      <abstract>
        <p>Relapsing <italic>C. difficile</italic> disease in humans is linked to a pathological imbalance within the intestinal microbiota, termed dysbiosis, which remains poorly understood. We show that mice infected with epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> (genotype 027/BI) develop highly contagious, chronic intestinal disease and persistent dysbiosis characterized by a distinct, simplified microbiota containing opportunistic pathogens and altered metabolite production. Chronic <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI infection was refractory to vancomycin treatment leading to relapsing disease. In contrast, treatment of <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI infected mice with feces from healthy mice rapidly restored a diverse, healthy microbiota and resolved <italic>C. difficile</italic> disease and contagiousness. We used this model to identify a simple mixture of six phylogenetically diverse intestinal bacteria, including novel species, which can re-establish a health-associated microbiota and clear <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI infection from mice. Thus, targeting a dysbiotic microbiota with a defined mixture of phylogenetically diverse bacteria can trigger major shifts in the microbial community structure that displaces <italic>C. difficile</italic> and, as a result, resolves disease and contagiousness. Further, we demonstrate a rational approach to harness the therapeutic potential of health-associated microbial communities to treat <italic>C. difficile</italic> disease and potentially other forms of intestinal dysbiosis.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Pathological imbalances within the intestinal microbiota, termed dysbiosis, are often associated with chronic <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infections in humans. We show that infection of mice with the healthcare pathogen <italic>C. difficile</italic> leads to persistent intestinal dysbiosis that is associated with chronic disease and a highly contagious state. Using this model we rationally designed a simple mixture of phylogenetically diverse intestinal bacteria that can disrupt intestinal dysbiosis and as a result resolve disease and contagiousness. Our results validate the microbiota as a viable therapeutic target and open the way to rationally design bacteriotherapy to treat chronic <italic>C. difficile</italic> infections and potentially other forms of persistent dysbiosis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> is an anaerobic, Gram-positive bacterium that is the major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and a significant healthcare-associated pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Gerding1">[1]</xref>. <italic>C. difficile</italic> challenges hospital infection control measures by exploiting an infection cycle involving the excretion of highly transmissible and resistant spores that act as an environmental transmission reservoir <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Best1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Walker1">[4]</xref>. Antibiotic treatment of hospitalized patients is the major risk factor for <italic>C. difficile</italic> colonization and disease that are characterized by a toxin-mediated neutrophil response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Pothoulakis1">[5]</xref> and a spectrum of outcomes from asymptomatic carriage, severe diarrhea, fulminant pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon and occasionally death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Gerding2">[6]</xref>. First line treatments for <italic>C. difficile</italic> disease are vancomycin or metronidazole, although in 20–35% of these cases a recurrent disease (relapse or re-infection) follows cessation of antibiotic therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Kuipers1">[7]</xref>. More recently, a narrow-spectrum antibiotic, Fidaxomicin, has been shown to cause less damage to the microbiota and lower rates of recurrence compared to vancomycin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Louie1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Tannock1">[9]</xref>. This has led to the proposal that <italic>C. difficile</italic> disease is linked to a general imbalance of the intestinal microbiota, often referred to as dysbiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Chang1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Robinson1">[11]</xref>. Alternatively, probiotic-based approaches that restore intestinal homeostasis are viewed as promising therapies for recurrent <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Borody1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-McFarland1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>During the past decade distinct genetic variants of <italic>C. difficile</italic> have emerged that are responsible for epidemics within North America and Europe and continue to disseminate globally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Brazier1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Clements1">[15]</xref>. Most notable is the “epidemic” variant, genotypically referred to as PCR-ribotype 027 or REA group BI, which is associated with high-level toxin production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Warny1">[16]</xref>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002995.s001">Figure S1</xref>), high rates of recurrence and mortality, and severe hospital outbreaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Loo1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Petrella1">[19]</xref>. We have recently used whole genome sequencing to demonstrate that isolates within the epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI clade are genetically distinct from other human virulent <italic>C. difficile</italic>, such as the 017/CF and 012/R variants that are endemic in many hospitals throughout Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Bauer1">[20]</xref>, and have likely emerged and spread globally within the past decade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-He1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Sebaihia1">[23]</xref>. Although the epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI variant is now the most common type causing disease in many parts of the world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Cheknis1">[24]</xref> it is not known how this particular variant transmits so effectively and outcompetes other <italic>C. difficile</italic> disease-causing variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-OConnor1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The recent description of <italic>C. difficile</italic> murine infection models that mimic many aspects of asymptomatic carriage, disease and spore-mediated transmission in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Chen1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Lawley1">[27]</xref> has facilitated experimental investigations into the molecular basis of <italic>C. difficile</italic> disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Schwan1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Steele1">[31]</xref> and transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Deakin1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Lawley3">[34]</xref>. Here we use a murine infection model to demonstrate that animals infected via natural transmission with epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI, but not other human virulent <italic>C. difficile</italic> variants, develop chronic infection and a highly contagious state that persists for months. Persistent infection is linked to intestinal dysbiosis that can be resolved by restoring a diverse intestinal microbiota with bacteriotherapy using a defined, simplified mixture of intestinal bacteria.</p>

        <p>We infected groups of healthy C57BL/6 mice separately with <italic>C. difficile</italic> PCR ribotypes 012 (strain 630 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Sebaihia1">[23]</xref>), 017 (strain M68 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-He1">[21]</xref>) or 027 (strain BI-7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-He1">[21]</xref>) via spore-mediated transmission and subsequently treated the infected groups with a clinically relevant dose of clindamycin for 7 days. Each of these <italic>C. difficile</italic> variants was isolated from hospital patients with <italic>C. difficile</italic> disease and is resistant to high levels of clindamycin (MIC of &gt;256 mg/L).

Persistent supershedders of <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI-7 displayed significant signs of chronic intestinal disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g001">Figure 1b i–ii</xref>) and harbored microcolonies and biofilm-like structures containing <italic>C. difficile</italic> on the intestinal mucosal surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g001">Figure 1b iii–iv</xref>). The cecal tissue of mice infected with epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI-7 also exhibited a significant up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes, particularly those known to promote neutrophil infiltration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002995.s003">Figure S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002995.s009">Table S1</xref>), similar to the human immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Pothoulakis1">[5]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Thus, epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI-7 induces a persistent supershedder state, characterized by intestinal disease and a prolonged contagious period in mice, whereas infection with other disease causing variants results in a self-limiting infection leading to a non-contagious carrier state.</p>

        <title>Enhanced transmissibility of epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI</title>
        <p>We hypothesized that since persistent supershedders excrete epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> into the environment for a prolonged period compared to other <italic>C. difficile</italic> infected mice, this would increase the transmission of epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> in a population of susceptible hosts. To test this hypothesis we housed mice supershedding <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI-7, 017/M68 or 012/630 together with naïve mice for 30 days and then determined the proportion of mice infected with each <italic>C. difficile</italic> variant. After exposure to supershedders, all naïve mice became colonized by <italic>C. difficile</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g001">Figure 1c</xref>). Significantly, the majority of naïve recipient mice (12/14) were infected with the epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI-7 and a minority (2/14) were colonized by <italic>C. difficile</italic> 017/M68 whereas the donor mice remained infected with only the original infecting strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g001">Figure 1c</xref>). Therefore, the ability of epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI-7 to induce a persistent supershedder state within hosts provides this variant with a competitive advantage over other variants within a susceptible host population.</p>

        <title>Epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI induces intestinal dysbiosis</title>
        <p>Recurrent <italic>C. difficile</italic> disease in humans is associated with a general reduction in intestinal bacterial diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Chang1">[10]</xref>. We therefore hypothesized that the persistent supershedder state in mice caused by <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI-7 is linked to alterations in the structure of the co-inhabiting bacterial community. To address this hypothesis we analyzed the composition of the intestinal microbiota from mice using 16S rRNA gene sequence profiling of bacterial DNA isolated from fresh fecal pellets.</p>
        <p>First we assessed the global community structure from individual mice over time by determining the Shannon Diversity Index (SDI), which takes into account species richness (number of species) and evenness (distribution of species). As expected, the intestinal microbiota of naïve, untreated mice was characterized as a diverse bacterial community (∼60 phylotypes/250 clones/mouse), free of <italic>C. difficile</italic>, that was very stable over 50 days and dominated by anaerobic species from the <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> and <italic>Firmicutes</italic> phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). Seven days of clindamycin treatment significantly reduced the SDI of both naïve mice and <italic>C. difficile</italic> (027/BI or 017/CF) infected mice and caused an increase in the proportional abundance of facultative anaerobes such as members of the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> family and enterococci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). Clindamycin treatment reduced the diversity to 9–12 phylotypes/250 clones/mouse, regardless of <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection, and <italic>C. difficile</italic> clones represented 26.7% (±6.8) of the clone library from infected mice (n = 10)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002995.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Interestingly, the SDI and phylum-level compositional structure from naïve mice and <italic>C. difficile</italic> 017/M68 infected mice consistently recovered to pre-clindamycin levels and no <italic>C. difficile</italic> clones were detected from infected mice by 49 days post-clindamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). In contrast, infection with epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI-7 altered the recovery pattern of the intestinal microbiota and instead the species diversity remained very low (10–12 phylotypes/250 clones; n = 15 mice) and <italic>C. difficile</italic> represented 6.8% (±5.2) of the clone libraries at 49 days post-clindamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g002">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002995.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>

        <p>We were next interested in defining the supershedder microbiota at the phylotype-level (&gt;98% identity of 16S rRNA gene across variable regions 2–5) so we compared the bacterial communities from mice infected with <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI-7 or 017/M68 as well as the appropriate naïve and clindamycin treatment controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g002">Figure 2b</xref>). Interestingly, the intestinal microbiota from persistent supershedders associated with epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI-7 infection was consistently simplified in structure (SDI 2.0±0.3 (n = 15) vs. SDI 3.6±0.2 for healthy/naïve mice (n = 17); <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002995.s004">Figure S4</xref>) and, importantly, was distinct in composition from the microbiota of mice undergoing clindamycin treatment, mice that recovered from clindamycin treatment, naïve mice and low-level carriers of 027/BI-7 or 017/M68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g002">Figure 2b</xref>). The emergence of the supershedder microbiota was very robust since it occurred in mice of distinct genetic backgrounds, including C57BL/6, C3H/HeN, C3H/HeJ and in certain C57BL/6 gene knock out mice such as those harboring mutations in the p40 subunit of interleukin 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g002">Figure 2b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002995.s010">Table S2</xref>). We noted that the supershedder microbiota consistently contained 16S rRNA gene clones derived from <italic>Blautia producta</italic> and regularly included 16S rRNA gene sequences representative of recognized human opportunistic pathogens, including <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic>, <italic>Parabacteroides distasonis</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>. We subsequently confirmed the presence of each organism by direct culture and sequence analysis of their 16S rRNA genes (unpublished data). Interestingly, all of these bacterial species have also been identified within the microbiota of humans with <italic>C. difficile</italic> disease using culture dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Tvede1">[36]</xref> and culture independent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Chang1">[10]</xref> methods.</p>
        <p>Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are the end products of bacterial fermentation in the intestines and serve as important nutrients for the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Macfarlane1">[37]</xref>. Imbalances in SCFA levels, particularly butyrate and acetate, have been associated with chronic intestinal diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Wong1">[38]</xref>. To investigate the functional consequence of the simplified intestinal community of persistent supershedders we next profiled the SCFAs present within the large intestine of mice. Interestingly, the microbiota from supershedder mice produced less SFCAs (69.4 µmol/gram cecal contents) compared to that from naïve mice (140.8 µmol/gram) and naïve mice that were given clindamycin and then allowed to recover for 49 days (138.0 µmol/gram). Further, the supershedder microbiota was associated with an altered SCFA profile compared to naïve and clindamycin treated mice that was characterized by a substantial proportional reduction in butyrate and acetate and an increase in succinate levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g002">Figure 2c</xref>), correlating with an increase in the levels of <italic>P. distasonis</italic> (succinate producer) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Sakamoto1">[39]</xref>. Thus, we demonstrate that epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI-7 maintains intestinal dysbiosis in mice after clindamycin treatment that is characterized by a simplified intestinal bacterial community, the presence of opportunistic bacteria and markedly altered SCFA production.</p>

        <p>Next we attempted to clear <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI-7 from persisting supershedders with a 10-day treatment of oral vancomycin.

Relapse occurred even after mice were aseptically moved to individual sterile cages to reduce host-to-host transmission and re-colonization by environmental spores. Interestingly, the SDI of the intestinal microbiota from relapsed mice remained low (2.1–2.2) and the resident bacteria included opportunistic species (i.e. <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. producta</italic>)(data not shown).</p>

        <p>Suppression of <italic>C. difficile</italic> shedding levels was associated with a significant loss of contagiousness as demonstrated by the inability of treated mice to transmit <italic>C. difficile</italic> to other naïve mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g003">Figure 3b</xref>).

            <p><bold>a</bold>) Principal component analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences demonstrates that distinct microbiota profiles (circled) are associated with “healthy/naïve” mice, mice undergoing “clindamycin treatment” and “persisting supershedders” of <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI-7.

Treatment of supershedder mice with feces from healthy mice, the cultured fecal derivative or mixtures of defined, cultured bacteria are as indicated: brown - shading for healthy feces, blue - shading for fecal derivatives culture passaged once, green - shading for mixture of six suppressive bacteria (MixB) and grey - shading for <italic>Bacteroides/Lactobacillus</italic> mixture.

        <p>Consequently, we reasoned that there are key bacteria within the microbiota of healthy mice that are responsible for suppressing the <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI supershedder state. To identify candidate bacteria we passaged healthy feces overnight in nutrient broth at 37°C to reduce the community complexity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002995.s007">Figure S7</xref>) and to enrich for readily culturable bacteria. Treatment of supershedder mice with cultured fecal derivatives serially passaged twice (Passage 1 and 2) effectively suppressed the supershedder state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002995.s008">Figure S8</xref>) and shifted their microbiota composition towards a healthy microbiota profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g003">Figure 3a</xref>). However, a third passage (Passage 3) was dominated by <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp. and <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> spp. and generally resulted in a loss of the protective effects of the fecal derivative against the <italic>C. diffiicile</italic> 027/BI supershedder state. These results confirm the presence of specific culturable bacteria within the microbiota of healthy mice that can suppress <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI infection as effectively as whole fecal bacteriotherapy.</p>
        <p>Next, we cultured a diverse collection of 18 bacterial species from the Passage 1 fecal derivative, including representatives of the four phyla that constitute the majority of the mammalian intestinal microbiota (<italic>Firmicutes</italic>, <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> and <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002995.s011">Table S3</xref>). Since the supershedders' microbiota contained a skewed profile of dominant bacterial phyla (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002995.s010">Table S2</xref>), we reasoned that inoculation of supershedders with a phylogenetically diverse bacterial mixture could potentially trigger recovery of the intestinal ecosystem and disrupt the stability of the supershedder microbiota. Therefore, we treated supershedders with different combinations of phylogenetically diverse bacterial mixtures (mixtures summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002995.s011">Table S3</xref>). Many of the combinations failed (see below) but we ultimately identified a mixture of six bacteria that effectively and reproducibly (20/20 mice) suppressed the <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI supershedder state (“MixB”; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g004">Figure 4b</xref>). Significantly, treatment of supershedders with the MixB bacteria shifted the recipients' intestinal microbiota to the profile of a healthy profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g004">Figure 4a</xref>) and triggered an increase in bacterial diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g004">Figure 4c</xref>) that was associated with resolution of intestinal disease and contagiousness. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, and of cultured isolates, derived from treated mice confirmed the presence of five of the six MixB bacteria in the feces during days 6–14 post-treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002995.s010">Table S2</xref>). Much of the increased diversity, however, was derived from commensal bacteria that were present at low levels pre-treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002995.s010">Table S2</xref>), suggesting that the MixB bacteria had disrupted colonization by <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI and the other members of the supershedder microbiota by triggering an expansion of the suppressed health-associated bacteria and a re-distribution of the microbiota to a healthy composition.</p>
        <p>Significantly, and in contrast to the results with MixB, treatment of mice with further subdivisions of this bacterial mixture, including the MixB bacteria administered individually, or mixtures containing six or seven other cultured bacterial strains had a negligible impact on the supershedder state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g004">Figure 4b</xref>). To further illustrate the particular effectiveness of our MixB collection of strains, treatment of supershedders with a <italic>Bacteroides</italic>/<italic>Lactobacillus</italic> mixture, representative of more traditional probiotic bacterial groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Mazmanian1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Schreiber1">[44]</xref>, failed to resolve the supershedder state and restore the recipients' microbiota to a healthy profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g004">Figure 4a</xref> and Figure S9). Thus, we rationally defined a novel, simple mixture consisting of six phylogenetically diverse intestinal bacterial strains that can resolve <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI infection in mice.</p>

        <title>Dominant supershedder and bacteriotherapy bacteria are phylogenetically distinct</title>
        <p>Next we wanted to fully define the identity of the six bacterial strains present in MixB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002995.s011">Table S3</xref>) and to discern their relationship to the dominant members of the supershedder microbiota. To do so we sequenced the genomes of the six MixB bacteria (and their closest equivalent human-derived species) and performed a phylogenetic comparison to the dominant members of the supershedder microbiota and reference intestinal bacterial genomes representative of the mammalian microbiota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002995.s012">Table S4</xref>). Based on this analysis we determined that MixB includes three previously described species, <italic>Staphylococcus warneri</italic>, <italic>Enterococcus hirae</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic>, and three novel species, <italic>Anaerostipes</italic> sp. nov., <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> sp. nov. and <italic>Enterorhabdus</italic> sp. nov. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002995.s011">Table S3</xref>). This mix of bacteria is therefore phylogenetically diverse, including both obligate and facultative anaerobic species, and represents three of the four predominant intestinal microbiota phyla. Importantly, these species appear to be common inhabitants of the mouse intestine in health and they are phylogenetically distinct from the dominant members of the supershedder microbiota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Given the demonstrated ineffectiveness of autoclaved feces, fecal filtrates, SFCAs and individual bacterial strains it therefore appears that displacement of <italic>C. difficile</italic> and the supershedder microbiota may require competition from a phylogenetically diverse and physiologically distinct collection of living bacteria.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We demonstrate that epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI effectively maintains intestinal dysbiosis after clindamycin treatment, altering the intestinal ecosystem to outcompete health-associated intestinal bacteria. In contrast, neither <italic>C. difficile</italic> 017/CF nor 012/R induced persistent dysbiosis, presumably because they are less virulent in mice. There are large differences between the genomes of the <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027, 012 and 017 lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-He1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Sebaihia1">[23]</xref> that could account for such differences, including the presence of a binary toxin in the 027/BI lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Schwan1">[28]</xref>, that warrant further investigation. As a result, epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027 is shed into the environment for a greater period compared to other human virulent variants, increasing its likelihood of infecting a susceptible host. This model explains how epidemic variants, like the <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI-7 clade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-He1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Stabler1">[22]</xref>, can quickly become the dominant variant within a host population. Below we propose a model to explain the establishment of persistent dysbiosis by epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI and the successful resolution of <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection by bacteriotherapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

          <p>Intestinal homeostasis (a) is characterized by lack of pathology and a diverse, stable microbiota that produces SCFA via fermentation. Antibiotic perturbation (b–c) kills susceptible bacteria resulting in a simplified community structure (and reduced SCFA production) and a loss of colonization resistance. In the absence of opportunistic infection, the microbiota generally rebounds in diversity and SCFA production (d) to re-establish homeostasis and colonization resistance (a). However, exposure to <italic>C. difficile</italic> (e) after antibiotic perturbation (b) can lead to persistent dysbiosis (f) that is characterized by a pathogenic microbial community, reduced SCFA and pathology. Bacteriotherapy disrupts dysbiosis (g) leading to the clearance of <italic>C. difficile</italic> (h) and re-establishment of intestinal homeostasis (a).</p>

We show that in the absence of <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection clindamycin treatment initially reduces the complexity of the murine microbiota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g006">Figure 6 b and c</xref>) before the diversity recovers to a level comparable to the original community by 2–3 weeks post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g006">Figure 6 d and a</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Lawley1">[27]</xref>.

However, there is variability in diversity recovery time and this is likely due to differences in the initial microbiota composition, the host's genetics/immune system status, the spectrum and dose of the antibiotic used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Sekirov1">[51]</xref> and the presence of bacteria in local environment that can potentially re-colonize the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Antonopoulos1">[48]</xref>.</p>
      <p>After antibiotic treatment there is a transient period where colonization resistance is reduced and the host is very susceptible to infection by such pathogens as <italic>C. difficile</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Buffie1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Hensgens1">[52]</xref> or <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Croswell1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Sekirov1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Lawley4">[53]</xref>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g006">Figure 6e</xref>). The antibiotic-induced susceptible period allows environmental <italic>C. difficile</italic> spores to colonize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Deakin1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Lawley3">[34]</xref> or intestinal <italic>C. difficile</italic> to expand from a low-level carrier state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Lawley1">[27]</xref>. We show that after colonization by environmental spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g006">Figure 6 e</xref>) epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> induces a strong neutrophil response compared to other human virulent variants of <italic>C. difficile</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g006">Figure 6f</xref>), possibly due to strain differences in toxin production/activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Warny1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Lanis1">[54]</xref> or other genetic differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-He1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Stabler1">[22]</xref>. The ability of epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic> 027/BI to induce an inflammatory response promoted the emergence of a distinct microbiota that contained low diversity and recognized human opportunistic pathogens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g006">Figure 6f</xref>). The dysbiotic microbiota also produced less SCFAs in tandem with a marked proportional reduction in butyrate and acetate. Butyrate is the major energy source for enterocytes and thereby indirectly supports host response mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Wong1">[38]</xref>. Thus, by limiting the energy resources available to the mucosal epithelium it is possible that the supershedder microbiota may be promoting it's own stability.</p>
      <p>Restoration of a healthy microbiota with fecal transplantation is viewed as a promising alternative treatment for recurrent <italic>C. difficile</italic> disease and other forms of intestinal dysbiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Borody1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Bakken2">[55]</xref>, but it is not widely used because of the time required to identify a suitable donor, the risk of introducing opportunistic pathogens as well as a general patient aversion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Borody2">[56]</xref>. Thus, the development of a murine model that recapitulates many features of fecal transplantation in humans with recurrent <italic>C. difficile</italic> disease provides a valuable surrogate to understand the basic mechanisms of successful fecal transplantation and also as a basis to develop standardized treatment mixtures (i.e. bacteriotherapy). Using our model we rationally identified a simple mixture of six phylogenetically diverse bacteria that can trigger the expansion of health-associated commensals that appear to be suppressed during persistent dysbiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g006">Figure 6 g</xref>) and the subsequent displacement of epidemic <italic>C. difficile</italic>, and the supershedder microbiota, to resolve intestinal disease and contagiousness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1002995-g006">Figure 6 h and d</xref>). Tvede and Rask-Madsen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Tvede1">[36]</xref> previously demonstrated that a mixture of ten different facultatively aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was able to resolve <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection in a small number of human patients. However, this initial success does not appear to have been maintained and, at present, defined bacteriotherapy mixtures with proven efficacy are sorely lacking.</p>
      <p>Our results highlight the malleability and therapeutic potential of health-associated microbial communities and suggest that the administration of a phylogenetically diverse mixture of bacteria is a critical early trigger for the recovery of the suppressed microbiota. Indeed, isolates within “MixB” failed to trigger a response when administered individually, suggesting that diversity is important. Species composition appears to be equally significant since other defined mixtures of strains failed to resolve disease. Crucially however, by identifying the persistent supershedder microbiota, we were able to guide our strain selection by avoiding the use of species that appear to be associated with <italic>C. difficile</italic> during supershedding infection. Following these principles we believe that it is likely that many distinct combinations of bacterial strains will have the potential to treat recalcitrant or recurring <italic>C. difficile</italic> infection. These observations open the way to rationally harness the therapeutic potential of health-associated microbial communities to treat recurrent <italic>C. difficile</italic> disease and transmission in humans, and potentially other forms of disease-associated dysbiosis.</p>

The 16S rRNA genes were then cloned into <italic>E. coli</italic> using pGEM-T Easy Vectors (Promega UK, Southampton, UK) and 284 clones per sample were picked for sequencing (covering regions V2–V5) using an ABI 3730. Sequences were aligned using the RDP aligner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Cole1">[60]</xref> and these alignments were manually curated in the ARB package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Ludwig1">[61]</xref> before further analysis. Otherwise, sequences were checked and classified as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Walker2">[62]</xref>. In total 19,991 sequences were generated and these were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers JF241944–JF260864 and HE605382–HE608150).</p>
        <p>The species diversity in each sample was measured by calculating the Shannon Diversity Index, which takes into account both species richness and relative proportional abundance (evenness), using the mothur software package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Schloss1">[63]</xref>. Rarefaction curves and Chao1 estimates of total bacterial diversity were also calculated in mothur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Schloss1">[63]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Cluster dendrograms and PCA plots were based on a master alignment, which was built using the RDP aligner and subjected to manual curation. Using this alignment a distance matrix, with Felsenstein correction, was created using ARB. The distance matrix was then used as an input for DOTUR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Schloss2">[64]</xref> using a 98% identity cut-off under the default furthest-neighbor setting. Sequences with &gt;98% phylogenetic similarity were regarded as belonging to the same OTU. These OTUs were then used to calculate cluster dendrograms, using the Bray Curtis calculator, in the mothur package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Schloss1">[63]</xref>. 336 OTUs (12,308 clones) contributed to this analysis. Cluster dendrograms, with added bar charts showing the microbial composition of each sample and Shannon Diversity Indices, were visualized using the iTOL web package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Letunic1">[65]</xref>. For the PCA plot OTUs were generated as above but with a 97% identity cut-off. PCA decomposition was performed on the (symmetric) matrix of pairwise sample similarity, where the similarity metric was based on the sum of absolute differences in OTU frequency. 344 OTUs (16,154 clones) contributed to the analysis, which was insensitive to the removal of low frequency OTUs.</p>
        <p>To determine the SCFA profile, the cecal contents from 5 mice per group were pooled and then resuspended in sterile PBS at a concentration of 500 mg/ml, homogenized and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Supernatant was collected, acidified and following conversion to <italic>t</italic>-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives were analyzed by gas chromatography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Richardson1">[66]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of intestinal bacteria</title>
        <p>We sequenced the genomes (and their closest equivalent human-derived species) using the MiSeq platform, and performed <italic>de novo</italic> assembly using Velvet {<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Zerbino1">[67]</xref> and gene prediction using GLIMMER3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Delcher1">[68]</xref>. We then identified the genes that were ubiquitous between the 6 MixB species, and reference intestinal bacterial genomes sourced from the MetaHIT project, the HGMI project, and the Human Microbiome Project (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002995.s013">Table S5</xref>). 44 Common genes were identified using TBLASTN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Gertz1">[69]</xref> searches against the complete dataset of the reference and assembled genomes for 80 bacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1002995.s013">Table S5</xref>). Although the “true” core genome amongst these samples may be higher – we were limited by the fact that in several cases only draft assemblies were available, and so some genes which may have been expected to be present in the “core” group, were in fact not present, due to their absence in one or more of the draft genome sequences used. A gene was classified as being ‘present’ if it had a minimum percent amino acid identity across the entire gene of 30% compared to the reference. The reference genes used for querying were taken from the strain of <italic>Staphylococcus warneri</italic> derived from MixB. The common genes so identified were manually checked, translated, extracted, and concatenated together. We then used FastTree 2.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1002995-Price1">[70]</xref>, with its default settings (BLOSUM45 and the Jones-Taylor-Thorton CAT model, with 20 rate categories), to generate a maximum likelihood phylogeny from the concatenated protein sequence, in order to place the bacteria into their correct context and to distinguish species.</p>
