      <abstract>
        <p>The mite <italic>Varroa destructor</italic> is an obligatory ectoparasite of the honey bee (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) and is one of the major threats to apiculture worldwide. We previously reported that honey bees fed on double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with a sequence homologous to that of the Israeli acute paralysis virus are protected from the viral disease. Here we show that dsRNA ingested by bees is transferred to the <italic>Varroa</italic> mite and from mite on to a parasitized bee. This cross-species, reciprocal exchange of dsRNA between bee and <italic>Varroa</italic> engendered targeted gene silencing in the latter, and resulted in an over 60% decrease in the mite population. Thus, transfer of gene-silencing-triggering molecules between this invertebrate host and its ectoparasite could lead to a conceptually novel approach to <italic>Varroa</italic> control.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Acquisition of RNAi components (dsRNA, siRNA) by ingestion and their spread within the recipient organism has been previously reported by us and others. Here we extend such observations, demonstrating cross-species horizontal transmission of dsRNA which, upon transmission from one organism to another still retains its biological activity. We show that dsRNA ingested by honey bees is further transmitted to the parasitic mite <italic>Varroa destructor</italic> that feeds on the honey bee's hemolymph. Reciprocally, dsRNA-carrying <italic>Varroa</italic> transmits the dsRNA back to bees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that bees ingesting dsRNA of <italic>Varroa</italic> gene sequences become vectors of dsRNAs, transmitting the signals to the <italic>Varroa</italic>, thus engendering silencing of mite genes and resulting in a significant phenotype, <italic>Varroa</italic> mortality. The exchange of active silencing signals between the honey bee and the mite suggests a potential RNA-based interaction between invertebrate hosts and parasites. Furthermore, our results offer a potentially conceptually new control measure for the mite <italic>Varroa destructo</italic>r, which is one of the greatest threats to apiculture.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The European honey bee, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>, plays a key role in pollination. One third of the world's food crops as well as many wild plants depend on honey bees for pollination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Gallai1">[1]</xref>. In recent years, honey bee colonies suffer from severe losses worldwide. Pests and pathogens are mainly involved in the decrease of honey bees vitality and colony losses including: mites, viruses, fungi, bacteria, and other insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Genersch1">[2]</xref>. However, the mite <italic>Varroa destructo</italic>r is considered one of the greatest threats to apiculture, not only because of its direct deleterious effect, but also by being a vector of several important bee viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Rosenkranz1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Gisder1">[8]</xref>. <italic>Varroa destructor</italic> is an obligatory parasite that feeds on the hemolymph of developing and mature honey bees. <italic>Varroa</italic> mites invade cells of bee larvae just before they are sealed, feed on the hemolymph of the developing bee and proliferate there. When the adult bee emerges, the attached female mites emerge with it. They may then transfer to another bee or another bee larval cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Rosenkranz1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Shimanuki1">[9]</xref>. Without proper treatment, honeybee colonies infested with <italic>Varroa destructor</italic> typically collapse within 2 to 3 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Rosenkranz1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Boecking1">[10]</xref>. Beekeepers use chemicals such as the organophosphate coumaphos, tau-fluvalinate and the formamidine amitraz to control <italic>Varroa</italic>, but the mites evolve resistance to such chemicals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Pettis1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Maggi1">[14]</xref>. Therefore, alternative measures for <italic>Varroa</italic> control are sought, such as breeding bees for tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Rosenkranz1">[3]</xref>. Here we report that <italic>Varroa</italic> gene expression can be modulated by RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by the bees, which may lead to a potential new conceptual approach to <italic>Varroa</italic> control.</p>
      <p>RNAi is an RNA-mediated sequence specific gene-silencing mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Fire1">[15]</xref>. RNAi has been demonstrated to moderate gene expression in a wide variety of organisms including plants, mammals, insects and ticks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Hannon1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-delaFuente1">[17]</xref>. The silencing pathway is initiated by the presence of endogenous or exogenous double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that is then cleaved by RNase III-like enzymes resulting in small (21–26 bp) interfering RNAs (siRNA). SiRNAs guide protein complexes to RNAs carrying homologous sequences and target the RNA for degradation, or RNA-directed DNA methylation or chromatin remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Hannon1">[16]</xref>. Recently, transfer of RNAi from plants to insects and nematodes has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Baum1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Steeves1">[21]</xref> as well as vertical transgenerational transfer of silencing signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Rechavi1">[22]</xref>. RNAi affecting a germline has also been reported very recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Buckley1">[23]</xref>. DsRNA-mediated gene knockdown has also been demonstrated in <italic>Varroa</italic> by soaking the mite with dsRNA-containing solution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Campbell1">[24]</xref>. In honey bees, ingestion of dsRNA has been successfully used to investigate gene function as well as for direct application against viral infection and the endoparasite <italic>Nosema ceranae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Aronstein1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Paldi1">[31]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our previous indications of the effectiveness of ingested dsRNA-mediated silencing in bees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Hunter1">[32]</xref> suggested that dsRNA is spread systemically in treated bees. We therefore hypothesized that ingested and systemically spread dsRNA might be horizontally transferred from treated bee to <italic>Varroa</italic>, in which case the bees could serve as RNAi vectors. Here we demonstrate reciprocal horizontal transfer of dsRNA ingested by honey bees to <italic>Varroa</italic> mites and then on to <italic>Varroa</italic>-parasitized bees. A significant phenotype, a measure of <italic>Varroa</italic> control, was achieved by RNAi that was vectored through bees to silence <italic>Varroa</italic>-specific genes.</p>

        <title>Direct and indirect horizontal transfer of dsRNA between bees and <italic>Varroa</italic> mites</title>
        <p>To determine whether dsRNA is transferred from honey bees to <italic>Varroa</italic>, initial studies were carried out with biologically irrelevant dsRNA marker carrying a segment of the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP). The use of dsRNA-GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003035.s003">Table S1</xref>) potentially reduced endogenous sequence “noise” and minimized possible silencing of bee or <italic>Varroa</italic> gene expression (the list of dsRNA sequences used throughout this study is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003035-t001">Table 1</xref> and the actual sequences are depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003035.s003">Table S1</xref>). Since <italic>Varroa</italic> mites suck substantial amounts of hemolymph from both adult and developing bees in sealed brood cells, we tested whether dsRNA is horizontally transferred in both cases. Adult bees were fed a sucrose solution containing dsRNA, resulting in direct transfer of dsRNA from adult bees to phoretic mites feeding on their hemolymph. Adult nurse bees produce jelly that they feed to developing larvae in brood cells, prior to sealing the cells: here, the transfer of dsRNA from a developing bee in a sealed cell to mites feeding on their hemolymph is indirect.</p>

        <p>Mites can absorb dsRNAs and siRNAs by physical contact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Campbell1">[24]</xref>. To determine any biological function, it was necessary to establish that RNAi triggers were delivered by food ingestion and not by accidental contamination, and that the acquired dsRNA was present in the bee hemolymph (the food source of <italic>Varroa</italic>). To this end we strapped individual bees to a hollow plastic tube, and fed them directly to their proboscis with dsRNA-GFP. This prevented potential contamination of other bee parts by self or mutual grooming with other bees. On the following day, we released each bee to a separate plastic box, and added two female <italic>Varroa</italic> mites to each of the above boxes. The <italic>Varroa</italic> were collected from a remote hive that had not been exposed to dsRNA.

        <title>Silencing of <italic>Varroa</italic> gene expression mediated by bees ingesting dsRNA</title>
        <p>Once we had established horizontal transfer of physiologically inert dsRNA between bees and <italic>Varroa</italic>, we explored the possibility that RNAi that originated in the bee might affect gene expression in the mite.</p>
        <p>When this study was initiated, the <italic>Varroa</italic> genome had not been elucidated (recently, partial <italic>Varroa</italic> genome information has been released <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Cornman1">[33]</xref>). Therefore, we designed a number of genes whose silencing was expected to harm the <italic>Varroa</italic> mite. We chose fundamental housekeeping genes involved in cytoskeleton assembly, energy transfer and transcription. In addition, we chose genes involved in apoptosis inhibition (assuming that their silencing would enhance apoptosis). We aligned several published mite and insect gene sequences and determined conserved regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003035.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We designed probes to the conserved regions, screened a <italic>Varroa</italic> cDNA library and isolated the respective <italic>Varroa</italic> genes. The <italic>Varroa</italic> dsRNA sequences selected for <italic>Varroa</italic> gene silencing are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003035.s003">Table S1</xref>. To prevent off-target human or bee gene silencing, these sequences did not correspond to any <italic>A. mellifera</italic> or human genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003035.s004">Table S2</xref>). In some cases, sequences from the same gene family were selected. The dsRNAs of the selected sequences were prepared as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Maori1">[29]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To determine whether <italic>Varroa</italic> gene silencing can be mediated via bees that have ingested dsRNA, we placed ca. 250 worker bees and a laying queen in mini-hives. We prepared two mixtures of the <italic>Varroa</italic> dsRNA: Mixture I contained sequences derived from five <italic>Varroa</italic> gene sequences (sequences 1, 4, 8, 12, and 14 described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003035-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003035.s003">S1</xref>) and Mixture II contained all 14 <italic>Varroa</italic> gene sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003035-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003035.s003">S1</xref>). Mini-hives fed with Mixture I or II each served as a treatment group. In addition, mini-hives fed with dsRNA-GFP or only sucrose solution served as two control groups. After 1 week of feeding, we introduced <italic>Varroa</italic> mites every day for a week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003035-g004">Figure 4</xref>). At the end of the 60-day experiment, we sampled <italic>Varroa</italic> mites from all four treatment groups and determined transcript levels of four selected <italic>Varroa</italic> genes by real-time RT-PCR (sequence 4, homologous to RNA polymerase III; sequence 9, homologous to vacuolar proton ATPase; and sequence 14, homologous to apoptosis inhibitor iap1 and 2) or semi-quantitative RT-PCR (sequence 12, homologous to apoptosis inhibitor FAS). The results confirmed that the dsRNA fed to the bees indeed engendered gene silencing in the parasitic <italic>Varroa</italic> mites, inhibiting expression levels of the tested genes by approximately 35 to 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003035-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The transcript levels of the three genes that we analyzed by real-time RT-PCR from Mixture II (genes 4, 14, and 9) were significantly lower relative to the untreated and the dsGFP controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003035-g005">Figure 5, A–C</xref>, respectively). The reduction in transcript levels of genes 4 and 14 did not differ significantly between Mixtures I and II. However, in Mixture I there was a trend for higher transcript levels, especially of the latter gene. Mixture I did not contain sequence 9, and consistently transcript level of this gene was not affected by Mixture I relative to the untreated and the dsGFP controls. Both mixtures contained the sequence for <italic>Varroa</italic> gene 12, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed greatly reduced expression of this gene by both mixtures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003035-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) relative to untreated bees and to bees treated with dsRNA-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003035-g005">Figure 5E</xref>), and to expression of actin as a standardizing internal control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003035-g005">Figure 5F</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Gene silencing following ingestion of dsRNA by honey bees has been previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Aronstein1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Hunter1">[32]</xref>. Here, we show that the ingested dsRNA can be delivered across species to a bee-hemolymph-dependent parasite. This RNAi transfer may cause silencing of <italic>Varroa</italic> gene expression and reduce mite populations in hives. Quantitative and semi-quantitative RT-PCR indicated that the dsRNAs affected the targeted <italic>Varroa</italic> genes. From an RNA biology point of view, the possibility that closely-associated organisms may interact via RNAi pathways should be further explored.</p>
      <p>The <italic>Varroa</italic> mite has been demonstrated to be a vector for bee viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Genersch1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Shen1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Gisder1">[8]</xref>. Similarly, we show that the mite can also vector RNAi-triggers, which were acquired from hemolymph of bees that had consumed dsRNA. Additionally, we demonstrated that bees vector biologically active dsRNA to the <italic>Varroa</italic> mite. The occurrence of such reciprocal interactions raises the hypothesis that bees may be potential vectors for <italic>Varroa</italic>-affecting viruses.</p>
      <p>Although the main emphasis of this study is the cross-species transfer and effect of RNAi, it also reflects on a promising concept of <italic>Varroa</italic> control. With <italic>Varroa</italic> mites evolving resistance to the chemicals used for their control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Pettis1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Maggi1">[14]</xref>, our study provides a novel potential approach for relieving the most serious economic burden on apiculture. Consistent with our findings of the stability of dsRNA in the honey bee colony, it is stable enough to be efficient when administered to the colony in sugar solution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Maori1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Hunter1">[32]</xref>, yet it eventually degrades in an environment favorable to bacterial growth. <italic>Varroa</italic> mainly devastate colonies when <italic>Varroa</italic> population grows unchecked. Effective control measures do not necessarily need to completely eradicate the <italic>Varroa</italic> population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Fagan1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Akyol1">[35]</xref>. Further studies would need to monitor the effect of dsRNA treatment on <italic>Varroa</italic> population dynamics and long-term effect on honey bee colonies under field conditions. Furthermore, the dsRNA formula may be optimized by finding more vital target genes that will lead to a greater reduction of the mite population in hives with less amount of dsRNA fed to infested hive.</p>
      <p>We prepared two dsRNA formulations: Mixture I targeted 5 <italic>Varroa</italic> gene sequences and Mixture II targeted 14 <italic>Varroa</italic> gene sequences. Mixture II tended to reduce <italic>Varroa</italic> populations more effectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003035-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

      <p>We selected dsRNA sequences that are not homologous to honey bee (or human) sequences.

Notably, we did not notice the off-target effects reported by Jarosch and Moritz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Jarosch1">[36]</xref>. Although <italic>Varroa</italic> infestation was greater in control vs. treatment mini-hives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003035-g007">Figure 7</xref>), this did not affect the strength of the hives at the end of our experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003035-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This is not surprising, since <italic>Varroa</italic> were present in our hives for only about 7 weeks. <italic>Varroa</italic> damage is cumulative and is minimal in newly infested hives (hives collapse after 2–3 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Rosenkranz1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Boecking1">[10]</xref>).</p>

        <title>Regimen of dsRNA-GFP feeding</title>
        <p>To test for direct transfer of dsRNA-GFP from adult bee to mite, 1-day-old bees that emerged in an incubator were placed in four plastic containers (30 bees per container). Two containers were fed with 30 µg dsRNA-GFP in 200 µl of 50% sucrose solution for 8 days, and the other two containers were controls, fed only 50% sucrose solution. Adult female <italic>Varroa</italic> (n = 30) were introduced into each container on day 5. After 3 days, <italic>Varroa</italic> that were attached to bees were removed and collected and their RNA was isolated for dsRNA-GFP analysis. A possible caveat of this experiment was that dsRNA-GFP would be transferred to <italic>Varroa</italic> through direct contamination with dsRNA-GFP in the containers, or from contact with contaminated bee body parts.</p>
        <p>We therefore performed an additional experiment to test for dsRNA transfer to <italic>Varroa</italic> mites via the bee hemolymph. In the morning of the experiment, 150 bees were collected from the area of combs containing open larvae; these tend to be nurse bees. Each bee was strapped into a hollow plastic tube in a manner that ensured their ability to extend their proboscis, and minimized injuries of the bees upon release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003035-Shafir1">[38]</xref>. The bees were divided into two groups: Individuals in the first group were fed with 2.5 µg dsRNA-GFP in a 5 µl 50% sucrose solution. Bees in the second group served as the control group, and were fed with 5 µl 50% sucrose solution only. In order to avoid contamination of dsRNA-GFP on the bee body, the sucrose solution was given directly to the proboscis. In addition, in order to prevent starvation of the bees overnight, both groups (treated and control) were fed 5 µl 50% sucrose solution in the evening. The following day, each bee was released gently from the hollow plastic tube, placed in a clean cage and supplied with candy (67% sugar powder and 33% honey). Two female adult <italic>Varroa</italic> mites were added to each of the above bees. <italic>Varroa</italic> were collected from a mite-infested hive that has never been exposed to dsRNA. On the third day, each bee was anaesthetized on ice, and 1–10 µl of hemolymph was collected. The collection of hemolymph was performed by pricking a hole in the inter-segmental membrane between the 2nd and 3rd abdominal segment, and inserting a capillary tube. Prior to hemolymph collection, <italic>Varroa</italic> mites, which were attached to the bee's body, were collected. All samples (<italic>Varroa</italic> mites, hemolymph and bees) were placed directly on ice, and then stored at −80°C for molecular analysis.</p>
        <p>To test for bidirectional transfer of dsRNA-GFP from bee to mite and on to another bee, some of the <italic>Varroa</italic> that had been detached from bees were transferred to containers with newly emerged, untreated bees for 4 days and their RNA was isolated for dsRNA-GFP analysis. Every day, bees in all containers were given an additional 1 ml sucrose solution after finishing their treatment. In addition, bees had free access to a pollen patty consisting of 70% pollen mixed with sugar powder.</p>
        <p>To test for indirect transfer of dsRNA-GFP from adult bee to bee larva and on to mite feeding on the hemolymph of the developing bee in a sealed cell, a cup of bees (ca. 250) and a laying queen were introduced into each mini-hive (two replicates in each of two enclosures). DsRNA-GFP (200 µg per hive) was provided daily in 5 ml 50% sucrose solution for 8 days. Thirty <italic>Varroa</italic> mites were introduced to the hives on the fifth day. Adult female <italic>Varroa</italic> were collected from sealed cells from day 11 till day 30 and their RNA was isolated for dsRNA-GFP analysis.</p>

        <title>DsRNA-GFP stability in 50% sucrose solution</title>
        <p>To test the dsRNA stability in the hive, we placed 10 bees in a cage, and exposed them to 10 ml of 50% sucrose solution that contained 200 µg dsRNA-GFP. Hence, dsRNA-GFP final concentration was 20 ng/µl, identical to the dsRNA-GFP concentration that was used in the other experiments. The cage was placed in a vacant second floor of a hive, separated by a screen from the populated bottom floor. Thus the caged bees were exposed to the hive's environment. Samples from the sugar solution were taken on days 1, 2, 3 and 6, and placed on ice. The caged bees died on day 2, possibly due to a heat wave. Sucrose concentration in the samples was determined with a refractometer, and if needed, equilibration with water was done. Samples were then stored at −80°C until analysis. Samples were analyzed on 1.2% agarose gel, loaded with 5 µl from each sample (100 ng of dsRNA-GFP at time zero).</p>

        <p>The experiment with <italic>Varroa</italic> dsRNA was conducted in mini-hives, 12 mini-hives per replicate, and was repeated three times. In each replicate, a cup of bees and a laying queen were placed in each mini-hive. Three mini-hives were randomly assigned to one of four netted enclosures, each representing a different feeding treatment. Bees were fed 5 ml of 50% sucrose solution in troughs placed in each mini-hive. The four treatments were: 1) sucrose solution only (untreated control), 2) Mixture I (200 µg each of five dsRNAs added to the sugar solution), 3) Mixture II (200 µg each of 14 dsRNAs added to the sugar solution), and 4) dsRNA-GFP (200 µg dsRNA) serving as an inert dsRNA control. Mini-hives that fully consumed the treatment solutions were supplemented with candy (67% sugar powder and 33% honey). In addition, the bees were routinely fed pollen patties (70% pollen and 30% sugar powder). Each replicate of the experiment lasted for 60 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003035-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Bees in each treatment were fed the respective solution daily for the first 10 days and for the last 14 days, and twice a week in the interim. <italic>Varroa</italic> mites were introduced into each mini-hive from day 7 till day 14. In the first replicate, 30 mites were introduced into each mini-hive; in the latter two replicates, 100 mites were introduced into each mini-hive.
