      <abstract>
        <p>Cerebral malaria (CM) is the most severe manifestation of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infection in children and non-immune adults. Previous work has documented a persistent cognitive impairment in children who survive an episode of CM that is mimicked in animal models of the disease. Potential therapeutic interventions for this complication have not been investigated, and are urgently needed. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely prescribed for cardiovascular diseases. In addition to their effects on the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, statins have pleiotropic immunomodulatory activities. Here we tested if statins would prevent cognitive impairment in a murine model of cerebral malaria. Six days after infection with <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> ANKA (PbA) mice displayed clear signs of CM and were treated with chloroquine, or chloroquine and lovastatin. Intravital examination of pial vessels of infected animals demonstrated a decrease in functional capillary density and an increase in rolling and adhesion of leukocytes to inflamed endothelium that were reversed by treatment with lovastatin. In addition, oedema, ICAM-1, and CD11b mRNA levels were reduced in lovastatin-treated PbA-infected mice brains. Moreover, HMOX-1 mRNA levels are enhanced in lovastatin-treated healthy and infected brains. Oxidative stress and key inflammatory chemokines and cytokines were reduced to non-infected control levels in animals treated with lovastatin. Fifteen days post-infection cognitive dysfunction was detected by a battery of cognition tests in animals rescued from CM by chloroquine treatment. In contrast, it was absent in animals treated with lovastatin and chloroquine. The outcome was similar in experimental bacterial sepsis, suggesting that statins have neuroprotective effects in severe infectious syndromes in addition to CM. Statin treatment prevents neuroinflammation and blood brain barrier dysfunction in experimental CM and related conditions that are associated with cognitive sequelae, and may be a valuable adjuvant therapeutic agent for prevention of cognitive impairment in patients surviving an episode of CM.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Cerebral malaria (CM) is the direst consequence of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infection. Cognitive impairment is a common sequela in children surviving CM. Identification of adjunctive therapies that reduce the complications of CM in survivors is a priority. Statins have been suggested for the treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders due to their pleiotropic effects. Here, we examined the effects of lovastatin on neuroinflammation in experimental CM, and its effect on the prevention of cognitive impairment. Lovastatin reduced adhesion and rolling of leukocytes in brain vessels, inhibited blood-brain barrier disruption, and reversed decreases in cerebral capillary density. Lovastatin also inhibited ICAM-1 and CD11b mRNA expression while increasing HMOX-1 mRNA levels. Proinflammatory cytokines and markers of oxidative stress were lower in the brains of infected mice treated with lovastatin. Lovastatin administered together with antimalarial drugs during the acute phase of the disease-protected survivors from impairment in both contextual and aversive memory 15 days after infection. Similar results were observed in a model of bacterial sepsis. Our findings support the possibility that statins may be valuable pharmacologic tools in treatment of patients with neuroinflammation associated with severe systemic inflammatory syndromes. Clinical trials with statins in CM and sepsis should be speedily considered to examine this point.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The burden of malaria is enormous with more than 40% of the world's population at risk for infections caused by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Kappe1">[1]</xref>. <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is the principal cause of syndromes of severe malaria, including cerebral malaria, which involves neurologic and systemic manifestations and in which coma is the defining feature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Rosenthal1">[2]</xref>. While only about 1% of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections progress to cerebral malaria, mortality is around 10–20% of affected patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-deSouza1">[3]</xref>. Prevention of plasmodial infection, development of new anti-malarial drugs with consistent efficacy, and identification of adjunctive therapies that can reduce organ damage in cerebral malaria and other forms of severe malaria are public health and scientific objectives of highest priority <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Kappe1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Golenser1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Children in the sub-Saharan Africa are disproportionately at risk for developing cerebral malaria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-deSouza1">[3]</xref> and there is now evidence that many patients who are effectively treated and survive cerebral malaria have long term physical, neurologic and neurocognitive dysfunctions and thus present a second clinical challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-deSouza1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Carter1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Zimmerman1">[7]</xref>. Approximately 500,000–800,000 children develop cerebral malaria each year in sub-Saharan Africa alone, suggesting that persistent cognitive dysfunction occurs in a significant number of young survivors. In fact, neurocognitive impairments were detected in as many as 26% of African children when follow up testing was done 6 months to 9 years after treatment of acute cerebral malaria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-John1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Boivin1">[8]</xref>. The potential impact on learning and behavioral function and its societal consequences is staggering.</p>
      <p>We recently reported studies employing mouse models of cerebral malaria with persistent cognitive dysfunction after rescue therapy with conventional anti-malaria drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Reis1">[9]</xref>. Cognitive impairment in contextual and aversive memory occurred in mice of susceptible genetic backgrounds infected with <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> ANKA (PbA) despite rescue therapy that was given early, when neurologic manifestations were relatively subtle and before the onset of coma, seizures, and other manifestations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Reis1">[9]</xref>. These models may provide important insights into the pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction associated with cerebral malaria and related disorders that may be relevant to human conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Zimmerman1">[7]</xref>. While differences between murine models of CM and the human syndrome are often emphasized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Langhorne1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Craig1">[11]</xref>, there are also important similarities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-deSouza1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Zimmerman1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Hunt1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Nie1">[14]</xref>. Nevertheless, caution must be exerted when translating experimental findings to the clinical scenario.</p>
      <p>Exacerbated inflammatory responses are major causes of organ dysfunction during severe infectious syndromes. In cerebral complications of systemic infections, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines activate leukocytes and endothelial cells and lead to microvascular plugging, impaired blood flow, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), local neuroinflammation, and apoptosis. All of these are observed, for example, in animal models of sepsis and malaria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Reis1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Ebersoldt1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Semmler1">[16]</xref>. In addition to directly injuring neurons, neuroinflammation activates quiescent microglia, which are resident cerebral macrophages that can play a pivotal role in brain damage from systemic inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-vanGool1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Mechanisms that underlie cognitive dysfunction after brain involvement in severe infectious syndromes and measures that can be used to prevent and treat it are, however, largely unexplored. We propose that drugs with pleiotropic effects on inflammation and metabolism could be ideal candidates to target neuroinflammation and decrease cognitive impairment after severe infectious syndromes. Existing data indicate that statins may be such agents and that they can modify two processes leading to brain injury: neuroinflammation and activation of proinflammatory microglia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Terblanche1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Morandi1">[19]</xref>. Statins, therefore, may counteract the pro-inflammatory phenotype and microglial activation during critical illness. Their actions favor an antiinflammatory switch that may contribute to neurovascular stabilization and neuronal healing rather than damage. In this study we present the first evidence that adjunctive treatment with statins prevents cognitive impairment after cerebral malaria. We also provide evidence that statins prevent cognitive dysfunction in experimental sepsis. The effects of statins in these models are consistent with activities that decrease inflammation and microglial activation and improve microvascular parameters in the brain. These observations have clear translational implications, and suggest that statins should be considered key candidates for clinical trials aimed at cognitive sequelae in patients with cerebral malaria and other severe infectious syndromes.</p>

        <title>Cognitive impairment in animals rescued from CM by antiplasmodial drug treatment is abrogated by adjuvant lovastatin administration</title>
        <p>Long-term cognitive impairment was described in African children surviving CM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-John1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Boivin1">[8]</xref>, and we recently found that cognitive impairment is mimicked in experimental models of CM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Reis1">[9]</xref>. Here, we show that oral lovastatin administered concomitantly with chloroquine prevented cognitive impairment detected 15 days after CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Chloroquine and lovastatin treatment were started at day 6-post infection and continued for 7 days in animals that developed early CM based on positive scoring for clinical signs in a complex battery of physiologic tests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Reis1">[9]</xref>. Lovastatin (10–40 mg/kg) did not have anti-parasitic effects alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) or interfere with the anti-parasitic effect of chloroquine, since parasitemia levels were similar in animals receiving chloroquine or the combination of drugs (not shown). Further, lovastatin treatment did not prevent mortality when given alone despite the slight delay effect observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g002">Figure 2B</xref>.</p>

            <p>Data on parasitemia (A) are shown as mean ± SEM. On day 6 post-infection mice were separated in two groups and one received lovastatin (10–40 mg/kg b.w.) daily for 7 days. Comparisons of C57BL6-PbA versus C57BL6-PbA treated animals (*) were significant by Mann-Withney Comparison test. There was no difference in parasitaemia when PbA and PbA-lovastatin treatment were compared (Mann-Withney Comparison test). (<bold>B</bold>) No differences in survival were observed among the groups (Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon tests).</p>

        <p>At day 15 animals receiving the combination therapy or chloroquine alone had no detectable parasitemia or any clinical signs of disease (not shown) and were, therefore, subjected to cognitive evaluation tasks. We observed that PbA-infected mice that were positive for clinical signs of CM on day 6 after infection and were rescued by chloroquine treatment lacked contextual memory. This was demonstrated by habituation to an open-field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Reis1">[9]</xref> since the animals showed no significant differences in the number of crossings and rearings when training and test sessions were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g001">Figure 1 A, B</xref>). In contrast, animals that were treated with lovastatin in addition to chloroquine showed a significant reduction in the number of crossings and rearings when comparing test and training sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g001">Figure 1A, B</xref>), indicating intact contextual memory in those mice rescued from CM and treated with lovastatin. In a parallel set of experiments, animals were evaluated for aversive memory integrity by a step-down inhibitory avoidance test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Reis1">[9]</xref>. Both short and long-term memory during the avoidance task were affected in mice rescued from CM by chloroquine since the times of latency on the platform in those animals were significantly shorter then in uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g001">Figure 1C and D</xref>, respectively). Lovastatin treatment also prevented loss of aversive memory in mice receiving the combination therapy, as indicated by longer times of latency on the platform when compared to animals treated with chloroquine alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g001">Figure 1C, D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Interestingly, lovastatin treatment also prevented cognitive impairment after bacterial sepsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We found that animals rescued by antibiotic therapy and fluid resuscitation had significant cognitive impairment detected both by the habituation to the open field test (data not shown) and by the step-down inhibitory avoidance test performed 15 days after the infection. Adjuvant treatment with lovastatin together with antibiotics prevented the cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g003">Figure 3</xref>), in a fashion similar to that we observed in the malaria model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

        <p>In order to investigate potential mechanisms of the neuroprotective effect of statins in experimental CM we analyzed the influence of lovastatin on neuroinflammatory parameters after the initial signs of CM. Six days after the infection of C57Bl/6 mice with PbA, the animals demonstrated clear signs of CM (which were not present in controls injected with uninfected RBC), as detected by a modified SHIRPA protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Reis1">[9]</xref> (zero score points in controls versus 5.7±1.7 in PbA-infected mice, p&lt;0.05).

As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g004">Figure 4</xref>, there was a marked decrease in functional capillary density (PbA-infected 336.7±15.6 versus control 4656±29.1 capillaries/mm<sup>2</sup>, p&lt;0.05).

Animals begun on lovastatin treatment (1–80 mg/kg) on day 6 and examined one day later, however, showed a significant decrease in BBB disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g005">Figure 5E</xref>).

        <title>Lovastatin treatment reduces cytokine levels in the brains of PbA-infected mice</title>
        <p>Anti-inflammatory effects of statins have recently been described in several different models and conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Bu1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Kouroumichakis1">[27]</xref>. One of the mechanisms is the modification of the pattern of cytokines/chemokine that are expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Nath1">[28]</xref>. We, therefore, investigated the ability of lovastatin to modify cytokine and chemokine responses in this model of CM. We found that IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-12 levels were elevated in the brains of mice on day 6-post infection, and were reduced by lovastatin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g006">Figure 6</xref>). MCP-1 levels were also decreased by lovastatin (20 mg/kg) from 2074±571.1 in untreated mice to 1212±946.2 pg/mL in animals receiving lovastatin. Interestingly, RANTES levels were not altered in infected animals nor were they affected by lovastatin treatment (supplemental data 1). We also observed high levels of TNF-α and MCP-1 in the plasma on day 6-post infection (TNF: 106.1±22.1 pg/mL in uninfected, 855.9±262.6 pg/mL in PbA-infected animals; MCP-1, 342.2±100.2 pg/mL in uninfected, 1189±275.6 pg/mL in PbA-infected animals; p&lt;0.05 by Mann-Withney test in each case). Treatment with lovastatin reduced plasma levels of both TNF-α (855.9±262.6 pg/mL in saline-treated, 456.9±66.8 pg/mL in lovastatin-treated animals, p&lt;0.05 by Mann-Withney test) and MCP-1 (1189±275.6 pg/mL in saline-treated, 602.5±179.9 pg/mL in lovastatin-treated animals, p&lt;0.05 by Mann-Withney test). Thus, lovastatin reduces the intracerebral and systemic inflammatory mediator responses in experimental CM. For comparison, we also treated animals with sodium diclofenac or allopurinol as control anti-inflammatory agents and did not detect protective effects in CM. In fact, sodium diclofenac increased mortality in infected animals (supplemental data 2 and 3), suggesting that unique immunomodulatory effects of lovastatin may make this drug especially suited for this condition.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Neurocognitive dysfunction was detected in as many as 26% of African children surviving CM when follow-up testing was performed 6 months to 9 years after recovery from the acute disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Carter1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-John1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Boivin1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Carter2">[30]</xref>. Considering that 500,000–800,000 children develop cerebral malaria each year in sub-Saharan Africa alone, persistent cognitive dysfunction in survivors is unquestionably a significant complication regardless of the lack of data about its occurrence in other endemic regions of the world. Importantly, the potential impact on long-term learning and behavioral function, and the socio-economical consequences in poor areas of the world where CM is a major public health concern, are likely to be extremely important but are not yet charted. It is also possible that cognitive dysfunction occurs after successful therapy of CM in adults, despite the fact that CM is much less common in older age groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-deSouza1">[3]</xref>. Furthermore, cognitive impairment is also detected after severe bacterial sepsis – a common condition worldwide – in older patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Iwashyna1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Sacanella1">[32]</xref>, and may be a frequent sequela to brain involvement in a variety of acute and severe systemic inflammatory syndromes.</p>
      <p>The molecular mechanisms that underlie sustained cognitive dysfunction after systemic inflammatory syndromes such as CM and sepsis are not known and have been poorly investigated, making development of specific therapeutic measures equally challenging. With respect to CM, the detailed molecular mechanisms of the acute cerebral syndrome are not completely understood, although cytoadhesion of parasitized red blood cells (PRBC) and innate immune events seem to play key roles in the pathophysiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-vanderHeyde1">[33]</xref>. Glimpses of the molecular mechanism and mediators involved in neural dysfunctions in CM are becoming available. One analysis suggests that activation of endothelial cells in the brain vasculature and subsequent activation of microglia lead to the production of the excitotoxin quinolinic acid, a selective agonist of <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors, which can cause seizures, neuronal swelling, and delayed neuronal disintegration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Dobbie1">[34]</xref>. Pathophysiologic mechanisms of this nature may explain the neurologic complications of childhood CM.</p>
      <p>We recently reported that the cognitive impairment is associated with the development of clinical and histological signs of CM in murine models combining plasmodium strains that incite the cerebral syndrome and mice of susceptible genetic background, and that cognitive dysfunction may be directly linked to the early inflammatory changes in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Reis1">[9]</xref>. We found that models with systemic infection but without signs of neuroinflammation showed no cognitive impairment after cure of the parasitic disease, establishing that the cognitive dysfunction was a consequence of elements of specific brain involvement rather than severe systemic disease or the presence of the parasite <italic>per se</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Reis1">[9]</xref>. We also found that blocking oxidative damage by combining anti-oxidant and antiplasmodial drugs early after the initial clinical signs of cerebral involvement was an effective combination therapy that prevented late cognitive impairment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Reis1">[9]</xref>. Here, we used the same permissive CM model to show that, in addition to anti-oxidants, statins are also effective adjuvant agents that prevent cognitive impairment in animals with CM. This is a novel and important observation with clear translational implications, since statins are well tolerated and widely used drugs that could easily be incorporated into clinical trials aimed at evaluating acute adjuvant therapies for patients with CM. We recognize, however, that controversy exists regarding human CM and murine models of this syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-deSouza1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Langhorne1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Carvalho1">[13]</xref>, and that care must be exerted during new translational evaluation of statins in clinical trials.</p>
      <p>If adjuvant trials of statins are undertaken, we feel that the cognitive impairment should be the main endpoint of such a study since mortality is delayed but not decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), despite clear anti-neuroinflammatory effects of statins during the acute syndrome. Supporting this approach, a recently-published study reported that another member of the statin class, atorvastatin, given therapeutically alone had no effect on survival in a model of PbA-induced CM but that a prophylactic scheme employing atorvastatin together with mefloquine, rather than mefloquine alone, yielded significant delay in mortality and onset of CM symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Souraud1">[35]</xref>. Similarly, others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Bienvenu1">[36]</xref> reported that statins failed to prevent death due to CM but had an adjuvant effect when administered with artesunate, delaying death in infected animals without a clear effect on overall mortality. The delay in mortality may be secondary to a decrease in neuroinflammation and consequent death from neurological damage, leading to late mortality due to severe anemia or other complications related to the progression of the parasitic disease. We did not detect any effect of combination therapy with chloroquine and lovastatin on overall mortality, probably because the PbA strain used here is extremely sensitive to chloroquine and this drug alone was sufficient to confer a 100% rescue and survival (not shown). Furthermore, a statin (atorvastatin) was shown to synergize with mefloquine, but not with chloroquine, in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Wurtz1">[37]</xref>. Despite being highly effective in preventing mortality, we found that chloroquine alone did not reduce cognitive impairment in the surviving animals. This indicates that limiting the inflammatory damage to the brain, probably by shielding the endothelium against malaria-induced damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Taoufiq1">[38]</xref>, was necessary to avoid the cognitive sequelae, in addition to an effective control of the parasitic disease.</p>
      <p>In addition to their activities as cholesterol lowering drugs, statins are known to have complex pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and endothelial function-enhancing effects both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in human studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Terblanche1">[18]</xref>. Statins inhibit the mevalonate pathway, which involves the synthesis of isoprenoids and the intracellular trafficking of membrane-associated proteins such as G-proteins. GTP-binding proteins have crucial roles in intracellular inflammatory signaling by acting as molecular switches for various protein kinases. Specific targets, including Ras, Rho and Rac subfamilies, are thought to be important in systemic inflammatory syndromes, such as sepsis, because of their key roles in intracellular signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Greenwood1">[39]</xref>. We hypothesized that these or other molecular activities of statins prevent, or attenuate, injurious innate inflammatory responses in the brain during the initial phases of CM development. Endothelial cells are likely an important target for actions of statins that decrease CM-induced damage. In fact, atorvastatin pre-treatment of endothelial cells was recently reported to blunt the expression of adhesion molecules, reduce apoptosis, and decrease <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cytoadherence, while enhancing endothelial monolayer integrity during co-incubation with malaria parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Taoufiq1">[38]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>In vitro</italic> and animal studies have shown that statins reduce the release of TNF-α and IL-1β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Terblanche1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Niessner1">[40]</xref>. Consistent with these observations, lovastatin decreased brain levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-12 and MCP-1 in experimental CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g006">Figure 6</xref>). IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-12 were previously shown to play important roles in the pathophysiology of malaria and its cerebral form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Hunt2">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Yoshimoto1">[43]</xref>. There is substantial evidence that TNF-α is increased and pathogenically involved in both clinical and experimental syndromes of severe malaria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Lou1">[44]</xref>. Importantly, cerebrospinal fluid TNF-α levels correlated with cognitive impairment in Ugandan children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-John2">[45]</xref>. In addition, elevated brain levels of IL-1β were shown to occur in children with CM and neurodegenerative lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Armah1">[46]</xref>. Furthermore, ICAM-1 expression by endothelial cells is enhanced by TNF-α and IL-1β, and ICAM-1 is important in cell adhesion, including adhesion of PRBC, in models of cerebral malaria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Lou1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Willimann1">[47]</xref>. Our studies demonstrate that critical cytokines, endothelial ICAM-1, and adhesion of leukocytes and PRBC are decreased by lovastatin, and may indicate that the attenuated ICAM-1 expression detected in animals with CM treated with lovastatin is secondary to blunted cytokine signaling in these animals. These changes would be expected to have a positive impact on brain microcirculation by decreasing cell adhesion and improving blood flow, as we detected in our observations of the pial microvessels of treated animals by intravital microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Statins also reduce inducible nitric oxide (NOS) expression, thereby reducing neuronal apoptosis, while increasing endothelial NOS expression, preserving microcirculatory blood flow via local vasodilation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-McGown1">[48]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Blood-brain barrier disruption and edema formation are among the major features of CM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Brown1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Newton1">[51]</xref>. Brain edema is detected in the pediatric syndrome and also in adult patients with CM studied by <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Millan1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Looareesuwan1">[54]</xref>, and is of prognostic value in such patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Patankar1">[55]</xref>. We observed a marked increase in brain vascular permeability occurring simultaneously with detection of the initial clinical signs of CM in our experimental model. This was evidenced by quantitative measurement of Evans blue dye in brain tissue and also by histological examinations demonstrating clear evidence for perivascular edema. Previous work suggests that CM involves both cytotoxic and vasogenic edema and may, therefore, result from a combination of ischemic and inflammatory triggers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Penet1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Penet2">[57]</xref>. Vasogenic edema involves accumulation of excess fluid in the extracellular space of the brain parenchyma because of a leaky BBB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Paul1">[58]</xref>; cytotoxic edema consists of intracellular fluid accumulation that occurs during anoxic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Papadopoulos1">[59]</xref>. Our findings indicate that statin administration has salutary anti-inflammatory and vascular activities in animals with CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g004">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g005">5</xref>). Thus the inhibition of edema formation that we observed in our study may result from a combinational decrease in inflammatory damage to the BBB and obstructive plugging of microvessels. Whether cognitive dysfunction in clinical CM is directly linked to these mechanisms is yet unknown. Nevertheless, the fact that statins treatment decreases injurious neurovascular pathology and cognitive dysfunction in our model of CM suggest such a link or, at least, a common triggering mechanism.</p>
      <p>Of relevance, expression and activation of leukocyte adhesion molecules involved in the development of endothelial damage and BBB alterations were also decreased by statins in bacterial sepsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Terblanche1">[18]</xref>, and our initial experiments indicate that statins also prevent cognitive impairment in animals recovering from bacterial sepsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This observation has two major implications. First, the cognitive dysfunction detected after bacterial sepsis or CM may have common molecular pathways that are similarly affected by statins. Secondly, statins may be ideal candidates for clinical trials not only in patients with CM, but also in other patients with systemic inflammatory syndromes complicated by brain involvement. In fact, the idea that statins may be useful to reduce the burden of cognitive impairment in patients who are critically ill was suggested recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Morandi1">[19]</xref>. We believe that our observations are the first experimental evidence to support this possibility. Improvement of cognitive dysfunction in experimental CM and sepsis by antioxidant adjuvants also suggests that these syndromes share common molecular pathways that may be targets for similar pharmacologic therapies. Statins have also been examined in models of traumatic brain injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Lu1">[60]</xref>, which involves pathophysiologic changes (eg, neuronal damage and apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and BBB injury) similar to those observed in other types of critical illness, including sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and CM. The benefits of statins observed in animal studies of traumatic brain injury include increased hippocampal neuron survival and improved neurologic function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Lu2">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Lu3">[62]</xref>. In humans, one clinical trial reported a reduction in amnesia and increased orientation in patients with traumatic brain injury who were treated with rosuvastatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-TapiaPerez1">[63]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Rupture of red blood cells by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites releases free heme, which in turn increases the expression by the host cells of the antiinflammatory enzyme HMOX-1. HMOX-1 then degrades heme to CO, iron and biliverdin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Hunt3">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Tenhunen1">[65]</xref>. Increased expression of HMOX-1 after treatment with cobalt protoporphirin (CoPPIX) or CO administration prevented mortality in experimental CM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Pamplona1">[66]</xref>. These protective effects were associated with inhibition of BBB disruption, decreased brain microvascular congestion and hemorrhage, and suppression of neuroinflammation, including inhibition the expression of adhesion molecules in the brain microvasculature and the suppression of activated CD8+ T cell sequestration in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Pamplona1">[66]</xref>. In addition, biliverdin, and its byproduct bilirubin, are both powerful antioxidants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Stocker1">[67]</xref>. Previous reports have shown that statins induce HMOX-1 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Hsu1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003099-Ali1">[68]</xref>. In the present study we also observed that lovastatin enhanced HMOX-1 in healthy and PbA-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003099-g005">Figure 5I</xref>), suggesting that some of protective effects observed here result from the increase in HMOX-1 activity and the generation of its products, potentially contributing to the decrease in the inflammatory response and oxidative damage.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that a statin agent has potent salutary effects on neuroinflammation in experimental CM. Given as an adjunct therapy with antiplasmodial drugs, lovastatin prevented the cognitive impairment that follows CM. Furthermore, lovastatin treatment also prevented cognitive impairment after bacterial sepsis. We propose that statins may be valuable pharmacologic tools in treatment of patients with neuroinflammation associated with severe systemic inflammatory syndromes, and novel agents that may ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in survivors. Recognizing that translational steps from laboratory experiments to human disease must always be approached with care, our findings, together with the growing literature on statins and cognitive impairment, their safety profile, and the large experience with these drugs in patients indicate that clinical trials with statins in CM and sepsis should be considered to examine this point.</p>

Mice were infected with PbA and were treated with chloroquine (25 mg/kg) once a day for 7 days at the first signs of CM (day 6 post-infection) or with chloroquine+sodium diclofenac (50 mg/kg b.w. p.o.) administered together with chloroquine. On day 12 we observed 100% of mortality in animals treated with chloroquine+sodium diclofenac. P&lt;0.05 when compared with chloroquine treated mice (Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon tests).</p>

          <p>Allopurinol did not prevent cognitive impairment after cerebral malaria. C57BL/6 mice (n = 12–20/group) were infected with PbA (10<sup>6</sup> PRBC). As a control, one group was inoculated with the same number of uninfected RBC (n = 6–12/group). Starting on day 6-post infection, uninfected and PbA-infected mice were divided into 2 groups and treated orally with chloroquine (25 mg/kg b.w.), or with the combination of chloroquine+allopurinol (100 mg/kg b.w. p.o.) for 7 days. On days 15 and 16 post-infection all the animals were submitted to open field training and test session (A–B). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E.M. of crossings (A) and rearings (B) in training (<italic>gray bars</italic>) and test (<italic>black bars</italic>) sessions. *Significant difference between groups in training and test sessions (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, Student's t test).</p>
