      <abstract>
        <p>Iron is an essential nutrient for most bacterial pathogens, but is restricted by the host immune system. <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) utilizes two classes of small molecules, mycobactins and carboxymycobactins, to capture iron from the human host. Here, we show that an <italic>Mtb</italic> mutant lacking the <italic>mmpS4</italic> and <italic>mmpS5</italic> genes did not grow under low iron conditions. A cytoplasmic iron reporter indicated that the double mutant experienced iron starvation even under high-iron conditions. Loss of <italic>mmpS4</italic> and <italic>mmpS5</italic> did not change uptake of carboxymycobactin by <italic>Mtb</italic>. Thin layer chromatography showed that the Δ<italic>mmpS4/S5</italic> mutant was strongly impaired in biosynthesis and secretion of siderophores. Pull-down experiments with purified proteins demonstrated that MmpS4 binds to a periplasmic loop of the associated transporter protein MmpL4. This interaction was corroborated by genetic experiments. While MmpS5 interacted only with MmpL5, MmpS4 interacted with both MmpL4 and MmpL5. These results identified MmpS4/MmpL4 and MmpS5/MmpL5 as siderophore export systems in <italic>Mtb</italic> and revealed that the MmpL proteins transport small molecules other than lipids. MmpS4 and MmpS5 resemble periplasmic adapter proteins of tripartite efflux pumps of Gram-negative bacteria, however, they are not only required for export but also for efficient siderophore synthesis. Membrane association of MbtG suggests a link between siderophore synthesis and transport. The structure of the soluble domain of MmpS4 (residues 52–140) was solved by NMR and indicates that mycobacterial MmpS proteins constitute a novel class of transport accessory proteins. The bacterial burden of the <italic>mmpS4/S5</italic> deletion mutant in mouse lungs was lower by 10,000-fold and none of the infected mice died within 180 days compared to wild-type <italic>Mtb</italic>. This is the strongest attenuation observed so far for <italic>Mtb</italic> mutants lacking genes involved in iron utilization. In conclusion, this study identified the first components of novel siderophore export systems which are essential for virulence of <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>In the late 19<sup>th</sup> century the French physician Armand Trousseau recognized that treating anemic tuberculosis patients with iron salts exacerbated the disease. In 1911 Twort postulated that mycobacteria produce an essential growth factor which was identified in 1953 as mycobactin. The hydrophobic mycobactin and its more water-soluble cousin carboxymycobactin are small molecules made by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> to scavenge iron from its human host. While the biosynthesis of these siderophores has been decoded, it was unknown how <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> secretes these molecules. In this study, we identified two similar transport systems, MmpS4/MmpL4 and MmpS5/MmpL5, which are required for biosynthesis and export of siderophores by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. The lack of these transport systems drastically decreased the number of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> cells in the lungs and spleens of infected mice. Lung examination and histological assessment in mice infected with the <italic>mmpS4/S5</italic> deletion strain showed almost no signs of infection. Further, none of the mice infected with this strain died within 180 days in contrast to wild-type <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. In this study, we identified the first components of a novel siderophore export system in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and showed the importance of siderophore export for virulence of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Iron is an essential micronutrient for most forms of life on earth because of its vital role as a redox cofactor of proteins required for critical cellular processes. Pathogenic bacteria have evolved an array of intricate mechanisms to scavenge limited iron from the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Skaar1">[1]</xref>. <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>), one of the most successful human bacterial pathogens, is no exception. <italic>Mtb</italic> meets its iron demands by stripping host iron stores employing two hydroxyphenyloxazoline siderophores, mycobactin (MBT) and carboxymycobactin (cMBT). To counteract these bacterial iron acquisition processes, the alveolar macrophage in which <italic>Mtb</italic> thrives, keeps phagosomal iron levels extremely low by the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein Nramp1 in particular after activation by interferon-γ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Searle1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Cellier1">[3]</xref>. MBT and cMBT increase the biologically available iron within the phagosomal compartment almost by 20-fold indicating that the <italic>Mtb</italic> siderophores can overcome these host defense mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Wagner1">[4]</xref>. Furthermore, studies using siderophore biosynthesis and uptake mutants underpin the importance of siderophore-mediated iron acquisition to the virulence of <italic>Mtb</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-deVoss1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Rodriguez1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Siegrist1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In <italic>Mtb</italic>, siderophore biosynthesis is induced under low-iron conditions. When sufficient iron is available the regulator IdeR represses expression of MBT biosynthesis genes <italic>mbtA-N</italic>. The inner membrane transporter IrtAB and the Esx-3 secretion machinery are required for utilization and uptake of siderophores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Rodriguez1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Siegrist1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Ryndak1">[8]</xref>. In <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, export of the siderophore exochelin was shown to be mediated by ABC-like exporter ExiT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Zhu1">[9]</xref>. Given mycobacteria's unique outer membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Hoffmann1">[10]</xref>, it is likely that a siderophore secretion system of <italic>Mtb</italic> requires both inner and outer membrane components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Niederweis1">[11]</xref>, similarly to the EntS-TolC system of <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Bleuel1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Furrer1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study, we examined two iron-regulated genes encoding predicted outer membrane proteins MmpS4 and MmpS5. We show that either MmpS4 or MmpS5 is required for growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> under low iron conditions. While single <italic>mmpS4</italic> or <italic>mmpS5</italic> deletion mutants do not exhibit a low iron growth phenotype, they have diminished virulence compared to the wild-type strain. Deletion of both <italic>mmpS4</italic> and <italic>mmpS5</italic> drastically decreases synthesis and secretion of siderophores in <italic>Mtb</italic> and greatly reduces its virulence in mice. Subcellular fractionation reveals that MmpS4 and MmpS5 are membrane associated. This study identifies MmpS4 and MmpS5 as the first components of a novel siderophore export system that is crucial for survival of <italic>Mtb</italic> in its host.</p>

        <title>MmpS4 or MmpS5 is required for growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> under iron-limited conditions</title>
        <p>To investigate whether MmpS4 and MmpS5 are important for growth under iron-deplete conditions, mutants with in-frame deletions of the <italic>mmpS4</italic> and <italic>mmpS5</italic> genes were constructed using homologous recombination in both virulent <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv and avirulent <italic>Mtb</italic> mc<sup>2</sup>6230 (ΔRD1, Δ<italic>panCD</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003120.s020">Table S1</xref>). Since no low-iron growth defect was observed with the single Δ<italic>mmpS4</italic> and Δ<italic>mmpS5</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003120-g001">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003120.s001">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003120.s002">2</xref>), and expression of both <italic>mmpS4</italic> and <italic>mmpS5</italic> is induced under iron-limited conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Rodriguez2">[14]</xref> we suspected that they might have redundant functions. Therefore, we constructed a double <italic>mmpS4/mmpS5</italic> mutant using the single Δ<italic>mmpS5</italic> mutant as the parent strain in both virulent and avirulent <italic>Mtb</italic>. The mutant strains were unmarked by site-specific recombination and confirmed by Southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003120.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Western blot experiments demonstrated the absence of MmpS4 and MmpS5 in the double mutant and in the respective single mutants, while wild-type levels of both proteins were observed in the complemented strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003120-g001">Figs. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003120.s004">S4</xref>). No differences in growth of the single Δ<italic>mmpS4</italic> and Δ<italic>mmpS5</italic> strains were observed on self-made low iron glycerol-alanine salts (GAS) agar plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003120-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). By contrast, the Δ<italic>mmpS4/S5</italic> mutant did not grow on GAS agar plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003120-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Growth of the double mutant was partially rescued when GAS agar plates were supplemented with 5 µM hemoglobin that was previously shown to function as an iron source for <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003120-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Tullius1">[15]</xref>. However, in liquid medium, the addition of hemin completely rescued the growth of the Δ<italic>mmpS4/S5</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003120.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) verifying that the growth defect of this strain is indeed iron dependent.

        <title>MmpS4 and MmpS5 are not involved in sensing or uptake of iron</title>
        <p>The inability of <italic>Mtb</italic> Δ<italic>mmpS4/S5</italic> to grow under iron-limiting conditions may be due to defects in siderophore biosynthesis, iron sensing, uptake or secretion of siderophores. Recently, a biosynthetic pathway has been proposed based on the substrate specificities of enzymes encoded by the <italic>mbt</italic> gene cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-McMahon1">[16]</xref> which accounts for all enzymatic activities required for MBT biosynthesis. Therefore, it is unlikely that MmpS4 and MmpS5 play a direct role in biosynthesis of MBT and cMBT. To test whether the ability of the Δ<italic>mmpS4/S5</italic> mutant is impaired in sensing low iron conditions, we utilized a <italic>gfp</italic>-based iron-regulated reporter construct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Jones1">[17]</xref>. Under low iron conditions, transcription from IdeR-regulated promoters was induced in wt <italic>Mtb</italic> containing the reporter construct as indicated by a strongly increased GFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003120.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). However, when wt <italic>Mtb</italic> was grown under high iron conditions, only background fluorescence was observed confirming that <italic>Mtb</italic> senses iron availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003120-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). To examine the iron sensing capability of the Δ<italic>mmpS4/S5</italic> mutant we exploited the observation that removal of the antibiotic resistance cassette from the MBT biosynthesis mutant ML1600 (Δ<italic>mbtD</italic>::<italic>hyg</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Jones2">[18]</xref> resulted in the strain ML1610 (Δ<italic>mbtD</italic>::<italic>loxP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003120.s020">Table S1</xref>) with only a partial low-iron growth defect <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003120.s008">Fig. S8</xref>). This result suggests that replacing <italic>mbtD</italic> with the <italic>hyg</italic> cassette inhibits expression of downstream genes thereby completely eliminating siderophore production. IdeR-regulated promoters are induced under high-iron conditions in <italic>Mtb</italic> Δ<italic>mbtD</italic>::<italic>loxP</italic>, but the addition of exogenous cMBT to this mutant repressed these promoters, demonstrating that this mutant is capable of sensing iron availability and is suitable as a control strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003120-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>).

        <p>The low iron growth defect of the Δ<italic>mmpS4/S5</italic> mutant is not caused by an iron sensing defect or by lack of cMBT uptake. An alternative explanation might be a defect in secretion of cMBT.

        <p>To assess the role of MmpS4 and MmpS5 for virulence of <italic>Mtb</italic>, BALB/c mice were infected with low dose aerosols containing the <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv parent strain ML617, the Δ<italic>mmpS4/S5</italic> mutant (ML618), and the double deletion mutant complemented with <italic>mmpS5</italic> (ML619), <italic>mmpS4</italic> (ML620), and <italic>mmpS4/S5</italic> (ML624). The growth kinetics of the parent <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv strain in lungs showed the expected logarithmic increase during the acute phase followed by a plateau during the chronic phase of infection. Similar growth kinetics in spleens demonstrated that this strain is competent for dissemination. Loss of the single <italic>mmpS4</italic> and <italic>mmpS5</italic> genes also compromised the ability of <italic>Mtb</italic> to survive in the lungs as the number of viable bacteria decreased by 100-fold from the initial burden compared to wt <italic>Mtb</italic>. However, loss of these genes alone did not alter the ability of <italic>Mtb</italic> to disseminate to and proliferate in the spleen. The Δ<italic>mmpS4/S5</italic> mutant failed to proliferate in lungs and spleen as reflected by a 24,000- and 1,800- fold, respectively, decreased bacterial burden compared to wt <italic>Mtb</italic> after 16 weeks of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003120-g007">Fig. 7</xref>).

The single <italic>mmpS4</italic> or <italic>mmpS5</italic> genes partially complemented the virulence defect of the double mutant.

        <title>MmpS4 and MmpS5 in complex with their cognate MmpL proteins constitute siderophore export systems in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic></title>
        <p>In this study, we showed that the lack of MmpS4 and MmpS5 strongly reduced siderophore secretion and caused a growth defect of <italic>Mtb</italic> under low iron conditions. Pull-down experiments demonstrated that the MmpS4 protein forms a complex with the inner membrane transporter MmpL4 <italic>in vitro</italic>. This observation was corroborated by genetic complementation experiments demonstrating that MmpS4 and MmpS5 interact with their respective MmpL proteins to restore growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> under iron-limiting conditions. Considering that siderophore uptake is not altered in <italic>Mtb</italic> lacking <italic>mmpS4/S5</italic> and that the MmpL proteins are inner membrane transporter proteins, it is concluded that the respective MmpS/MmpL complexes translocate siderophores across the inner membrane into the periplasmic space. Such a transport process is defined as export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Desvaux1">[27]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Proteins which enable siderophore export in <italic>Mtb</italic> have been unknown so far <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Niederweis1">[11]</xref>, largely because <italic>Mtb</italic> does not have any proteins resembling known siderophore export systems such as EntS of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Furrer1">[13]</xref> or PvdE of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Schalk1">[28]</xref>. Previously, MmpS5 and MmpL5 have been implicated in drug efflux due to weak similarity with RND efflux pumps of <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Milano1">[29]</xref>. MmpL3, MmpL7 and MmpL8 were shown to export lipids such as trehalose monomycolate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Varela1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Tahlan1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Grzegorzewicz1">[32]</xref>, phthiocerol dimycocerosate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Cox1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Camacho1">[34]</xref>, and sulfolipid 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Converse1">[35]</xref> leading to the hypothesis that the MmpL proteins are lipid transporters. Since carboxymycobactins and in particular mycobactins are quite hydrophobic molecules and have similar chemical properties as lipids, this finding is rather an expansion than a deviation from the rule. Taken together, we conclude that MmpS4/MmpL4 and MmpS5/L5 constitute novel bacterial siderophore export systems.</p>

        <title>The reduced siderophore levels in the <italic>mmpS4/S5</italic> double mutant suggest a link between siderophore biosynthesis and export in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic></title>
        <p>The lack of the MmpS4/5 proteins also reduced the amount of detectable carboxy/mycobactins suggesting a role in biosynthesis of these siderophores in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Recently, a biosynthetic pathway comprising all enzymatic activities required for MBT/cMBT biosynthesis has been proposed based on the substrate specificities of enzymes encoded by the <italic>mbt</italic> operons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-McMahon1">[16]</xref>. Modifying enzymes to generate nonmethylated or α-methylated MBT derivatives have not been identified yet, but they are not expected to alter the total MBT amount. Thus, it is concluded that the strongly reduced siderophore levels in the <italic>Mtb</italic> Δ<italic>mmpS4/S5</italic> mutant likely result from an indirect effect of these proteins on biosynthesis. Indeed, such a mechanism has been proposed for the MmpS4 protein which is required for efficient synthesis and export of surface-exposed glycopeptidolipids (GPL) in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Deshayes1">[20]</xref>. Co-localization of MmpS4 with FadD23 and MbtH indicated that the GPL biosynthesis enzymes form a multi-protein complex with the membrane proteins MmpS4 and MmpL4a/b in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. Since lack of MmpS4 resulted in enzyme diffusion in the cytoplasm, biosynthesis of GPLs was much less efficient in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Deshayes1">[20]</xref>. This phenotype was complemented by the <italic>Mtb mmpS4</italic> gene indicating that <italic>Mtb</italic> MmpS4 also enables formation of a biosynthetic multi-enzyme complex at the inner membrane of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. In this study we show, that MmpS4 is involved in siderophore export in <italic>Mtb</italic>. The fact that the siderophore biosynthesis enzyme MbtG is located at the inner membrane, as shown in this study, supports the hypothesis that a similar multi-enzyme complex for efficient siderophore synthesis and transport exists in <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p>
        <p>In principle, block of transport caused by the <italic>mmpS4/mmpS5</italic> deletions and degradation of siderophores as is observed for the ferric enterobactin esterase IroD, IroE, and Fes of <italic>E. coli</italic> and Salmonella <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Lin1">[36]</xref> would also explain the low level of MBTs/cMBTs in the <italic>Mtb mmpS4/mmpS5</italic> double mutant. However, there are no enzymes in <italic>Mtb</italic> with similarities to known siderophore esterases. In addition, degradation of imported siderophores to release iron in the cytoplasm is rare and has only been observed for trilactone siderophores such as enterobactin of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Abergel1">[37]</xref>.

Coupled synthesis and export would also prevent toxic accumulation of siderophores in <italic>Mtb</italic> as has been observed in other bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Brickman1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Franza1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Caza1">[42]</xref>.</p>

        <title>The MmpS4 and MmpS5 proteins do not confer substrate specificity</title>
        <p>An interesting question is whether the MmpL4/MmpS4 or the MmpL5/MmpS5 systems are specific for MBTs or cMBTs. The single mutants clearly produce and secrete both siderophores indicating that the MmpS4/MmpS5 proteins are not specific for either substrate. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the <italic>Mtb mmpS4</italic> gene complements the GPL synthesis and transport defect of the <italic>M. smegmatis mmpS4</italic> mutant, although GPLs do not exist in <italic>Mtb</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Deshayes1">[20]</xref>. It is more likely that the transporters themselves, namely MmpL4 and MmpL5, confer specificity for MBTs or cMBTs. This hypothesis is currently under investigation. Interestingly, we observed that both MmpS4 and MmpS5 interact with MmpL5, while MmpS5 cannot restore growth of an <italic>Mtb</italic> triple mutant Δ<italic>mmpS4/S5/L5</italic> expressing only <italic>mmpL4</italic> under iron-limiting conditions. Thus, MmpS4 seems to be more promiscuous in its interactions with MmpL proteins. In this regard, it should be noted that the genetic complementation experiments indicate that the MmpS5/MmpL5 pair is more efficient in restoring wt growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> under low iron conditions. In conclusion, it appears that <italic>Mtb</italic> ensures efficient siderophore export by employing at least two partially redundant transporters.</p>

Further experiments are required to provide evidence for this hypothesis. Importantly, the structure of MmpS4 shows no similarity to AcrA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Mikolosko1">[44]</xref> or other periplasmic adapter proteins from drug efflux systems of Gram-negative bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Symmons1">[45]</xref> indicating that the mycobacterial MmpS proteins constitute a novel class of accessory proteins in complex transporter systems.</p>

        <p>In this study, we identified a novel siderophore export system of <italic>Mtb</italic> which is composed of the transporters MmpL4 and MmpL5 and their associated MmpS proteins. Previously, it was proposed that the MmpS proteins function as periplasmic adapter proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Milano1">[29]</xref> which was based on the low sequence similarities between the transporters of tripartite efflux pumps of Gram-negative bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Nikaido1">[46]</xref> with MmpL proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Domenech1">[47]</xref>.

In addition, we show that, in contrast to their Gram-negative counterparts, the MmpS4/MmpS5 proteins are not only required for export, but also for biosynthesis of cMBT/MBT. Therefore, we hypothesize that MmpS4 functions as a scaffolding protein to couple synthesis and export of MBT/cMBT in <italic>Mtb</italic> as has been proposed for GPLs in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Deshayes1">[20]</xref>.

            <p>Siderophores are synthesized by cytoplasmic synthases that function as a complex. Synthesis and transport of siderophores is likely coupled and dependent on the activity of the RND transporters, MmpL4 and MmpL5. Siderophore export requires that the membrane-associated proteins MmpS4 and MmpS5 function together with their cognate MmpL proteins. MmpS4 and MmpS5 are anchored to the inner membrane and may function as periplasmic adaptor proteins. Export of siderophores across the OM would require a yet undiscovered OMP. Once secreted, siderophores bind iron and would require an OMP siderophore receptor for transport across the OM. Once in the periplasmic space IrtAB imports ferric-siderophores across the inner membrane where iron is released from the siderophore and becomes available for the cell.</p>

Interestingly, the <italic>Mtb mmpL4</italic> mutant showed a 10-fold reduced bacterial burden in the lungs of mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Domenech1">[47]</xref>. This is consistent with our finding that the number of bacteria of an <italic>Mtb</italic> strain which lacks only <italic>mmpS4</italic> was between 10- and 100-fold lower in the lungs of mice after the acute phase of infection. Similarly, the slight attenuation of an <italic>Mtb</italic> strain which lacks only <italic>mmpS5</italic> is consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> growth defect of an <italic>Mtb mmpS5</italic> mutant in transposon site hybridization (TraSH) studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Sassetti1">[48]</xref>. The loss of virulence of <italic>Mtb</italic> Δ<italic>mmpS4/S5</italic> mutant in mice is much more pronounced than that observed for the <italic>irtAB</italic> mutant which lacks an ABC transporter required for cMBT uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Rodriguez1">[6]</xref>. This correlates with the different magnitude of their <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotypes: While the <italic>irtAB</italic> mutant showed only a minor growth defect under low iron conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Rodriguez1">[6]</xref>, loss of <italic>mmpS4</italic> and <italic>mmpS5</italic> completely abolished growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> under those conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003120-g001">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003120.s001">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003120.s002">S2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>In this study, we identified that interaction of the membrane proteins MmpS4 and MmpS5 with their cognate MmpL transporters is required for siderophore export in <italic>Mtb</italic> and propose a model for siderophore secretion. These novel siderophore transport systems are essential for virulence of <italic>Mtb</italic> in mice. Considering the almost universal requirement of bacterial pathogens for iron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003120-Nairz1">[49]</xref> it is tempting to speculate that these systems might be good drug targets. However, more work is required to determine whether these two partially redundant transporters can be poisoned by a single drug.</p>

Twenty four 4- to 5-week old female BALB/c mice (Charles River) were infected with ML617, ML618, ML619, ML620, or ML624. Four mice from each group were weighed and sacrificed at days 1, 14, 28, 56, 84, and 112 post-infection to determine the number of bacilli in the lung and spleen. Mouse organs were aseptically removed, homogenized, and serially diluted. Appropriate dilutions were plated onto Middlebrook 7H11 agar plates to determine the colony forming units. For histological analysis, representative tissue samples from each group at days 1, 28, 56, 112 post-infection were fixed in 10% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin using standard procedures. Thirteen 4- to 5-week old female BALB/c mice were infected with 7,500–10,000 bacilli using the five strains mentioned above using the same method already described.
