        <p>Reverse genetics in the mosquito <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> by RNAi mediated gene silencing has led in recent years to an advanced understanding of the mosquito immune response against infections with bacteria and malaria parasites. We developed RNAi screens in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> hemocyte-like cells using a library of double-stranded RNAs targeting 109 genes expressed highly or specifically in mosquito hemocytes to identify novel regulators of the hemocyte immune response. Assays included phagocytosis of bacterial bioparticles, expression of the antimicrobial peptide CEC1, and basal and induced expression of the mosquito complement factor LRIM1. A cell viability screen was also carried out to assess dsRNA cytotoxicity and to identify genes involved in cell growth and survival. Our results identify 22 novel immune regulators, including proteins putatively involved in phagosome assembly and maturation (Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, v-ATPase and cyclin-dependent protein kinase), pattern recognition (fibrinogen-domain lectins and Nimrod), immune modulation (peptidase and serine protease homolog), immune signaling (Eiger and LPS-induced factor), cell adhesion and communication (Laminin B1 and Ninjurin) and immune homeostasis (Lipophorin receptor). The development of robust functional cell-based assays paves the way for genome-wide functional screens to study the mosquito immune response to infections with human pathogens.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The mosquito immune system relies on innate humoral and cellular reactions to fight infections, including those by malaria parasites that must pass through mosquitoes before they can infect humans. Therefore, a detailed molecular understanding of these reactions could assist the design of new ways to control the spread of malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases. Here we use a technique to silence in mosquito cultured cells genes that are highly and/or specifically expressed in mosquito hemocytes, the equivalent of human white blood cells, as a means to investigate their function in reactions of the mosquito immune system. Our study identifies several novel regulators of immune reactions including phagocytosis, the engulfment and subsequent destruction of bacteria and other pathogens by hemocytes, the production of antimicrobial peptides, which directly kill or inhibit the proliferation of microbes, and the basal and induced production of an important complement regulator. Complement is a robust reaction of mosquitoes against malaria parasites and bacteria through phagocytosis, lysis or melanization (the enclosure of pathogens in a melanin capsule). We also reveal intriguing molecular connections between these reactions such as phagocytosis and regulation of complement. Our study provides novel insights into mosquito immune system and its reactions against infections.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> is a major vector of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria in sub-Saharan Africa and a secondary vector of other parasitic and viral diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-WHO1">[1]</xref>. Differences in vector susceptibility to malaria parasites are partly attributed to the ability of the mosquito immune system to fight infections. The developmental migration of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> within the mosquito hemolymph, the main carrier of the immune system, presents opportunities for the vector humoral and cellular immune reactions to attack the parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Christophides1">[2]</xref>. Key functions of mosquito hemolymph components include killing of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ookinetes as soon as they emerge from the midgut epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Yassine1">[3]</xref> and sporozoites before they invade the salivary glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Hillyer1">[4]</xref>. Numerous mosquito agonist and antagonist effectors of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and bacteria have been identified, principally by RNAi-mediated reverse genetic tests using dsRNA (double-stranded RNA) injections into adult mosquitoes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Blandin1">[5]</xref>. These factors operate in complex molecular networks that involve pathogen recognition by secreted or membrane bound receptors, activation of immune signaling pathways, and synthesis or activation of effectors that contribute to lysis, melanization or phagocytosis of the invading pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Christophides1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Christophides2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Waterhouse1">[7]</xref>. Importantly, many of these factors are produced by hemocytes and function in the hemolymph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Pinto1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Rodrigues1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Lavine1">[10]</xref>. Two hemocyte expression datasets have been reported recently, providing a comprehensive list of hemocyte-expressed genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Pinto1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Baton1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>An. gambiae</italic> cell lines have been used extensively to study mosquito immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Muller1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Dimopoulos1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Dimopoulos2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Meister1">[15]</xref>. Indeed, these cells are capable of accomplishing complex immune tasks that include phagocytosis of bacteria and beads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Levashina1">[16]</xref>, as well as expression of immune factors upon microbial challenge. It has been shown that IMD pathway activation in cell lines leads to robust expression of the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) gene <italic>Cecropin 1</italic> (<italic>CEC1</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Meister1">[15]</xref> and other immune factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Dimopoulos1">[13]</xref>. This pathway is activated when the transmembrane receptor PGRPLC binds peptidoglycan (PGN) and induces nuclear translocation of the REL2 transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Meister1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Cirimotich1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Meister2">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The development of high-throughput RNAi screens in cultured cells has been a major breakthrough in functional genomics of model organisms, in both basic and applied research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Cherry1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Echeverri1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Boutros1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Boutros2">[22]</xref>. Here we report the development and implementation of RNAi screens in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> cells to provide insights into the functional immune repertoire of mosquito circulating hemocytes. We have generated a dsRNA library targeting 109 genes specifically or predominantly expressed in circulating hemocytes and then optimized cell-based RNAi screens to investigate the role of these genes in phagocytosis of bacteria and transcriptional activation of immune-related genes. Our results identify novel regulators of the hemocyte immune responses and interactions with pathogens, including regulators of a complement-like pathway component that plays a key role in reactions to malaria parasites. This is a key milestone towards development of genome-wide RNAi screens in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> cells.</p>

        <p>We carried out viability screens to assess the levels of dsRNA toxicity as determined by the effect of gene silencing on fundamental housekeeping processes such as cell growth, proliferation and survival, which could hamper true identification of immune regulators. <italic>An. gambiae</italic> homologs of three genes previously shown to cause lethal or growth-defective RNAi phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Boutros2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Somma1">[27]</xref> were used as controls: inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (IAP1; AGAP007294), a ubiquitin-like/ribosomal fusion protein (AGAP008001; 2 different dsRNA fragments) and the Rho1 small GTPase (AGAP005160) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003145.s008">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003145.s012">Text S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Two protocols were implemented to assess cell growth and viability: (a) image acquisition and quantification by automated fluorescence microscopy, which is time-consuming and technically challenging but allows for more accurate and informative analysis; and (b) microplate reader fluorescence quantification, which is quicker and can accommodate large datasets but is less user-responsive.</p>
        <p>A subset of 37 dsRNAs was screened by automated fluorescence microscopy. Staining cells with Sytox green/Hoechst was used to assess the effect of dsRNAs on cell viability. Protocols in Volocity Improvision and ImageJ softwares were developed to capture images and quantify fluorescent cells, to determine the ratio of dead cells (Sytox green positive) over the entire cell population (Hoechst positive) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003145-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). ANOVA statistics followed by Bonferroni's post-test correction revealed that ds<italic>IAP1</italic> leads to a significant increase of cell mortality.

        <p>Next, we screened the entire collection of 111 dsRNAs using plate reader quantification in conjunction with a CellTiter-Blue Cell Viability assay. Data from three replicates were analyzed and z-score analysis was performed posing thresholds of +/−2 for at least two replicates out of three. Reproducibility among replicates was evaluated by correlation tests as shown in the plots in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003145.s004">Figure S3</xref>. Silencing the ubiquitin-like/ribosomal fusion protein gene <italic>AGAP008001</italic> led to significant decrease in cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003145-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003145.s004">Figure S3</xref>).

        <p>Phagocytosis is a highly effective and immediate response against microbial invaders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Blandin2">[28]</xref>.

We established a fast and reliable cell-based assay in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> cells using <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> bioparticles conjugated with pHrodo succinimidyl ester, a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, to investigate the potential role of genes in the hemocyte-enriched library in bacterial phagocytosis. The phagocytic activity of cells was determined as the increase of bioparticle fluorescence caused by the drop of pH in the acidified phagosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Miksa1">[32]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Bacterial bioparticles were added to the cells three days after incubation with dsRNA, and the capacity of cells to uptake bioparticles was assessed by fluorescence measurements using a microplate reader. Four time-points were assayed to take into account the kinetics of bioparticle uptake (1, 3, 6 and 24 h post-challenge). The measurements obtained were subtracted from basal level measurements (0 h, immediately after challenge). The entire dsRNA library was screened three times and z-score values for each of the dsRNA in each of the replicate screens were calculated. We considered positive dsRNA hits those with z-score values above 2 or below −2 in at least two out of the three replicates for each time point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003145.s005">Figure S4</xref> and Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003145.s009">Table S3</xref>). Because our library is strongly biased towards genes that are likely to play a role in immune reactions, the z-score method which compares the effect of each dsRNA with the average effect of all dsRNAs is a very strict condition. Therefore, we also analysed the data using ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test, thus comparing each dsRNA with the reference ds<italic>LacZ</italic> control. The results from both methods revealed a total of 13 positive dsRNA hits, 6 from the z-score and 11 from ANOVA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003145.s009">Table S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003145-g002">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Four dsRNAs showed significant effects on bioparticle uptake with both methods: 2 of them decreased phagocytosis (<italic>FBN8</italic> and <italic>AGAP000095</italic>) and 2 of them increased phagocytosis (<italic>AGAP006769</italic> and <italic>FBN9</italic>). <italic>Cactus</italic> dsRNA that was used as a positive control also led to a significant increase in phagocytosis of <italic>E. coli</italic> as soon as 1 h after challenge, in consistence with previous observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Moita1">[29]</xref>.</p>

        <p>We examined the 13 positive hits from the microplate reader analysis using automated fluorescence microscopy and a protocol for quantification of phagocytosed bioparticles developed in the ImageJ software. Bioparticle uptake was monitored 2 h and 20 h after challenge and compared to the ds<italic>LacZ</italic> control using ANOVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003145-g002">Figure 2C–D</xref>). An overall consistency was observed between the microplate reader and the microscopy analyses. Of the 13 dsRNAs, 6 showed the expected phenotype with statistical significance, 5 showed the expected phenotype but were not statistically significant, and 2 showed no difference with the ds<italic>LacZ</italic> control and/or a phenotype opposite to the expected, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003145-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As mentioned earlier, imaging analysis can provide additional, more detailed, information when compared to the microplate reader method, but it is technically more challenging and time consuming. The few discrepancies between these two approaches may be due to both technical and biological reasons, for example image analysis cannot quantify the amount of bioparticles in a single cell, while the microplate reader quantifies the intensity of fluorescence. Moreover, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003145-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, the distribution of fluorescent bioparticles is not uniform in the cell layer, and this introduces another variable when microscope images are captured and analyzed.</p>
        <p>Next, we investigated the silencing effect of 8 out of the 13 dsRNAs identified by the microplate reader method on bacterial phagocytosis <italic>in vivo</italic>. For this, we employed a protocol that was used in an earlier study, in which bacteria injected into the mosquito hemolymph spread rapidly into the cavity and are phagocytosed by hemocytes often found in clusters associated with the tracheal system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Moita1">[29]</xref>. We injected 2-day old mosquitoes with dsRNAs and 4 days later re-injected them with <italic>E. coli</italic> pHRodo-conjugated bioparticles. Mosquitoes were dissected 1 h after bioparticle injection, mounted onto glass slides and immediately observed by fluorescence microscopy. Pictures of different parts of the mosquito abdomens were captured and analyzed using a protocol developed in ImageJ to quantify the numbers of fluorescent particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003145-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The results revealed strong <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes similar to those of the cell-based analysis for 4 out of the 8 dsRNAs: AGAP000182, AGAP008492, AGAP004928 and AGAP002243, the last one corroborated by a significant statistical evaluation. Three dsRNAs (AGAP003879, FBN8 and AGAP006769) also showed similar albeit weaker phenotypes compared to the cell-based analysis and only one dsRNA (AGAP009459) did not confirm the expected phenotype.</p>

        <title>Novel regulators of phagocytosis</title>
        <p>Based on to the microplate reader analysis, the silencing of 7 genes led to a significant decrease of the cellular capacity to phagocytose <italic>E. coli</italic> bioparticles. Some of these genes were also confirmed with the microscopy and the <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis, as presented above. These genes encode: a protein of unknown function with a putative signal peptide and a peptidase domain (<italic>AGAP000182</italic>); a protein with a homodimerization BTB/POZ domain, ankyrin repeats and a zinc finger domain (<italic>AGAP002243</italic>); a putative transmembrane v-ATPase (<italic>AGAP003879</italic>); a membrane-bound protein with a zinc finger and a LITAF (LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha factor) domain putatively involved in immune signaling (<italic>AGAP004928</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Igaki1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Ponting1">[34]</xref>; the fibrinogen-domain FBN8 (also known as FREP57), previously shown to play a role in anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> defense (<italic>AGAP011223</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Dong1">[35]</xref>; a putative Calcium channel protein (<italic>AGAP000095)</italic>; and a three-transmembrane protein of unpredicted function (<italic>AGAP008500</italic>).</p>
        <p>Two of these proteins are likely to play a role in phagosome formation and maturation/acidification. The putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel protein (AGAP000095) may be involved in the cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> balance that is required for solubilization of the actin meshwork surrounding nascent phagosomes, fusion of phagosomes with granules containing lytic enzymes, or assembly and activation of the superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Nunes1">[36]</xref>.

        <p>In contrast, silencing 6 out of the 109 genes leads to a significant increase of <italic>E. coli</italic> phagocytosis. Proteins encoded by these genes represent potential novel negative regulators of bacterial recognition and phagosome assembly. These include: a secreted protein of unknown function that is strongly expressed in mosquito hemocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Pinto1">[8]</xref> and cultured cells following LPS or PGN challenge (<italic>AGAP006769</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Dimopoulos1">[13]</xref>; a putative tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase (<italic>AGAP009459</italic>) with homologs described in other mosquitoes (<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, <italic>AAEL008621</italic>, cell division protein kinase 1, cdk1; and <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>, <italic>CPIJ001155</italic>, cdk2) and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (CG5363, cdc2 cell division control protein); <italic>AGAP008492</italic> that does not exhibit similarity to any other genes and is regulated during immune challenges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Dimopoulos1">[13]</xref>; the ortholog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> laminin B1 chain (<italic>AGAP001381</italic>); and the fibrinogen-domain lectins FBN30/FREP8 and FBN9/FREP13 (<italic>AGAP006914</italic> and <italic>AGAP011197</italic>, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Dong1">[35]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The negative effect of <italic>AGAP009459</italic> silencing in bacterial phagocytosis is possibly related to defects in cytoskeleton regulation.

Our screen identified four genes that inhibit transcriptional activation of the <italic>LRIM1</italic> promoter following PGN challenge, as silencing <italic>AGAP009762</italic>, <italic>AGAP007499</italic>, <italic>AGAP003473</italic> and <italic>AGAP001964</italic> led to increased luciferase expression compared to PBS control. <italic>AGAP009762</italic> is highly expressed in circulating hemocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Pinto1">[8]</xref> and encodes a EGF-like domain protein with similarities to <italic>Drosophila</italic> phagocytosis receptors eater <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Kocks1">[56]</xref> and NimC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Kurucz1">[57]</xref> as well as to other members of the Nimrod superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Somogyi1">[58]</xref>. Interestingly, a screen for novel regulators of JNK following IMD pathway activation upon challenge with PGN in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, revealed that the ortholog of AGAP009762 caused an increased P-JNK protein expression, which, in turn, may act to modulate the expression of Relish-controlled effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Bond1">[59]</xref>.</p>
        <p><italic>AGAP007499</italic> encodes a chloride channel protein, orthologous to the human chloride channel 7. It is strongly expressed in circulating hemocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Pinto1">[8]</xref> and upregulated in mosquito cultured cells after hydrogen peroxide treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Dimopoulos1">[13]</xref>. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of <italic>AGAP007499</italic> is shown to play a role in the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathway; its silencing leads to increased MAPK phosphorylation following EGF stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Friedman1">[60]</xref>. It has been previously shown that MAPK ERK signaling plays a role in the mosquito immune response against malaria parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Surachetpong1">[61]</xref>. <italic>AGAP003473</italic> encodes a transmembrane protein with no significant similarity to known proteins. Finally, <italic>AGAP001964</italic> encodes a previously uncharacterized member of the clip-domain serine protease subfamily A (CLIPA) that lacks protease activity. Importantly, several CLIPAs show <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Volz1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Schnitger1">[63]</xref>, mostly by regulating the hemocyte-mediated melanization reaction. Since <italic>LRIM1</italic> is involved in malaria parasite melanization and lysis, as well as in bacterial phagocytosis, we hypothesize that the identified proteins function as negative regulators of these reactions some of which (e.g. melanization) are potentially costly to the host; thus <italic>LRIM1</italic> is induced only when these proteins are downregulated or presumably depleted during these reactions.</p>
        <p>Silencing <italic>AGAP001381</italic> had an opposite effect, reducing luciferase expression driven by the <italic>LRIM1</italic> promoter 7 h after challenge with PGN compared to mock PBS challenge. As mentioned previously, <italic>AGAP001381</italic> encodes the ortholog of the fruit fly Laminin B1 and its silencing also increases phagocytosis of <italic>E. coli</italic> bioparticles. These data conform to our hypothesis that a network of negative and positive regulators is involved in induction of <italic>LRIM1</italic> expression that follows infection. Intriguingly, silencing of Laminin B1 also resulted in a contrasting increase of the basal <italic>LRIM1</italic> promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003145-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting a dual role of laminin B1 in activating and suppressing <italic>LRIM1</italic> expression in the presence and absence of immune challenge, respectively.</p>
        <p>Two additional genes were identified as negative regulators of <italic>LRIM1</italic> basal expression: silencing of <italic>AGAP009119</italic> and <italic>AGAP002186</italic> led to a significant increase of luciferase expression driven by the <italic>LRIM1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003145-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). <italic>AGAP009119</italic> encodes a protein with tetratrico peptide structural repeats, involved in protein-protein interactions, and a heat shock chaperonin-binding motif, which is orthologous to the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Hsp70-interacting protein 2 (HIP-replacement). <italic>AGAP002186</italic> encodes a receptor of lipophorin (Lp), that is the insect equivalent of low-density lipoproteins and co-ortholog of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> LpR1 and LpR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Tufail1">[64]</xref>. In <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, Apolipoprotein I and II, the main components of Lp, have been shown to act antagonistically to TEP1-dependent malaria parasite killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Vlachou1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Mendes1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Rono1">[67]</xref>.

        <p>Reduction of the basal <italic>LRIM1</italic> promoter activity in cultured cells was detected only after silencing <italic>REL2</italic> compared to ds<italic>LacZ</italic>-treated control cells, consistent with an earlier study showing that REL2, as well as REL1, control basal <italic>LRIM1</italic> and <italic>TEP1</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Frolet1">[69]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Four membrane-bound or transmembrane proteins are implicated in <italic>E. coli</italic> phagocytosis, but none of them have domains that could indicate <italic>bona fide</italic> phagocytic receptors. Two of them, a putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel protein (<italic>AGAP000095</italic>) and a v-ATPase (<italic>AGAP003879</italic>) have predicted functions that point to their involvement in phagosome assembly and maturation. Of the remaining two membrane-bound or transmembrane proteins, <italic>AGAP004928</italic> has an LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha factor domain and could be involved in immune signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Igaki1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Ponting1">[34]</xref>.</p>
        <p>A very intriguing connection is revealed between phagocytosis and regulation of the basal and induced expression of LRIM1, a key component of the mosquito complement cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Povelones1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Fraiture1">[55]</xref> and a known facilitator of <italic>E. coli</italic> phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Moita1">[29]</xref>. The basement membrane protein Laminin B1 inhibits both phagocytosis and basal expression of LRIM1, but promotes LRIM1 expression after immune challenge. Therefore, Laminin B1 appears to play a dual role in maintaining the basal levels of complement in the hemolymph and in promoting production of complement components when needed or in preparation of potential reinfections. Whether this function of Laminin B1 is based on cell signaling and hemocyte differentiation, it remains to be investigated. Indeed, it has been suggested that immune priming of the mosquito hemolymph by gut bacteria following midgut invasion by malaria parasites causes hemocyte differentiation and attachment to the midgut basement membrane (basal lamina), which induces transient overexpression of LRIM1 and TEP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Rodrigues1">[9]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Indeed complement is a very important defense reaction of the mosquito hemolymph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Levashina1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Moita1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Blandin3">[70]</xref>. Upon TEP1 maturation cleavage, TEP1<sub>cut</sub> binds to the LRIM1/APL1C complex, where it remains in an active soluble state until an infection occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Povelones1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Fraiture1">[55]</xref>. However, the last steps of TEP1 binding on the pathogen surface remain unknown. Rono and co-workers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003145-Rono1">[67]</xref> have recently suggested that the observed antagonistic effect of Lp (and Vitellogenin) on TEP1 binding on malaria parasites may be due to Lp masking or competing for TEP1 binding sites on the parasite surface, directly interacting with TEP1, or modifying the lipid composition of the parasite membrane. Our finding that the Lp receptor suppresses the basal expression of <italic>LRIM1</italic> provides additional insights into the mechanism underlying the effect of Lp on TEP1-mediated parasite killing. Further investigation of the roles of the Lp receptor, Laminin B1 and the additional regulators of LRIM1 expression identified in this screen will shed light into the regulatory mechanisms of mosquito complement and how these impact upon infections with malaria parasites.</p>
