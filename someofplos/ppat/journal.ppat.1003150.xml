      <abstract>
        <p>Influenza virus has the ability to evade host immune surveillance through rapid viral genetic drift and reassortment; therefore, it remains a continuous public health threat. The development of vaccines producing broadly reactive antibodies, as well as therapeutic strategies using human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs) with global reactivity, has been gathering great interest recently. Here, three hybridoma clones producing HuMAbs against influenza B virus, designated 5A7, 3A2 and 10C4, were prepared using peripheral lymphocytes from vaccinated volunteers, and were investigated for broad cross-reactive neutralizing activity. Of these HuMAbs, 3A2 and 10C4, which recognize the readily mutable 190-helix region near the receptor binding site in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, react only with the Yamagata lineage of influenza B virus. By contrast, HuMAb 5A7 broadly neutralizes influenza B strains that were isolated from 1985 to 2006, belonging to both Yamagata and Victoria lineages. Epitope mapping revealed that 5A7 recognizes 316G, 318C and 321W near the C terminal of HA1, a highly conserved region in influenza B virus. Indeed, no mutations in the amino acid residues of the epitope region were induced, even after the virus was passaged ten times in the presence of HuMAb 5A7. Moreover, 5A7 showed significant therapeutic efficacy in mice, even when it was administered 72 hours post-infection. These results indicate that 5A7 is a promising candidate for developing therapeutics, and provide insight for the development of a universal vaccine against influenza B virus.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Influenza virus is classified into types A, B and C. Influenza A virus is further divided into many subtypes, all of which exist in animals, indicating pandemic potential. By contrast, influenza B virus circulates almost exclusively in humans and, as there is no evidence for reassortment with influenza A virus, there is no indication of pandemic potential. Hence, there is far less accumulated research information regarding influenza B virus than influenza A virus. Influenza B virus, which is classified into two phylogenetic lineages, does, however, cause annual epidemics in humans and is therefore as essential to control as influenza A virus. Recently, the development of a universal vaccine and therapeutic strategies using human monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs) has been gathering great interest. The present study reports a HuMAb neutralizing a wide range of influenza B viruses of both lineages. This HuMAb recognizes the conserved region of hemagglutinin. Moreover, therapeutic efficacy of this HuMAb was also confirmed by <italic>in vivo</italic> animal experiments. Thus, this study provides insight for the development of broad-spectrum therapeutics and a universal prophylactic vaccine against influenza B virus.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Influenza virus remains a constant public health threat. During annual epidemics 5â15% of the worldwide population are typically infected, resulting in 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and between 250,000 to 500,000 deaths per year <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Lambert1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-WHO1">[2]</xref>. While all age groups are affected by the disease, most influenza-related hospitalizations in industrialized countries occur in young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Carrat1">[3]</xref>. Like H1 and H3 subtypes of influenza A virus, influenza B virus also causes epidemics in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-WHO1">[2]</xref>. In contrast to influenza A virus, influenza B virus is found almost exclusively in humans and has a much slower mutational rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Carrat1">[3]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Webster1">[5]</xref>. However, cocirculation of two phylogenetically and antigenically distinct lineages, represented by B/Yamagata/16/1988 and B/Victoria/2/1987, has caused antigenic variation through genetic reassortment and antigenic drift from cumulative mutations, leading to annual epidemics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Hay1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Lin1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Currently, two main countermeasures, vaccines and antiviral drugs, are used against influenza virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Sym1">[8]</xref>. Vaccination has been the mainstay of infection control. However, the protection afforded by vaccination varies widely, depending on the antigenic match between the viral strains in the vaccine and those that are circulating during a given influenza season, as well as on the recipient's age and health status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Lambert1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Carrat1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Belshe1">[9]</xref>. Neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza), and matrix 2 (M2) ion channel inhibitors like amantadine, have been widely used for the treatment of influenza viral infection and are proven to be quite effective against susceptible strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Nicholson1">[10]</xref>. However, they have limited efficacy in delayed administration after the onset of illness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Aoki1">[11]</xref>, and widespread use has resulted in the emergence of resistant viral strains, as seen in H1N1 and H3N2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Kiso1">[12]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Suzuki1">[15]</xref>. Of note, M2 blockers are not active against influenza B virus as it has no equivalent to the M2 ion channel protein of influenza A virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Jing1">[16]</xref>. Thus, the development of therapeutic approaches and vaccine design that provide potent and broadly cross-protective host immunity are a global public health priority <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Marasco1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Human monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs) prepared from vaccinated donors and patients with viral infections could have potential therapeutic application, and provide significant information on human epitopes that could be important for developing the next generation of universal vaccines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-CampasMoya1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Cheson1">[19]</xref>. In addition to classical hybridoma methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Shirahata1">[20]</xref>, recent advances in technology, such as transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Lonberg1">[21]</xref> and yeast or phage display <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Clackson1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-McCafferty1">[23]</xref>, have renewed interest in the development of HuMAbs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Marasco1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Jin1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Nelson1">[25]</xref>. Thus, using phage display or single cell culture methods, several HuMAbs with broad neutralizing activities have been identified against the hemagglutinin (HA) protein in influenza A viruses, including C6261 and F10 which react with group 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Ekiert1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Sui1">[27]</xref>, and CR8020 which reacts with group 2 viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Ekiert2">[28]</xref>. Another HuMAb, FI6v3, that neutralizes both group 1 and group 2 influenza A viruses, has also recently been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Corti1">[29]</xref>. For influenza B virus, by contrast, broadly neutralizing HuMAbs, CR8033, CR8071 and CR9114, have firstly reported on September 2012 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Dreyfus1">[30]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A hybridoma method for establishing HuMAbs was developed previously in this laboratory by fusion of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of influenza-vaccinated healthy volunteers with the fusion partner cell line SPYMEG, which has been optimized for higher reliability of cell fusion by overcoming chromosome deletion problem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-KubotaKoketsu1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-MBL1">[32]</xref>. In this study, three HuMAbs that neutralize influenza B virus were prepared using this method. One of the three HuMAbs, 5A7, reacted broadly with influenza B virus isolates from 1985 to 2006 that belong to both the Yamagata and Victoria lineages, and recognized a highly conserved region in the HA protein. Moreover, 5A7 showed therapeutic efficacy even in mice treated with the HuMAb 72 hours post-infection. These results indicate that 5A7 is a promising candidate for developing therapeutics and will provide insight for the development of the next generation of vaccines universally effective against influenza B virus.</p>

        <title>Preparation of anti-influenza B HuMAbs</title>
        <p>Healthy volunteers were vaccinated with the trivalent HA split vaccine including A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2), and B/Florida/4/2006 strains. Then, 1â2 weeks later, the vaccine-derived PBMCs were fused with SPYMEG cells. After screening for MAb specificity to influenza viruses, the cells in the specific MAb-positive wells were cloned by limiting dilution. Ultimately, three hybridoma clones producing HuMAbs, designated 5A7, 3A2 and 10C4, were established against influenza B virus. These HuMAbs did not react with influenza A virus. HuMAb reactivity was tested by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and western blotting using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells infected with B/Florida/4/2006, homologous with the vaccine antigen. All three HuMAbs reacted with HA protein expressed by transfection into 293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003150.s006">Table S1</xref>).

        <p>Next, the three HuMAbs were evaluated for their ability to neutralize influenza B viruses by <italic>in vitro</italic> virus neutralization (VN) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003150-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The VN test was carried out on MDCK cells infected with influenza B virus under the treatment with serial four-fold dilutions of HuMAbs. The viruses used were B/Florida/4/2006, B/Shanghai/361/2002, B/Johannesburg/5/1999, B/Yamanashi/166/1998 and B/Mie/1/1993 for the Yamagata lineage, and B/Malaysia/2506/2004, B/Shandong/7/1997 and B/Victoria/2/1987 for the Victoria lineage. The mouse-adapted B/Ibaraki/2/1985 in the Victoria lineage, used in the passive transfer experiment described below, was also subjected to VN assay. HuMAb 5A7 showed a lower neutralizing activity compared with 3A2 and 10C4 against the Yamagata lineage; however, 5A7 neutralized all strains in the Yamagata and Victoria lineages that were isolated during 1985 to 2006. HuMAbs 3A2 and 10C4 neutralized the Yamagata lineage effectively, whereas they had little neutralization effect on all the Victoria lineage viruses. An anti-dengue virus HuMAb (D23-1B3B9) derived from PBMCs of a patient infected with dengue virus serotype 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Setthapramote1">[33]</xref> was used as a control IgG.

        <p>To clarify the mechanism of neutralization by the three HuMAbs, hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) and fusion inhibition assays were performed. All three HuMAbs had HI activity; 3A2 and 10C4 showed markedly higher HI titers (0.39 Âµg/ml) than 5A7 (25.0 Âµg/ml). Fusion inhibition assay showed that they all had the ability to inhibit cell-cell fusion; the concentration of HuMAb necessary for complete inhibition was lower for 3A2 and 10C4 (25 Âµg/ml) than 5A7 (100 Âµg/ml) at pH 5.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003150.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

        <p>In addition, HuMAbs 5A7, 3A2 and 10C4 were subjected to surface plasmon resonance analysis to examine their binding affinities.

        <title>Epitope mapping of three HuMAbs</title>
        <p>Next, the epitope regions recognized by the three HuMAbs were determined. At first, escape mutants were selected by culturing B/Florida/4/2006 in the presence of serial ten-fold diluted HuMAb. MDCK cells were infected with the mixture in a 24-well plate and 72 hours later the supernatants were subjected to VN and HI assays, and direct sequencing analysis of the HA gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003150.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Escape mutants were not established for 5A7, even after the virus was serially passaged 10 times in the presence of this HuMAb. 5A7 reacted with the HA protein by western blotting under reducing conditions. Therefore, the region of 5A7 involved in recognition was refined using HA truncation vectors containing HA segments of varying length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003150-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Western blotting with 5A7 was carried out on 293T cells transfected with the truncated HA expression vectors. HuMAb 5A7 reacted with truncated HA segments that included amino acid residues 1â324 but not with those with residues 1â314 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003150-g003">Figure 3A</xref>): amino acid numbering was started after the signal peptide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Wang1">[34]</xref>. These results indicate that 5A7 recognizes amino acid residues between 315 to 324 (IGNCPIWVKT) in the HA protein, which locates near the C terminal of the HA1 protein. The epitope region of 5A7 was determined by mutating each of the 315â324 amino acid residues singly. Each residue was replaced by alanine using a site-directed mutagenesis method. Mutant HAs expressed in 293T cells were tested for reactivity with 5A7 by IFA. Mutants G316A, C318A and W321A did not react with 5A7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003150-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating that 316G, 318C and 321W amino acids critically affected the structure of the epitope of 5A7. To estimate the conservation of the amino acid sequences in the epitope of 5A7, HA sequences of influenza B virus were extracted from the NCBI database. Notably, 2,851 among 2,853 viral sequences (99.93%) showed an identical amino acid sequence in the epitope region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003150.s007">Table S2</xref>).

        <p>By contrast, escape mutants were obtained in the presence of 3A2 and 10C4. They showed four-fold reduced VN and HI activities compared with the parent virus after just one passage of the virus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003150.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Each escape mutant obtained in the presence of 3A2 and 10C4 had amino acid substitutions at identical positions, 194D and 196T (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003150.s004">Figure S4</xref>), both located in the readily mutable 190-helix antigenic site near the receptor binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Wang1">[34]</xref>. In addition, the different amino acid residues in V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> of 3A2 and 10C4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003150-g001">Figure 1</xref>) indicated that these two HuMAbs were derived from different germ lines. These results are consistent with 3A2 and 10C4 reactivity with only the Yamagata strains, since Yamagata and Victoria strains differ in amino acid sequence at this position. HuMAb 3A2 showed low reactivity against B/Shanghai/361/2002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003150-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and was therefore examined for an additional distinct epitope region. To do this, various chimeric sequences of HA were constructed from B/Florida/4/2006 and B/Shanghai/361/2002, which differ at seven residues (positions 37, 40, 88, 131, 227, 249 and 456), expressed in plasmids, and transfected into 293T cells. IFA of the chimeric HA proteins expressed in 293T cells showed that 131P and 227S were essential for reaction with 3A2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003150.s005">Figure S5</xref>). These results indicate that the epitope of 3A2 is dependent on residues at positions 131, 194, 196 and 227, and the epitope of 10C4 is dependent on residues at positions 194 and 196.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>A broadly neutralizing HuMAb, 5A7, was established using PBMC from a vaccinated healthy volunteer. This antibody neutralizes influenza B virus strains isolated between 1985 and 2006 that belong to the Yamagata or Victoria lineage. Moreover, therapeutic efficacy was shown in mice even when the HuMAb was administered 48 or 72 hours after viral challenge. As previously reported for almost all MAbs broadly neutralizing influenza virus, 5A7 recognized the stalk region of the HA protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Ekiert1">[26]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Corti1">[29]</xref>. Importantly, the epitope region recognized by 5A7 is highly conserved in influenza B virus and the divergent strains occur only sparsely (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003150.s007">Table S2</xref>). Although influenza B virus has a much slower mutational rate than that observed for influenza A subtypes like H1 and H3, cocirculation of two phylogenetically and antigenically distinct lineages of influenza B virus leads to annual epidemics in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Hay1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Lin1">[7]</xref>. Dreyfus <italic>et al.</italic> first reported broadly neutralizing HuMAbs against influenza B virus in September 2012 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Dreyfus1">[30]</xref>. The epitope regions they identified were distinct from that of our HuMAb, 5A7. Characterization of the epitope region recognized by such a HuMAb could therefore provide insight for the development of a universal vaccine.</p>
      <p>The high degree of conservation of amino acid residues in the epitope region implies that influenza B virus would not easily induce mutation in this region. Indeed, amino acid residues in the epitope region did not mutate even when the virus was passaged ten times under 5A7-treatment conditions. It could be considered that the poor inhibitory activity of 5A7 (weak HI, fusion inhibition and VN<sub>50</sub>) is the cause of failure to establish escape mutants. However, a previous report showed that escape mutants could be prepared even from an MAb with weak fusion inhibition and complete neutralizing activities (25 and 50 Âµg/ml, respectively), and without HI activity, in order to map its epitope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Okuno1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Okuno2">[36]</xref>. Since 5A7 shows similarly weak activity, we would also expect to have been able to prepare 5A7 escape mutants and determine the epitope region. Failure to establish escape mutants in the presence of 5A7 could be an advantage for its development as a therapeutic tool, and also for designing the next generation of globally effective vaccines.</p>
      <p>Generally, MAbs recognizing the globular head show strong HI activity, whereas those against the stalk region usually show none <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Okuno1">[35]</xref>. Thus, it is considered that MAbs against the globular head inhibit the receptor binding step, while MAbs against the stalk region inhibit the fusion step, in viral replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Ekiert1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Knossow1">[37]</xref>. In fact, HuMAbs, 3A2 and 10C4, that recognize the 190-helix in the globular head near the receptor binding site, showed strong HI activity, which suggests that they can inhibit viral binding to the receptor on the host cells. Their ability to inhibit the fusion process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003150.s001">Figure S1</xref>) implies that they could secondarily disturb the low pH-dependent structural change in HA by binding to the globular head. Surprisingly, although 5A7 reacted to the stalk region it also showed specific and weak HI activity. This suggests that MAb recognizing the stalk region distal from the viral membrane could affect the ability of the virus to bind to the receptor. As reported for MAbs reacting to the stalk region, 5A7 also showed specific fusion inhibition activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Ekiert2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Wang2">[38]</xref>. These results suggest that HuMAb 5A7 could inhibit viral entry by preventing receptor binding, and the subsequent fusion process.</p>
      <p>Previous reports show that the concentration of MAbs necessary for viral neutralization was much higher for those recognizing the stalk region of the envelope protein than for those reacting with the globular head in influenza viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Ekiert2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Okuno2">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Yoshida1">[39]</xref>, as well as other viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Chakrabarti1">[40]</xref>. In agreement with these reports, the concentration required for viral neutralization in this study was higher for 5A7 than 3A2 and 10C4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003150-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Such results can be explained by either a difference in binding affinity or in physical accessibility of HuMAbs to the epitope region. 5A7 showed similar K<sub>D</sub> with 10C4 in binding kinetics analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003150-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003150.s002">Figure S2</xref>), indicating that 5A7 has more difficulty physically accessing the epitope region of the HA protein. Modifying the HuMAb structure to enable easier access to the epitope region and improving its binding affinity, as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Casipit1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Chames1">[42]</xref>, could lead to the development of better therapeutic HuMAbs for influenza.</p>
      <p>HuMAb 5A7 had specific therapeutic efficacy in mice even when administered after viral challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003150-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Two independent passive transfer experiments were performed. Surprisingly, in both experiments, mice treated with 5A7 HuMAb 72 hours post-infection had a better survival rate than those treated 48 hours post-infection. It is reported that in the first 24 hours after infection, the levels of lymphocyte apoptosis increase transiently in both nasal-associated lymphoid tissue and spleen, and cellular immune suppression occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Petukhova1">[43]</xref>. Temporal cellular immune suppression or infection-mediated endogenous signals could therefore interfere with the efficacy of exogenous HuMAb. These results imply that the timing of HuMAb treatment could be critical for efficacy, and therefore, injection at several time points may be necessary.</p>
      <p>Mouse-adapted B/Ibaraki/2/1985 was used to examine the kinetics of survival rate and body weight change in passive transfer experiments because other viral strains are not lethal to mice, even if passaged several times <italic>in vivo</italic>. HuMAb 5A7 protected mice against mouse-adapted B/Ibaraki/2/1985 viral challenge although 5A7 was obtained from a volunteer vaccinated with B/Florida/4/2006 and had shown the lowest sensitivity to this viral strain <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003150-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These results suggested that 5A7 would have therapeutic efficacy against a wide spectrum of influenza B viruses and, in fact, lung viral titers of both mouse-adapted B/Ibaraki/2/1985 and B/Florida/4/2006 were reduced significantly under 5A7-treatment conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003150-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Further study using both mice and ferrets with several viral strains is needed to confirm the wide-ranging therapeutic potential of 5A7 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

Before infection, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of pentobarbital sodium (Somnopentyl; Kyoritsu Seiyaku Corporation). MLD<sub>50</sub> was determined by inoculating intranasally with serial 10-fold dilutions of virus and calculating with the Reed-Muench method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003150-Ozanne1">[52]</xref>. For passive transfer experiments, mice were treated with HuMAb at 1, 5, 10 or 15 mg/kg intraperitoneally at 4, 24, 48 or 72 hours post-infection with 25 Âµl mouse-adapted B/Ibaraki/2/1985 virus at a lethal dose (1.47Ã10<sup>3</sup> MLD<sub>50</sub>/mouse). Mice were weighed daily and sacrificed if they fell to 60% of starting weight. To titrate the viruses in the infected lungs, mouse-adapted B/Ibaraki/2/1985 or B/Florida/4/2006 passaged eight times in mice lungs were infected at 1.47Ã10<sup>3</sup> MLD<sub>50</sub>/mouse or 5.0Ã10<sup>3</sup> FFU/mouse, respectively. The lungs were harvested on day 3 and day 6 post-infection and virus titers in lung homogenates were determined by focus-forming assay.</p>

          <p><bold>Diagram showing how the escape mutants were obtained.</bold> Four HuMAb concentrations prepared by serial ten-fold dilutions (right lower diagram) were mixed with B/Florida/4/2006 for 1 hour. Then, each mixture was used to infect MDCK cells in six wells (i.e., four groups of six wells) and incubated for 72 hours (for details, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and methods</xref>). Groups were graded according to cytopathic effects: all six wells showing no cytopathic effects (white), some wells showing cytopathic effects (gray), and all wells showing cytopathic effects (black). Supernatants from wells colored gray were collected separately and measured for VN and HI activities. When a four-fold reduction in VN and HI assays was not shown by any of supernatants, one sample was mixed with HuMAbs serially 10-fold diluted described above and infected to newly prepared MDCK cells. P1 to P10 indicates passage number. Out of 12 gray wells, two wells for 3A2 and one well for 10C4 (colored red) showed a four-fold reduction in VN and HI activities compared with the parent virus. Gray wells at P10 of 5A7 and gray and red wells at P1 of 3A2 and 10C4 were subjected to direct sequencing analysis of the HA gene.</p>
