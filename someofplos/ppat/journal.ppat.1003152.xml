      <abstract>
        <p>Acute pyelonephritis (APN), which is mainly caused by uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (UPEC), is the most common bacterial complication in renal transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive treatment. However, it remains unclear how immunosuppressive drugs, such as the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA), decrease renal resistance to UPEC. Here, we investigated the effects of CsA in host defense against UPEC in an experimental model of APN. We show that CsA-treated mice exhibit impaired production of the chemoattractant chemokines CXCL2 and CXCL1, decreased intrarenal recruitment of neutrophils, and greater susceptibility to UPEC than vehicle-treated mice. Strikingly, renal expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (Nod1), neutrophil migration capacity, and phagocytic killing of <italic>E. coli</italic> were significantly reduced in CsA-treated mice. CsA inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced, Tlr4-mediated production of CXCL2 by epithelial collecting duct cells. In addition, CsA markedly inhibited Nod1 expression in neutrophils, macrophages, and renal dendritic cells. CsA, acting through inhibition of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFATs), also markedly downregulated Nod1 in neutrophils and macrophages. Silencing the NFATc1 isoform mRNA, similar to CsA, downregulated Nod1 expression in macrophages, and administration of the 11R-VIVIT peptide inhibitor of NFATs to mice also reduced neutrophil bacterial phagocytosis and renal resistance to UPEC. Conversely, synthetic Nod1 stimulating agonists given to CsA-treated mice significantly increased renal resistance to UPEC. Renal transplant recipients receiving CsA exhibited similar decrease in NOD1 expression and neutrophil phagocytosis of <italic>E. coli</italic>. The findings suggest that such mechanism of NFATc1-dependent inhibition of Nod1-mediated innate immune response together with the decrease in Tlr4-mediated production of chemoattractant chemokines caused by CsA may contribute to sensitizing kidney grafts to APN.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Patients who have received a kidney graft are treated with immunosuppressive drugs, such as the cyclosporine A (CsA). Transplanted patients under CsA are prone to bacterial infections. In this study, we used an experimental mouse model of kidney infection with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) bacteria to study the effect of CsA. We show that CsA treatment of mice reduced their renal defense against <italic>E. coli</italic>. We found that CsA, in addition to its inhibitory action on the TLR4-mediated production of chemoattractant chemokines, also inhibited the expression of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (Nod1), an intracellular receptor involved in the innate immune response against bacteria, in phagocytic cells. CsA acts by inhibiting the functions of the transcription factor NFAT. We show that NFAT is required for the proper expression of Nod1. Since Nod1 has already been reported to be involved in the phagocytic functions of polymorphonuclear neutrophils, we looked for and found a severe defect in neutrophil bacterial killing associated with reduced expression of Nod1 in both mice and patients treated by CsA. Interestingly, when mice treated with CsA are given synthetic molecules known to bind Nod1, this permitted the restoration of the Nod1 expression and renal defenses. This paper describes a novel mechanism which may explain, at least in part, why transplant patients receiving CsA have increased susceptibility to bacterial infection, and also provides a potential therapeutic strategy to restore renal antibacterial defenses.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Urinary tract infection (UTI) often complicated by acute pyelonephritis (APN), which is mainly caused by uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (UPEC), is the most frequent infectious complication following renal transplantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Schmaldienst1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-deSouza1">[2]</xref>. Despite improvement of the surgical procedures and the use of post-operative antibiotic prophylaxis, the rates of post-graft APN still remain higher than in the normal population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-deSouza1">[2]</xref>, and late UTI occurring after more than 6 months after transplantation are associated with increased risk of death, and post-graft APN may also compromise long-term graft outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Abbott1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Pelle1">[4]</xref>. Although many factors including age, sex, and co-morbidity conditions play a role in the susceptibility to infection, long-term immunosuppressive therapy used to prevent episodes of acute graft rejection obviously increases the risk of bacterial, viral or fungal infections in the context of transplantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Snydman1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Fishman1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Calcineurin inhibitors, such as Cyclosporine A (CsA), are almost incontrovertible drugs widely used to prevent renal graft rejection. Their main function is to inhibit the phosphatase activity of calcineurin, which regulates the nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFATs) transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Hogan1">[7]</xref>. Impaired activation of NFATs then prevents the transcription of cytokine genes, including IL-2, in activated T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Northrop1">[8]</xref>. However, the mechanism(s) by which CsA could alter the innate immune system, and thereby decrease renal host defenses against ascending UPEC remain largely unknown.</p>
      <p>Early recognition of bacterial motifs by a number of pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and (Nod)-like receptors (NLRs), is essential for the removal of bacterial pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Takeuchi1">[9]</xref>. UPEC colonizing the urinary tract are recognized by several TLRs, including TLR2, 4, 5, and 11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Song1">[10]</xref>. Studies using experimental murine models of ascending UTI have demonstrated that Tlr4, which senses lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Song1">[10]</xref>, and also Tlr11, that is expressed in murine bladder epithelial cells and RTECs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Zhang1">[11]</xref>, regulate susceptibility to UTIs in mice. TLRs play key roles in activating the transcription factor NF-κB and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathways leading to the production of chemoattractant cytokines and subsequent recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages for efficient clearance of the bacteria. Nod1 and Nod2 also promote the activation of NF-κB and MAPKs through the recruitment of the kinase RIP-2 (also known as RIP2K or RICK), which is a member of the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) protein family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Girardin1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Kobayashi1">[13]</xref>.

The functions of Nod1, which is more ubiquitously expressed, differ somewhat from those of Nod2.

      <p>In the present study, we used an experimental mouse model of ascending UTI and show that the administration of CsA to wild-type (WT) mice decreases renal resistance to UPEC infection. CsA impaired Tlr4-mediated activation and subsequent production of chemoattractant chemokines in the epithelial collecting duct cells, to which UPEC bind preferentially during their retrograde ascent along the urinary tract system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Chassin1">[23]</xref>. In addition, CsA, through its inhibitory action on NFATs, also markedly inhibited the functional expression of Nod1 in phagocytic cells, including neutrophil migration capacity and phagocytic killing of UPEC. Similar to CsA-treated WT mice, <italic>Nod1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice exhibited greater susceptibility to UPEC than their WT counterparts. Using 11R-VIVIT, a synthetic peptide inhibitor of NFATs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Noguchi1">[24]</xref>, we also demonstrate <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> the relevance of the regulatory role of the NFATc1 isoform in controlling the Nod1-mediated renal susceptibility to UPEC. We also report the functional downexpression of human NOD1 and decreased phagocytic capacity of <italic>E. coli</italic> in leukocytes from renal transplant recipients treated with CsA. The combined inhibitory effects of CsA on Tlr4-mediated chemokine production and Nod1-mediated migration of neutrophils and bacterial phagocytic capacities, which contribute to decrease renal antibacterial defenses in mice, may explain, at least in part, the susceptibility of CsA-treated renal transplant recipients to bacterial infections.</p>

However, the small number of purified renal CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells obtained did not permit reliable Western blot analysis of the Nod1 protein. Consistent with an inhibitory action of CsA on Nod1, the production of CCL5, which has been shown to be highly sensitive to Nod agonist stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Werts1">[40]</xref>, when stimulated by the Nod1 agonist FK156 was significantly lower in CsA-treated than in untreated neutrophils and macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003152-g005">Figure 5C and F</xref>). CsA only slightly, and non-significantly, reduced the FK156-stimulated production of CCL5 in renal DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003152-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). Given that CXCL2 plays an essential role in the recruitment of neutrophils, we went on to test the effects of CsA on CXCL2 production in neutrophils, macrophages, and renal DCs. Unlike renal MCD cells, CsA only slightly reduced the CXCL2 production stimulated by LPS in neutrophils, macrophages, and renal DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003152-g005">Figure 5C, F and H</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In the present work, we show that in mice, CsA reduces renal resistance to the retrograde inoculation of uropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic>. CsA induces a significant decrease in the production of the chemoattractant chemokines and impairs the recruitment of neutrophils in kidneys from mice infected by UPEC. The primary source (i.e. the epithelial tubule cells or circulating immune cells) of pro-inflammatory mediators produced in experimental models of UTI remains discussed. In accordance with a number of previous studies, medullary collecting duct epithelial cells, which are the first renal tubule cells to come into contact with UPEC during their retrograde ascent, produce substantial amounts of TLR4-mediated CXCL2, which play a key role in the recruitment of neutrophils in the infected kidneys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Chassin1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Haraoka1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Godaly1">[47]</xref>. The fact that CsA impairs LPS-induced production of CXCL2 in renal MCD cells and LPS-induced recruitment of neutrophils, further suggests that the Tlr4-mediated activation of renal epithelial cells contributes to the recruitment of neutrophils in the infected kidneys, at least during the initial phase of infection. Nor can we exclude the possibility that the decrease in <italic>Tlr4</italic> mRNA expression detected in the infected kidneys and in the Tlr4-mediated cell activation detected in murine MCD cells, are due, at least in part, to the cytotoxic action of calcineurin inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Kopp1">[48]</xref>. In contrast, CsA had no <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibitory effect on <italic>Tlr4</italic> expression in neutrophils, macrophages, or renal DCs. After being bound to renal collecting duct cells, UPEC induces the rapid recruitment of neutrophils (during the first 6 h), followed by the recruitment of monocytes/macrophages over the next 12–24 h. Although LPS stimulates the <italic>in vitro</italic> production of CXCL2 by neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes/macrophages, these cells do not seem to play major roles in the renal production of chemoattractant chemokines during UPEC infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Tittel1">[38]</xref>. Recently, resident renal DCs have been shown to be major source of CXCL2 production, compared to neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, 20 h following the retrograde inoculation of UPEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Tittel1">[38]</xref>. Furthermore, the migration capacity of neutrophils has been reported to be significantly lower in UPEC-infected CD11c deficient mice than in their WT counterparts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Tittel1">[38]</xref>, indicating that CXCL2 production by renal DCs certainly plays some role in the chemoattraction of neutrophils. Here we show that CsA altered <italic>Nod1</italic> mRNA expression in renal DCs, without impairing <italic>Tlr4</italic> mRNA expression and the number of renal DCs in the infected kidneys. Although <italic>in vitro</italic> incubation of renal DCs with CsA did not have much effect on the <italic>in vitro</italic> LPS-induced CXCL2 production, we cannot exclude any <italic>in vivo</italic> participation of renal DCs in the defective migration capacity of neutrophils within infected kidneys from CsA-treated mice.</p>
      <p>The present study demonstrated an unexpected effect of CsA on Nod1-mediated neutrophils migration capacity and bacterial phagocytosis. We show both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> that CsA impairs Nod1 expression in neutrophils and macrophages. The stimulation of Nod1 by Nod1 stimulating agonist or bacteria was shown to play a role in the recruitment of neutrophils in the intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Masumoto1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Hasegawa1">[49]</xref>, and that the number of infiltrating neutrophils was shown to be significantly reduced in injured livers from <italic>Nod1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice challenged with carbon tetrachloride <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Dharancy1">[30]</xref>. We also detected defective recruitment of neutrophils in kidneys from <italic>Nod1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice infected by UPEC, and in infected kidneys of WT mice treated with CsA. Given that CsA, which affects TLR4-mediated CXCL2 production in MCD cells and alters the expression of <italic>Nod1</italic> in neutrophils, macrophages, and also renal DCs, these findings suggest that, in addition to impairing the epithelial TLR4-mediated production of chemoattractant chemokines, CsA may also alter the Nod1-mediated capacity of neutrophils to migrate in kidneys infected with UPEC.</p>
      <p>Recent studies have highlighted the role of NFAT/calcineurin signaling pathways in controlling innate immunity and in regulating homeostasis of immune cells. Calcineurin/NFATs signaling was shown to negatively regulate myeloid lineage development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Fric1">[50]</xref>. The susceptibility to fungal infection caused by CsA was also shown to be the consequence of NFAT-dependent inhibition of an immune innate pathway regulating antifungal resistance in neutrophils. Indeed, Greenblatt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Greenblatt1">[42]</xref> reported that the neutrophils of both calcineurin-deficient mice and CsA-treated mice exhibited a defective ability to kill <italic>Candida albicans</italic> without any noticeable changes in the classical fungicidal activity of neutrophils. These authors showed that calcineurin regulates the ability of neutrophils to kill <italic>C. albicans via</italic> another anti-microbial pathway, which involves the C-type lectin-like receptor dectin-1 and IL-10 production. Given that Nod1 and Nod2 are not directly involved in the recognition of <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Gow1">[51]</xref>, these findings suggest that CsA may affect NFATs-dependent cellular signaling activated by Gram-negative bacteria or fungi in different ways. The NFATc3/c4 isoforms were also shown to be required for TLR-induced innate inflammatory response in monocytes/macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Minematsu1">[52]</xref>. Our results strongly suggest that NFATc1 controls Nod1 at the transcriptional level. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis (<italic>Genomatix</italic> Software GmbH) has identified putative NFAT binding sites in human and murine Nod1 and Nod2 promoter regions. Downexpression of NFATc1 inhibited Nod1 more efficiently than Nod2. However, the <italic>in silico</italic> analysis did not permit us to predict differences in the number of putative binding sites for NFATc1 on the promoter regions of Nod1 and/or Nod2. We have no direct explanation for the preferential inhibitory effect of silencing NFATc1 on Nod1 expression. The fact that much less Nod1 than Nod2 is present in immune cells may account, at least in part, for the greater reduction in <italic>Nod1</italic> mRNA expression induced by <italic>NFATc1</italic> silencing. Nevertheless our findings strongly suggest that CsA, through NFATc1 inhibition, alters Nod1-mediated phagocytic functions. In agreement with this, inhibition of the calcineurin phosphatase activity has been reported to decrease phagocytosis in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Yamaguchi1">[53]</xref>, further suggesting that NFATc1 is essential for proper activation of the phagocytosis process. Collectively, these findings indicate that NFATs, which play key roles in adaptive T cell functions, are critical cellular mediators of the innate immune responses.</p>
      <p>Although the present findings indicate that CsA directly alters Nod1 expression, it may also affect other immune receptors and downstream signaling pathways in various different ways. Calcineurin serine threonine phosphatase downregulates TLR-mediated signaling pathways in macrophages, whereas CsA and its newer counterpart Tacrolimus have been shown to activate NF-κB and induce cytokine expression in inactivated macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Kang1">[54]</xref>. It has been also reported that the activation of DCs and macrophages by Tacrolimus can induce a state of reduced responsiveness to LPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Jennings1">[55]</xref>, similar to the LPS-induced transient state of tolerance observed following a subsequent LPS challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Biswas1">[56]</xref>. During bacterial infection, it seems likely that various TLRs and NLRs are activated in response to the invading pathogen or to microbial components, such as LPS or PGN, released into the bloodstream and in the infected tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Hellman1">[57]</xref>. Moreover, the interplay between Nods and TLRs may be critical for the induction of protective immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Chamaillard1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Fritz1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Kim1">[59]</xref>. Therefore, it is conceivable that altered epithelial TLR4-mediated chemokine production caused by CsA, may potentiate the deleterious inhibitory effects of CsA on Nod1-mediated neutrophil functions, leading to a more pronounced decrease in host resistance to bacterial infection.</p>
      <p>Long-term use of immunosuppressive drugs, used to prevent graft rejection, increases the susceptibility of transplant recipients towards bacterial infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-deSouza1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Snydman1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Fishman1">[6]</xref>. Until recently, the impact of immunosuppressive therapy was considered to be largely non-specific. However, several groups of researchers have reported changes in the numbers and/or functions of circulating leukocytes, including polymorphonuclear neutrophils from transplant patients acquiring infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Hutchinson1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Blazik1">[22]</xref>. Moreover, it has already been suggested that abnormalities in neutrophil functions, including impaired migration capacity following fMLP stimulation, are indicators of sepsis in solid organ transplant recipients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Egger1">[60]</xref>. Neutrophils from renal transplant recipients have been reported to exhibit diminished phagocytic activity and reduce bactericidal activity against <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, compared to the activities seen with neutrophils from healthy subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Cuffini1">[61]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have also shown that CsA reduces both neutrophil phagocytosis capacity and ROS production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Thorat1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Roilides1">[63]</xref>. Analysis of a panel of blood leukocyte phenotypes and functions also revealed that transplant recipients (renal and renal/pancreas) most of whom were receiving CsA and subjected to infection exhibited a reduction in ROS production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Hutchinson1">[21]</xref>. In the present study, the investigations performed on renal transplant recipients have revealed downregulated expression of NOD1 in circulating leukocytes, similar to that found in CsA-treated mice. The low capacity for <italic>E. coli</italic> phagocytosis appears to be closely correlated with a low expression of NOD1 in the neutrophils of renal transplant recipients. Since Nod1<sup>−/−</sup> mice are more susceptible than WT to early <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> sepsis, and conversely, that PGN recognition by Nod1 enhances killing of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> by neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Lysenko1">[19]</xref>, it is conceivable that the observed downregulation of NOD1 caused by CsA may also impair the capacity of neutrophils from renal transplant recipients to kill Gram-positive bacteria. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the results from investigations performed in human renal transplant recipients could have been flawed by several confounding factors, such as the concomitant administration of several immunosuppressive drugs and some degree of renal impairment. The consistency with which CsA downregulated NOD1 strongly suggests that the impairment of NOD1-mediated bacterial phagocytic capacity caused by CsA may therefore represent an additional risk factor for the occurrence of UTI/APN in human transplant recipients. Despite antibiotic prophylaxis, the frequency of post-graft UTI/APN still remains relatively high, and increasing the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics may also increase the risk of recurrent episodes of UTI/APN. This raises the question of whether alternative therapeutic strategies could help to reduce the frequency of post-graft UTI/APN. A number of studies have provided convincing evidences that pre-treatment of mice with Nod agonists enhances host protection against sepsis, bacterial infection, viruses, or even parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Hancock1">[64]</xref>. Here we also show that administration of Nod1 agonists can restore efficient renal clearance of UPEC in CsA-treated mice. However, further studies will be required to find out whether the administration of synthetic Nod1 agonists alone or in combination with antibiotics could potentially help to reduce the occurrence of UTI/APN in renal grafts.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have identified a hitherto-unknown mechanism of the NFATc1-dependent inhibitory action of the Nod1-mediated innate immune response, which may affect host renal antibacterial defenses against invasive uropathogens, and possibly favor the emergence of bacterial infection in renal transplant recipients receiving long-term CsA treatment.</p>

Human blood samples (10 µl) were incubated in 500 µl RPMI culture medium (Invitrogen) at 37°C alone or with 1 ng/ml Pam3CSK4 (InvivoGen) or LPS, 1 µg/ml flagellin (InvivoGen); 50 µg/ml unmethylated CpG-DNA (HyCult Biotechnology, Uden, The Netherlands), 50 nM MDP or various concentrations (0.05–2 µM) of M-TriDAP (InvivoGen) for 18 h. IL-8 production was measured using a DuoSet human ELISA kit (R&amp;D Systems, Lille, France). All the reagents used were tested negative for endotoxin contamination using the Limulus amoebocyte assay according to the Manufacturer's recommendations (QCL-1000, Biowhittaker, Buckinghamshire, UK). MPO activity was measured using HyCult Biotechnology ELISA kit.</p>

        <title>Flow cytometry analysis</title>
        <p>The cell populations infiltrating the infected mouse kidneys were analyzed by flow cytometry. 24 h after UPEC infection, kidneys were carefully rinsed with PBS to remove the remaining circulating blood cells. The kidneys were then minced and digested for 45 min at 37°C with 1 mg/ml collagenase (Roche Diagnostics) and 10 µg/ml DNAse I in the same RPMI 1640-Glutamax medium (Life Technologies) as described above for the isolation of renal DCs. After rinsing, kidney homogenates were then passed through a 70 µm pore sized nylon Cell Strainer (BD Biosciences) with 15 ml PBS. The resulting cell suspension was centrifuged (1600 rpm, 10 min) again and then resuspended (10×10<sup>6</sup> total cells/ml) in FACS buffer containing 2% BSA and 0.05% sodium azide. Non-specific binding of antibody to Fc receptors was blocked by incubating the cell suspension with the anti-mouse CD16/32 (2.4G2) antibody (10 µg/ml) and ChromePure rat IgG (100 µg/ml, Jackson Immunoresearch) for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were then incubated in pre-determined optimal concentrations of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies to cell surface antigens or matching isotype control antibodies for 30 min at 4°C. APC anti-mouse Ly-6G/Ly-6C (Gr1; RB6-8C5), Pe anti-mouse F4/80 (BM8), PerCP/Cy5.5 anti-mouse CD11b (M1/70), Pacific Blue anti-mouse (MHC-II/IA/IE, M5/114.15.2) and PeCy7 anti-mouse CD45 (RA3-6B2), and matching fluorophores-conjugated antibodies isotypes were purchased from Biolegend. PeCy7 anti-mouse CD11c (HL3) and V500 anti mouse CD45.2 (104) were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Fluorescent measurements were conducted with identical settings on at least 100,000 CD45<sup>+</sup> cells per kidney per experiment using a BD FACSCanto II cytometer operating BD FACSDiva software v6.1.3 (BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium), and FlowJo v7.6.5 (Tree Star. Inc., Ashland, OR). Analyses of NOD1 expression and bacterial phagocytosis capacity by human neutrophils were also analyzed by flow cytometry. Human whole blood samples (1 ml) were incubated with Texas red-coupled <italic>E. coli</italic> (10<sup>7</sup> bacteria) (Molecular Probes) with gentle stirring for 30 min at 37°C, while negative control samples were kept on ice before analysis. Red blood cells were then lyzed by adding 10 ml NH<sub>4</sub>Cl 0.8% wt/vol for 15 min. Trypan blue (0.05 mg/ml) was added to the samples to reduce the quenching of surface-bound fluorescence. Samples were centrifuged (400 g, 10 min) at 4°C to remove cell debris, and pelleted leukocytes were then rinsed in PBS. In parallel, aliquots of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl-treated blood samples were permeabilized with methanol, and then incubated with an anti-human NOD1 antibody (Imgenex Corp.). All fluorescence measurements were conducted with identical settings and forward and side-scatter parameters to identify the neutrophil population and to gate out other cells and debris <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003152-Francois1">[67]</xref>.</p>
