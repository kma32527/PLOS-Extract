      <abstract>
        <p>We have reported that properties of prion strains may change when propagated in different environments. For example, when swainsonine-sensitive 22L prions were propagated in PK1 cells in the presence of swainsonine, drug-resistant variants emerged. We proposed that prions constitute quasi- populations comprising a range of variants with different properties, from which the fittest are selected in a particular environment. Prion populations developed heterogeneity even after biological cloning, indicating that during propagation mutation-like processes occur at the conformational level. Because brain-derived 22L prions are naturally swainsonine resistant, it was not too surprising that prions which had become swa sensitive after propagation in cells could revert to drug resistance. Because RML prions, both after propagation in brain or in PK1 cells, are swainsonine sensitive, we investigated whether it was nonetheless possible to select swainsonine-resistant variants by propagation in the presence of the drug. Interestingly, this was not possible with the standard line of PK1 cells, but in certain PK1 sublines not only swainsonine-resistant, but even swainsonine-dependent populations (i.e. that propagated more rapidly in the presence of the drug) could be isolated. Once established, they could be passaged indefinitely in PK1 cells, even in the absence of the drug, without losing swainsonine dependence. The misfolded prion protein (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) associated with a swainsonine-dependent variant was less rapidly cleared in PK1 cells than that associated with its drug-sensitive counterpart, indicating that likely structural differences of the misfolded PrP underlie the properties of the prions. In summary, propagation of prions in the presence of an inhibitory drug may not only cause the selection of drug-resistant prions but even of stable variants that propagate more efficiently in the presence of the drug. These adaptations are most likely due to conformational changes of the abnormal prion protein.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Prions consist of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, an aggregated conformer of the host protein PrP<sup>C</sup>. PrP<sup>Sc</sup> multiplies by catalyzing the conformational conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> into a likeness of itself. Prions present as distinct strains that have the same primary amino acid sequence but differ in their conformation. Many distinct mouse-derived prions strains, for example RML, 22L or Me7, have been isolated. Prions can adapt to their environment. We investigated whether propagation of swainsonine-sensitive RML prions in the presence of the drug would yield swainsonine-resistant variants. Interestingly, this was not possible with a standard line of neuroblastoma cells, but in certain sublines not only swainsonine-resistant, but even swainsonine-dependent populations (i.e. that propagated more rapidly in the presence than in the absence of the drug) could be isolated. Once established, they could be propagated “indefinitely” in PK1 cells, even in the absence of the drug, without losing swainsonine dependence. In summary, our paper shows that propagation of prions in the presence of an inhibitory drug may not only cause the selection of drug-resistant prions but even of stable prion variants that propagate more efficiently in the presence of the drug. These adaptations are most likely due to conformational changes of the abnormal prion protein.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The prion, the transmissible agent mediating spongiform encephalopathies consists mainly if not entirely of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, an aggregate of conformers of the host protein PrP<sup>C</sup> (cellular prion protein). PrP<sup>Sc</sup> may present in a proteinase K (PK)-sensitive and a PK-resistant form, designated PrP<sup>sen</sup> and PrP<sup>res</sup>, respectively. Replication of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> occurs by seeded aggregation (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Weissmann1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Collinge1">[4]</xref>).</p>
      <p>Murine prions occur in form of many strains that can be distinguished by their cell tropism and susceptibility to drugs, as determined by the extended cell panel assay (ECPA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Mahal1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Mahal3">[9]</xref>. Prion populations exhibit features of Darwinian evolution in that they are subject to “mutations” that give rise to heterogeneity and allow selective amplification of prions in different environments. Brain-derived 22L prions are “R33 competent”, that is, they can infect R33 cells, and “swa resistant”, meaning that they can infect PK1 cells in the presence of the inhibitor swainsonine (swa), but after propagation in PK1 cells for several generations they become R33-incompetent and swa sensitive. However, when swa-sensitive 22L prions were propagated in PK1 cells in the presence of the drug, the prion population became swa resistant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Mahal2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Li1">[10]</xref>. Similarly, RML prions acquired quinacrine resistance in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Ghaemmaghami1">[11]</xref> and yeast prions resistance to epigallocatechin-3-gallate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Roberts1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>While brain-derived 22L prions are swa resistant, RML prions, both brain- or cell-derived, are swa sensitive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Mahal2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Browning1">[7]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003158.s001">Figure S1</xref>), raising the question whether RML prions can nonetheless become swa resistant. We cultured RML-infected PK1 cells in the presence of swa under various conditions but repeatedly failed to obtain swa-resistant RML prions. Interestingly however, three PK1 subclones, AMO10, AMO18 or CAB19-2E4, when infected with RML and cultured in presence of swa, yielded prions that were fully swa-resistant or even “swa-dependent”, i.e. propagated more efficiently in the presence of swa than in its absence. AMO10-derived swa-resistant prions, when passaged through mouse brain, gave rise to a novel strain, distinct from the original RML, as assessed by the Extended Cell Panel Assay (ECPA).</p>
      <p>These experiments suggest that in some RML-infected PK1-derived cell lines, but not in the PK1 cell line itself, the swa-sensitive prion populations contain a low level of variants, which can be selected in the presence of the drug to yield swa-resistant RML populations. We speculate that some cell line-dependent feature, be it the glycosylation state of PrP<sup>C</sup> or the availability of some factor modulating its conformation, is responsible for the distinct behavior of some PK1 subclones in permitting the emergence of swa resistance or dependence.</p>

After four days the cells were split 1∶5 to 1∶8, depending on their growth rate. After reaching confluence following the third split, 20000 cells/well were transferred into wells of pre-activated Multiscreen IP96-well 0.45-µm filter plates (Millipore).

In the work described here prion characteristics were analyzed using CAD cells, R33<sub>2H11</sub> cells and PK1 cells, as well as PK1 cells in the constant presence of 1 µg swainsonine (Logan Natural Products)/ml, 5 or 10 µg kifunensine (Cayman Chemicals)/ml, 0.25 µg curcumine (Sigma-Aldrich)/ml, 1.6 ng compound B (a gift from K.

The cells' response to prions is characterized by the Response Index (RI), the reciprocal of the dilution required to yield a designated number of positive cells (“spots”) per 20000 cells; the ratio of RIs is characteristic for different prion strains. We characterize swa sensitivity, swa resistance or swa dependence of the different prion samples by the ratio Q<sub>swa</sub> = RI<sub>PK1</sub>/RI<sub>(PK1+swa)</sub>. Because Q<sub>swa</sub> (Q for short) may vary from one assay to another, Q of a sample was compared relative to that of RML, determined in the same assay, to obtain Q<sub>rel</sub> = Q<sub>sample</sub>/Q<sub>RML</sub> and prions were defined as being swa sensitive if Q<sub>rel</sub>≥1; as semi-resistant if 1&gt;Q<sub>rel</sub>&gt;(1/Q<sub>RML</sub>); as resistant if Q<sub>rel</sub> = (1/Q<sub>RML</sub>) and as “swa dependent” if Q<sub>rel</sub>&lt;(1/Q<sub>RML</sub>).</p>

        <p>CM recovered from brain-derived RML-infected PK1 or AMO10 cells, was used to infect PK1 cells in the presence (undiluted CM) or absence (five serial 1∶2 dilutions, starting from undiluted CM) of swa. Pools of 2000 cells (in the presence of swa) or of 10 cells (plus 1990 uninfected cells, in the absence of swa) were distributed into the wells of 96-well plates, grown to confluence and propagated for six splits. The plates were then assayed by the SSCA and wells containing PrP<sup>res</sup>-positive cells (spot numbers&gt;[background+5 SDs]) were scored as “putative positive”. We have found that PrP<sup>res</sup>-positive cells may persist in the presence of swa even though the prions are not swa resistant (because inhibition by swa is not complete). Therefore seven each of AMO10-derived and PK1-derived “putative positive” prion populations were analyzed by the SSCA on PK1 cells in the absence or presence of swa to establish “true” swa resistance. From the percentage of validated positive samples, the average number of prions per well (m<sub>w</sub>) could be determined as m<sub>w</sub> = ln(1/P<sub>mw</sub>(0)), where P<sub>mw</sub>(0) = 1-(positive wells/total wells) and N = cells/well, and hence the average number of prions per cell m<sub>c</sub> = m<sub>w</sub>/N. The ratio m<sub>c(+swa)</sub>, prions/cells in the swa-containing plate, to m<sub>c(no swa)</sub>, prions per cell in the swa-free plate, yields the frequency of pre-existing swa-resistant prions in the population.</p>

        <title>Half-life experiments</title>
        <p>In order to compare the degradation rate of different brain- or cell-derived prion samples PK1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 5.7×10<sup>4</sup> cells in 1.4 ml media and inoculated with CM (final concentration: 30 fold) from infected cells, or with 10% RML brain homogenate (final dilution: 2×10<sup>−4</sup>). After four days, cells were split; 0.9×10<sup>6</sup> cells were transferred to a 15-cm culture dish, grown for four days and split again by transferring 1.4×10<sup>6</sup> cells each into two 15-cm dishes, to one of which 2 µg swa/ml were added. Three days after drug application, cells were split a third time; 10<sup>6</sup> cells each were transferred to ten 15-cm dishes, resulting in 10 dishes with and 10 without swa. On the following day, PIPLC was added to a final concentration of 1 unit/ml to four of 10 dishes. At time zero, before adding PIPLC, two dishes were harvested, and thereafter one dish per condition after 7, 12, 18 and 24 hours. Cells, recovered in culture media, were centrifuged at 3000× g and 4°C for 5 min. The pellet was re-suspended in 0.5 to 1 ml of PBS, the cells were counted, centrifuged again at 3000× g and 4°C for 5 min and finally frozen in −80°C as suspension of 2.5×10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml in PBS. Lysates were prepared by three freeze-thaw cycles using liquid nitrogen, followed by several passages through a 28-gauge syringe. All samples were adjusted to 1.6 mg protein/ml in PBST (PBS, 0.5% TritonX-100) and digested with 20 µg proteinase K (Roche)/ml at 37°C for 1 hour. After terminating digestion with 2 mM PMSF, the samples were denatured by heating in XT-MES sample buffer (BioRad) at 100°C for 10 minutes and were subjected to electrophoresis on triplicate gels with subsequent western blot analysis as described below. After correcting for differences in luminescence intensity between the gels, the intensity of PrP<sup>res</sup> at each time point was normalized to the PrP<sup>res</sup> intensity at the zero-hour time point and plotted as a function of time on a log scale.</p>

        <p>Samples (30 µg total protein/ml) were adjusted to guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn.HCl) in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) in a dilution series ranging from 0.2 M to 4.2 M. After 15 minutes at 25°C the Gdn.HCl concentration was brought to 0.2 M in all samples and volumes were equalized. This was followed by digestion with 0.6 µg proteinase K (Roche)/ml 0.5% TritonX-100 in PBS (PBST) for 1 hour at 37°C. The digestion was stopped with 2 mM PMSF. Proteins were precipitated by TCA (10% final concentration), incubated 30 minutes on ice and centrifuged at 16000× g for 15 min at 4°C. The pellets were resuspended in cold acetone, centrifuged again and finally resuspended in PBST. After addition of XT-MES sample buffer (BioRad) samples were denatured at 100°C for 10 minutes and subjected to electrophoretic separation on triplicate gels with subsequent western blot analysis as described below.</p>

        <title>Western blot analysis</title>
        <p>To detect PrP<sup>res</sup> by western blot analysis, samples were, if not stated otherwise, subjected to standard PK digestion: 3 mg total protein/ml in PBST were digested with 25 µg proteinase K (Roche)/ml at 37°C for 1 hour. Undigested controls were run in parallel. The digestion was stopped with 20 µl 100 mM PMSF/ml and the samples were denatured by boiling in XT-MES sample buffer (BioRad) at 100°C for 10 minutes. Electrophoretic separation (4–12% Criterion gel, BioRad) and wet transfer (BioRad) to PVDF Immobilon membranes (Millipore) were performed by standard procedures. All further steps were performed at room temperature. Membranes were incubated for 1 hour in blocking solution (5% non-fat dry milk in PBST) and immunostained with 0.7 µg humanized anti-PrP antibody D18/ml in 1% non-fat dry milk in PBST (PBS; 0.1% Tween 20), followed by three washes with PBST and 1 hour of incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-IgG antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL, 1∶15000 in 0.5% non-fat dry milk in PBST). After three washes with PBST, chemiluminescence was induced by ECL-Plus (Pierce) and recorded by CCD imaging (BioSpectrum AC Imaging System; UVP).</p>

The response of a cell line to a prion strain preparation is measured by the Response Index (RI), the reciprocal of the dilution required to yield a specified proportion of positive cells.

      <p>Swainsonine (swa), an inhibitor of α-mannosidase II, causes misglycosylation of N-glycosylated proteins, including PrP<sup>C</sup>, which carries up to two N-linked glycans. Infection of neuroblastoma N2a-derived PK1 cells with RML in the presence of swa reduces the RI by 1.5 to 2 logs but has no inhibitory effect on other cell lines tested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Browning1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We quantify susceptibility of a prion strain to swa by determining the RI on PK1 cells in the absence or presence of swa and calculating the quotient Q = RI<sub>PK1</sub>/RI<sub>(PK1+swa)</sub>. Because Q may fluctuate from one assay to another, we determine Q of a sample relative to that of RML, determined in the same assay, to obtain Q<sub>rel</sub> = Q<sub>sample</sub>/Q<sub>RML</sub>. We define prions as being swa sensitive if Q<sub>rel</sub>≥1; semi-resistant if 1&gt;Q<sub>rel</sub>&gt;(1/Q<sub>RML</sub>); resistant if Q<sub>rel</sub> = (1/Q<sub>RML</sub>) and “swa dependent” if Q<sub>rel</sub>&lt;(1/Q<sub>RML</sub>).</p>

        <title>Search for swa-resistant RML prions</title>
        <p>In several preliminary experiments PK1 cells were infected with RML and split repeatedly in the presence of swa, or PK1 cells were repeatedly exposed to concentrated conditioned medium (CCM) of RML-infected PK1 cells containing secreted prions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Li1">[10]</xref>. Although in some instances RML-exposed PK1 cells remained infected when propagated in the presence of the drug, the lysate or CCM of the cells was unable to infect PK1 cells in the presence of the drug, as judged by the SSCA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003158.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). We concluded that the apparent swa resistance came about not because swa-resistant prions had emerged but because swa, although decreasing RML prion propagation in PK1 cells by about 1.5–2 logs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Browning1">[7]</xref>, did not completely abrogate it and therefore allowed propagation of infected cells. Subclones of PK1 cells may vary considerably in their properties, such as susceptibility to infection by RML or 22L prions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Mahal1">[5]</xref> or their ability to mediate swa inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Browning1">[7]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We considered that PK1-derived cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003158-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) which mediate swa susceptibility to a lesser degree than PK1, such as AMO10 and AMO18 might be more likely to allow selection of swa-resistant mutants than CAB19-2E4 (2E4 for short), which showed a more pronounced swa effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003158-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). As shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003158-g002">Figure 2</xref>, we infected PK1 (A), AMO10 (B) and 2E4 cells (C) with RML in the presence of swa, and after the cells had reached confluence the conditioned medium (CM) was used to infect fresh cells in the presence of swa. The prions in the CM recovered after this second round of infection were assayed for swa resistance by the SSCA on PK1 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003158-g003">Figure 3</xref>, no infectivity was recovered from PK1 cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003158-t001">Table 1</xref>, &lt;?&gt;), whilst prions propagated in AMO10 cells in the presence of swa were virtually fully swa resistant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003158-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003158-t001">Table 1</xref>, &lt;2&gt;). Unexpectedly, prions propagated in 2E4 cells in the presence of swa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003158-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003158-t001">Table 1</xref>, &lt;3&gt;), were not only swa resistant, but “swa dependent”, that is, they scored even higher in the presence of swa than in its absence, giving a quotient Q = RI<sub>PK1</sub>/RI<sub>PK1+swa</sub> of 0.05, as compared to 102 for RML<sup>brain</sup> prions that served as controls.</p>

            <p>Initially, PK1 or PK1-derived cells were infected with RML prions, cultured in the presence of swa, and prions secreted into the conditioned medium (CM) were concentrated (CCM) and used to infect fresh batches of cells, also in the constant presence of swa. This cycle was repeated at least once more. The resulting prions were further propagated under various conditions. Large circles indicate cell lines; small circles indicate prions; horizontal arrows represent propagation of infected cells and vertical arrows transfer of prions; &lt;#&gt; indicates a prion sample whose swa resistance is reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003158-t001">Table 1</xref> and/or in one of the further figures. <bold>A.</bold> CCM from PK1 cells (large green disks), collected after the first infection (&lt;1&gt;) in the presence of swa (red arrows), contained low titers of swa-sensitive prions (small blue disks). After transfer to a fresh batch of PK1 cells in the presence of swa, infectivity dropped below detectability (&lt;?&gt;). <bold>B.</bold> AMO10 cells (large yellow disks) infected with RML in the presence of swa yielded swa-resistant prions (small red disks) (&lt;2&gt;); upon further transmission to AMO10 cells (large yellow disks) in the presence of swa the prions remained swa resistant; upon transmission to PK1 cells (large green disks) in the presence of swa the prions developed swa dependence. When transferred in the absence of swa the prions became swa sensitive (small, blue disks), semi-resistant (small orange disks) or swa dependent (small black disks) depending on whether they had previously been cultured with (red arrows) or without swa (blue arrows), and on the cell line (CAD cells violet disks). <bold>C.</bold> In the case of 2E4 cells, swa-dependent prions (small black disks) were recovered after the first transfer of CCM in the presence of swa (&lt;3&gt;); these prions remained swa dependent regardless of culture conditions or cell line.</p>

            <p>PK1 cells and cells of the PK1-derived sublines AMO10 and 2E4 were infected with RML prions, cultured in the presence of swa for 2 splits, and prions secreted into the conditioned medium (CM) were concentrated (CCM) and used to infect fresh batches of cells in the constant presence of swa (see scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003158-g002">Figure 2</xref>). CCM recovered from these cultures was analyzed by the SSCA on PK1 cells in the absence (blue line) or presence (red, dashed line) of swa. The proportion of PrP<sup>res</sup> positive cells was plotted against the logarithm of the inocula dilutions and RIs were determined as reciprocal of the dilutions required to yield 750 PrP<sup>res</sup> positive cells per 20000 cells. Q<sub>swa</sub>, the ratio of RI<sub>cell</sub> vs. RI<sub>cell+swa</sub>, indicates the inhibitory effect of swa on the analyzed prion sample, to be compared with swa-sensitive, brain-derived RML prions (rightmost graph). Prions could not be detected in CM recovered from PK1 cells (&lt;?&gt;). Prions recovered from AMO10 cells (&lt;2&gt;) were found to be swa resistant, that is, they were propagated to the same extent in the presence or absence of swa. Prions recovered from 2E4 cells (&lt;3&gt;) were “swa dependent”, i.e. were propagated more efficiently in the presence of swa. n.a., not applicable.</p>

Nonetheless, as shown below, the original isolate of swa-dependent RML prions (RML<sup>(2E4+swa)</sup>) could be propagated indefinitely in various cell lines.</p>

        <title>Are swa resistance and swa dependence stable properties of the selected RML prions, and are they maintained after transfer to other cell lines?</title>
        <p>In order to determine whether swa resistance and swa dependence were properties of the prions or of the cells that harbored them, we transferred the prions to PK1 cells and determined their properties. Swa-resistant RML prions from AMO10 cells, transferred to PK1 cells and passaged for 6 splits in the presence of swa, surprisingly gave rise to swa-dependent prions, whilst passaging in the absence of swa led to production of swa-sensitive prions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003158-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, top; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003158-t001">Table 1</xref>, &lt;4&gt;, &lt;5&gt;). However, if the PK1 cells infected with swa-resistant RML prions were first passaged for 11 splits in the presence of swa, and then for 9 further splits, in either the presence or absence of swa, swa-dependent prions were produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003158-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, top; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003158-t001">Table 1</xref>, &lt;10&gt;, &lt;11&gt;).</p>

        <p>Thus, swa-resistant prions in AMO10 cells were stably maintained in the presence of swa, but in its absence reverted to partial swa resistance or swa sensitivity. However, if transferred to PK1 cells and propagated in the presence of swa, the prions became swa dependent and no longer reverted to swa sensitivity when the drug was withdrawn. Interestingly, although PK1 cells failed to mediate the generation of swa-resistant prions, they were not only able to propagate them but allowed them to evolve to drug dependence.</p>

            <p>Swa-resistant AMO10-derived prions and swa-dependent 2E4-derived prions were transferred to CAD cells and propagated in the absence of swa for 8 splits. Concentrated conditioned medium from these cultures was then analyzed by the SSCA on PK1 cells in the absence (blue line) or presence (red, dashed line) of swa. RIs are the reciprocals of the dilutions yielding 1000 PrP<sup>res</sup>-positive cells per 20000 cells. Q<sub>swa</sub> = RI<sub>cell</sub>/RI<sub>cell+swa</sub> reflects inhibition by swa and may be compared with the value for swa-sensitive, brain-derived RML prions (rightmost panel). Swa-resistant AMO10-derived prions reverted to swa sensitivity (&lt;18&gt;), while swa-dependent 2E4-derived prions remained dependent (&lt;19&gt;).</p>

        <p>In summary, when RML-infected PK1 cells were propagated in the presence of swa, the cells were cured of infection, whilst propagation of RML-infected AMO10 and 2E4 cells in the presence of swa led to the emergence of swa-resistant prions, or even of prions that replicated more efficiently in the presence of swa.</p>

        <title>Frequency Assay for swa-resistant RML prions</title>
        <p>Previous work has supported the proposal that prion strain populations are quasi-species, consisting of a major conformer and multiple variants that are constantly selected against, but are replenished by mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Weissmann1">[1]</xref>. Within the framework of this hypothesis, and considering that AMO10 but not PK1 cells could give rise to swa-resistant prions, we hypothesized that RML-infected PK1 cells have a more restricted prion repertoire than AMO10 cells. In an attempt to substantiate this hypothesis we subjected prions from RML-infected PK1 and AMO10 cells (both infected and cultured in the absence of swa) to the frequency assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Weissmann1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Li1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Li2">[17]</xref>: PK1 cells were infected in the presence or absence of swa with prions from the two sources, and pools of 2000 cells (in the presence of swa) or of 10 cells (plus 1990 uninfected cells, in the absence of swa) were distributed into the wells of 96-well plates, grown to confluence and propagated for six splits. The ratio of prion-infected cells in the swa-containing plate to that in the swa-free plate yields the frequency of pre-existing swa-resistant prions in the population. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003158.s005">Table S1B</xref>, 8.7×10<sup>5</sup> PK1 cells infected with RML-infected AMO10 cell supernatant in the presence of swa, assayed in pools of 2000 cells/well, yielded about 0.003% validated infected cells, while in the absence of swa (assayed in pools of 10 cells/well) an average of 4.1% infected cells were identified. Thus, in the AMO10 populations, about 0.08% of the prions were swa resistant prior to exposure to the drug. No cells containing swa-resistant prions were found among 8.8×10<sup>5</sup> cells in the cognate experiment with the PK1 population, setting an approximate upper limit of 0.02%. This experiment showed that swa-resistant prions pre-existed in the AMO10-derived population but, because of the low numbers, it did not allow a statistically significant conclusion to be drawn regarding the PK1-derived population.</p>
        <p>As an incidental note, while validating a set of 7 apparently positive clones from the AMO10-derived prions grown in PK1 cells in the presence of swa, we found three clones to be swa sensitive, two swa resistant and two swa dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003158.s002">Figure S2B</xref>), confirming the previous findings shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003158-g002">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003158-g005">5</xref>, namely that swa-resistant AMO10-derived prions can become swa dependent when passaged in PK1 cells in the presence of swa.</p>
        <p>As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003158-g002">Figure 2B and C</xref>, AMO10-derived swa-resistant prions propagated in AMO10 cells in the presence of swa remained swa resistant for &gt;10 splits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003158-t001">Table 1</xref>, &lt;13&gt;), and when passaged through PK1 cells in the presence of swa became swa dependent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003158-t001">Table 1</xref>, &lt;10&gt;), while 2E4-derived prions were swa dependent whether propagated in 2E4 or PK1 cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003158-t001">Table 1</xref>, &lt;16&gt; and &lt;14&gt;). Although both AMO10- and 2E4-derived prions passaged in PK1 cells were R33 incompetent and resistant to kifunensine, they differed in that 2E4-derived prions were far more resistant to curcumine and distinctly more resistant to compound B than their AMO10-derived counterpart, as shown by the Extended Cell Panel Assay (ECPA; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003158-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003158-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

        <title>Propagation of swa-resistant and -dependent RML prions through mouse brain</title>
        <p>Earlier experiments had shown that the changes incurred by brain-derived 22L prions after propagation in cell lines, namely transition to swa sensitivity and R33 incompetence, were abrogated after passaging in brain, and that the resulting prions were not distinguishable from the original 22L by the CPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Li1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Li2">[17]</xref>. We therefore considered brain-adapted and cell-adapted 22L prions as substrains of 22L, because of their facile interconvertibility.</p>
        <p>The situation with swa-resistant RML prions proved to be different. We inoculated swa-resistant AMO10-derived, swa-dependent 2E4-derived as well as authentic brain-derived RML prions into C57BL/6 mice. Although the resulting histopathological and immunohistochemical changes were indistinguishable, the ECPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003158-g008">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003158-t001">Table 1</xref>) revealed that while brain-passaged AMO10-derived prions (&lt;AMO10-brain-a&gt;, &lt;AMO10-brain-b&gt;) had indeed reverted back to swa sensitivity (Q = 9.6 and 14, for duplicate brains), becoming similar to authentic RML prions (Q = 21, 15 and 27, for triplicate brains), they were largely resistant to kifu (Q = 7.5 and 12), in contrast to authentic RML prions, which were strongly inhibited by the drug (Q&gt;661, &gt;457, &gt;1349, for triplicate brains). These results were confirmed by multiple independent assays. Thus, selection for swa resistance in cell culture followed by propagation in brain resulted in a mutant strain characterized by resistance to kifu but not to swa. Three brains inoculated with 2E4-derived prions gave different, albeit repeatable results in the ECPA: While swa was equally inhibitory to all three samples (Q = 14, 17, 17), one brain (&lt;2E4-brain-c&gt;) contained prions that were semi-resistant to kifu (Q = 18), one sample (&lt;2E4-brain-b&gt;) contained kifu-sensitive prions (Q = 130), albeit less sensitive than brain-derived RML prions (Q&gt;661, &gt;457, &gt;1349, for triplicate brains), and the third brain (&lt;2E4-brain-a&gt;) contained prions that were as strongly inhibited by kifu as brain-derived RML (Q&gt;230). Inasmuch as the mice were genotypically identical, the diverse development of the prion populations may be due to an incidental phenotypic characteristic of the mouse (such as its immunological status); another possibility is that the number of prions following injection was greatly reduced, leading to a “bottleneck” from which distinct populations emerged.</p>

The rate of depletion, as measured after addition of PIPLC, appeared to be biphasic, with a rapid drop in the first 7 hours and a slower exponential decrease thereafter. After the initial 7-hour period, the clearance rate of PrP<sup>res</sup> of swa-dependent RML in absence of swa was 3× lower than that of swa-sensitive RML, and was 5.5× lower in the presence of the drug, indicating that susceptibility of PrP<sup>res</sup> to clearance was a major determinant for swa resistance.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>It was not too surprising that swa-resistant 22L prions could be selected from a swa-sensitive, cell-adapted 22L population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Li1">[10]</xref>, because “natural” brain-derived 22L prions are swa resistant to begin with. It was however unpredictable that RML prions, which are swa sensitive, both when propagated in brain or in PK1 cells, would give rise to swa-resistant and even swa-dependent populations when passaged in the presence of swa.</p>
      <p>What is the biochemical basis for swa sensitivity, resistance and dependence? Swa, by inhibiting α-mannosidase II, causes misglycosylation of N-glycosylated proteins, including PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (PrP<sup>res</sup>). General misglycosylation could alter the cellular mechanisms involved in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> synthesis and clearance; however it is more likely that most of the effect is related to the misglycosylation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> because different variants of RML prions exhibit a vast difference in their response to swa in the same cell line. How could misglycosylation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> lead to these effects? X-ray crystallographic studies on IgG1-Fc have demonstrated that the nature of the N-linked glycans may affect the conformation of a glycoprotein and thereby change its susceptibility to degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Krapp1">[25]</xref>. Indeed, we found that swa-sensitive and swa-dependent RML PrP<sup>res</sup> have different degradation rates. Moreover, misglycosylation may affect the interaction of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> with other cellular proteins, such as lectin chaperones, and thereby modulate the rate of synthesis and/or clearance. If, as we propose, prions form quasi-species populations, a conformer present at low levels that is able to overcome a deleterious effect due to swa-mediated misglycosylation could be selected and give rise to swa-resistant or even -dependent PrP<sup>res</sup> species.</p>
      <p>A further point of interest is that swa and kifu resistance of RML prions do not necessarily go hand in hand: Although both drugs lead to misglycosylation, the resulting glycans are of different nature, namely hybrid-type glycans in the case of swa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Tulsiani1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Crispin1">[28]</xref> and oligomannose-type glycans in the case of kifu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Elbein1">[29]</xref>. This indicates that different types of misglycosylation might modulate the interactions of PrP<sup>C</sup> and/or PrP<sup>res</sup> with proteins involved in PrP<sup>res</sup> synthesis or degradation in distinct ways. Castanospermine, an inhibitor of α-glucosidase 1, which removes glucose residues from the initial core and generates a high-mannose glycan, shows an inhibition pattern different from both swa and kifu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Browning1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Why was it possible to reproducibly generate swa-resistant prions in AMO10 and AMO18 cells (and at least once in 2E4 cells), but not in PK1 cells, although the latter were able to propagate swa-resistant prions once they were generated in other cell lines and even mediate their conversion to swa dependence? Within the framework of the quasi-species hypothesis, it is possible that the diversity of the prion population in PK1 cells is distinct from, or more restricted than that in AMO10 cells, as suggested by the frequency analysis for swa-resistant prions from RML-infected PK1 and AMO10 cells, so that there are no swa-resistant variants to be selected. This in turn begs the question as to why the diversity is different. We suggest that prions undergo mutations that are based on small, thermally induced conformational changes of short PrP<sup>res</sup> aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Weissmann1">[1]</xref>, which are stabilized if and when appropriate (“competent”) PrP<sup>C</sup> conformers accrete to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003158-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Thus, as we proposed earlier to explain cell tropism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Weissmann2">[30]</xref>, the repertoire of PrP<sup>res</sup> variants could depend on the repertoire of PrP<sup>C</sup> conformers, which in turn may be determined by the N-linked glycans, of which there is a great variety <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Endo1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Rudd2">[33]</xref> or by association with some cell-derived molecule, for instance a small RNA. The affinity of PrP<sup>C</sup> for RNA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Gomes1">[34]</xref>) and the requirement for RNA in PMCA-mediated prion propagation in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Deleault1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Saa1">[37]</xref> has been documented. Thus, if prion propagation at low concentrations of both swa-resistant seed and competent monomer follows 2<sup>nd</sup> order kinetics, the rate of swa-resistant prion formation in PK1 cells may be lower than the replication rate of the cells, thereby preventing emergence of swa-resistant prions. On the other hand, elevated concentrations of swa-resistant seed in the same cells could promote rates of swa-resistant prion formation high enough to allow persistence in dividing cell populations and evolution of prions with increased swa resistance and even “dependence”.</p>

          <p><bold>A.</bold> The conformation of a PrP<sup>Sc</sup> unit in an aggregate may be “locked” even if it is not the thermodynamically most favored one. The shorter the aggregate, the more the conformation of its subunits may be subject to thermal fluctuation; accretion of PrP<sup>C</sup> stabilizes the variant conformation, resulting in “mutation” of the prion. <bold>B.</bold> PrP<sup>C</sup> may assume a variety of conformations, of which only one or a few can readily accrete to a particular seed. Different conformers may be present at different steady state concentrations and could be favored by the nature of the N-glycans and/or by interaction with cellular factors (such as small RNAs). Cell tropism may reflect the preponderance of different sets of conformations in distinct cell types.

      <p>Several prion strain variants we have described earlier, which resulted from the transfer of brain-derived 22L prions to different cultured cell lines, reverted to the original strain when returned to brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Li1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Li2">[17]</xref>, suggesting that the activation energy barriers between the various conformations were low <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Weissmann1">[1]</xref>. In another instance, brain-derived 139A prions, when passaged through PK1 cells and returned to brain, became indistinguishable from the 79A/RML strain, suggesting that the activation energy barrier between the two strains was high in brain but low in PK1 cells, and that the 79A/RML conformers were preferentially replicated in the cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003158-Oelschlegel1">[8]</xref>. In the experiments described in this paper, at least one distinct swa-resistant and three swa-dependent RML variants were characterized, derived from AMO10 and from 2E4 cells, which, after passaging in PK1 cells, retained their properties even after propagation in the absence of swa. Upon propagation in brain, the swa-resistant (and kifu-resistant) prions from AMO10 cells reproducibly became swa sensitive, however were still semi-resistant to kifu, showing that a strain distinct from RML had emerged. Whether or not these prions would further change or revert to RML upon continued propagation in mouse brain was not determined. The 2E4-derived prions, when propagated in mouse brain, also became swa sensitive, however the resistance to kifu varied in the three brains tested, ranging from semi-resistance to full susceptibility; this may reflect very slow reversion to the original RML strain, which proceeded at slightly different rates in these brains.</p>
      <p>In summary, our experiments have shown that RML prions, when subjected to selective pressure in cultured cells, can develop a variety of novel properties, which are stable in cell culture but are further modified when propagated in brain. The repertoire of possible conformations associated with PrP conformers with the same primary sequence appears to be unexpectedly vast.</p>
