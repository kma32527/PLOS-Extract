      <abstract>
        <p>The overexpression of activated, myristoylated Akt in the midgut of female transgenic <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> results in resistance to infection with the human malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> but also decreased lifespan. In the present study, the understanding of mitochondria-dependent midgut homeostasis has been expanded to explain this apparent paradox in an insect of major medical importance. Given that Akt signaling is essential for cell growth and survival, we hypothesized that sustained Akt activation in the mosquito midgut would alter the balance of critical pathways that control mitochondrial dynamics to enhance parasite killing at some cost to survivorship. Toxic reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RNOS) rise to high levels in the midgut after blood feeding, due to a combination of high NO production and a decline in FOXO-dependent antioxidants. Despite an apparent increase in mitochondrial biogenesis in young females (3 d), energy deficiencies were apparent as decreased oxidative phosphorylation and increased [AMP]/[ATP] ratios. In addition, mitochondrial mass was lower and accompanied by the presence of stalled autophagosomes in the posterior midgut, a critical site for blood digestion and stem cell-mediated epithelial maintenance and repair, and by functional degradation of the epithelial barrier. By 18 d, the age at which <italic>An. stephensi</italic> would transmit <italic>P. falciparum</italic> to human hosts, mitochondrial dysfunction coupled to Akt-mediated repression of autophagy/mitophagy was more evident and midgut epithelial structure was markedly compromised. Inhibition of RNOS by co-feeding of the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor <italic>L</italic>-NAME at infection abrogated Akt-dependent killing of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> that begins within 18 h of infection in 3–5 d old mosquitoes. Hence, Akt-induced changes in mitochondrial dynamics perturb midgut homeostasis to enhance parasite resistance and decrease mosquito infective lifespan. Further, quality control of mitochondrial function in the midgut is necessary for the maintenance of midgut health as reflected in energy homeostasis and tissue repair and renewal.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Malaria is a major public health problem in the world and various strategies are under development for control, including vaccines and transgenic mosquitoes that block parasite transmission. We previously reported that overexpression of the major signaling protein Akt in the midgut of female <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> mosquitoes could impart resistance to infection with the most important human malaria parasite and also reduce the duration of mosquito infectivity to human hosts. However, to use this strategy for malaria transmission control in endemic areas, we must understand the mechanism by which parasites are killed to ensure that transmission of other human pathogens (e.g., viruses, nematodes) is not unexpectedly enhanced and to allow the design of rational, preventive interventions. Here, we report that overexpression of a constitutively active Akt in the mosquito midgut alters important cellular, and in particular, mitochondrial processes – in a manner similar to Akt control of these processes in mammalian cells – to generate high levels of toxic compounds that kill parasites within hours after infection. However, the same alterations in mitochondrial processes that result in parasite killing ultimately reduce mosquito infective lifespan for transmission, indicating that mitochondrial dynamics in the mosquito midgut could be targeted for multi-faceted genetic control of mosquito biology to reduce malaria transmission.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Malaria is one of the greatest public health threats worldwide and is caused by infection with protozoan parasites of the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic> that are transmitted by <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. Shortly after an infective bloodmeal is consumed by the female mosquito, which can occur as early as 3 d of age, zygotes form and develop into motile ookinetes in the midgut lumen. Ookinetes must successfully traverse the midgut epithelium to form non-motile oocysts that grow and develop on the outside of the midgut for a minimum of 12 d. Within 14–16 d of ingesting a parasite-containing blood meal (or at 17–19 d post-emergence of the mosquito), oocyst-derived sporozoites invade the salivary glands to yield a mosquito that is infective to humans for the duration of her life. Despite this need for lengthy development, only a small percentage of mosquitoes under natural conditions live long enough to become fully infective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Quraishi1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Reisen2">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Akt is a key signaling molecule in nearly all eukaryotes and regulates a variety of physiological processes in a tissue dependent manner. In mosquitoes, Akt regulates immunity, lifespan, reproduction, metabolism and diapause <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Antonova1">[4]</xref>. We previously demonstrated that increased Akt signaling in the midgut of the female malaria mosquito <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> disrupted development of the human malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and concurrently reduced the duration that mosquitoes are infective to humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-CorbyHarris1">[5]</xref>. Specifically, overexpression of constitutively active Akt (myristoylated Akt or myrAkt) in heterozygous (HT) transgenic <italic>An. stephensi</italic> reduced parasite infection by 60–99% relative to non-transgenic (NTG) controls. Of those mosquitoes that were infected, we observed a 75–99% reduction in parasite load. Homozygous (HM) transgenic mosquitoes were resistant to parasite infection. The increase in midgut-specific Akt signaling also reduced the average mosquito lifespan by 18–20% and the window of opportunity to transmit malaria parasites by 50% relative to controls. Thus, activation of Akt signaling reduced the number of infected mosquitoes, the number of malaria parasites per infected mosquito, and the duration of mosquito infectivity relative to NTG controls. While these findings are significant, the safe application of this or any similar strategy for malaria transmission control requires identification of the mechanism(s) whereby parasites are killed to ensure that transmission of other human pathogens (e.g., viruses, nematodes) is not unexpectedly enhanced and to allow the design of rational, preventive interventions.</p>
      <p>The signaling protein Akt is not only a key mediator in insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS), but it also integrates signals from other growth factor-activated tyrosine kinase receptors as well as activated G-protein-coupled receptors and integrins to regulate a wide array of downstream proteins involved in cell growth, cell survival, and metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Franke1">[6]</xref>. Although activation of Akt is required for fundamental processes, sustained activation of the Akt pathway – as observed in PTEN haploinsufficient or null mice – can lead to abnormal behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Kwon1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Napoli1">[8]</xref>, disrupted autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Zhou1">[9]</xref>, and mitochondrial dysfunction with accumulation of mtDNA deletions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Napoli1">[8]</xref>. Furthermore, enhanced or defective clearance of damaged mitochondria by autophagy or mitophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Lee1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Okamoto1">[11]</xref> has been reported in several disorders with dysregulation of Akt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Gottlieb1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Lo1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Narendra1">[14]</xref>.

      <p>Removal of damaged mitochondria occurs via general autophagy or by a selective form of autophagy termed mitophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Ashrafi1">[16]</xref>. In general, signals that <italic>promote</italic> mitophagy and autophagy, in addition to oxidative stress-mediated damage, include activation of the stress-associated kinases (p38 MAPK and JNK), ERK-dependent signaling, energy deprivation, some pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as Toll-like receptor (TLR) and peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Huang1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Levine1">[18]</xref>. Signals that <italic>inhibit</italic> mitophagy and autophagy include the signaling axis surrounding Akt (phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase [PI-3K] upstream of Akt and target of rapamycin [TOR] downstream of Akt), allergic inflammation-associated signals including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, and some microbial virulence factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Huang1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Levine1">[18]</xref>. Autophagy is critical for the regulation and coordination of cellular homeostasis, epithelial barrier integrity, stem cell maintenance and differentiation, lifespan, and immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Huang1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Vereecke1">[21]</xref>. For example, autophagy in <italic>C. elegans daf-2</italic> mutants – which are both long-lived and infection-resistant – is necessary and sufficient for pathogen resistance and lifespan extension under reduced IIS activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Jia1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Melndez1">[23]</xref>. Thus, balance between mitochondrial biogenesis and these positive and negative signals for the clearance of damaged mitochondria is required for adequate levels of steady-state functional mitochondria.</p>
      <p>In light of observations from nematodes to mammals and the phenotypes of enhanced anti-parasite resistance and reduced lifespan in our transgenic mosquitoes, we hypothesized that myrAkt overexpression in the midgut of <italic>An. stephensi</italic> would lead to mitochondrial dysfunction that could impact resistance to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection and infective lifespan. Specifically, we predicted that Akt overexpression would increase steady-state oxidative stress through a reduction in antioxidants, including FOXO-dependent mitochondrial MnSOD and perhaps glutathione-<italic>S</italic>-transferases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Kang1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-McElwee1">[25]</xref> and through enhanced NO production, based on previous observations of ROS-induced <italic>NOS</italic> expression in <italic>An. stephensi</italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Surachetpong1">[26]</xref>. Given the reciprocal interaction between PTEN levels and mitochondrial dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Napoli1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-GarciaCao1">[15]</xref>, we hypothesized that reduced oxidative phosphorylation, resulting from oxidative damage by increased toxic reactive nitrogen and oxygen species (RNOS) contributed in part perhaps from enhanced mitochondrial ROS production, would feedback to increase damage if not accompanied by concomitant increases in antioxidant and repair enzymes. While a significant upregulation of toxic RNOS could be sufficient to kill parasites, we reasoned that RNOS-damaged midgut architecture could also contribute to anti-parasite resistance and, at the same time, alter infective lifespan. For example, low MnSOD activity, which in the presence of normal or high NO production would result in peroxynitrite formation within mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Melov1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Johnson1">[28]</xref>, could disrupt the activity of several targets, in particular, Complexes I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Zhou1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Chinta1">[29]</xref> and V <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Haynes1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Fujisawa1">[31]</xref> and, possibly, remaining MnSOD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-MacMillanCrow1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Yamakura1">[33]</xref>. Although the resulting high oxidative stress should be a potent signal for activating autophagy and/or mitophagy, Akt overexpression would antagonize RNOS-mediated activation, resulting in reduced clearance of damaged mitochondria, altered biogenesis, and concomitantly higher RNOS. Hence, despite the reduction in parasite infection, Akt-induced metabolic changes would lead to significantly altered mitochondrial dynamics and damage to the midgut epithelium, the primary site for nutrient acquisition from ingested blood.</p>
      <p>Previous studies from Oliveira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Oliveira1">[34]</xref> and Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Kumar1">[35]</xref> using a strain of <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> (L3–5) genetically selected for refractoriness (R) to infection with the simian parasite <italic>Plasmodium cynomolgi</italic>, reported that resistance to infection was related to a heightened state of oxidative stress resulting from lower antioxidant defenses based on morphological and microarray mRNA expression analysis. In particular, they observed decreased State 3-dependent oxygen uptake in midgut and thorax, increased midgut ROS production (from Nox, Duox or mitochondria), and decreased fat stores with increased transcript expression of several glycolytic enzymes. When Oliveira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Oliveira1">[34]</xref> silenced the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT) in sensitive mosquitoes, they observed increased ROS production and a recapitulation of “resistance to infection” observed in R mosquitoes. Although the only glycolytic transcript increased was lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the authors concluded that a “metabolic shift” sustained oxidative stress to favor killing of parasites, driving resistance to infection. A decrease in State 3-mediated oxygen uptake (especially in thorax and less in midgut) and increased LDH transcript, however, would not favor beta-oxidation of fatty acids, a mitochondrial process, to explain the decrease in fat deposits. Rather, these changes would favor glycolysis as a main source of ATP in an attempt to cope with the lower output of mitochondrial ATP. Midgut epithelium is a highly aerobic tissue, for which the electrolyte balance would not be supported by glycolysis alone. Thus, these changes do not appear to be “adaptive” with a temporary implication, rather they are terminal, dramatic changes that would result in increased resistance (less infection) but with a higher cost (shorter lifespan). Although this model of malaria resistance is appealing, it is not possible to definitively identify which (or any) of the detected metabolic changes define the mechanism of resistance given that resistance could result from altered expression of more than one gene in more than one tissue. Indeed, Oliveira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Oliveira1">[34]</xref> suggested that the changes associated with increased resistance might be affected by a regulatory protein such as “a constitutively active transcription factor or a non-functional suppressor of a signal transduction pathway”. In this study, we have used a well-defined model of malaria resistance based on expression of constitutively active myrAkt in the midgut of female mosquitoes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-CorbyHarris1">[5]</xref> to elucidate the mechanism underlying resistance to infection. Here, sustained activation of Akt functions broadly to control mitochondrial dynamics in malaria resistance. This control is initiated as an overproduction of NO and resistance is sustained as an imbalance of mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy. This fundamental imbalance perturbs midgut homeostasis or “midgut health” to mediate the mosquito response to infection and the infective lifespan.</p>

        <title>myrAkt overexpression was associated with increased mitochondrial and cytoskeletal proteins and repression of MAPK signaling in <italic>An. stephensi</italic></title>
        <p>To identify the molecular targets affected by Akt overexpression in <italic>An. stephensi</italic>, we used differential LC-MS/MS to identify proteins that were over- or underrepresented in 3–5 d old, female myrAkt HM and HT <italic>An. stephensi</italic> relative to age-matched, NTG female <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. Analysis of the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> and <italic>An. stephensi</italic> genome data sets yielded largely concordant results; additional related matches from other mosquito species were detected through limited analyses of available data.</p>
        <p>Among 477 identified proteins, a total of 38 proteins (excluding the transgenesis eye marker DsRed and multiple hits to the same protein in different mosquito genomes) were shared between HM and HT <italic>An. stephensi</italic> that were not evident or were reduced in NTG mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003180-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). Notably, of these 38 proteins, a large proportion (14/38 or 37%) were associated with mitochondrial processes, including Krebs' cycle, electron transport chain subunit assembly, protein folding, and mitochondria-specific oxidative stress responses. The latter included an antioxidant enzyme, a peroxiredoxin V (PrxV) ortholog, and three additional proteins generally associated with oxidative stress response, including chaperones (heat shock protein), protein refolding (protein disulfide isomerase) and reduction of oxidative modifications (aldo-keto reductase). In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>prxV</italic> <sup>−/−</sup> mutants exhibited reduced survivorship under oxidative stress, while overexpression of PrxV enhanced oxidative stress resistance and lifespan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Radyuk1">[36]</xref>. In other studies, PrxV was associated with redox regulation during bacterial infection of the midgut in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, but overexpression of PrxV was unexpectedly associated with reduced fly survivorship relative to controls following infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Ahn1">[37]</xref>. While the association of PrxV overexpression with reduced lifespan under some circumstances is intriguing, it is more likely that overexpressed PrxV here is a limited response to oxidative stress, perhaps protecting only a small subset of mitochondrial proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Radyuk2">[38]</xref>.</p>

        <p>The overrepresentation of proteins from Krebs' cycle and the electron transport chain (ETC) was interpreted as increased mitochondrial biogenesis to enhance oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) output and perhaps to replace oxidatively-modified mitochondrial proteins. An increase in OXPHOS output would be consistent with elevated levels of the alpha subunit of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003180-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). This enzyme, known to be located in the basolateral plasma membrane close to mitochondria-enriched fractions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Brouillard1">[39]</xref>, catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the exchange of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> across the plasma membrane creating an electrochemical gradient, which sustains the resting membrane potential as well as provides the energy for active transport of various nutrients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Sun1">[40]</xref>, and is one of the major ATP-consuming units of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Haynes1">[30]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Among the 14 proteins that were underrepresented in myrAkt <italic>An. stephensi</italic>, 7 proteins (50%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003180-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>) were associated with epithelial and chromatin integrity. In particular, perlecan, collagen, and laminin – key components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) – were underrepresented in HM and HT <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. ECM proteins can be degraded and fragmented by oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Kliment1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Yao1">[42]</xref>, suggesting that ECM/epithelial integrity was compromised in myrAkt <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. Histones H2B, H3, and H4 were also underrepresented in myrAkt <italic>An. stephensi</italic> relative to NTG mosquitoes. Histones are essential for chromatin packaging and DNA damage has been identified as a major mediator of chromatin reorganization and histone loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Oberdoerffer1">[43]</xref>, suggesting that oxidative damage to DNA in myrAkt <italic>An. stephensi</italic> at 3–5 d post-emergence was likely to be high.</p>
        <p>Four cytoskeletal proteins were overrepresented in myrAkt <italic>An. stephensi</italic>, including orthologs of microtubule-associated protein 1A and myosin light chain, proteins that are critically associated with mitophagy and autophagy, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Orvedahl1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Tang1">[45]</xref>. A third cytoskeletal protein, troponin T, a member of the troponin complex, regulates the interaction of myosin light chain with actin via tropomyosin, and, therefore, is associated with actin-myosin contractility. Mutations in troponin T in mice have been associated with mitochondrial degradation and the formation of increased numbers of small, round mitochondria with loss of well-defined membranes and cristae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Tardiff1">[46]</xref>, indicating the importance of this protein in mitophagy and mitochondrial structure and function. Spectrin was also overrepresented in HM and HT <italic>An. stephensi</italic> relative to NTG females. Changes in levels of spectrin, a protein that links the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, precede autophagic cell death in salivary glands of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Martin1">[47]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The upregulation of cytoskeletal proteins associated with the progression of autophagy and mitophagy suggested some involvement of these processes in the phenotype of myrAkt <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. To address this hypothesis, we examined activation levels (phosphorylation) of autophagy-promoting ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK in the midguts of 3–5 d old, age-matched NTG and HM <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. Activation levels of all three MAPKs were reduced in the midgut of HM females relative to NTG females (by 40–60%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>), which in the context of Akt overexpression, suggested a state of disruption of normal, autophagic repair processes in the midgut epithelium. Together with our LC-MS/MS data, these data suggested that proteins associated with mitochondria and maintenance of the structure of the midgut were altered by tissue-specific Akt overexpression in <italic>An. stephensi</italic>.</p>

        <title>myrAkt overexpression resulted in abnormal midgut and mitochondrial morphologies</title>
        <p>To investigate the impact of myrAkt overexpression on general midgut morphology and on midgut mitochondrial size, number, and shape, we completed morphometric analyses on TEM micrographs from posterior midguts of age-matched, 3 d and 18 d NTG, HT, and HM female <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. While the majority of blood digestion occurs in the posterior part of the midgut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Billingsley1">[48]</xref>, this analysis provided the additional benefit of exploring a midgut region that that is enriched for endocrine cell-associated intestinal stem cells that are required for epithelial repair and maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Micchelli1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Brown1">[51]</xref>. The analyzed micrographs from the posterior midgut covered an average area of 462.9 µm<sup>2</sup> or the equivalent of 5–8 cells per posterior midgut region. Each image section included an average of 72.9 µm of the midgut epithelium brush border and the average depth of the midgut sample from the edge of the brush border to the edge of the image was 85.9 µm.</p>
        <p>The overexpression of myrAkt resulted in significant morphological changes to the <italic>An. stephensi</italic> posterior midgut (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003180-t002"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). Posterior midgut tissue of 3 d and 18 d NTG mosquitoes had a well-defined brush border, intact basal lamina, well-defined nuclei, normal lysosomes, and numerous mitochondria that tended to localize near the brush border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g002"><bold>Figs. 2A, B</bold></xref>) as observed in other insect species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Zhuang1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Beyenbach1">[54]</xref>. The midgut morphology of 3 d HT and HM females were similar to those of NTGs with most structures comparable to NTG mosquitoes. However, a significantly higher prevalence of midguts from 3 d transgenic mosquitoes had cytoplasmic inclusions (40% HT and 60% HM) that were less common or absent in midguts from NTG females (20%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003180-t002"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). Based on morphology (outer double membrane around electron dense material, membrane-like structures, membrane-bound structures with cristae-like organization; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Diedrich1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Tanaka1">[56]</xref>), these inclusions were likely stalled autophagosomes of various sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g002"><bold>Figs. 2E</bold></xref>). Mitochondrial autophagy in particular was evident as either mitochondrial membranes engulfed by a developing phagolysosome or as autophagosome-associated mitochondrial degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g002"><bold>Fig. 2E, F</bold></xref> <bold>insets</bold>).</p>

Midguts from 3 d NTG, HT, and HM <italic>An. stephensi</italic> had an intact brush border (BB) and mitochondria (M) localized near the brush border (A, C, E). Stalled autophagosomes (SA) were observed in the midguts of 3 d HM (E) and 18 d HM and HT mosquitoes (D, F). Giant stalled autophagosomes (GSA) were found in the midguts of 18 d HM and HT mosquitoes (D, F). Many SAs contained electron dense material consistent with engulfed mitochondria (E, F). An example of a clear, double membrane, autophagic vacuole fusing with a small, apparently damaged, mitochondrion in the midgut of 3 d HM (white arrowhead, E inset) indicated mitophagy in process.

The numerator indicates the number of midguts that contained a number of autophagosomes above the highest 95%CI limit. The denominator indicates the number of midguts evaluated for each condition.

        <p>Midgut epithelium is a highly aerobic tissue and deficits in energy from mitochondria, perhaps associated with altered mitophagy, would likely result in electrolyte imbalance, defective secondary active transport of cations and solutes, and increased permeability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Xiang1">[57]</xref>. To determine whether histological changes observed in HM midguts were accompanied by altered epithelial integrity, 3–5 d old NTG and HM mosquitoes were fed with fluorescent beads in reconstituted human blood meals. After 48 h – to allow complete digestion of the blood – bead numbers were quantified by flow cytometry in washed, lysed midguts and in whole mosquitoes to estimate transport of beads across the epithelium. Body bead counts (minus midgut beads) from NTG females were 2,805±593 (mean ± SEM), whereas body bead counts from HM females were nearly 2-fold higher (5,073±534; <italic>P</italic> = 0.011; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g003"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>). Therefore, the permeability of the midgut epithelium was significantly increased in 3–5 d old HM females compared to age-matched NTG females, confirming that observed histological changes in the midgut epithelium of 3–5 d old HM myrAkt <italic>An. stephensi</italic> were functionally significant.</p>

Arrowheads in nbf NTG mark location of mosquito leg and in bf NTG and bf HM images mark fluorescent beads in mosquito legs, an indication of bead passage through the midgut epithelium into the hemocoel. Note larger number of beads in bf HM compared to bf NTG <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. (D) Bead numbers per three whole mosquitoes minus bead numbers in three paired midguts from the same groups at 48 h post-feeding are represented as individual dots (means indicated as bars). Midgut beads averaged 236 for bf NTG and 225 for bf HM at 48 h post-feeding, so midgut beads accounted for less than 10% and less than 5%, respectively, of NTG and HM whole body bead counts. Data were analyzed by Student's t-test (alpha = 0.05).</p>

        <p>In 18 d NTG mosquitoes, midgut morphology was comparable to 3 d NTG mosquitoes although an increased number of lysosomes were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g002"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>).

These giant stalled autophagosomes with remnants of brush border were present only in TG mosquitoes at 18 d (50% HT and 100% HM versus 0% NTG; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003180-t002"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). In addition, in midguts of 18 d HM females mitochondria were no longer localized to the brush border, but were instead evenly distributed throughout the cell cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g002"><bold>Fig. 2F</bold></xref><bold>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003180.s001">Fig. S1B</xref></bold>).</p>
        <p>Although autophagy is required for normal mitochondrial turnover, the accumulation of inclusions suggested (i) stalled autophagy in HT and HM relative to NTG mosquitoes, (ii) normal autophagy overwhelmed by the high increase in damaged mitochondria, and (iii) over-reactive autophagy that could perhaps eliminate normal as well as dysfunctional mitochondria. In support of the first hypothesis, altered <italic>Atg6</italic> and <italic>Atg8</italic> mRNA expression levels were observed in the midgut of 18 d HM <italic>An. stephensi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g004"><bold>Fig. 4</bold></xref>). Atg6, also known as Beclin-1, is required for the generation of pre-autophagosome structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Suzuki1">[58]</xref>, while Atg8-phosphoethanolamine conjugates and the Atg5–Atg12 complex are essential components of the autophagosomal membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Ohsumi1">[59]</xref>.

        <p>Total mitochondrial content – represented as a percentage of posterior midgut area occupied by mitochondria and based on mitochondrial number and size – was significantly lower in 3 d HM females compared to 3 d NTG females (by 33%, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g005"><bold>Fig. 5D</bold></xref>), which was consistent with the reduction in mitochondria numbers in 3 d HM females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g005"><bold>Fig. 5C</bold></xref>). Interestingly, there was no corresponding decrease in the total mitochondrial content of 3 d HT females relative to 3 d NTG females. However, at 18 d after adult emergence, midguts from both HT and HM females had a significant reduction in total mitochondrial content relative to NTG females (by 29% in HT, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05; by 40%, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 in HM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g005"><bold>Fig. 5D</bold></xref>).

Accordingly, we quantified the percentages of round versus non-round mitochondria to assess the balance of fission-fusion with the assumption that functional midgut mitochondria exhibit a tubular, elongated shape while round mitochondria form in cells undergoing a response to cellular oxidative damage. We examined the shape of 2524 mitochondria in 3 d NTG, 2979 in 3 d HT, 1638 in 3 d HM, 2080 in 18 d NTG, 2154 in 18 d HT, and 2147 mitochondria in 18 d HM <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. The number of midgut epithelial cells from which we analyzed mitochondrial shape could not be determined for 18 d HT and 18 d HM mosquitoes due to extensive tissue damage induced by transgene expression in older mosquitoes. Thus, mitochondria were counted over an identical midgut area for all treatments. As expected, a high percentage of elongated, tubular mitochondria were observed in NTG midguts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g006"><bold>Fig. 6</bold></xref>). Contrary to our expectations, however, no significant differences in the percentages of round mitochondria among midguts of NTG, HM, and HT females at 3 d or 18 d or between matched genotypes at 3 d or 18 d were observed (<italic>P</italic> = 0.088). However, analysis of the distributions of small (&lt;50,000 nm<sup>2</sup>), medium (50,000–100,000 nm<sup>2</sup>), and large (&gt;100,000 nm<sup>2</sup>) round mitochondria showed significant differences between and among NTG, HT, and HM females. The distributions of small, medium, and large round mitochondria were comparable in midguts from 3 d and 18 d NTGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g006"><bold>Fig. 6</bold></xref>). However, the distributions of round mitochondria in NTGs were significantly different from those in HT and HM midguts at both 3 d and 18 d (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001). In addition, within each transgenic genotype (HT or HM), there were significant differences in mitochondrial size distributions between samples analyzed from 3 d and 18 d <italic>An. stephensi</italic> (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001). At 18 d, the occurrence of small, round mitochondria showed a gene-dose dependence from NTG to HT to HM females (30% to 48% to 65%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g006"><bold>Fig. 6</bold></xref>). The increased percentages of small mitochondria were accompanied by losses in both medium and large sized mitochondria, with percentages of both sizes trending downward from NTG to HT to HM females at 18 d. These changes in morphology appeared to be consistent with persistence of oxidative stress-induced fission, resulting in the formation of small, round mitochondria that can persist when fusion is inhibited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Gilkerson1">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Sesaki1">[63]</xref>.</p>

        <title>myrAkt overexpression was associated with reduced midgut mitochondrial function, enhanced nitrative damage</title>
        <p>Despite obvious abnormal mitochondrial morphology, our LC-MS/MS data indicated that mitochondrial proteins were overrepresented in midguts of myrAkt transgenic <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. Successful mitochondrial biogenesis requires a correct sequence of events consistent with increased and coordinated synthesis of mitochondrial precursors from the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, followed by import and assembly of nuclear-encoded subunits. Importantly, if any processes downstream from overexpression of mitochondrial proteins (including post-translational processes such as increased RNOS-mediated stress) are altered, then mitochondrial OXPHOS would be compromised despite an available excess of individual subunits. To evaluate this possibility, individual Complex activities were evaluated in whole midguts from 3 d and 18 d NTG and HM <italic>An. stephensi</italic> females along with citrate synthase, a marker for mitochondrial mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Napoli1">[8]</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003180-t003"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>). Citrate synthase activity in midguts from HM females was approximately 10% higher than NTG females at 3 d. This value contrasted with the 33% reduction in posterior midgut mitochondrial content of 3 d HM females by morphometric analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g005"><bold>Fig. 5D</bold></xref>). By 18 d, citrate synthase was decreased by 40% in the whole midgut, consistent with the 40% reduction in total mitochondrial content revealed by morphometric analyses of posterior midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g005"><bold>Fig. 5D</bold></xref>). The discrepancy at 3 d could be due to spatial changes in mitochondrial mass over time in the midgut. In particular, mitochondrial loss may be evident at 3 d only in the posterior region of the HM midgut, which was examined morphometrically, but not detectable biochemically at the level of the whole midgut at this time. By 18 d, changes in total mitochondrial content/mass may have spread from the posterior region throughout the midgut, as revealed by concordance between poster midgut morphometrics and whole midgut biochemical analyses.</p>

        <p>Examination of OXPHOS capacity revealed that in HM mosquitoes, activities of Complex I, Complex II–III and Complex V were 75% (for Complex I average of both NQR and NFR activities), 30% and 70% of NTG controls at 3 d, respectively, whereas at 18 d, these values were 50%, 40% and 50% of NTG controls, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003180-t003"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>). These activities were still lower than controls when normalized to citrate synthase, making them independent of the number of mitochondria present at any given time point in whole midguts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003180-t003"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>). Relatively lower ETC activities can result in lower OXPHOS and energy deficits. To test this hypothesis, the energy charge potential (ECP) – defined as ([ATP]+0.5*[ADP])/([ATP]+[ADP]+[AMP]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Ball1">[64]</xref>) – was evaluated in NTG and HM female midguts at 3 d and 18 d post-emergence and in whole bodies of 3 d NTG and HM females. In midguts from HM females at 3 d, the ECP showed some decline (94% of controls), which was clearly lower at 18 d (89% of controls; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003180-t003"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g007"><bold>Fig. 7</bold></xref>). In addition to local tissue effects, overexpression of myrAkt in the <italic>An. stephensi</italic> midgut was associated with significantly reduced whole body total adenosine metabolites. In particular, [ADP] (in percentage of total nucleotides) at 3 d was 2-fold higher, [AMP] was 7.7-fold higher, and ECP was significantly reduced relative to age-matched NTG controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003180-t004"><bold>Table 4</bold></xref>) despite the fact that Akt overexpression was targeted to the midgut of <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. These results (decreased ECP, higher [ADP]/[ATP] and [AMP]/[ATP] ratios) indicated clear energy deficiencies locally in the midgut and systemically in the body of HM mosquitoes, suggesting that (i) mitochondrial biogenesis could not be correctly completed (defects at import/assembly) or (ii) oxidative/nitrative stress-mediated damage overpowered this putative compensatory response.</p>

        <p>To determine whether the effects of NO were attributable specifically to direct, toxic effects on developing parasites, we examined more closely the timing of parasite death in HM females relative to parasite development in NTG <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. For these studies, we used a mouse malaria parasite infection model (GFP-expressing <italic>Plasmodium yoelii yoelii</italic> 17XNL; kindly provided by A. Rodriguez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Ono1">[72]</xref>) in addition to mosquito infection with <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. This design allowed us to examine mosquito infection using independent, quantitative measures and to determine whether NO-dependent parasite killing in myrAkt <italic>An. stephensi</italic> was unique to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> or more broadly effective against unrelated parasite species. Infection with <italic>P. y. yoelii</italic> was monitored using fluorescence quantitation, while <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection levels were assessed with quantitative, reverse-transcriptase PCR for two markers of sexual stage parasite development, <italic>Pfs16</italic> and <italic>Pfs25</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Dechering1">[73]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Moreira1">[75]</xref>.

A secondary significant drop in infection levels of HM <italic>An. stephensi</italic> relative to NTG females was observed by 48 h after infection for both parasite species – a time that coincides with ookinete to oocyst transition on the outside of the midgut epithelium for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Meis1">[77]</xref> and early oocyst development for <italic>P. y. yoelii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Vaughan1">[76]</xref> – suggesting that RNOS-mediated anti-parasite killing occurs over a broad period of parasite development.

Here, we have elucidated the mechanism for this process, demonstrating that Akt-dependent anti-parasite resistance is due to early, toxic effects of NO/RNOS followed by sustained mitochondrial dysfunction that cannot be mitigated via biogenesis and/or mitophagy/autophagy. Collectively, these phenomena lead to midgut epithelial damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g002"><bold>Figs. 2</bold></xref><bold>, S1; </bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003180-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>) and systemic energy deficiencies (as judged by ECP) that would be consistent with a reduction in lifespan and, as a consequence, a reduced infective lifespan. Activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kB-dependent immunity does not contribute to parasite resistance in myrAkt <italic>An. stephensi</italic>: Pakpour et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Pakpour1">[78]</xref> showed that activation of PI-3K-dependent signaling represses NF-KB activation in response to immune signals in <italic>An. stephensi</italic> cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Rather, overwhelming RNOS production with overexpression of myrAkt not only confers resistance to parasite infection, but also adversely impacts host infective lifespan. We would assert that balance and successful resolution of oxidative stress-induced mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis are the driving forces behind these phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g012"><bold>Fig. 12</bold></xref>) and that genetic manipulation of mitochondrial processes can provide a basis to alter multiple mosquito phenotypes to inhibit malaria parasite transmission.</p>

          <p>The overexpression of myrAkt in the <italic>An. stephensi</italic> midgut induces FOXO phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-CorbyHarris1">[5]</xref>, which results in a reduction in both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic antioxidants. This reduction leads to increased levels of ROS and RNOS, which lead to mitochondrial damage and a feedback cycle that enhances RNOS to levels that are necessary and sufficient for malaria parasite killing. Although oxidative damage is a strong activating signal for mitophagy, strong repressive signals from myrAkt overexpression and MAPK down-regulation prevent successful resolution of mitophagy, as evidenced by the accumulation of stalled autophagosomes. The incomplete resolution of mitophagy sustains oxidative stress, which results in local and systemic energy deficits, incomplete mitochondrial biogenesis, and epithelial damage that is unmitigated by autophagy-dependent stem cell differentiation. The balance between positive and negative signals for autophagy underlies autophagic regulation in and coordination of cellular homeostasis, epithelial barrier integrity, lifespan, and immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Huang1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Vereecke1">[21]</xref>.

      <p>In this study, we identified the molecular processes downstream of Akt overexpression in myrAkt <italic>An. stephensi</italic> that are involved in parasite infection resistance and reduction in lifespan. First, myrAkt protein levels in the midgut of transgenic <italic>An. stephensi</italic> increase significantly by 2 h after bloodfeeding and remain elevated above control levels through 12 h; these levels decline for the latter half of blood digestion and the reproductive cycle (24–48 h post-feeding; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-CorbyHarris1">[5]</xref>). Hence, inducible overexpression of active Akt soon after blood ingestion would be available to repress FOXO-dependent antioxidants, including mitochondrial MnSOD, allowing a rise in damaging mitochondrial RNOS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Melov1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Johnson1">[28]</xref>. We have previously demonstrated that toxic RNOS, which likely include peroxynitrite, can rise to high levels in the parasite-infected mosquito midgut after infection and that NOS-dependent killing is central to anti-parasite resistance in wild type mosquitoes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Peterson1">[79]</xref>. However, the critical differences in the current studies are that Akt overexpression (i) leads to the overproduction of NO <underline>even in the absence of infection</underline> and (ii) represses cellular mitophagy, which would normally occur in response to infection-associated oxidative/nitrative stress, resulting in much more efficient parasite killing at a cost of both local and systemic energy synthesis and renewal/repair of the midgut epithelium that are essential for host survival following infection.</p>
      <p>In addition to Akt-dependent signaling inhibition of mitophagy/autophagy, activated Akt controls mitochondrial biogenesis through phosphorylation of FOXO and exclusion of this transcriptional activator from the nucleus. In the absence of FOXO, there is no induction of PPAR-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1a), a key mediator of mitochondrial biogenesis in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-FernandezMarcos1">[80]</xref>. Rera et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Rera1">[81]</xref> demonstrated that overexpression of FOXO-dependent <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of PGC-1a led to an increase in abundance of respiratory complexes I, III, IV, and V and an increase in respiratory chain activity, indicating that control of biogenesis is conserved. Hence, in transgenic <italic>An. stephensi</italic>, activated Akt likely represses mitochondrial biogenesis through FOXO phosphorylation, which results in lower total mitochondrial content at 3 d and 18 d by morphometric analyses of the posterior midgut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g005"><bold>Fig. 5C</bold></xref>) and at 18 d as indicated by citrate synthase activity in the whole midgut (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003180-t003"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>).</p>
      <p>Despite the decrease in mitochondrial mass, we observed an upregulation of mitochondrial protein levels. A second strong signal in our system – NO synthesis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003180-t003"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref><bold>; </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g008"><bold>Figs. 8</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g009"><bold>9</bold></xref>) – provides a possible explanation for our observations. In brief, Moncada and others demonstrated in a variety of mammalian cell types that NO is a potent inducer of mitochondrial biogenesis via NO-dependent activation of guanylate cyclase, which induces PGC-1a expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Nisoli1">[82]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Nisoli3">[84]</xref>. Hence, strong activation of NO synthesis, which also occurs in response to Akt overexpression, could explain the early upregulation of mitochondrial proteins in myrAkt <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. Alternatively, direct inhibition of OXPHOS by NO results in increased AMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Giulivi1">[67]</xref>, which can activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to increase PGC-1a expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-FernandezMarcos1">[80]</xref>. In agreement with these results, we observed increased levels of mitochondrial proteins without increases in OXPHOS, an effect likely due to a combination of direct NO inhibition of OXPHOS and indirect RNOS-mediated damage to individual Complexes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003180-t003"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref><bold>; </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g008"><bold>Figs. 8</bold></xref><bold>, </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g009"><bold>9</bold></xref>).</p>
      <p>Conflicts in signaling – RNOS induction of mitophagy, Akt-dependent inhibition of mitophagy, Akt-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial biogenesis, NO/AMP-dependent induction of mitochondrial protein synthesis – are apparent in the midgut epithelium of myrAkt <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. We suggest that conflict of these signals over time results in a lack of resolution of both mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis, which ultimately results in energy deficits as judged by ECP. Deficits in energy would result in loss of midgut tissue architecture and electrolyte balance, both of which are critical for proper absorption of nutrients and barrier function. In support of these inferences, incomplete resolution of mitophagy is evident as shifting distributions toward increased small, round mitochondria and decreased large, round mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g006"><bold>Fig. 6</bold></xref>) from 3 d to 18 d in midguts of HM females and also in the progression of gene dosage from NTG to HT to HM females at 18 d. We suggest that these changes have resulted from fission of damaged mitochondria into small fragments that are not eliminated from the cell. Excessive fission has also been linked to <italic>S</italic>-nitrosylation of Drp-1 (SNO-Drp-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Cho1">[85]</xref>, which could occur in the context of high level NO synthesis in myrAkt <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. Because proteolysis and, ultimately, mitophagy are key to resolution of oxidative damage in the cell, excessive fission and accumulated damage ultimately trigger bulk autophagy, evident as giant stalled autophagosomes in midguts from 18 d HM females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003180-g002"><bold>Figs. 2</bold></xref><bold>, S1</bold>). An imbalance of fission and fusion, whereby undamaged mitochondrial fragments are reassembled in recovered cells, has been reported in a number of human disease states. In particular, Parkinson's disease-specific proteins associated with fission/fusion include PTEN-inducible kinase 1/parkin, alpha-synuclein, and HTRA2/OMI, while mutant huntingtin appears to be associated with alterations in mitochondrial fission and fusion in Huntington's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Chen1">[86]</xref>. Based on these observations and our data, an appropriate balance of mitochondrial dynamics in the mosquito midgut epithelium – in a manner analogous to that in the gut of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and the midgut of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Rera2">[87]</xref> – is likely to be key to overall mosquito vigor and vector capacity in malaria transmission.</p>
      <p>Given the complexity of mitochondrial dynamics – and the conflicting signals that balance response to and recovery from damage – how can this knowledge be harnessed for novel strategies for malaria control? That is, is it possible to genetically engineer optimal mitochondrial dynamics to promote parasite killing while maintaining competitive fitness of mosquitoes under natural conditions? In light of successful manipulation of autophagy genes and mitochondrial proteins in invertebrates and mammals to alter immunity, lifespan/cell senescence, and stem cell differentiation, we suggest that this is entirely possible in vector mosquitoes. In particular, overexpression of autophagy-related genes enhances anti-pathogen immunity, including clearance of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>-containing phagosomes in mouse macrophages and human myeloid cells <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Gutierrez1">[88]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Singh1">[89]</xref>, protection against fatal Sindbis virus infection <italic>in vivo</italic> in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Liang1">[90]</xref>, and proper localization of anti-pathogen hypersensitive responses in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Liu1">[91]</xref>. Hence, independent manipulation of mosquito autophagy genes is likely to impact pathogen resistance. In addition, moderate repression of neuronal ETC genes in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Copeland1">[92]</xref> and in neuronal and intestinal cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Durieux1">[93]</xref> can promote longevity, which in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is dependent on the upregulation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR) in the nematode intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Durieux1">[93]</xref>. The mtUPR is activated in response to mitochondrial stress that is communicated to the nucleus to increase the expression of the mitochondrial protein chaperones HSP-6 and HSP-60 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Zhao1">[94]</xref>. In addition to the relationship with longevity, mtUPR-associated HSP-60 has profound effects on immunity. In particular, HSP-60 is released from damaged or stressed cells and can act a as a potent inducer of innate immune responses, including release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NO, and is believed to be a major extracellular mediator in linking infectious agents with immune cells in response to stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Quintana1">[95]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Habich1">[96]</xref>. Further, HSP-60 peptides and protein, which bind a variety of receptors including CD36 and other class B scavenger receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Baranova1">[97]</xref>, have been delivered <italic>in vivo</italic> to enhance the immunogenicity of anti-microbial vaccines, resulting in the description of HSP-60 as a “natural adjuvant” for innate and adaptive responses to infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Quintana2">[98]</xref>. Intriguingly, the mosquito ortholog of HSP-60 (AGAP004002; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003180-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>), was upregulated in myrAkt <italic>An. stephensi</italic>, suggesting that anti-parasite resistance may be regulated in part by actions of mosquito HSP-60 via scavenger receptor binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Nichols1">[99]</xref>, which could be enhanced directly or via ETC manipulation without epithelial damage as induced by Akt overexpression.</p>
      <p>In this study, we used a well-defined model based on midgut-specific expression of a constitutively active myrAkt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-CorbyHarris1">[5]</xref> to elucidate the mechanism underlying mosquito resistance to infection. Activated Akt leads to increased steady-state reactive nitrogen and oxygen species, which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction. In a compensating response, the expression of mitochondrial proteins in the midgut is upregulated, likely by PGC-1a, to promote mitochondrial biogenesis. However, this response is countered by (i) Akt-mediated repression of autophagy and (ii) the loss of ATP from mitochondria which would ensue in dysfunctional regulation of electrolyte balance and nutrient transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Xiang1">[57]</xref>. These two effects, which resemble “accelerated aging” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Yen1">[100]</xref>, result in accumulation of damaged mitochondria and general loss of tissue structure and barrier function. Additionally, Akt activation inhibits apoptosis, suggesting that sustained activation of Akt would undermine elimination of damaged cells through a controlled death process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Zhang2">[101]</xref>. Thus, a critical point for malaria resistance is quality control of mitochondrial function in the mosquito midgut, which would support – as confirmed in mammalian and invertebrate models – the maintenance of epithelial integrity through energy homeostasis, stem cell viability, and tissue repair and renewal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Xiang1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Rera1">[81]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Cassel1">[102]</xref>. Accordingly, we assert that genetic manipulation of mitochondrial processes in the midgut as a “signaling center” can be used as the basis for an efficient and novel strategy to block malaria parasite transmission.</p>

        <title>Transmission electron microscopy and morphometric analysis of mitochondria</title>
        <p>Midguts were dissected from female mosquitoes 3 d and 18 d post adult emergence from all three treatment groups (non-transgenic, HT myrAkt, and HM myrAkt) into 1× TBS buffer (0.025 M Tris, 0.15 M sodium chloride, pH 8.0). Midguts were immediately fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PIPES buffer pH 7.4 for 1 h at room temperature and then transferred to 0.1 M PIPES buffer, pH 7.4 on ice for same day submission to the AHSCI Imaging Core Facility at University of Arizona. Five midguts per genotype for 3 d mosquitoes and four midguts per genotype for 18 d mosquitoes were processed as follows. Samples were incubated in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M PIPES for 1 h and then washed 3 times for 5 min in deionized water. Washed samples were then transferred to 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 20 min, rinsed in deionized water for 5 min and incubated in increasing concentrations of ethanol: 50% ethanol for 5 min, 70% ethanol for 5 min, 90% ethanol for 5 min, 100% ethanol for 5 min; 100% ethanol for 20 min, and 100% ethanol for 5 min. This was followed by three incubations (5 min each) in propylene oxide, followed by an overnight incubation in EmBed 812/propylene oxide (1∶1). The next day samples were incubated 3 times for 60 min in EmBed 812 resin, and, finally, flat embedded for 24 h at 60°C. Semi-thin sections (0.5 µm) were stained with 1% toluidine blue and examined with light microscopy. Thin silver sections were cut onto uncoated 150 mesh copper grids, stained with 2% aqueous lead citrate for 2 min and examined with a CM12S electron microscope operated at 80 kv. TIFF images were collected with an AMT 4Mpix CCD camera.</p>
        <p>Twenty adjacent images from individual posterior midguts were acquired at 15,000× magnification. For each individual midgut, 12 to 17 adjacent images (equivalent to ∼5–8 cells) were analyzed for morphometric analysis, with care taken to ensure that areas of the analyzed midguts were the same size for each mosquito. For each micrograph all mitochondria were outlined by hand using ImageJ software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Rasband1">[105]</xref>. The area of each individual mitochondrion, the total mitochondrial area and the total number of mitochondria were determined using ImageJ. The numbers of round (presumably damaged) and elongated (healthy) mitochondria were counted for each image, and round mitochondria were further classified by size (&lt;50 K, 50–100 K, and &gt;100 K nm<sup>2</sup>). Vacuoles with electron dense content, small stalled autophagosomes with membrane material, large stalled autophagosomes with membrane material and giant stalled autophagosomes with brush border were counted for all midguts. Two 95% confidence intervals (CI) were constructed using NTG values at 3 and 18 d ([4.4, 17.9] and [7.7, 33.8]) to identify posterior midguts that contained a number of autophagosomes above the highest 95%CI limit. Chi-square test (alpha = 0.5) was used to compare NTG versus HT, NTG versus HM, and HT versus HM. In addition, the area of each midgut epithelial cell on each micrograph, the length of the brush border, and depth from the brush border were measured. Total mitochondrial content was determined by dividing the total mitochondrial area in one midgut by the total area examined in that midgut. The data for mitochondria size, total mitochondrial area and total number of mitochondria were analyzed using two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer HSD test. Proportions of round mitochondria were analyzed with ANOVA following arcsin transformation. Size distributions of round mitochondria among treatments were analyzed by contingency analysis followed by specific pairwise comparisons.</p>

        <p>Cultured parasites were grown in 10% heat-inactivated human serum and 6% washed human red blood cells (RBCs; Interstate Blood Bank, Memphis, TN) in RPMI 1640 with HEPES (Gibco) and hypoxanthine for 15 days, or until stage V gametocytes were evident. Exflagellation rates of mature gametocytes were evaluated on the day prior to and the day of mosquito infection. Mosquitoes were fed on mature gametocyte cultures diluted with human RBCs and heat-inactivated human serum (Interstate Blood Bank) for 30 min. Experimental treatments were added to the diluted culture just before blood feeding. After feeding, blood fed mosquitoes were maintained on the same treatments, provided as water-soaked sterile cotton balls and changed twice daily, until dissection. Protocols involving the culture and handling of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> for mosquito feeding were approved and in accordance with regulatory guidelines and standards set by the Biological Safety Administrative Advisory Committee of the University of California, Davis.</p>

This experiment was repeated four times with four separate cohorts of mosquitoes. After 10 d, fully gravid females were dissected and midguts were stained with 0.1% mercurochrome to visualize <italic>P. falciparum</italic> oocysts. Oocysts were counted for each midgut and mean oocysts per midgut (infection intensity) and percentages of infected mosquitoes (infection prevalence; infection defined as at least one oocyst) were calculated for all dissected mosquitoes. Infection prevalence data were analyzed by Fisher's exact test to determine whether infection status differed between treatment conditions. Infection intensity data were analyzed by ANOVA to determine whether the oocysts per midgut in the controls differed among replicates. Since no differences were evident, the data were pooled across replicates. The numbers of infected mosquitoes in the water and <italic>D</italic>-NAME groups were outside the 95% confidence intervals for the NTG (1.79,3.05) and <italic>L</italic>-NAME (1.41,4.01) groups and, therefore, were excluded from analyses of the latter data. Oocyst counts between <italic>L</italic>-NAME and NTG groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric data.</p>

        <title>Timing of malaria parasite killing in myrAkt HM <italic>An. stephensi</italic></title>
        <p>To determine the timing of parasite killing in myrAkt HM <italic>An. stephensi</italic> relative to NTG controls, we examined infection of HM and NTG mosquitoes with GFP-expressing <italic>Plasmodium yoelii yoelii</italic> 17XNL and with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> NF54. For <italic>P. y. yoelii</italic> studies, CD1 mice were infected with the 17XNL strain stably transfected with green fluorescent protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Ono1">[72]</xref> and parasitemia and gametocytemia were monitored daily via Giemsa staining of thin blood films. At approximately 9 d post infection (parasitemia of 15–18%), mice were anesthetized and used to feed laboratory-reared 3–5 d, female HM and NTG <italic>An. stephensi</italic> (n = 125 per group). Mosquitoes were maintained on water for 24 h prior to blood feeding, and then allowed to feed for 30 min (mice were rotated among cartons to ensure uniform infections). At 6, 20 and 48 h post-feeding, midguts were dissected into PBS (Cellgro). As an experimental control, HM and NTG mosquitoes were also fed on uninfected CD1 mice. Three pools of 10 midguts were collected at each time point, homogenized using QIAshredder homogenizer columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), serially diluted and then scanned at 485 nm excitation/535 nm emission wavelengths. Additionally, infected and uninfected blood was collected directly from mice via cardiac puncture and fluorescence readings were obtained for serial dilutions of this blood. Parasitemia and hematocrit counts were determined by Giemsa stained thin blood smears and by hemocytometer, and the fluorescent values used as a standard for <italic>P. yoelii</italic> fluorescence in midgut samples. This experiment was repeated three times with three separate cohorts of mosquitoes and infected mice.</p>
        <p>For assessment of timing for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> killing, laboratory-reared 3–5 d female myrAkt HM and NTG <italic>An. stephensi</italic> (n = 150 per group) were maintained on water for 24 h prior to blood feeding. TG and NTG mosquitoes were provided blood meals containing <italic>P. falciparum</italic> NF54-infected RBCs and allowed to feed for 30 min. Midguts from blood-fed females were dissected into TriZOL reagent (Invitrogen) at 6, 18 and 48 h post infection and homogenized using pulse sonication. RNA was extracted from homogenates following the manufacturer's protocol. Contaminating genomic DNA was removed from RNA samples using Turbo DNAse Free Kit (Applied Biosystems/Life Technologies, Foster City, CA). Reverse transcription was carried out with the Superscript III cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). Real time quantitative PCR reactions were performed using Fermentas Maxima SYBR Green Master Mix (Fermentas ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA). Reactions were performed in 25 µl volumes containing 200 µg cDNA and 0.5 µM gene specific primers. Each cDNA sample was analyzed in triplicate (all Cts within 0.5 units to confirm amplification consistency) on an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System. Primers were based on Berry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Berry1">[106]</xref> to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genes <italic>Pfs16</italic>, <italic>Pfs25</italic>, and <italic>A18S</italic> rRNA. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 50°C/2 min; 95°C/10 min; 50 cycles with 95°C/15 sec denaturing and 60°C/1 min annealing-elongation. Since expression of <italic>A18S</italic> rRNA is high in all parasite stages and varies with the parasitemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003180-Berry1">[106]</xref>, this gene and the ribosomal protein S7 gene (<italic>An. stephensi</italic>) were used to normalize parasite gene target data.

Non-blood fed mosquitoes were removed and, at 48 h post blood feeding, samples of three whole mosquitoes or three dissected midguts were placed in cell lysis buffer (Invitrogen), pulse sonicated, and filtered through a 35 µm nylon mesh to remove tissue debris. Pelleted samples were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Data acquisition was performed with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and analysis was conducted using FlowJo software (version 6.4.1; Tree Star, Ashland, OR). The number of beads per three midguts was quantified and subtracted from each analyzed sample of three whole mosquitoes to remove the contribution of beads remaining in the midgut to whole body bead counts. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t-test.</p>
