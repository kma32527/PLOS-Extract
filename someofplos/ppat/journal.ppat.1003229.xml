      <abstract>
        <p>Detrimental inflammation of the lungs is a hallmark of severe influenza virus infections. Endothelial cells are the source of cytokine amplification, although mechanisms underlying this process are unknown. Here, using combined pharmacological and gene-deletion approaches, we show that plasminogen controls lung inflammation and pathogenesis of infections with influenza A/PR/8/34, highly pathogenic H5N1 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses. Reduction of virus replication was not responsible for the observed effect. However, pharmacological depletion of fibrinogen, the main target of plasminogen reversed disease resistance of plasminogen-deficient mice or mice treated with an inhibitor of plasminogen-mediated fibrinolysis. Therefore, plasminogen contributes to the deleterious inflammation of the lungs and local fibrin clot formation may be implicated in host defense against influenza virus infections. Our studies suggest that the hemostatic system might be explored for novel treatments against influenza.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Influenza viruses, including H5N1 bird influenza viruses continue to form a major threat for public health. Available antiviral drugs for the treatment of influenza are effective to a limited extent and the emergence of resistant viruses may further undermine their use. The symptoms associated with influenza are caused by replication of the virus in the respiratory tract and the host immune response. Here, we report that a molecule of the fibrinolytic system, plasminogen, contributes to inflammation caused by influenza. Inhibiting the action of plasminogen protected mice from severe influenza infections, including those caused by H5N1 and H1N1 pandemic 2009 viruses and may be a promising novel strategy to treat influenza.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Influenza A viruses (IAV) are an important cause of outbreaks of respiratory tract infections and are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in the human population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Knipe1">[1]</xref>. Upon infection with IAV, innate and adaptive immune responses are induced that restrict viral replication and that afford protection against infection with these viruses. However, excessive inflammation, particularly in the lower respiratory tract, may result in alveolar damage limiting respiratory capacity and deteriorate the clinical outcome of IAV infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Kuiken1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-LaGruta1">[3]</xref>. Dys-regulation of cytokine production in the lungs is thus often associated with a fatal outcome of IAV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-deJong1">[4]</xref>. The sites of virus replication in the respiratory tract represent complex microenvironments, in which extracellular proteases are present abundantly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Reed1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Sokolova1">[6]</xref>. Some of these proteases can play a role in innate immune responses since they are important mediators of inflammatory processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Steinhoff1">[7]</xref> and influence virus replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Bradley1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Khoufache1">[9]</xref>. To date, however, the elucidation of host proteases contributing to pathogenesis of IAV infections <italic>in vivo</italic> has been hampered by the lack of experimental models.</p>
      <p>One of the proteases of interest is plasmin, which is a serine protease involved in fibrinolysis, the biological process of dissolving fibrin polymers into soluble fragments. Plasmin is generated through cleavage of the proenzyme plasminogen, produced in the liver and present in the blood. Specific binding and conversion of plasminogen into plasmin by IAV may afford the virus an alternative protease for cleavage of its hemagglutinin molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-LeBouder1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-LeBouder2">[11]</xref>. This is an essential step in the virus replication cycle and this may contribute to the pathogenesis of IAV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Goto1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Goto2">[13]</xref>. In addition, plasminogen/plasmin plays a central role in fibrinolysis-mediated inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-vanHinsbergh1">[14]</xref> and there is evidence of fibrinolysis activation during IAV infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Keller1">[15]</xref>. Thus, plasminogen could contribute to the pathogenesis of IAV infections by promoting virus replication or by inducing a fibrinolysis-dependent harmful inflammatory response in the respiratory tract. At present it is unknown whether one or both of these two mechanisms of plasminogen activity contribute to pathogenesis of IAV infections <italic>in vivo</italic>. In the present study we address this research question and using plasminogen-deficient mice (PLG-KO) and pharmacological approaches the role of plasminogen during IAV infections was investigated.</p>
      <p>Our findings show that plasminogen plays an important role in lung inflammation upon IAV infections, mainly through fibrinolysis. Therefore, targeting host factors, such as the fibrinolytic molecule plasminogen may be of interest for the development of new therapeutics against IAV infections.</p>

        <title>Plasminogen promotes IAV pathogenesis</title>
        <p>To explore the role of plasminogen in IAV pathogenesis, we investigated the consequence of plasminogen-deficiency. Plasminogen +/− mice were intercrossed to generate wild-type (WT) and plasminogen −/− (PLG-KO) mice, which were infected with IAV A/PR/8/34 (H1N1; 50,000 or 500 PFU) and weight loss and survival rates were monitored. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, compared to WT mice, PLG-KO mice were significantly more resistant to IAV-induced weight loss and death. In PLG-KO mice substantial protection was also observed against infection with 2009 pandemic virus A/Netherlands/602/09 (30,000 PFU, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and highly pathogenic H5N1 virus A/chicken/Ivory-Coast/1787/2006 (10 EID50 H5N1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Of note, the latter was not adapted to replicate in mammals, which could explain the delay in weight loss observed upon infection, as also observed by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Manz1">[16]</xref>. Thus, we concluded that without plasminogen, pathogenesis of IAV infections was dampened and mortality reduced in a subtype-independent manner.</p>

        <p>To gain further insight into the role of plasminogen in virus replication, A549 cells were infected with IAV in the absence or presence of plasminogen. Interestingly, plasminogen supported the replication of IAV A/PR/8/34 but not that of A/Netherlands/602/09 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, trypsin supported replication of both viruses while no replication was observed in absence of proteases. Since plasminogen promotes IAV replication through HA cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-LeBouder2">[11]</xref>, plasminogen-mediated HA cleavage of both viruses was compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In absence of proteases (−), HA0 precursor protein was detected in A549 cells infected with either virus. In presence of plasminogen (PLG), an additional band, corresponding to HA2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-LeBouder2">[11]</xref> was detected at 25 kDa in A/PR/8/34, but not in A/Netherlands/602/09 infected cells. In presence of trypsin (Try), HA2 was detected in cells infected with either virus. Similar levels of tubulin were detected, which was included as control cellular protein. Thus, plasminogen promotes cleavage of HA of IAV A/PR/8/34 but not that of A/Netherlands/602/09, which correlated with differences in replicative capacity of these viruses in presence of plasminogen.</p>

        <p>To assess possible other contributions of plasminogen to the pathogenesis of IAV infections, inflammation of the lungs and viral dissemination were examined after infection of mice with IAV A/PR/8/34 or A/Netherlands/602/09.

        <p>To investigate the difference in pulmonary inflammation between PLG-KO and WT mice, cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) were assessed by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) or a luminex-based cytokine detection assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) at various time point post-infection. Upon inoculation of A/PR/8/34 virus, both in PLG-KO and WT mice, BAL cytokine levels increased 2 and 5 days post-inoculation. However, in BAL of PLG-KO mice cytokine levels were considerably and significantly lower than in those of WT littermates (see scale differences for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), which correlated with reduced IAV-induced lung inflammation in absence of plasminogen. Upon A/Netherlands/602/09 virus infection, release of cytokines in the BAL was also significantly higher in WT mice compared to PLG-KO mice at day 5 but not at day 2 post-inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, right panel). Thus in concordance with the histological analysis, plasminogen promoted lung inflammation of IAV A/PR/8/34 and A/Netherlands/602/09 viruses, showing that the effect is most likely independent of virus replication in the lungs. Furthermore, in PLG-KO mice the virus failed to disseminate to extra pulmonary organs unlike in WT mice, upon intranasal infection with A/PR/8/34 virus (500 PFU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Especially high virus titers were detected in the liver, the source of plasminogen.

        <title>Fibrinolysis and IAV pathogenesis</title>
        <p>Since degradation of fibrin is one of the main functions of plasminogen/plasmin, we hypothesized that the host fibrinolytic system plays a role in the pathogenesis of IAV infection. First, we investigated whether IAV infection induced fibrinolysis. To this end, mice were inoculated with IAV A/PR/8/34 and at various time points post-inoculation, the level of fibrinolysis markers in BALs was assessed by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Plasminogen and active plasmin levels were barely detectable in the BAL of uninfected mice but their levels significantly increased during the course of infection. Levels of fibrinogen also significantly increased at day 4 post-infection and then dropped at days 5 and 6, suggesting a recruitment of fibrinogen to the lungs and a rapid consumption of the molecule and fibrinolysis. Finally, levels of FDP and D-dimers, degradation products of fibrinolysis, significantly increased upon infection, reaching 45 and 13 ng/ml respectively on day 6 post-inoculation. Similar results were also obtained upon infection with influenza virus A/Netherlands/602/09 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). As expected, in the BAL of infected PLG-KO mice, used as negative control, fibrinolysis markers were barely detectable. Thus, IAV infection induced fibrinolysis. These results were confirmed by Western blot analysis using an antibody directed against the mouse Aα chain of fibrinogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), which recognizes purified mouse fibrinogen at a molecular weight of 66 kDa (data not shown). Compared to uninfected mice (−), fibrinogen was readily detectable 2–6 days post-inoculation in the lungs of infected mice. In the tissues, no marked fibrinogen consumption was detected but during the course of IAV infection, additional smaller bands corresponding to FDP were observed in mouse lungs. These findings confirmed that fibrinolysis took place during IAV infections <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

        <p>To simulate the depletion of fibrin (and therefore fibrinolysis), mice were treated with the snake venom Ancrod, a thrombin-like protease that cleaves the Aα chain of fibrinogen, enhancing its degradation and severely reducing its plasma levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Treatment with Ancrod significantly increased IAV-induced weight loss and mortality compared to vehicle-treated mice, but had no effect on uninfected control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). This increased mortality was also associated with an increase in inflammation of the lungs, as detected by elevated cytokine levels in the BAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, WT). Of particular interest, the level of interferon-gamma was barely detectable in untreated mice but severely increased upon ancrod treatment.

        <title>Plasminogen promotes IAV pathogenesis through fibrinolysis</title>
        <p>Next, we investigated whether Ancrod treatment could reverse the protective effect of plasminogen-deficiency in terms of inflammation and mortality rate. Again, PLG-KO mice were protected from lung inflammation (p&lt;0,05, between WT versus PLG-KO), as judged from cytokine responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) and from IAV-induced mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Interestingly, Ancrod-treatment reversed the protection observed in the absence of plasminogen and cytokine responses and mortality rates were similar to those of Ancrod treated WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g006">Figure 6B and C</xref>, p&gt;0.05, between WT-treated and PLG-KO-treated ancrod). Ancrod had no effect in uninfected mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003229.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, fibrinolysis contributes to inflammation and pathogenesis of IAV infections, which is mediated by plasminogen.</p>
        <p>To further confirm if the deleterious role of plasminogen is caused by fibrinolysis, we tested the outcome of infection of mice after treatment with Ancrod and/or 6-aminohexanoic acid (6-AHA). Indeed, 6-AHA is a lysine analogue that binds to the lysine binding sites of plasminogen, inhibiting plasminogen-binding to fibrin(ogen) and plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Prentice1">[17]</xref>. First, 6-AHA treated mice inoculated with 5,000 or 500 PFU of A/PR/8/34 were significantly more resistant to infection than untreated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) and this protection correlated with reduced inflammation in 6-AHA treated animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003229.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Also, lung virus titers were significantly lower in 6-AHA-treated mice compared to untreated mice, at day 2 but not at days 3 or 5 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Thus, inhibition of plasminogen fibrinolytic activity protected mice from developing pneumonitis and severe disease. Furthermore, Ancrod-treatment of 6-AHA treated mice over-rode the protective effect of 6-AHA, again resulting in IAV-induced mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, lower panel). Administration of Ancrod and/or 6-AHA had no effect in uninfected mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003229.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Thus, the protective effect of 6-AHA was reversed by Ancrod-mediated fibrinogen degradation, demonstrating that plasminogen contributed to pathogenesis of IAV infection through fibrinolysis activation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study showed for the first time that fibrinolysis plays a central role in the inflammatory response and the pathogenesis of IAV infections. Consistently, evidence is accumulating that the fibrinolytic molecule plasminogen and plasmin are critical host factors for immune cell infiltration and cytokine production upon injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Gong1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Syrovets1">[20]</xref>. The absence of plasminogen blunts inflammation in response to several inflammatory stimuli and suppresses development of lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-OConnell1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Moons1">[23]</xref>. In our study, absence of plasminogen also considerably reduced the extent of lung inflammation upon IAV infection. Since severe inflammation contributes to the pathogenicity of IAV infections of humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Kuiken1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-deJong1">[4]</xref>, most likely the proinflammatory properties of plasminogen play a role in the pathogenesis of these infections. IAV have the capacity to bind plasminogen and convert it into its active form plasmin through viral or cellular proteins like annexin-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-LeBouder2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Goto1">[12]</xref>. However, the extent of plasminogen activation is strain-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-LeBouder2">[11]</xref>, which may explain differences in pathogenicity of IAV strains.</p>
      <p>Mechanistically, the mode of action of plasminogen-driven lung inflammation was through fibrinolysis. Indeed, degradation of fibrinogen by Ancrod treatment increased pathogenicity of IAV infection and compensated the protective effect in PLG-KO mice or in mice in which plasminogen fibrinolytic activity was blocked by 6-AHA treatment. Consistently, Keller et al showed an activation of the fibrinolytic system during non-pathogenic IAV infection in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Keller1">[15]</xref>. Remarkably, in humans increased production of D-dimer, a marker of fibrinolysis was found to be a risk factor for fatal outcome of H5N1 and pandemic H1N1 virus infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Soepandi1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Wang1">[25]</xref>. Furthermore, IAV infections have been associated with bleeding medical disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Urso1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Okayama1">[27]</xref>. Thus, as for bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Degen1">[28]</xref>, the dysregulation of hemostasis by virus infections may cause serious complications. Consistent with our results, it was recently demonstrated that endothelial cells are central orchestrators of cytokine amplification during IAV infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Teijaro1">[29]</xref>. Interestingly, plasminogen-dependent inflammation appears early after infection with influenza virus A/PR/8/34, of which virus replication is promoted by plasminogen. In contrast, replication of influenza virus A/Netherlands/602/09 is independent of plasminogen and control of plasminogen activity has a delayed impact on inflammation and disease. Thus, the capability of plasminogen to cleave HA and promote virus replication may also contribute to lung inflammation for some IAV strains. Possibly, a sustained high degree of inflammation is deleterious for the host.</p>
      <p>Collectively, we propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003229-g008">Figure 8</xref>) in which plasminogen-mediated fibrinolysis increases FDP production and vascular permeability allowing increase recruitment of inflammatory cells at the site of infection. As a positive feedback loop, plasminogen mediated virus replication may also further contribute to lung inflammation. Fibrinolysis may also allow systemic haematogenous spread of virus. Consistently, we and others detected IAV replication in extrapulmonary organs in plasminogen-competent mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Fislova1">[30]</xref>. Since plasminogen is omnipresent in the blood, it may provide certain IAV an alternative mechanism of HA cleavage in extra-pulmonary organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-LeBouder1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-LeBouder2">[11]</xref>. For example, the plasminogen-binding property of the neuraminidase of A/WSN/33 strain is a determinant of its neurotropism and pathogenicity in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Goto1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Goto2">[13]</xref>. Interestingly, particular high virus titers were found in the liver, which is the primary source of plasminogen. This may explain why IAV can replicate in hepatocarcinoma liver HEPG-2 cells in the absence of exogenous proteases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003229.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Whether plasminogen-dependent IAV replication contributes to damage of the liver or other extra-pulmonary organs, as observed in Reye's syndrome or other postinfluenza complications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-SanchezLanier1">[31]</xref> requires further investigation. Interestingly, differences in virus replication were not at the basis of plasminogen-dependent differences in pathogenesis of IAV infection although it also can contribute to exacerbation of inflammation. Indeed, A/Netherland/602/09 virus replication in the lungs was not affected by plasminogen deficiency, while infected PLG-KO mice were protected from infection. This is consistent with a recent report showing that presence of critical residues in HA, necessary for cleavage by plasmin is strain-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Sun1">[32]</xref>. In addition, the HA of A/chicken/Ivory-Coast/1787/2006 contains a polybasic site, which is cleaved by furin-type proteases. This suggests that plasminogen plays a minor role in replication of this virus, while plasminogen deficiency still protected from infection with this virus. Alternative proteases may thus play a more dominant role in HA cleavage and virus replication <italic>in vivo</italic> than plasminogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Zhirnov1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Chaipan1">[36]</xref>.</p>

          <title>Schematic overview of the proposed model for Plasminogen-mediated influenza virus pathogenesis.</title>
          <p>During IAV infection, plasminogen is converted into plasmin. On the one hand, plasmin cleaves and activates the viral hemagglutinin, promoting IAV replication for some influenza strains. On the other hand, plasmin promotes inflammation via fibrinolysis and increases permeability.</p>

      <p>For the clinical management of influenza patients, a limited number of antiviral drugs are available. The use of these currently available drugs is compromised by the emergence of virus strains that developed resistance to these drugs. Therefore, intervention strategies that aim at preventing deleterious inflammatory responses after IAV infection are of interest and do not suffer from resistance to antiviral drugs. Specifically, blocking protease activity may be an efficient way to achieve this, as previously suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Zhirnov2">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003229-Zhirnov3">[39]</xref>. Our results are consistent with these studies but differ in term of mechanism of action. Indeed, our results suggest a more predominant role for proteases in lung hemostasis compared to virus replication and HA cleavage.</p>
      <p>In summary, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for fibrinolysis and plasminogen in the pathogenesis of IAV infections. Thus, targeting plasminogen, its conversion into plasmin or regulating fibrinolysis may be a venue for the development of novel intervention strategies for the treatment of severe IAV infections.</p>
