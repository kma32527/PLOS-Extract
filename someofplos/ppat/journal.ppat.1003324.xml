<abstract>
<p><italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> causes pneumonic plague, a disease characterized by inflammation, necrosis and rapid bacterial growth which together cause acute lung congestion and lethality. The bacterial type III secretion system (T3SS) injects 7 effector proteins into host cells and their combined activities are necessary to establish infection. <italic>Y. pestis</italic> infection of the lungs proceeds as a biphasic inflammatory response believed to be regulated through the control of apoptosis and pyroptosis by a single, well-conserved T3SS effector protein YopJ. Recently, YopJ-mediated pyroptosis, which proceeds via the NLRP3-inflammasome, was shown to be regulated by a second T3SS effector protein YopK in the related strain <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic>. In this work, we show that for <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, YopK appears to regulate YopJ-mediated apoptosis, rather than pyroptosis, of macrophages. Inhibition of caspase-8 blocked YopK-dependent apoptosis, suggesting the involvement of the extrinsic pathway, and appeared cell-type specific. However, in contrast to <italic>yopJ</italic>, deletion of <italic>yopK</italic> caused a large decrease in virulence in a mouse pneumonic plague model. YopK-dependent modulation of macrophage apoptosis was observed at 6 and 24 hours post-infection (HPI). When YopK was absent, decreased populations of macrophages and dendritic cells were seen in the lungs at 24 HPI and correlated with resolution rather than progression of inflammation. Together the data suggest that <italic>Y. pestis</italic> YopK may coordinate the inflammatory response during pneumonic plague through the regulation of apoptosis of immune cells.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In this work, we studied the mechanism whereby bacteria manipulate innate immune responses by controlling host cell death. <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, the causative agent of plague, requires effector Yops of the Type III Secretion System (T3SS) to evade the innate immune system during infection. We show that <italic>Yersinia</italic> induces apoptosis of macrophages through two distinct mechanisms, each through the activity of the well-characterized T3SS effector YopJ, yet regulated in an opposing manner through the activity of a second effector protein YopK. In a murine pneumonic plague model, we found evidence that YopK regulates apoptosis of macrophages during the early stage of infection, leading to uncontrolled inflammation and disease. In contrast, the absence of YopK-regulated apoptosis allowed recruitment of lymphocytes and CCR2<sup>+</sup> immune cells which led to bacterial clearance and resolution of inflammation. Together the data suggest that <italic>Yersinia</italic> YopK modulates apoptosis of immune cells to control the inflammatory response during plague.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Acute bacterial pneumonia is the result of active colonization of the airspace in the lungs combined with host inflammation that is unable to resolve due to host-pathogen interactions as well as progressing host- and microbial- induced injury. Resident macrophages in the lungs play an important role in orchestrating the mucosal immune response and subsequent tissue repair following infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Janssen1">[1]</xref>. Alveolar and interstitial macrophages act as sentinel cells and react to pathogen-associated molecular patterns following bacterial invasion of the lung mucosa by activating pro-inflammatory cytokine production and phagocytosis. Following chemotaxis, neutrophils are the primary mediators of bacterial clearance. After neutrophils destroy invading extracellular bacteria, interstitial macrophages activate a resolution program, allowing efferocytosis and clearance of apoptotic neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Moreira1">[2]</xref>. Activated alveolar macrophages retain a pro-inflammatory role and apoptosis of these macrophages signals the down-regulation of inflammation and induction of tissue repair. When efferocytosis by interstitial macrophages does not occur, increased severity of pneumonia results while, conversely, treatment of mice with apoptotic macrophages is protective against lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Marriott1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Borges1">[4]</xref>. Apoptosis provides both pro- and anti-inflammatory signals and each is necessary to prevent bacterial pneumonia.</p>
<p><italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> is a Gram negative bacterium that causes bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic plague <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Pollitzer1">[5]</xref>. Expression of multiple virulence factors together allow evasion and manipulation of the host innate immune system and rapid replication in the midst of a massive pro-inflammatory response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Fetherston1">[6]</xref>. Pulmonary infection of mammals progresses as an acute bronchopneumonia, with an initial delay in inflammatory responses thought to be important to successful infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Bergsbaken1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Bubeck1">[8]</xref>. Near 48 hours post-infection (HPI), bacteria multiply rapidly and cause host cell pyroptosis and necrosis and a large pro-inflammatory response. Neutrophils form coalescing foci of inflammation that are unable to combat the massive bacterial growth, and acute bronchopneumonia rapidly overtakes the host. Depletion of neutrophils early following infection increases the sensitivity of mice to pneumonic plague suggesting that neutrophils are, at least initially, active against <italic>Y. pestis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Laws1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>The type III secretion system (T3SS) is responsible for the injection of anti-host effector proteins, collectively known as Yops, into phagocytic and other mammalian cells and is essential for virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Huang1">[10]</xref>. Upon host cell contact, insertion of a translocation pore into the plasma membrane allows injection of Yops from the bacteria to the host cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Rosqvist1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Petersson1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Neyt1">[13]</xref>. Each Yop likely has a distinct role in the pathogenesis of infection because <italic>Y. pestis</italic> strains lacking individual effector proteins have varied virulence defects ranging from mild to severe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Straley1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Holmstrom1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Nemeth1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Logsdon1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Lemaitre1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Cantwell1">[19]</xref>. Yop-mediated host cell death and modulation of inflammatory responses have been demonstrated and are important to the pathogenesis of plague. The T3SS effector protein YopJ is a deubiquitinase and acetyltransferase whose activity blocks signaling by mitogen activated protein kinase, prevents NF-κB activation and leads to decreased production of anti-apoptotic proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Monack1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Mukherjee1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Orth1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Orth2">[23]</xref>. Yet in spite of these immune-modulating activities, YopJ is largely dispensable for virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Lemaitre1">[18]</xref>. Moreover, the evolution of <italic>Yersinia</italic> towards increased virulence includes reductive secretion of YopJ suggesting selective pressure against YopJ activity for the development of plague <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Zauberman1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Brodsky1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>Translocation of effector Yops is believed to be controlled by YopK, whose activity has been shown to modulate the size of the translocation pore in red blood cells and epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Holmstrom2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Dewoody1">[27]</xref>. YopK is translocated into host cells where it localizes to the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Dewoody1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Garcia1">[28]</xref>. In addition, recent evidence supports a role for YopK in modulating inflammatory responses. Insertion of the translocation pore by a <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> strain lacking most of the Yop effectors resulted in activation of caspase-1 and the inflammasome, subsequent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pyroptotic cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Bergsbaken2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Shin1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Lilo1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Schotte1">[32]</xref>. YopK was therefore proposed to remain associated with the translocation pore where it could suppress inflammasome activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Brodsky2">[33]</xref>. Nevertheless, <italic>in vivo</italic>, YopK was dispensable for caspase-1-mediated host defense suggesting additional function for YopK in <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> virulence. <italic>Y. pestis</italic> is believed to evade inflammasome activation at least in part, due to the presence of a non-canonical lipopolysaccharide structure, not present in <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic>, which does not stimulate Toll-like receptor 4 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Montminy1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Valdimer1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this work, we found that YopK mediates inflammatory responses in a murine model of pneumonic plague. We show that YopK is necessary for YopJ-dependent activation of apoptosis of monocyte-like macrophages but for alveolar macrophages, deletion of YopK resulted in increased apoptosis. Using small molecule inhibitors, we show that YopK activity in RAW 264.7 cells is independent of caspase-9, acting upstream of caspase-8 in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. <italic>In vivo</italic>, YopK is necessary for virulence, and its deletion caused a 5,000-fold increase in lethal dose. YopK-dependent modulation of macrophage apoptosis was observed during the first 24 hrs of infection and led to recruitment of macrophages, prevention of dendritic cell migration and subsequent progression of inflammation and disease. In contrast, lung inflammation and congestion were observed early but were quickly followed by a resolution program in the absence of YopK. Pro-inflammatory cytokine production was not affected by YopK <italic>in vitro</italic>. Nevertheless, elevated levels of MCP-1 persisted throughout the <italic>yopK</italic> infection <italic>in vivo</italic> and the MCP-1 receptor, CCR2, was involved in host defense. Together, the data suggest that YopK modulates inflammation through the control of macrophage and perhaps other immune cell apoptosis for the rapid development of pneumonic plague.</p>

<p>Previous data on the function of YopK employed <italic>in vitro</italic> infection models of epithelial cells where increased injection of effector Yops has been demonstrated using cell fractionation and reporter assays examining a subset of Yops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Holmstrom2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Dewoody1">[27]</xref>. However, it is known that during infection, <italic>Y. pestis</italic> targets phagocytic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Marketon1">[37]</xref>. We therefore sought to characterize the <italic>yopK</italic> mutant <italic>in vitro</italic> using macrophage infection models to better understand the potential impact of YopK in plague. Towards this end, we employed functional assays and first measured the induction of apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells, a mouse monocyte-macrophage cell line. Caspase-3-dependent apoptosis of macrophages is caused by the T3SS effector YopJ, which has been shown to have increased translocation in the absence of <italic>yopK</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Dewoody1">[27]</xref>. Thus, we anticipated that more caspase-3 activation would be observed in the <italic>yopK</italic> mutant due to the increased effector Yop translocation. Unexpectedly, however, the <italic>yopK</italic> mutant did not cause increased cleavage of caspase-3 but rather significantly less cleavage was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This phenotype could be complemented by expressing YopK on a low copy plasmid from its native promoter. In contrast, <italic>Y. pestis</italic>-induced lysis of RAW 264.7 macrophages was not significantly affected by YopK, and 25–30% LDH release was observed following infection by WT and <italic>yopK</italic> mutant <italic>Y. pestis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Host-cell lysis was dependent on the T3SS, however, and only 5% LDH release was observed following infection of RAW macrophages with <italic>Y. pestis</italic> lacking the T3SS virulence plasmid pCD1.</p>
<p>We also tested whether MH-S cells, a murine alveolar macrophage cell line, induced increased amounts of YopK-dependent caspase-3 activity following <italic>Y. pestis</italic> infection. In sharp contrast to RAW 264.7 cells, MH-S cells infected with <italic>Y. pestis yopK</italic> had significantly increased caspase-3 cleavage, consistent with increased translocation of YopJ due to the deregulation of the translocation pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). When <italic>yopK</italic> expression was complemented on a recombinant plasmid, however, levels of caspase-3 cleavage were significantly decreased to levels below that caused by the WT strain. This result is also consistent with a role for YopK as a regulator of pore size in the plasma membrane of MH-S cells where increased expression and translocation of YopK would be predicted to result in decreased injection of Yops. Furthermore, LDH release by infected MH-S cells was overall low, and only 3–5% LDH release was observed following infection by WT and <italic>yopK</italic> mutant <italic>Y. pestis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). This low level of MH-S cell lysis was dependent on the T3SS as less than 1% LDH release was observed following infection by pCD1 mutant bacteria.</p>
<p>Previous data indicated that YopK amino acid residue D46 was important for function whereas residue T45 was dispensable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Dewoody2">[38]</xref>. We therefore engineered these point mutations into the yopK complementing plasmid and tested them for the ability to complement the <italic>yopK</italic> mutant in inducing apoptosis of RAW macrophages. Indeed, mutation of D46 resulted in loss of YopK function and no complementation of apoptosis was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). In contrast, T45 was dispensable and this mutant fully complemented apoptosis of RAW macrophages. Together, the genetic data support a role for YopK in the induction of apoptosis in RAW macrophages.</p>

<title><italic>Y. pestis</italic> induces caspase-3 activation in RAW macrophages through two distinct pathways</title>
<p><italic>Y. pestis yopK</italic> has previously been shown to translocate increased amounts of YopJ in CHO cells, yet in RAW macrophages, the <italic>yopK</italic> mutant induced decreased caspase-3 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Dewoody1">[27]</xref>. This result suggests that YopK may be necessary for YopJ activity in specific cells or that YopK has an independent role in inducing apoptosis that might be additive to YopJ. However, previously published data suggests apoptosis of <italic>Y. pestis</italic>-infected RAW macrophages requires YopJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Zauberman2">[39]</xref>. To confirm that apoptosis of RAW macrophages requires YopJ in our assay, we infected RAW macrophages with <italic>Y. pestis</italic> carrying a point mutation in the catalytic site of YopJ (C172A) which abolishes its ability to induce apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Lilo1">[31]</xref>. Consistent with previous reports, YopJ is necessary for apoptosis of macrophages and, upon infection with the <italic>yopJ</italic> mutant strain, no caspase-3 activation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, while YopK is necessary for maximal apoptosis in RAW cells, YopJ is absolutely required.</p>

<p>Previously, inhibition of caspase-8 and caspase-9 revealed that <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> YopJ induces apoptosis through both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Pandey1">[40]</xref>. We therefore asked whether YopK was necessary for both of these activities. Caspase-3 cleavage can be activated by caspase-8 whose auto cleavage from pro-caspase-8 occurs following formation of a complex involving the adaptor protein FADD which is normally initiated through binding of Fas or TNF receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Lavrik1">[41]</xref>. YopJ is necessary for inducing formation of the DISC in the absence of receptor binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Grobner1">[42]</xref>. In lymphocytes and perhaps other immune cells, formation of the FADD-caspase-8 complex, the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) leads to caspase-3 activation directly, while in most cells, caspase-3 activation requires amplification through caspase-9 and the intrinsic apoptosis pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Scaffidi1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>We therefore treated RAW macrophages with inhibitors to caspase-8 and -9 and measured the impact on <italic>Y. pestis</italic>-induced activation of caspase-3. Pre-treatment of macrophages with caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK partially blocked caspase-3 activation and 30% remained following infection of RAW cells by WT <italic>Y. pestis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This suggests that <italic>Yersinia</italic>-induced caspase-3 activation in RAW macrophages is partially dependent on caspase-9. In contrast, the caspase-9 inhibitor had a more severe effect on apoptosis caused by the <italic>yopK</italic> mutant bacteria where caspase-3 activation was reduced to background levels. This suggests that the caspase-3 activity caused by the <italic>yopK</italic> mutant may be due solely to caspase-9-dependent signaling whereas when YopK is present, the extrinsic, caspase-9-independent pathway may be induced. Consistent with this hypothesis, pre-treatment of macrophages with caspase-8 inhibitor (IETD) abolished caspase-3 activity following infection by both WT and <italic>yopK</italic> mutant <italic>Y. pestis</italic> suggesting caspase-8 is absolutely required for caspase-3 activation following <italic>Y. pestis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Together, the data suggest that YopK acts upstream of caspase-8 to modulate YopJ-dependent apoptosis of RAW macrophages.</p>
<p>Following <italic>Y. pestis</italic> infection, inhibitors of c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) increase caspase-3 activation of RAW and J774 macrophages in a manner dependent on the acetylation activity of YopJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Zhang1">[44]</xref>. We asked whether this required YopK. SP600125 pre-treatment caused a 50% increase in caspase-3 activation of RAW macrophages following WT infection, similar to previously published data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, SP600125 had no effect on infection by the <italic>yopK</italic> mutant as no detectable differences were observed between treated and untreated macrophages. Thus, like YopJ, YopK is required for the JNK inhibitor to induce apoptosis in infected RAW macrophages. Taken together the inhibitor data suggest that <italic>Y. pestis</italic> induces YopJ-dependent apoptosis of RAW macrophages through the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, with a requirement for YopK in the extrinsic pathway.</p>

<title><italic>Y. pestis</italic> CO92 <italic>yopK</italic> is severely attenuated during pneumonic plague</title>
<p>Because macrophages are key mediators of the innate and adaptive immune systems, and their apoptosis is likely to have profound effects on these systems <italic>in vivo</italic>, we were interested in understanding how the contribution of YopK to apoptosis affected inflammatory responses during pulmonary infection. Since the <italic>Y. pestis</italic> KIM D27 parent strain is a non-pigmented mutant, it is attenuated and cannot cause pulmonary disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-LeeLewis1">[45]</xref>. In order to better understand the role of YopK in pathogenesis, we studied the fully virulent <italic>Y. pestis</italic> CO92 strain which is capable of causing primary pneumonic plague. Towards this end, we generated a <italic>yopK</italic> null mutation in <italic>Y. pestis</italic> CO92 using the strategy described above. This strain was characterized by PCR, confirming the absence of <italic>yopK</italic> and presence of pCD1, pPCP and pMT1 (data not shown). We measured the LD<sub>50</sub> of this strain following intranasal infection of BALB/c mice as 1.5×10<sup>6</sup> CFU, a 5,000-fold increase in lethal dose over that of the parent CO92 strain (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003324.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). This increase appears more severe than the LD<sub>50</sub> measured in the septicemic plague model and, together with previously published data, suggests that YopK has an essential function for all forms of plague <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Straley1">[14]</xref>. Importantly, the LD<sub>50</sub> for both CO92 and KIM D27 <italic>yopK</italic> mutant strains is less than that observed following pulmonary infection of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> lacking the type III secretion system (pCD1<sup>−</sup>), a strain that cannot cause disease in mice indicating the virulence defects observed in our strains are not due to second site mutations that result in loss of T3SS activity.</p>
<p>Following infection with lethal challenge doses of <italic>yopK</italic>, some mice succumbed to disease in 3 to 4 days post-infection, a similar time course as wild type CO92 at 100-fold lower challenge dose, while about 10% died later (5 to 14 days post-infection). The mice that succumbed to disease early appeared to be suffering from primary pneumonic plague, defined as multi-focal bacterial colonies in the lungs and neutrophil congestion in the parenchyma (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003324.s001">Figure S1B–C</xref>). Those mice that succumbed to disease later appeared to have developed and succumbed to septicemic plague, with fewer bacteria in the lungs, interstitial pneumonia, and massive liver and spleen necrosis and inflammation (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003324.s001">Figure S1D–F</xref>). Bacterial titers and severity scores for lungs, liver and spleen of moribund mice were determined (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003324.s007">Table S3</xref>). These mice had in common little to no damage to or colonization of the spleen, but an overall systemic infection.</p>

<title>Clearance and resolution of inflammation following infection of <italic>Y. pestis</italic> yopK</title>
<p>To identify host responses that lead to clearance of <italic>yopK</italic> mutant <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, we next performed a 72 hour time course experiment. Due to the large attenuation of the <italic>yopK</italic> mutant, comparisons with wild type are subject to misinterpretation because of the growing differences in clinical state and bacterial load in the tissues over time. We therefore studied two challenge doses: one equivalent to 0.67 LD<sub>50</sub> for <italic>yopK</italic> (1×10<sup>6</sup> CFU) and the second equivalent 30 LD<sub>50</sub> for wild type (1×10<sup>4</sup> CFU, a dose which causes no symptoms when used for the <italic>yopK</italic> mutant). This allowed us to assess similar clinical states of infection caused by both strains of bacteria. At 6 hours post-infection (HPI), increased bacterial load for <italic>yopK</italic> was observed compared to WT due to the 100× higher inoculating dose (data not shown). At 24 HPI, however, both strains colonized the lungs at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Strikingly, at this time point, pathology in the lungs of both wild type and <italic>yopK</italic> infected mice were similar with mild to moderate infiltration of neutrophils and little tissue damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g003">Figure 3B, D</xref>). In contrast, at 72 HPI, the divergence of the two strains was notable, with wild-type bacteria replicating to high titer while <italic>yopK</italic> mutant bacteria were undergoing clearance. Congestion in <italic>yopK</italic>-infected lungs at 72 HPI was mild, and either interstitial or consisted of lymphocytes around blood vessels near the airways, while in WT-infected lungs, inflammation was more severe and predominantly neutrophils were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g003">Figure 3C,E</xref>). Wild type-infected mice also had visible bacterial colonies in the hepatic sinusoids of the liver as well as the red pulp of the spleen while the <italic>yopK</italic> mice had smaller inflammatory foci in the liver and spleen (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003324.s002">Figure S2A–D</xref>). Together, the pathology of the <italic>yopK</italic> infection suggests that these bacteria may cause an alteration of the host inflammatory response compared to that caused by wild type <italic>Y. pestis</italic>.</p>

<p>In order to identify the cellular infiltrate in the lungs during the later stage of infection, we analyzed these tissue sections by immunohistochemistry. Formalin fixed lung tissues from 72 HPI were stained with NIMP R14 (a monoclonal antibody that recognizes Ly6G/6C on the surface of monocytes and neutrophils), F4/80, CD3 or B220 and analyzed by microscopy. Wild type bacteria induced an inflammatory response in the lungs that appeared primarily composed of Ly6G/6C<sup>+</sup> cells (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003324.s003">Figure S3</xref>) suggesting active neutrophil recruitment, while in the liver and spleen, fewer neutrophils were observed (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003324.s004">Figure S4</xref>). In contrast, fewer Ly6G/6C<sup>+</sup> staining cells were present in <italic>yopK</italic> infected mice, and instead, F4/80<sup>+</sup>, CD3<sup>+</sup> and B220<sup>+</sup> stained cells were found especially in the lungs indicating recruitment of macrophages, T cells and B cells. Together, the results suggest a dramatic difference in the inflammatory response between WT- and <italic>yopK</italic>-infected mice at 72 HPI. Correlation between divergence in inflammatory cell recruitment and reduction in bacterial load suggests that the primary role of YopK in virulence may be immunomodulatory.</p>

<p>To determine if YopK-dependent caspase-3 activation occurs <italic>in vivo</italic>, we also stained lung tissue sections from 6, 24 and 72 HPI with labeled antibodies to cleaved caspase-3 and analyzed them by microscopy. Initial assessment revealed relatively frequent caspase-3 positive macrophages in both WT- and <italic>yopK</italic>-infected lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g004">Figure 4A–B</xref>). We counted caspase-3 positive macrophages in 10 non-overlapping fields of lungs at 40× magnification. At 6 HPI, a modest, but significant increase in caspase-3-positive staining was observed following <italic>yopK</italic> infection compared to WT suggesting an increase in apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). This observation is similar to that observed in MH-S cells, however it is important to note that at this time point, there are increased numbers of <italic>yopK</italic> bacteria compared to WT which may be responsible for this observation. In contrast, at 24 HPI when bacterial titers of WT and <italic>yopK</italic> were highly similar, lungs harvested from mice infected by WT contained greater than 2-fold more macrophages undergoing apoptosis compared to <italic>yopK</italic> infected mice. This suggests that YopK may induce increased apoptosis of macrophages <italic>in vivo</italic>, correlating with the progressing development of pneumonia in WT-infected mice. In contrast, at 72 HPI, mice infected by WT bacteria (now progressing towards lethality), displayed significantly reduced caspase-3 positive macrophages compared to 24 HPI. At this time point, the <italic>yopK</italic>-infected mice have begun to resolve inflammation and likely harbor many fewer bacteria than the WT-infected mice. Overall, these results are consistent with a role for YopK in modulating macrophage apoptosis early following infection, as seen <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>YopK is necessary for controlling CCR2-dependent inflammatory responses during the early stage of infection</title>
<p>YopK-induced apoptosis of macrophages would be expected to impact bacterial clearance directly, contribute to neutrophil-induced tissue injury and/or modulate inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Dockrell1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Fox1">[47]</xref>. To distinguish between these possibilities, we sought to determine the overall impact of YopK on immunomodulation during infection. Towards this goal, we analyzed serum cytokines from mice infected with WT and the <italic>yopK</italic> mutant for a panel of 13 cytokines and chemokines. When comparing WT- and <italic>yopK</italic>-infected mice at 24 HPI, we found similar, low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g006">Figure 6A–D</xref>, Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003324.s009">Table S5</xref>). As the infection progressed, WT-infected mice expressed significantly increased amounts of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared to the <italic>yopK</italic>-infected mice. Together these data suggest that YopK modulates inflammatory responses but may not affect secretion of inflammatory cytokines or chemokines.

<p>We therefore stained the formalin-fixed lung sections with antibody to CCR2, the receptor for MCP-1, present on many leukocytes, to determine if CCR2<sup>+</sup> cells are recruited to the lungs as the <italic>yopK</italic> infection is being cleared. While the <italic>yopK</italic>-infected lungs stained positive for CCR2 as early as 24 HPI, the WT-infected lungs harbored very little CCR2<sup>+</sup> staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g006">Figure 6E–F</xref>). Likewise, at 72 HPI there were increased numbers of CCR2<sup>+</sup> cells in the perivascular regions of the <italic>yopK</italic>-infected lungs, while WT-infected lungs continued to harbor little to no CCR2<sup>+</sup> staining cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g006">Figure 6G–H</xref>). Importantly, the observed changes in the pro-inflammatory cytokine response and inflammatory cell recruitment occurred after the onset of increased macrophage apoptosis, consistent with a model whereby YopK-mediated depletion of macrophages influences inflammation. Furthermore, we also observed increased B220<sup>+</sup> cells in the perivascular regions of <italic>yopK</italic>-infected lungs at 24 and 72 HPI as compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g006">Figure 6I–L</xref>).

Levels of IL-1β produced by RAW and MH-S macrophages were independent of infection and no detectable differences in IL-1β secretion were observed between infected and not infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g008">Figure 8C–D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The TNF receptor super family is a group of cell surface proteins including TNF-receptor and Fas that are involved in inducing programmed cell death to an extracellular ligand, the extrinsic apoptosis pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Kaufmann1">[50]</xref>. <italic>Yersinia</italic> infection has been shown to induce the assembly of the pro-caspase-8-containing death receptor complex, known as the DISC, independent of TNF or Fas receptor signaling, thereby activating caspase-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003324-g009">Figure 9</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Grobner1">[42]</xref>. YopJ is essential for activation of apoptosis due to its ability to shut down production of anti-apoptotic proteins and to stimulate assembly of an atypical DISC. YopK is located at the plasma membrane, associated with the translocation pore, where it could regulate, either directly or indirectly, YopJ activity in promoting DISC assembly or downstream signaling.</p>

<title>A model for <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> induced apoptosis of macrophages.</title>
<p>Infection of RAW macrophages induces caspase-3-apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway by manipulating host signaling through type III secretion system effectors YopJ and YopK. YopK is located at the plasma membrane where it may control injection of effector Yops but may also be required to induce formation of the DISC death receptor complex, composed of pro-caspase-8 and -10, FADD and cFLIP, which is necessary for activation of caspase-8. In the absence of DISC complex formation, small amounts of active caspase-8 can cleave Bid to tBid in the absence of anti-apoptotic factors whose expression is repressed through the action of YopJ (green X). Formation of the DISC complex is regulated by YopJ. The small molecule SP600125 inhibits JNK phosphorylation, thereby causing reduced production of anti-apoptotic genes. Yellow background denotes the signaling pathway that may be specific to RAW cells and perhaps other immune cells.</p>

<p>Resident and recruited macrophages in the lung are believed to be different in their response to apoptotic stimuli, with monocyte-like, recruited macrophages highly sensitive to extrinsic apoptosis while resident alveolar macrophages are somewhat resistant to apoptosis due in part to the expression of NF-κB-induced pro-survival factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Janssen2">[51]</xref>. Two populations of macrophages are resident in the mammalian lungs: interstitial and alveolar. Interstitial lung macrophages more closely resemble monocytes, with a greater capacity for immune regulation than alveolar macrophages, and, due to their location in direct contact with epithelial and endothelial cells, they can have pathological impact as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Laskin1">[52]</xref>. In contrast, alveolar macrophages exhibit greater functional activity such as increased cytotoxicity, phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species production. MH-S is an alveolar macrophage cell line whereas RAW 264.7 phenotypically more closely resembles monocytes, thus it is conceivable that the differences we observed <italic>in vitro</italic> may have important consequences <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Laskin1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Berghaus1">[53]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although the <italic>yopK</italic> mutant causes a rapid change to the inflammatory response <italic>in vivo</italic>, we did not identify YopK-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by infected macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic>. This is especially relevant concerning the proposed function of YopK as a regulator of translocation of effector Yops, a model that predicts increased injection of at least 3 immunomodulators: YopJ, YopH and YopM by <italic>yopK</italic> mutant <italic>Yersinia</italic>. Although YopJ has well-characterized activity in the prevention of NF-κB activation, suppression of TNF-α secretion and induction of apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, <italic>yopJ</italic> mutant <italic>Y. pestis</italic> exhibited little to no virulence defects in rodent models of plague. Our data suggests that YopK may be important as a regulator of YopJ-mediated apoptosis, and that the dysregulation of apoptosis that occurs in the absence of YopK leads to changes in inflammatory responses <italic>in vivo</italic> that affect the establishment of infection. YopH has been shown to suppress MCP-1 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Sauvonnet1">[54]</xref>. Yet, we did not find decreased MCP-1 secretion between WT and <italic>yopK Y. pestis</italic> infection of RAW or MH-S cells, both of which produced MCP-1 in the absence of infection. Together, the data are accumulating that support a critical role for YopK in modulating inflammatory responses through the control of immune cell death.</p>
<p>CCR2<sup>+</sup> cells are known to be broadly important to host defense against bacterial infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Serbina1">[55]</xref>. CCR2 is expressed by many inflammatory cells and allows for their recruitment to the lungs following infection by many respiratory pathogens. Further, pulmonary infection by <italic>Y. pestis</italic> results in robust MCP-1 secretion (the chemokine for CCR2) in the lungs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Lathem1">[56]</xref>. Thus, successful respiratory infection and pneumonia that occurs during <italic>Y. pestis</italic> infection requires evasion of early CCR2 responses. Our data and others indicate the T3SS is critical for CCR2 evasion, with three effectors, YopH, YopM, and now YopK implicated in modulating recruitment of CCR2<sup>+</sup> cells. YopH was shown to suppress pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages, and may delay CCR2-signaled recruitment of immune cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Cantwell1">[19]</xref>. Recently, YopM was also shown to suppress CCR2 inflammatory responses that would otherwise contribute to bacterial clearance from the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003324-Ye1">[49]</xref>. Thus CCR2 is a critical mediator of host defense against <italic>Y. pestis</italic> whose effect is blocked by the T3SS.</p>
<p>Many immune cells express CCR2, albeit to varying levels, on the cell surface including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer T cells, and some B cells. Our observations of the <italic>yopK</italic> infection suggest that all of these cells may be recruited through MCP-1 signaling and one or more of its receptors. CCR2/MCP-1 have been implicated in both bacterial clearance and resolution of inflammation. Although a role for macrophages and monocytes in resolution of inflammation via phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils following bacterial clearance is well known, a role for B cells in resolution has not yet been elucidated. The <italic>yopK</italic> pulmonary infection model may therefore provide a novel system for studying the role of B cells and other lymphocytes in the resolution of inflammation.</p>
