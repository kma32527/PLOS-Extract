      <abstract>
        <p><italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> is a major pathogen in severe and chronic manifestations of periodontal disease, which is one of the most common infections of humans. A central feature of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> pathogenicity is dysregulation of innate immunity at the gingival epithelial interface, including suppression of IL-8 production by epithelial cells. NF-κB is a transcriptional regulator that controls important aspects of innate immune responses, and NF-κB RelA/p65 homodimers regulate transcription of IL8. Phosphorylation of the NF-κB p65 subunit protein on the serine 536 residue affects nuclear translocation and transcription of target genes. Here we show that SerB, a haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) family serine phosphatase secreted by <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, is produced intracellularly and can specifically dephosphorylate S536 of p65 in gingival epithelial cells. A <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> mutant lacking SerB was impaired in dephosphorylation of p65 S536, and ectopically expressed SerB bound to p65 and co-localized with p65 in the cytoplasm. Ectopic expression of SerB also resulted in dephosphorylation of p65 with reduced nuclear translocation in TNF-α-stimulated epithelial cells. In contrast, the p105/50 subunit of NF-κB was unaffected by SerB. Co-expression of a constitutively active p65 mutant (S536D) relieved inhibition of nuclear translocation. Both the activity of the IL8 promoter and production of IL-8 were diminished by SerB. Deletion and truncation mutants of SerB lacking the HAD-family enzyme motifs of SerB were unable to dephosphorylate p65, inhibit nuclear translocation or abrogate IL8 transcription. Specific dephosphorylation of NF-κB p65 S536 by SerB, and consequent inhibition of nuclear translocation, provides the molecular basis for a bacterial strategy to manipulate host inflammatory pathways and repress innate immunity at mucosal surfaces.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Periodontal diseases are one of the most common infections of humans, and are characterized by gingival inflammation and destruction of the hard and soft tissues that support the tooth, eventually causing tooth loss. <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> is a major pathogen in periodontal diseases and a key pathogenic attribute of this organism is the ability to disrupt host innate immunity. Infection of gingival epithelial cells by <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> suppresses production of the neutrophil chemokine IL-8. This inhibitory process is associated with the <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> serine phosphatase, SerB. In this study we show that SerB has a potent and specific ability to inhibit activation the NF-κB transcription factor which regulates IL-8 production. Mechanistically, SerB binds to and dephosphorylates the p65 subunit of NF-κB which prevents nuclear translocation and subsequent transcription of the IL8 gene. Targeting the NF-κB p65 subunit allows <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> to dampen IL-8 dependent inflammatory responses, facilitate survival and potentially to establish a favorable niche for the entire periodontal microbial community.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Many of the mucosal surfaces of humans are colonized by a diverse and abundant microbiota. In most instances the host remains healthy, in large part due to numerous innate and acquired immune mechanisms that limit microbial intrusion and rapidly kill organisms that traverse epithelial barriers. In the periodontal tissues of the oral cavity the epithelium of the subgingival compartment plays a central role in orchestration of innate immunity. While this tissue is relatively porous, gingival epithelial cells secrete high levels of IL-8 and consequently large numbers of neutrophils are recruited into the periodontal area where they serve to constrain the microbial challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Dixon1">[1]</xref>. Successful periodontal pathogens, such as <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>, are capable of disrupting innate defenses, and indeed one virulence determinant of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> is inhibition of IL-8 production by gingival epithelial cells, a strategy known as localized chemokine paralysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Darveau1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Darveau2">[3]</xref>. Moreover, periodontal diseases are multispecies infections involving pathogenic communities in which the microbial constituents exhibit polymicrobial synergy. Consistent with this, <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> can antagonize IL-8 secretion in the presence of stimulatory organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Darveau1">[2]</xref>, a property that will allow <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> to enhance the pathogenicity of the entire multispecies periodontal community and which contributes to its designation as a keystone pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Hajishengallis1">[4]</xref>. The <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> serine phosphatase SerB is required for IL-8 suppression, and in a murine model of disease a mutant lacking SerB induces higher levels of neutrophil recruitment into gingival tissues compared to the parental strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Bainbridge1">[5]</xref>. Additionally, loss of SerB attenuates alveolar bone destruction in animal infection models demonstrating that SerB, and its associated anti-inflammatory action, is required for <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> to realize its full pathogenic potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Bainbridge1">[5]</xref>. The mechanistic basis for the SerB-dependent inhibition of IL-8 remains undetermined.</p>
      <p><italic>P. gingivalis</italic> is an intracellular pathogen and epithelial cell entry is accomplished by a very limited number of bacterial effectors. The major fimbriae mediate attachment to integrin receptors and this leads to remodeling of the host cell cytoskeleton. SerB is secreted by <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> and facilitates invasion through dephosphorylation and activation of the host actin depolymerizing protein cofilin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Moffatt1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Chen1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Tribble1">[8]</xref>. SerB is a haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) family enzyme that is functionally versatile and can impact the dynamics of both the host microfilament and the microtubule cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Tribble1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Hasegawa1">[9]</xref>; however, the complete range of host cell serine phosphoproteins that can be dephosphorylated by the enzyme is unknown.</p>
      <p>At the transcriptional level, the predominant control over IL8 is exerted by the eukaryotic transcription factor NF-κB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Vallabhapurapu1">[10]</xref>. NF-κB can be comprised of homo- or hetero-dimers containing combinations of the subunits RelA/p65, c-Rel, RelB, p100, p105 and p50, each of which contains a Rel homology domain that mediates subunit binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Vallabhapurapu1">[10]</xref>. The non-Rel NF-κB subunit, RPS3, guides NF-κB to specific κB sites on the chromosome and contributes to regulatory specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Wan1">[11]</xref>. In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is generally sequestered in the cytosol and bound to inhibitory IκB proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Sun1">[12]</xref>. In the canonical pathway stimuli, including bacterial products and proinflammatory cytokines, activate IκB kinases (IKKα and β, along with the regulatory subunit IKKγ) that phosphorylate IκB and induce ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of IκB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-DiDonato1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Zandi1">[14]</xref>. The free homo- or hetero-dimer complex then rapidly enters the nucleus and initiates transcription of downstream effector genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Ghosh1">[15]</xref>. Noncanonical activation pathways also exist in which there is no sequestration of NF-κB by IκB proteins, and in one example active p52-RelB complexes can be generated by IKKα-mediated phosphorylation of p100 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Sun2">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Many considerations contribute to the transcriptional activation of NF-κB target genes, including the nature of the homo- or hetero-dimers, the involvement of basal transcription factors and coactivators, and histone modifications in the promoter region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Vallabhapurapu1">[10]</xref>. In addition, posttranslational modifications of NF-κB subunits, including phosphorylation, acetylation and methylation, have been shown to contribute to regulation of transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Huang1">[17]</xref>. The p65 subunit, for example, can be phosphorylated on serine (S) 276 in the Rel homology domain as well as on S468 and S536 in the C-terminal transcriptional activation domain, in response to a variety of stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Huang1">[17]</xref>. Phosphorylation on these sites can have different functional consequences depending on the nature of the stimulus, the kinase involved and the target gene. S536 can be phosphorylated by IKKs in response to TNF-α, LPS, <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> or HTLV1 TAX protein, resulting in elevated function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Huang1">[17]</xref>. The enhanced transcriptional activity following p65 S536 phosphorylation may ensue from a conformational change affecting binding to other subunits or decreased affinity for the IκBα inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Bohuslav1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Hoberg1">[19]</xref>. S536 phosphorylation can also impact the kinetics of nuclear import of NF-κB p65 and cytoplasmic retention of IκBα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Mattioli1">[20]</xref>. Furthermore, there is evidence that S536 phosphorylation represents a noncanonical activation pathway whereby phosphorylated p65 can translocate to the nucleus independent of IκBα regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Sasaki1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In this study we found that SerB-mediated inhibition of IL-8 production by epithelial cells involved suppression of NF-κB activation. SerB was capable of binding to the p65 subunit of NF-κB and dephosphorylated p65 at S536 through the action of the HAD-family enzyme motifs. SerB thus prevented nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 and subsequent transcription of the IL8 gene. This work provides insights into both the immune-subversive processes of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, and the development of polymicrobial synergy in pathogenic communities.</p>

        <title><italic>P. gingivalis</italic> dephosphorylates NF-κB p65 in a SerB dependent manner</title>
        <p>Previous reports have established that <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> can inhibit the accumulation of IL-8 in the supernatants of gingival epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Darveau1">[2]</xref>. The secreted serine phosphatase SerB is required for maximal inhibition of IL-8 production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Hasegawa1">[9]</xref>, and to explore whether regulation of IL-8 by SerB occurs at the transcriptional level we transfected telomerase immortalized gingival keratinocytes (TIGKs) with the reporter plasmid pIL-8κB-Luc in which the luciferase gene is controlled by the NF-κB-regulated IL8 promoter. Transfected cells were then infected with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> ATCC 33277 wild type (WT) or its isogenic Δ<italic>serB</italic> mutant at MOI 10 for 16 h, stimulated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and assayed for luciferase activity at 3 h after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003326-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). IL8 promoter activity was increased 5-fold by TNF-α stimulation, and infection with <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> WT significantly reduced IL8 promoter activity to 3.6-fold over unstimulated basal levels. In contrast, the Δ<italic>serB</italic> mutant was unable to antagonize TNF-α stimulated IL8 promoter activity. These results suggest that the ability of SerB to diminish IL-8 secretion by epithelial cells involves inhibition of NF-κB dependent transcription of the IL8 gene.</p>

        <p>Recent reports have documented that phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 at the S536 residue in Jurkat cells induces IL8 transcription following stimulation by ionomycin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Sasaki1">[21]</xref>. We hypothesized therefore that p65 S536 might be a target for dephosphorylation by <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> SerB.

        <title>SerB binds to and dephosphorylates NF-κB p65</title>
        <p>To investigate the function of SerB independent of other <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> molecules, we constructed a mammalian expression vector bearing a fusion protein, Myc-SerB, which was transiently expressed in TIGK cells. Using the cross-linking agent DSP to stabilize enzyme-substrate interactions, we found that Myc-SerB, but not Myc alone (empty vector), co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous NF-κB p65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003326-g002">Figures 2A and 2B</xref>). Co-precipitation, albeit less efficient, was also observed in the absence of cross-linking reagent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003326.s003">Figure S3</xref>). These results indicate that SerB can interact directly with p65 or a p65 complex, but do not exclude the possibility that other <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> molecules can also interact with NF-κB components.</p>

        <p>To further examine the interaction of SerB with NF-κB p65, GFP tagged NF-κB p65 was generated and introduced into TIGK cells along with Myc-SerB. We then visualized co-localization of Myc-SerB and GFP-NF-κB p65 in TIGKs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003326-g002">Figures 2C and 2D</xref> show that when Myc-SerB and GFP-NF-κB p65 were ectopically expressed in TIGKs, Myc-SerB co-localized with GFP-NF-κB p65 in the cytoplasmic area. We then confirmed that the phosphorylation status of NF-κB p65 is necessary for SerB binding by constructing a constitutively-active phosphomimic p65 S536D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Sasaki1">[21]</xref>. TIGKs were transfected with GFP-NF-κB p65 or GFP-NF-κB p65 S536D, along with Myc-SerB, and left unstimulated to maintain the phosphorylation of wild type p65 at basal levels. Immunoprecipitation with Myc antibodies revealed that Myc-SerB co-immunoprecipitated with GFP-NF-κB p65 S536D whereas co-precipitation of Myc-SerB with wild type, unphosphorylated NF-κB p65 was below detection thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003326-g002">Figures 2E and 2F</xref>). This finding demonstrates that the phosphorylation status of NF-κB p65 S536 is significant for the binding of SerB to NF-κB p65.</p>
        <p>Next we investigated whether binding of SerB to p65 effectuates dephosphorylation of S536. Myc-SerB was ectopically expressed in TIGKs and after stimulation with TNF-α, the kinetics of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation were examined by immunoblot analysis with quantitative densitometry. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003326-g003">Figures 3A and 3B</xref>, TIGKs expressing Myc-SerB displayed a lower level of phosphorylated NF-κB p65 from 5–30 min after TNF-α stimulation compared to cells transfected with empty vector. After 1 h, levels of phospho-p65 declined in cells expressing both Myc-SerB and Myc alone as a result of the transient effect of TNF-α. These findings indicate that SerB can dephosphorylate p65 at the S536 residue. To address the specificity of SerB action, we investigated whether the enzyme can also dephosphorylate the S276 and S468 residues. SerB did not significantly decrease the level of phospho-NF-κB p65 S276 or S468 induced by TNF-α stimulation (Figures S4 and S5). In addition, the effect of SerB on phosphorylation of the NF-κB p105 subunit at S933 was assessed. Similarly, SerB did not dephosphorylate the NF-κB p105 S933 residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003326-g003">Figures 3C and 3D</xref>). Phosphorylation of NF-κB p105 leads to processing into the p50 subunit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Orian1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Heissmeyer1">[25]</xref> and hence we also confirmed that the amount of NF-κB p50 was unchanged in TNF-α stimulated TIGKs expressing Myc-SerB compared to the empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003326-g003">Figures 3C and 3E</xref>). Thus, SerB does not impact the phosphorylation status of NF-κB p65 S276, p65 S468, or p105 S933, and does not affect processing of phospho-NF-κB p105 into NF-κB p50. The action of SerB on NF-κB thus appears to be specific for p65 S536.</p>

        <title>SerB prevents the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65</title>
        <p>The phosphorylation status of NF-κB p65 Ser 536 has been shown to control the kinetics of NF-κB p65 nuclear import in Jurkat cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Mattioli1">[20]</xref>. Based on this observation, we postulated that SerB can block the translocation of NF-κB p65 to the nucleus in stimulated cells. To test this idea, we transfected TIGKs with either GFP-tagged NF-κB p65 or GFP- tagged phosphomimic NF-κB p65 S536D. Cells were co-transfected with Myc-SerB and the location of GFP-NF-κB p65 determined by confocal microscopy. Upon stimulation with TNF-α, 68% of counted control cells were positive for GFP-NF-κB p65 in the nucleus, confirming nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003326-g004">Figures 4A and 4B</xref>). However, in stimulated TIGKs expressing Myc-SerB and GFP-NF-κB p65 fusions, only 26% of counted cells were positive for GFP-NF-κB p65 in the nucleus. In cells expressing Myc-SerB and GFP-NF-κB p65 S536D, the number of counted cells positive for nuclear NF-κB p65 was similar to the level in cells without SerB, demonstrating that translocation of the constitutively active p65 subunit is unaffected by SerB. These results suggest that dephosphorylation of S536 by SerB inhibits nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. As controls, we examined nuclear translocation of GFP-NF-κB p50 or GFP-NF-κB p105 fusions in TIGKs co-transfected with Myc-SerB. The presence of SerB did not affect the nuclear translocation of p50 or p105 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003326-g004">Figures 4C and 4D</xref>), further evidence that the action of SerB is specific for the p65 subunit.</p>

        <title>SerB inhibits the promoter response regulated by NF-κB p65</title>
        <p>It is reported that phospho-NF-κB p65 does not associate with NF-κB p50, and that NF-κB p50-independent NF-κB p65 can be recruited to the IL8 promoter following stimulation by ionomycin in Jurkat cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Sasaki1">[21]</xref>. We hypothesized, therefore, that dephosphorylation of NF-κB p65 by SerB would be sufficient to prevent transcription of the IL8 gene. To test this possibility, Myc-SerB and the luciferase IL8 reporter plasmid, pIL8κB-Luc, were co-expressed in TIGKs. In response to TNF-α, luciferase activity of cells expressing Myc-SerB was significantly reduced compared to cells transfected with empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003326-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). We then examined the ability of excess exogenous p65 to partially relieve suppression of the IL8 reporter by introducing GFP-NF-κB subunits into the cells containing the reporter plasmid. Additional co-transfection of GFP-p65 with Myc-SerB increased promoter activity from 0.76- to 55-fold of the control level compared with cells expressing Myc-SerB and GFP at 3 h after stimulation by TNF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003326-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, exogenous p50 subunit did not relieve SerB-mediated suppression of the IL8 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003326-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and indeed decreased luciferase activity indicating that overexpression of p50 subunits can interfere with the formation of p65 homodimers.

In contrast, Myc-SerB 198–413 which lacks the ACT domain but not the HAD domains reduced the level of phospho-p65 to a similar level compared to full length SerB.

        <p>Collectively these results indicate that SerB binds to the NF-κB p65 subunit in TIGKs and through the action of the HAD-family motifs dephosphorylates the S536 residue.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Periodontal diseases are characterized by destruction of the gingival tissues including the alveolar bone, with eventual exfoliation of the tooth. These are among the most common infections of humans, and in developed countries over half of the adult population will experience some form of periodontitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Eke1">[27]</xref>. The disease initiates at the epithelial surfaces of the subgingival compartment, and gingival epithelial cells play a central role in responding to microbial infection and orchestrating immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Dixon1">[1]</xref>. Mucosal inflammatory responses involve coordinated expression of cytokines and chemokines, and the NF-κB transcriptional regulator exerts control over a number of inflammation-associated genes.</p>
      <p><italic>P. gingivalis</italic> is a major pathogen in the initiation and progression of severe and chronic forms of periodontal disease. A feature of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> infection is dysregulation of innate immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Darveau2">[3]</xref>, including suppression of IL-8 production from gingival epithelial cells. The functionally versatile serine phosphatase SerB of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> is required for optimal invasion of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> into epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Moffatt1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Tribble1">[8]</xref> and is also necessary for IL-8 suppression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Hasegawa1">[9]</xref>. In this report we provide several lines of evidence that SerB antagonizes IL-8 production through dephosphorylation of the serine 536 residue of the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB. This evidence includes: infection of epithelial cells with a <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> Δ<italic>serB</italic> mutant induces less dephosphorylation of NF-κB p65 S536 and higher levels of IL8 promoter activity compared to parental <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>; ectopically expressed SerB binds to and dephosphorylates p65 in epithelial cells stimulated with TNF-α; exogenous SerB impedes nuclear translocation of p65; and SerB blocks IL8 promoter activity and secretion of IL-8 from epithelial cells.</p>
      <p>Given the role of NF-κB in directing cytokine production and innate immune responses, it is not surprising that many human pathogens have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to interfere with NF-κB activity and disrupt host immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-LeNegrate1">[28]</xref>. Bacterial disruption of NF-κB can occur at multiple points in the activation pathway. Several organisms target the IKK complex, a central node that integrates the input from a number of upstream pathways. For example, the InlC internalin of <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> can bind to IKKα and block IκBα phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Gouin1">[29]</xref>, while the NleH1 and NleH2 proteins of EHEC impede IκB ubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Royan1">[30]</xref>. Specific bacterial effectors can also target TLR signaling upstream of the IKK complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Newman1">[31]</xref>, and NF-κB-dependent transcription downstream of IKK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Wan2">[32]</xref>. While the latter mechanism is less commonly recognized, it is less likely to impact other signaling pathways that intersect with TLR signaling and with the IKK complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Oeckinghaus1">[33]</xref>, and thus provide a more precise redirection of host immune responses. For example, the NleH1 effector of EHEC also binds to NF-κB RPS3 and prevents phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Wan2">[32]</xref>. NleH1 can thus selectively reduce the transcription of RPS3-dependent target genes, including IL8 and TNF, without attenuating promoter activity of other NF-κB-dependent genes. The ability of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> SerB to prevent nuclear translocation of p65 is a previously unrecognized bacterial NF-κB subversion strategy involving specific dephosphorylation of a NF-κB subunit.</p>
      <p>Phosphorylation of p65 at S536 can elevate nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of NF-κB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Yang1">[34]</xref>. However, the full extent of NF-κB regulation that is dependent on serine phosphorylation of p65 remains to be fully defined, and may vary according to cell type and phosphorylation mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Huang1">[17]</xref>. Various studies have shown both inducible phosphorylation of S536 and a pool of constitutively phosphorylated p65 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Sasaki1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Jiang1">[35]</xref>. Our data show that in gingival epithelial cells, S536 phosphorylation is induced by TNF-α and that nuclear translocation of p65 is enhanced by phosphorylation. Immunoblot analyses did not reveal a pool of phospho-p65 in the absence of stimulation, similar to the situation in intestinal epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Haller1">[36]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Among the pathogenic constituents of the periodontal polymicrobial community, <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> has a unique ability to selectively antagonize IL-8 production in epithelial cells, even in the context of co-infection with other stimulatory bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Darveau1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Hasegawa1">[9]</xref>. Conversely, <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> can induce the secretion of other proinflammatory cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Stathopoulou1">[37]</xref>. These properties are consistent with a specific action of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> on NF-κB p65. It has been reported that the IL8 promoter is regulated by p65 homodimers, and that neither p105/p50 homodimers nor p105/p50 - p65 heterodimers, can activate transcription from the IL8 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Kunsch1">[38]</xref>. In addition, in this study we found that overexpression of NF-κB p65, but not p50, induces the secretion of IL-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003326-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Crystallization studies show that NF-κB p65 homodimers bind to a pseudosymmetric sequence in the enhancer region of the IL8 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Chen2">[39]</xref>. Moreover, phospho-p65 can be selectively recruited to the NF-κB site on the IL8 promoter independent of p50 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Sasaki1">[21]</xref>. Hence, dephosphorylation of p65 and inhibition of nuclear translocation will allow <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> to selectively manipulate different aspects of innate immunity. NF-κB also controls expression of a number of host genes that govern cell proliferation and programmed cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Vallabhapurapu1">[10]</xref>, and thus broadly based inhibition of NF-κB would be predicted to elevate apoptotic cell death. <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, however, suppresses apoptotic cell death in epithelial cells and accelerates progression through the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Kuboniwa1">[40]</xref>. Collectively these results point toward an exquisite specificity of the interaction between <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> and NF-κB, allowing process-specific manipulation.</p>
      <p><italic>P. gingivalis</italic> is an intracellular organism which lacks the machinery and effector molecules of the type III secretion system that are utilized by many invasive pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Xia1">[41]</xref>. Rather, <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> relies on a more limited number of multifunctional effectors, such as the HAD family SerB, to direct entry into host epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Tribble1">[8]</xref>. While the SerB deficient mutant of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> has a diminished capacity to invade and survive within epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Tribble1">[8]</xref>, the ability of ectopically expressed SerB to dephosphorylate p65 establishes that abrogated p65 dephosphorylation by the SerB mutant is not a reflection of lower levels of intracellular bacteria, but due to the absence of the enzyme-substrate reaction. Furthermore, although SerB can dephosphorylate a variety of host cell proteins, such as cofilin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Moffatt1">[6]</xref>, its impact on the NF-κB pathway appears to be restricted to the p65 subunit. The effect of SerB on p65 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and transcription of the IL8 gene all require the HAD enzyme domains. Eukaryotic HAD family enzymes have been shown to regulate innate immunity by modulating the phosphorylation state of signal transducers involved in host responses to viral infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003326-Okabe1">[42]</xref>; however, this is the first example of a bacterial HAD family phosphatase that can divert innate immunity through dephosphorylation of host signaling molecules. The ability of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> SerB to specifically target IL8 transcription through dephosphorylation of p65 provides a molecular basis to the localized chemokine paralysis induced by <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> at mucosal surfaces. Many bacteria possess SerB homologs which are generally annotated as metabolic enzymes. It will be interesting to discover whether secretion of this enzyme and activity against NF-κB are features of pathogens, particularly keystone pathogens in mixed communities.</p>
