<abstract>
<p>Measures that bolster the resolution phase of infectious diseases may offer new opportunities for improving outcome. Here we show that inactivation of microbial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) can be required for animals to recover from the innate immune tolerance that follows exposure to Gram-negative bacteria. When wildtype mice are exposed to small parenteral doses of LPS or Gram-negative bacteria, their macrophages become reprogrammed (tolerant) for a few days before they resume normal function. Mice that are unable to inactivate LPS, in contrast, remain tolerant for several months; during this time they respond sluggishly to Gram-negative bacterial challenge, with high mortality. We show here that prolonged macrophage reprogramming is maintained <italic>in vivo</italic> by the persistence of stimulatory LPS molecules within the cells' <italic>in vivo</italic> environment, where naïve cells can acquire LPS via cell-cell contact or from the extracellular fluid. The findings provide strong evidence that inactivation of a stimulatory microbial molecule can be required for animals to regain immune homeostasis following parenteral exposure to bacteria. Measures that disable microbial molecules might enhance resolution of tissue inflammation and help restore innate defenses in individuals recovering from many different infectious diseases.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>We showed previously that mice lacking acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH), the host enzyme that inactivates Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), are unable to regain normal immune responsiveness for many weeks/months after they are exposed <italic>in vivo</italic> to a small amount of LPS or Gram-negative bacteria. The many possible explanations for slow recovery included long-lasting epigenetic changes in macrophages or other host cells, chronically stimulated cells that produce certain mediators, and persistent signaling by internalized LPS within macrophages. Using several <italic>in vivo</italic> techniques to study peritoneal macrophages, we found that none of these mechanisms was correct. Rather, prolonged recovery is caused by intact LPS that remains in the environment where macrophages live and can pass from one cell to another <italic>in vivo</italic>. This is the first evidence that the persistence of a bioactive microbial agonist, per se, can prevent resolution of inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic>. It also identifies the stimulatory microbial molecule as a realistic target for intervention – in further support, we found that providing recombinant AOAH can be partially preventive. In a larger sense, showing that chemical inactivation of one important microbial signaling molecule is required for full recovery should encourage efforts to find out whether disabling other microbial agonists (chitin, lipopeptides, flagella, others) also benefits infected animals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A great deal is known about how animals kill bacteria but very little about what happens to the corpses. Most bacterial structures seem to be broken down by phagocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Cohn1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Elsbach1">[2]</xref>, yet much of the catabolic machinery is made by the bacteria themselves (phospholipases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Elsbach2">[3]</xref>, peptidoglycan hydrolases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Humann1">[4]</xref>, autolysins), which in some cases produce agonists that can elicit inflammation. Host enzymes may also participate, attacking peptidoglycan (lysozyme, peptidoglycan binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Wang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Royet1">[6]</xref>), lipids (phospholipases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Elsbach2">[3]</xref>), chitin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Seibold1">[7]</xref>, proteins (cathepsins, others), lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and, presumably, DNA. It is likely that the breakdown products are excreted, retained within phagocytes (e.g., in lymph nodes or arterial walls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Renko1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Koren1">[9]</xref>) or in discrete extracellular deposits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Bockenstedt1">[10]</xref>, or recycled by the host.</p>
<p>The seminal studies of Cohn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Cohn1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Cohn2">[11]</xref>, Elsbach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Elsbach1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Elsbach2">[3]</xref> and Schwab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Smialowicz1">[12]</xref> established that degradation of ingested bacteria by phagocytes can be incomplete. More recently, deposits of microbial antigens have been discovered in animals following infection with <italic>B. burgdorferii</italic>, the etiological agent of Lyme Disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Bockenstedt1">[10]</xref>. A key question raised by these findings has remained unanswered to date: to what extent does the inactivation of stimulatory microbial molecules influence the outcome of infectious diseases or host reactions to microbe-rich environmental exposures? Here we show that for one important agonist, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), persistently active molecules can greatly delay immune recovery <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Exposure to Gram-negative bacterial LPS induces humans and many other mammals to enter a transient state of altered immune responsiveness known as cellular reprogramming or tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Henricson1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Medvedev1">[15]</xref>. The phenomenon has also been produced in animals by peritonitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Ellaban1">[16]</xref>, influenza virus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Didierlaurent1">[17]</xref> and bacterial lipopeptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Sato1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Wang2">[19]</xref> and in cultured macrophages using muramyl dipeptide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Hedl1">[20]</xref>, lipoteichoic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Lehner1">[21]</xref>, and flagella <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Mizel1">[22]</xref>. For a period that may last from a few hours to a few days after exposure to the microbial agonist, tolerant animals and cells respond to a second exposure by producing reduced amounts of many pro-inflammatory cytokines while maintaining, or even increasing, their production of certain anti-inflammatory and anti-infective molecules. Tolerance wanes as inflammation resolves and the animal regains normal immune responsiveness. Long considered a mechanism for preventing inflammation-induced injury, innate immune tolerance may also be immunosuppressive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Cavaillon1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>Acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH), an enzyme produced by macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, inactivates bioactive LPSs by removing two of the six fatty acyl chains that are present in the bioactive hexaacyl lipid A moiety <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Munford1">[24]</xref>. In mice that lack AOAH, a single intraperitoneal exposure to as little as 80 ng of hexaacyl LPS induces tolerance that lasts for several weeks, much longer than that seen in wildtype animals that have received much larger doses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Lu1">[25]</xref>. Tolerant animals respond sluggishly to Gram-negative bacterial challenge and are unable to prevent bacterial multiplication <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Lu1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>The mechanism(s) by which fully acylated LPS maintains reprogramming <italic>in vivo</italic> have been uncertain. Here we considered several possibilities. First, it seemed likely that bioactive LPS would remain within or on <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> macrophages for prolonged periods and render them tolerant via cell-intrinsic signaling, despite the existence of mechanisms that promote LPS efflux from macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Thompson1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Kitchens1">[27]</xref>. Second, it was possible that extracellular bioactive LPS, released from tolerant macrophages and/or other <italic>in vivo</italic> reservoirs, could prevent tolerant macrophages from recovering and induce tolerance in recruited naïve monocytes. A third consideration was that mediators produced by tolerant cells, even in the absence of LPS, could induce tolerance in themselves and other cells <italic>in vi</italic>vo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Lehner1">[21]</xref>. Finally, it was possible that LPS-stimulated <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> macrophages might undergo long-lived, stable reprogramming that persisted even in the absence of bioactive LPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Carson1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Chan1">[32]</xref>. A combination of these mechanisms was also considered.</p>
<p>The studies described here indicate that macrophage tolerance can be maintained for long periods <italic>in vivo</italic> by the presence of small amounts of fully acylated extracellular LPS. The source of the LPS seems to be extrinsic to the tolerant cell, coming from the fluid in which macrophages live or the LPS-containing cells they contact <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that cell-associated LPS can be released, bind to other cells, and induce or maintain their tolerant state. Importantly, LPS-exposed, tolerant macrophages regained normal responsiveness when transferred to a LPS-free environment. Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> inactivation of LPS by administering recombinant AOAH partially prevented tolerance. These results identify persistence of bioactive LPS in both cells and cell-extrinsic reservoirs as a primary mechanism that drives prolonged macrophage tolerance <italic>in vivo.</italic> They suggest that measures to inactivate LPS in these reservoirs might shorten the period of macrophage unresponsiveness that follows many Gram-negative bacterial diseases. They also provide evidence that inactivation of microbial molecules can be an essential element of the resolution/recovery phase of infectious illnesses.</p>

<title>LPS exposed, tolerant <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> macrophages have distinctive features</title>
<p>As previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Lu1">[25]</xref>, 14 days after LPS injection, <italic>Aoah<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice have largely recovered from tolerance while <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice are still reprogrammed.

<title>Macrophages retain intracellular LPS for long periods <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>We previously found that both <italic>Aoah<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> peritoneal macrophages retain LPS for at least 10 days <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Lu1">[25]</xref>. Whereas the LPS in <italic>Aoah<sup>+/+</sup></italic> macrophages had been partially deacylated (i.e., it had lost two of the six fatty acyl chains from lipid A), that in <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> macrophages was fully acylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Lu1">[25]</xref>. The cells' ability to produce TNF in response to a second exposure to LPS was related inversely to their LPS content; <italic>Aoah<sup>+/+</sup></italic> macrophages were almost 20-fold more responsive than were <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> macrophages. It thus seemed likely that cell-associated LPS, if fully acylated, could maintain macrophage tolerance for long periods <italic>in vivo</italic>. To localize the cell-associated LPS, we injected FITC-labeled LPS i.p. to <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Aoah<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice and harvested their peritoneal macrophages 10 days later. Anti-FITC antibodies were used to detect cell-associated LPS. We found that the majority of the LPS was intracellular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003339-g002"><bold>Fig. 2 A–C</bold></xref>). <italic>Aoah<sup>+/+</sup></italic> macrophages contained more LPS per cell than did <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> macrophages, because there were more macrophages in <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse peritoneum after i.p. LPS injection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Lu1">[25]</xref>. Anticipating that there would be differences in the intracellular localization of acylated and partially deacylated LPS, we then studied the macrophages using immunofluorescence microscopy. We found LPS co-localized with the lysosome marker, LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003339-g002"><bold>Fig. 2 D–H</bold></xref>), but not with markers for ER (Calnexin), cis and medial Golgi (Giantin), trans-Golgi (TGN46) or early endosomes (Rab5a) (not shown) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Husebye1">[34]</xref>. There was no evident difference in the intracellular location of acylated LPS (in <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells) and partially deacylated LPS (in <italic>Aoah<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cells). Thus, both <italic>Aoah<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> peritoneal macrophages contain LPS in endolysosomes for at least 10 days after i.p. injection; at this time <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> macrophages are tolerant and <italic>Aoah<sup>+/+</sup></italic> macrophages are not, consistent with the tolerant state being determined by LPS acylation status rather than by differential LPS localization within the cells.</p>

<title>The peritoneal environment maintains macrophage reprogramming</title>
<p>We then tested whether prolonged tolerance <italic>in vivo</italic> is due to retention of bioactive LPS in <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> peritoneal macrophages or conferred by the peritoneal environment in which the macrophages reside.

<p>If macrophage tolerance is maintained for prolonged periods by environmental cues, removing tolerant <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> macrophages from an LPS-containing environment should allow them to regain responsiveness to LPS. We injected <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice i.p. with LPS to produce tolerant macrophages. Fourteen days after injection, the peritoneal cells were harvested, washed and transferred to the peritoneal cavity of a naïve <italic>Aoah<sup>+/+</sup></italic> or <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse. Seven days after transfer, we tested whether the donor <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> macrophages remained tolerant.

<title>LPS exposure can induce prolonged macrophage reprogramming</title>
<p>We then asked how the peritoneal environment determines the fate of macrophages. Although bioactive LPS might still be present in the peritoneum, LPS also induces a broad array of inflammatory mediators, some of which (e.g., IL-10, TGF-β, IL-1 receptor antagonist) may promote macrophage reprogramming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Medvedev1">[15]</xref>. To find out whether wildtype macrophages can become tolerant in an <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> environment that lacks LPS-induced mediators, we transferred <italic>Aoah<sup>+/+</sup></italic> CD45.1 peritoneal cells into mice that lack both AOAH and TLR4 (<italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> CD45.2) and can neither deacylate, nor respond to, LPS.

<p>To test whether providing AOAH to mice can prevent or reverse prolonged tolerance <italic>in vivo</italic>, we gave <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice LPS i.p. on day 0, followed by rhAOAH or carrier protein BSA i.p. daily from day 1 to day 13.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Patients who experience severe sepsis develop a state of immune tolerance that may last for many weeks and is thought to be immunosuppressive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Hotchkiss1">[40]</xref>. The phenomenon has been characterized principally by studying peripheral blood leukocytes, whose responses to LPS and other microbial agonists are typically altered to diminish pro-inflammatory cytokine production while maintaining or increasing production of anti-inflammatory molecules such as IL-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonist. LPS-induced tolerance in mice mimics the human phenomenon in many ways (reduced monocyte-macrophage CD86, reprogrammed cytokine production) but not in others (e.g., murine macrophages do not decrease class II molecule expression) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Cavaillon1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although some Gram-negative bacteria can modify the acylation structure of their LPS in ways that may alter its ability to trigger signaling via MD-2—TLR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Reynolds1">[41]</xref>, LPS is also disabled by host enzymes, either on mucosal surfaces (alkaline phosphatase) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Bates1">[42]</xref> or in tissues (AOAH) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Munford1">[24]</xref>. In addition to experiencing prolonged tolerance, mice that lack AOAH respond to small subcutaneous or intravenous doses of LPS by producing high titers of polyclonal antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Lu3">[43]</xref> and developing massive, prolonged hepatomegaly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Shao1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Shao2">[45]</xref>. Animals have many other mechanisms for neutralizing hexaacyl LPS in plasma and tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Munford3">[46]</xref>, yet none of these is able to prevent these striking reactions in animals that cannot deacylate LPS. Transgenic mice that produce greater than normal amounts of AOAH are protected from live <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Ojogun1">[47]</xref>, again emphasizing the importance of AOAH mediated LPS inactivation in optimizing anti-bacterial immune responses.</p>
<p>Continued exposure to microbial agonists can prolong the activation of cultured cells. Hume et al. reported that continuous exposure to LPS induced a sustained activation state in a macrophage cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Hume1">[48]</xref>, and Hedl et al. found that prolonged exposure to muramyl dipeptide, a ligand for Nod2, promoted tolerance in human monocyte-derived macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Hedl1">[20]</xref>. Tolerance has also been described in human cells that may be exposed repeatedly to LPS <italic>in vivo</italic>, such as the alveolar macrophages of tobacco smokers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Chen1">[49]</xref> and blood monocytes from patients with uncontrolled gram negative bacterial infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Munoz1">[50]</xref> or cystic fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-delFresno1">[51]</xref>. Tolerance lasts for weeks in patients who have chronic pyelonephritis with active bacterial urinary tract infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-McCabe1">[52]</xref>, as well as in volunteers with typhoid fever <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Greisman1">[53]</xref>. Individuals who inhale endotoxin-rich agricultural dusts may also develop chronic macrophage activation or tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Poole1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Poole2">[55]</xref>. Here we show that tolerance can be maintained <italic>in vivo</italic> for long periods by the presence of small amounts of bioactive LPS, raising the possibility that the rate and/or extent of LPS inactivation might influence the rate of recovery from many Gram-negative bacterial diseases.</p>
<p>The mammalian MD-2—TLR4 LPS receptor is activated most sensitively by LPSs that have a lipid A moiety that contains 6 acyl chains. Such “hexaacyl” LPSs are produced by many of the Gram-negative bacterial commensals and pathogens that can inhabit the mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Munford4">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Munford5">[57]</xref>. Since AOAH inactivates these LPSs, AOAH deficiency might be associated with greater susceptibility to, or duration of, Gram-negative bacterial diseases that involve mucosal surfaces. To date, genetic linkage studies have found associations between polymorphisms in the AOAH gene and rhinosinusitis (confirmed in 2 populations of different ethnic composition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Bosse1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Zhang1">[59]</xref>) as well as asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Barnes1">[60]</xref> in humans. In addition, two studies of large populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Fehrmann1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Fairfax1">[62]</xref> have independently found that AOAH mRNA expression is associated in <italic>trans</italic> with polymorphisms in HLA-DRB1 that, in turn, have been strongly linked to colitis and primary biliary cirrhosis. How AOAH influences disease expression, if it does, remains uncertain.</p>
<p>The present studies identified the presence of cell-associated and extracellular (cell-extrinsic) LPS as the primary determinant of prolonged LPS tolerance in macrophages <italic>in vivo</italic>. This conclusion is supported by the observations that 1) prolonged tolerance could be induced in either <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> or <italic>Aoah<sup>+/+</sup></italic> macrophages that had been transferred into LPS-injected <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, and 2) <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> macrophages did not exhibit prolonged tolerance when they were transplanted into <italic>Aoah<sup>+/+</sup></italic> hosts, indicating that LPS inactivation by AOAH in the host environment, not in the tolerant cell itself, determines the tolerant phenotype. Tolerance could be induced in naïve macrophages either by direct contact with cells that had taken up LPS or by extracellular LPS acquired within the peritoneal environment. In addition, administration of rAOAH to <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice partially prevented tolerance, and tolerance could be induced in naïve macrophages when they were transferred into LPS-exposed <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice or co-cultured with LPS-exposed <italic>Aoah<sup>−/−</sup>Tlr4<sup>−/−</sup></italic> peritoneal cells, which do not produce LPS-induced mediators but can release fully acylated LPS into their environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Thompson1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Duncan1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Kitchens2">[64]</xref>. Although these studies identify bioactive LPS as essential for maintaining tolerance, we also found that LPS-induced paracrine mediators further promoted tolerance, perhaps in part by extending the phenotype to cells that do not express TLR4. These results also do not exclude the possibility that the epigenetic changes shown to be induced by short-term exposure to LPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Carson1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Chan1">[32]</xref> contribute to maintaining prolonged tolerance in macrophages, but these changes evidently do not persist (or maintain dominance) in an environment that lacks extracellular LPS; they can also be overcome by soluble mediators such as interferon-γ or GM-CSF.</p>
<p>Where does LPS deacylation occur <italic>in vivo</italic>? LPS may be deacylated extracellularly, as was shown using purulent ascites fluid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Weinrauch1">[65]</xref>; both LPS-binding protein and CD14 can present LPS to extracellular AOAH in a manner that promotes its deacylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Gioannini1">[66]</xref>. Alternatively, LPS may be taken up by macrophages, neutrophils, or dendritic cells and inactivated by AOAH, or conceivably LPS could be deacylated by AOAH in cells that have acquired AOAH via mannose-6-phosphate receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Feulner1">[67]</xref>. Recent studies found that the LPS in circulating LPS-HDL (high density lipoprotein) complexes undergoes deacylation in the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Shao3">[68]</xref>, where AOAH is produced by Kupffer and dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Shao1">[44]</xref>. AOAH-deficient mice cannot deacylate LPS in ascites or in cells within, or on the walls of, the peritoneal cavity, and these cells or membranes may then become reservoirs that release small amounts of bioactive LPS over time. This LPS then could maintain macrophage tolerance or induce tolerance in monocytes that newly arrive in the peritoneal fluid. The LPS “depot” includes the peritoneal membrane and/or mesenteric fat, since we found significant quantities of radiolabeled, fully acylated LPS in these sites. Naïve macrophages may also acquire LPS from other macrophages by direct cell-cell contact.</p>
<p>Innate immune reactions to microbes are typically short-lived. Mobilizing an animal's antimicrobial armamentarium usually promotes microbial eradication and clearance within hours or a few days. Potentially harmful inflammation then resolves as the battlefield is cleared and defenses are restored <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Nathan1">[69]</xref>. Recovery is thought to involve both anti-inflammation (preventing inflammation-induced damage) and resolution (clearing the battlefield and promoting return of homeostasis). Known tissue resolution mechanisms include neutrophil apoptosis, macrophage emigration and efferocytosis of dead cells, and the production of lipoxins, resolvins [and other lipids] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Serhan1">[70]</xref>, proteases, and gaseous signals that promote restoration of homeostasis in tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Nathan1">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Rossi1">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Morris1">[72]</xref>. Here we present evidence for another essential component of resolution: inactivating the microbial molecules that tell the host that microbes are present. A host's ability to remove or disable bioactive microbial molecules from an infected tissue may influence the ultimate outcome of many host-microbe encounters, since inactivating these molecules removes an important obstacle to resolution of inflammation and restoration of innate host defenses.</p>

The cells were then fixed and permeabilized (eBioscience) and stained with antibodies to IL-6 and TNF α to measure intracellular responses to <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimuli. We used the per cent of the total F4/80+ cells that were IL-6, TNF double positive as a measure of macrophage responsiveness. Approximately 1–10×10<sup>4</sup> donor macrophages were recovered from each recipient mouse. Fewer donor macrophages were recovered from mice that had been injected with LPS, especially Aoah<sup>−/−</sup> mice; this reflected the known migration of stimulated cells from the peritoneum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003339-Barth1">[75]</xref>.

To measure cytokines produced by naïve cells in the co-culture system and exclude a contribution from tolerant cells, 10<sup>6</sup> tolerant cells were cultured in separate wells and treated in the same manner as were co-cultured cells. The low levels of cytokines produced by tolerant cells were subtracted from those produced by co-cultured cells.</p>
<p>To separate tolerant cells from naïve cells, 10<sup>6</sup> tolerant cells were cultured in permeable Transwell inserts (Corning) overlying 10<sup>6</sup> naïve cells in 12-well plates for 18 hours. The control was 10<sup>6</sup> naïve cells in permeable inserts co-cultured with 10<sup>6</sup> naïve cells. The culture media were collected after 18 hours of co-culture.</p>
