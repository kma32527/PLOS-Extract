<abstract>
<p>The circadian clock integrates temporal information with environmental cues in regulating plant development and physiology. Recently, the circadian clock has been shown to affect plant responses to biotic cues. To further examine this role of the circadian clock, we tested disease resistance in mutants disrupted in <italic>CCA1</italic> and <italic>LHY</italic>, which act synergistically to regulate clock activity. We found that <italic>cca1</italic> and <italic>lhy</italic> mutants also synergistically affect basal and resistance gene-mediated defense against <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> and <italic>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</italic>. Disrupting the circadian clock caused by overexpression of <italic>CCA1</italic> or <italic>LHY</italic> also resulted in severe susceptibility to <italic>P. syringae</italic>. We identified a downstream target of CCA1 and LHY, <italic>GRP7</italic>, a key constituent of a slave oscillator regulated by the circadian clock and previously shown to influence plant defense and stomatal activity. We show that the defense role of CCA1 and LHY against <italic>P. syringae</italic> is at least partially through circadian control of stomatal aperture but is independent of defense mediated by salicylic acid. Furthermore, we found defense activation by <italic>P. syringae</italic> infection and treatment with the elicitor flg22 can feedback-regulate clock activity. Together this data strongly supports a direct role of the circadian clock in defense control and reveal for the first time crosstalk between the circadian clock and plant innate immunity.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Plants are frequently challenged by various pathogens. The circadian clock, which is the internal time measuring machinery, has been implicated in regulating plant responses to biotic cues. To better understand the role of the circadian clock in defense control, we tested disease resistance with Arabidopsis mutants disrupted in <italic>CCA1</italic> and <italic>LHY</italic>, two key components of the circadian clock. We found that consistent with their contributions to the circadian clock, <italic>cca1</italic> and <italic>lhy</italic> mutants synergistically affect resistance to both bacterial and oomycete pathogens. Disrupting the circadian clock caused by overexpression of <italic>CCA1</italic> or <italic>LHY</italic> also results in severe disease susceptibility. Thus, our data further demonstrate a direct role of the circadian clock mediated by CCA1 and LHY in defense regulation. We also found that CCA1 and LHY act independently of salicylic acid mediated defense but at least through the downstream target gene <italic>GRP7</italic> to regulate both stomata-dependent and -independent pathways. We further show that defense activation by bacterial infection and the treatment with the elicitor flg22 can also feed back to regulate clock activity. Together our study reveals for the first time reciprocal regulation of the circadian clock and plant innate immunity, significantly expanding our view of complex gene networks regulating plant defense responses and development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plants are challenged by various pathogens on a daily basis. Accumulating evidence implicates a role of the circadian clock in regulating plant innate immunity. The circadian clock is the internal time measuring machinery important for plant growth and development. However, our understanding of the molecular basis of how the circadian clock controls plant innate immunity is still in its infancy.</p>
<p>Plants have evolved various mechanisms, some pre-formed and others induced, to ward off pathogen invasion. An example of pre-formed surface structures is the stomate, the natural opening important for photosynthetic gas exchange. This opening can provide a portal for pathogens to enter leaves; however, plants can also control the aperture of stomata to physically limit pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Melotto1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Underwood1">[2]</xref>. One type of induced defense is activated when plants recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are conserved molecules or structures present in groups of related microbes. This defense, also termed PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI), can be highly effective against non-adapted pathogens and provides a basal level of defense even against adapted pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Zipfel1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Boller1">[4]</xref>. Another type of induced defense is activated by plant resistance (R) proteins, which specifically recognize secreted pathogen effectors and subsequently activate effector-triggered immunity (ETI). ETI, also termed <italic>R</italic> gene-mediated resistance, is a stronger and faster elaboration of PTI, and frequently results in hypersensitive cell death at the infection site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Jones1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-HammondKosack1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Chisholm1">[7]</xref>. The small molecule salicylic acid (SA) has been linked to signal transduction in PTI and ETI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Ryals1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Tsuda1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Lu1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>The circadian clock has profound influence on the fitness of organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Michael1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Green1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Dodd1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Graf1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Dong1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Ni1">[16]</xref>. The core of the circadian clock is the central oscillator, which in Arabidopsis, is composed of multiple interconnected negative feedback loops that orchestrate biological adjustments independently of external stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-McClung1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Harmer1">[18]</xref>. Of these clock components, CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and its close homolog LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) are transcription factors that are involved in multiple feedback loops and function synergistically to regulate clock activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Lu2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Mizoguchi1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Alabadi1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>The role of the circadian clock in controlling plant innate immunity has long been proposed based on circadian-regulation of defense gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Sauerbrunn1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Weyman1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Wang1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Wang2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Roden1">[26]</xref>. Direct evidence from several research groups has recently emerged to support such a role of the circadian clock. Under free running conditions, wild type Arabidopsis exhibits temporal oscillations in susceptibility to <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> infection, which are disrupted by overexpression of <italic>CCA1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Bhardwaj1">[27]</xref>. Misexpression of several clock genes, including <italic>CCA1</italic>, compromises resistance to the bacterial pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> and/or to the oomycete pathogen <italic>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</italic> (<italic>Hpa</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Bhardwaj1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Wang3">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Shin1">[29]</xref>. Interestingly, although <italic>lhy</italic> mutants exhibit similarly shortened circadian period as <italic>cca1</italic> mutants, LHY was not shown to play a defense role against <italic>Hpa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Wang3">[28]</xref>. This raises the question of whether CCA1 is a dual function protein, affecting both the circadian clock and other non-clock related processes, as shown in the case of another central oscillator component GIGANTEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Oliverio1">[30]</xref>. <italic>cca1</italic>-conferred disease susceptibility might be attributed to a role of CCA1 in regulating non-clock related processes rather than to its direct involvement in the circadian clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-McClung2">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>To better understand the role of CCA1 and LHY-mediated circadian clock in defense control, we tested plants misexpressing <italic>CCA1</italic> and/or <italic>LHY</italic> for disease resistance to <italic>P. syringae</italic> and <italic>Hpa</italic>. We show that <italic>CCA1</italic> and <italic>LHY</italic> loss-of-function mutants synergistically affect basal resistance and <italic>R</italic> gene-mediated defense against both pathogens. Disrupting the circadian clock caused by overexpression of <italic>CCA1</italic> or <italic>LHY</italic> also results in severe disease susceptibility to <italic>P. syringae</italic>. The defense role of CCA1 and LHY against <italic>P. syringae</italic> is at least partially through circadian control of stomatal aperture but is SA-independent. Furthermore, we found that clock activity is modulated by <italic>P. syringae</italic> infection or treatment with the elicitor flg22. These data further establish the role of the circadian clock in defense control and for the first time reveal crosstalk between the circadian clock and plant innate immunity.</p>

<title>The effect of CCA1 and LHY on clock activity can manifest in LL and LD</title>
<p>To evaluate defense roles of CCA1 and LHY, we constructed the <italic>cca1-1lhy-20</italic> mutant via a genetic cross in a Col-0 background that also contains the <italic>LUCIFERASE</italic> reporter gene driven by the <italic>CCA1</italic> promoter (<italic>ProCCA1:LUC</italic>). The single loss of function mutants, <italic>cca1-1</italic> and <italic>lhy-20</italic>, have shortened circadian periods of <italic>ProCCA1:LUC</italic> expression in constant light (LL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Michael1">[11]</xref>. In LL, we confirmed that <italic>cca1-1lhy-20</italic> had a much-shortened period (19.9±0.11 hr), compared with wild type (wt) Col-0 (24.4±0.09 hr) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003370.s001">Figure S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Lu2">[19]</xref>). Although experiments in LL are important for establishing the involvement of the circadian clock in specific phenotypes, such experimental conditions can also be limiting. In entraining conditions (e.g., a 12 hr L/12 hr D cycle; LD), the altered period of clock mutants like <italic>cca1-1</italic> and <italic>lhy-20</italic> is not seen due to the entraining cycle, which imposes a 24 hr period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The clock remains important in such LD conditions, though, because the clock determines the phase of specific events with respect to as dawn and dusk. Mutants with altered period in LL typically exhibit altered phase in LD, with short period mutants exhibiting a leading (early) phase and long period mutants exhibiting a lagging (late) phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Salom1">[32]</xref>. Moreover, interactions between the endogenous circadian clock and external LD cycles can results in phase differences, sometimes dramatic, when measured in LD versus LL. For example, the phase of maximal hypocotyl elongation during early seedling growth was shifted 8–12 hours between LD and LL conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Nozue1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-DowsonDay1">[34]</xref>. In their natural environment, plants do not usually encounter LL. Therefore in evaluating the role of the circadian clock on plant defense against pathogens, it is critically important to study plant-pathogen interactions in LD and to consider the potential influence of the circadian clock on the phases of rhythmic events that might influence the plant response to pathogen challenge.</p>

<p>We show here that in LD the phases of <italic>cca1-1</italic> and <italic>lhy-20</italic> single mutants were leading with respect to that of wild type Col-0, and that the <italic>cca1-1 lhy-20</italic> double mutant exhibited a much earlier phase than either single mutant, consistent with the synergistic contribution of CCA1 and LHY in regulating clock activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003370.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Early phase was also reported with other <italic>cca1lhy</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Mizoguchi1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Alabadi1">[21]</xref>. In addition, we found that plants overexpressing <italic>CCA1</italic> (<italic>CCA1ox</italic>), which display arrhythmic clock activity in LL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Wang4">[35]</xref>, also showed arrhythmic expression of <italic>ProCCA1:LUC</italic> in LD with an acute peak in response to lights on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003370.s001">S1B</xref>). Low <italic>ProCCA1:LUC</italic> activity in <italic>CCA1ox</italic> is consistent with CCA1 being a negative regulator of its own expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Wang4">[35]</xref>. These results emphasize that altered function of the circadian clock can manifest in both LL and LD conditions.</p>

<title>CCA1 and LHY contribute synergistically to resistance to <italic>P. syringae</italic></title>
<p>To test disease resistance of <italic>cca1-1</italic> and <italic>lhy-20</italic> plants, we performed infection experiments at Zeitgeber Time 1 (Zeitgeber Time is the time relative to dawn; ZT1 is 1 hr after lights on) or ZT13 (1 hr after lights off), two times of day associated with drastic changes of light regime.

<p>Under natural conditions, <italic>P. syringae</italic> enters the apoplast of leaves through openings such as stomata and wounds. It is known that stomatal aperture is regulated by the circadian clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Webb1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Gorton1">[38]</xref>. Therefore, infiltration of bacteria directly into plant tissue might bypass the influence of the circadian clock on stomatal defense. To test this possibility, we spray-infected with <italic>PmaDG3</italic> Col-0, <italic>cca1-1</italic>, <italic>lhy-20</italic>, and <italic>cca1-1lhy-20</italic> at ZT1 and ZT13 in LD. We found that Col-0 supported over 10-fold more bacterial growth with ZT1 infection than with ZT13 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>), suggesting that Col-0 is more resistant at night than at dawn when spray-infected. Although we did not observe significant difference in bacterial growth between Col-0 and <italic>cca1-1</italic> and <italic>lhy-20</italic> single mutants, the double mutant <italic>cca1-1lhy-20</italic> showed enhanced susceptibility to <italic>PmaDG3</italic> when sprayed at ZT13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g003">Figure 3A to 3C</xref>).

<title>CCA1 and LHY gate stomatal response to dark and to <italic>P. syringae</italic> infection</title>
<p>Our data show that <italic>cca1-1lhy-20</italic> was more susceptible with spray-infection and <italic>CCA1ox</italic> and <italic>LHYox</italic> plants displayed enhanced susceptibility with both spray and infiltration infections.

<title>Defense-related genes might be preferentially regulated by CCA1 and LHY</title>
<p>Identification of defense-related genes controlled by CCA1 and LHY is critical to gain better understanding of the mechanism of action of CCA1 and LHY in defense regulation. To this end, we analyzed promoters of 571 genes for CCA1-binding site (CBS) and evening element (EE), two <italic>cis</italic> elements known for CCA1 and LHY binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Wang5">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Michael2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Harmer2">[42]</xref>. These 571 genes had been previously selected to construct mini-microarrays, consisting of three groups, selected (337 defense-related genes based on microarray experiments), empirical (127 empirical marker genes for various pathogen responses), and normalization (107 non-defense related genes whose expression levels were relatively stable among experiments with pathogen infection) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Sato1">[43]</xref>. The online tool POBO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Kankainen1">[44]</xref> was used to analyze up to 3000 bp from the promoter regions of these genes, which do not include the coding sequences of neighboring genes, for an enrichment of CBS or EE motifs. The background for this analysis was generated using pseudo-clusters of 100 promoters of up to 3000 bp in length of randomly sampled Arabidopsis genes (1000 bootstrap replications were used in the sampling). Compared with the background, the CBS motif was found as often as expected by chance in the selected and empirical gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>) but the motifs were found less frequently in the normalization gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g007">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003370.s010">Table S2</xref>). When compared to the normalization genes, there was a greater than 40% increase of the cluster mean for the CBS motif in both selected and empirical genes. These observations suggest that although defense-related genes (selected and empirical genes) are not particularly enriched with the CBS motif, the non-defense related genes (the normalization genes) are slightly depleted of the motif. The enrichment of the EE motif was more pronounced in both selected and empirical genes, with about 200% increase of the cluster means when compared to the normalization genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g007">Figure 7D–7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003370.s010">Table S2</xref>). Thus, these results suggest that defense-related genes are preferentially regulated by CCA1 and LHY. However, since the sample size in each group is small, caution should be taken when extrapolating this interpretation to the whole genome level.</p>

However, when spray-infected with <italic>PmaDG3</italic> at ZT13, the double mutants were slightly more susceptible while the triple mutant was much more susceptible than <italic>acd6-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g009">Figure 9C</xref>). These results corroborate a synergistic interaction between CCA1 and LHY in clock and defense regulation. They also suggest that the defense role of CCA1 and LHY is largely SA-independent. Consistent with this notion, we found that in the absence of <italic>acd6-1</italic>, the SA levels are comparable among Col-0, <italic>cca1-1</italic>, <italic>lhy-</italic>20, <italic>cca1-1lhy-20</italic>, and <italic>CCA1ox</italic> in LD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003370.s006">Figure S6A</xref>).

<title>Defense activation reciprocally regulates clock activity</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Increasing evidence has implicated a role of the circadian clock in regulating plant innate immunity. Of the components in the central oscillator of the circadian clock, CCA1 is the first shown to affect plant defense against <italic>P. syringae</italic> and <italic>Hpa</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Bhardwaj1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Wang3">[28]</xref>. However, its close homolog, LHY, has not been shown such a role, despite the fact that loss-of-function mutants in both genes displayed similarly shortened period. Thus, it was unclear whether plant innate immunity is regulated by the circadian clock mediated by CCA1 or by non-clock related function of CCA1. Here we show that disrupting clock function by misexpression of <italic>CCA1</italic> and/or <italic>LHY</italic> leads to compromised immunity, thus further establishing a direct role of the circadian clock in defense regulation. Our data suggest that one of the mechanisms by which CCA1 and LHY regulate plant innate immunity is through affecting stomatal defense with the downstream target gene <italic>GRP7</italic>. We further demonstrate that defense activation by <italic>P. syringae</italic> infection and flg22 treatment shortens circadian period. Thus this study reveals for the first time crosstalk between the circadian clock and plant innate immunity.</p>

<title>The circadian clock mediated by CCA1 and LHY regulates plant defense under LL and LD conditions</title>
<p>Typical studies of the circadian clock have been performed under constant light (LL) conditions to emphasize the endogenous nature of the clock. In LL, perturbations of the circadian clock typically result in altered period length; for instance, loss of CCA1 or LHY function shortens circadian period. However, plants typically grow in LD cycles in which the environmental cycle entrains even a mutant clock to a 24-hour period. Under such LD conditions, perturbations in the circadian clock can manifest as alterations in phase for reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003370.s001">S1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Mizoguchi1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Alabadi1">[21]</xref>) as well as changes in a variety of other traits, including flowering time, metabolism, stomatal activity, gene expression patterns, and defense responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Green1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Dodd1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Mizoguchi1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Shin1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Niwa1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Fukushima1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Kim2">[61]</xref>. Thus, the effects of disrupted circadian clock could become apparent under LL and LD conditions.</p>
<p>Several studies indicate that the circadian clock mediated by CCA1 and LHY regulates plant defense in both LL and LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Bhardwaj1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Wang3">[28]</xref> and this study). For instance, Bhardwaj et. al. showed that <italic>CCA1ox</italic> plants were more susceptible to <italic>P. syringe</italic> infection than wt in LL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Bhardwaj1">[27]</xref>. Here we extend this observation by showing that <italic>CCA1ox</italic> plants had enhanced susceptibility to <italic>P. syringae</italic> in both LL and LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g003">3</xref>, and S2). In LD, enhanced susceptibility was also observed in <italic>cca1-1lhy-20</italic> and <italic>LHYox</italic> plants to <italic>P. syringae</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g004">4</xref>) and in <italic>cca1-1lhy-20</italic> to <italic>Hpa</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Consistent with our data, a single <italic>cca1</italic> mutant showed compromised resistance to a different <italic>Hpa</italic> strain and affected expression of some defense-related genes in LD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Wang3">[28]</xref>. Together these studies firmly establish that plant innate immunity is an output regulated by the circadian clock under LL and LD conditions.</p>
<p>While we mainly focus our analyses in this report on defense phenotypes regulated by CCA1 and LHY in LD, we also agree that we should use caution when interpreting our results since the effect of the circadian clock can manifest differently under different light conditions, including both differing daylengths and light intensities. For instance, it is possible that the degree of susceptibility to pathogen infection and the severity of stomatal change in response to dark and <italic>P. syringae</italic> infection could be different in LD from those in LL in <italic>cca1-1lhy-20</italic> (compared with wt). Alternatively, the amplitude, period, and/or phase of defense gene expression could be different in <italic>cca1-1lhy-20</italic> (compared with wt) in LD from those in LL. Even different LD conditions could have different effects on clock activity. For example, Michael et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Michael3">[62]</xref> showed that the set of cycling transcripts increased with the number of different cycling conditions examined. We found that in 12 hr L/12 hr D, expression of <italic>GRP7</italic> retained rhythmicity in <italic>CCA1ox</italic>, compared with that in wt, although the waveform was altered with baseline expression increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). However, Green et al observed more pronounced alterations in phase of <italic>GRP7</italic> expression in <italic>CCA1ox</italic> (compared with that in wt) in seedlings growing in long or short daylengths (16 hr L/8 hr D or 8 hr L/16 hr D), with maximal transcript accumulation in the dark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Green1">[12]</xref>. Such differences in the patterns of <italic>GRP7</italic> transcript abundance could also be due to other reasons besides light conditions. Nonetheless, these observations together with those of Michael et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Michael3">[62]</xref> emphasize that to better understand the role of the circadian clock in defense control, analyses of defense phenotypes with plants misexpressing <italic>CCA1</italic>, <italic>LHY</italic>, and/or other clock genes should be carried out in LL, DD, and different LD conditions for a comprehensive comparison.</p>

<title>Plants employ different mechanisms to defend against pathogens at different times of day</title>
<p>Although encountering pathogens at different times in a day, Arabidopsis plants were suggested to be more resistant in the morning than at night. To support this conclusion, wt plants demonstrated higher resistance and/or defense responses when infiltrated during the day than at night <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Bhardwaj1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Griebel1">[63]</xref>. We also observed similar results in plants infiltrated with <italic>P. syringae</italic> in LL or LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g004">4A</xref>, and S2), thus supporting this conclusion. However, with spray-infection in LD, we observed the opposite phenotype; wt plants were more resistant at night than in the morning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g004">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g008">8D</xref>). During spray-infection, <italic>P. syringae</italic> initially lands on the leaf surface. Further invasion depends on the success of the bacteria in gaining entry into the host tissue via natural openings, such as stomata <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Melotto1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Underwood1">[2]</xref>. Consistent with enhanced disease resistance to sprayed <italic>P. syringae</italic>, plants in the evening have much smaller stomatal pore sizes than in the morning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g005">Figure 5A, 5B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g008">8B</xref>).</p>
<p>These two seemly contradicting results actually coalesce to suggest different mechanisms that plants use to defend against pathogens at different times of day, depending on the mode of pathogen invasion. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g012">Figure 12A</xref>, at night plants might rely more on closed stomata to physically restrict pathogen invasion but stomata-independent defense is relatively low. If a pathogen can breach stomatal restriction (i.e. being pressured into host tissue via infiltration in the laboratory) at night, it can be more virulent to the host. However, with stomata widely open during the day, plants apparently compensate for enhanced pathogen access to the leaf interior with enhanced stomata-independent defense that is stronger during the day than at night. This cycling in host resistance means that plants can be more resistant to epiphytic pathogens at night than during the day. But in the presence of apoplastic pathogens, plants can activate stronger defense during the day than at night. Taken together, we conclude that plants rely on distinct mechanisms, involving stomata-dependent and stomata-independent defenses, to respond to pathogen attacks at different times of day.</p>

<title>A simplified model for crosstalk between the circadian clock and plant innate immunity.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Timing of stomata-dependent and -independent defense in a day. At night, plants might rely more on closed stomata to provide physical constrains to limit pathogen invasion but have relatively lower levels of stomata-independent defense. Once pathogens bypass such constrains (i.e. via infiltration infection in the laboratory), they encounter a plant host that is more susceptible than during the day. During the day, most stomata are wide open. In the presence of pathogens, plants can only transiently reduce stomatal aperture for a few hours (this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Melotto1">[1]</xref>). Thus, during the day plants might depend more on stomata-independent defense to restrict pathogen invasion. Stomata-dependent defense could be stronger at night while stomata-independent defense could be stronger during the day. (<bold>B</bold>) The circadian clock regulates both stomata-dependent and -independent defense pathways to restrict pathogen growth in Arabidopsis. In a stomata-dependent pathway, CCA1 and LHY act, at least in part, through GRP7 as a direct downstream target to regulate stomatal aperture and thereby defense. Other downstream targets of CCA1 and LHY and other components of the central oscillator of the circadian clock might also be involved in regulating stomata-dependent and –independent defense. On the other hand, pathogen infection can activate PTI, ETI and other defense signaling in the host. PTI induced by flg22 feeds back to regulate clock activity. In addition, flg22-triggered signaling is under circadian clock control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Bhardwaj1">[27]</xref>. Thus, we conclude that the clock-defense crosstalk involves flg22-mediated signaling. Flg22 can affect stomatal aperture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Zhang1">[91]</xref>. However, whether this function of flg22 is through its regulation of the circadian clock or through a direct regulation of stomata is unclear. Other questions, such as whether additional PAMPs, effectors, and other defense signaling molecules are involved in clock-defense crosstalk, remain to be answered.</p>

<title>The circadian clock acts through stomata-dependent and -independent pathways to regulate defense</title>
<p>Our data suggest that both stomata-dependent and -independent defense can be affected by CCA1, LHY, and its downstream target GRP7. Consistent with such a role of CCA1 and GRP7, these proteins are expressed in guard cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Kim1">[51]</xref>. It is conceivable that CCA1 and/or LHY proteins directly affect the abundance of GRP7 via binding to its promoter at different times of day, which in turn regulates stomatal aperture and thereby stomatal defense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g011">Figure 11B</xref>). Since both CCA1 and GRP7 proteins are also found in other cell types besides the guard cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Kim1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Yakir1">[64]</xref>, it is possible that CCA1/LHY/GRP7 also contribute to stomata-independent defense.</p>
<p><italic>GRP7</italic> is unlikely to be the only target of CCA1 and LHY to regulate pathogen defense. First, our bioinformatic analysis suggests that a number of defense genes besides <italic>GRP7</italic> might be preferentially regulated by CCA1 and LHY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g007">Figure 7</xref>). And second, plants overexpressing <italic>GRP7</italic> are not more susceptible to <italic>P. syringae</italic> (J. Alfano and H. Kang, personal communications) while <italic>CCA1ox</italic> and <italic>LHYox</italic> plants are more susceptible to <italic>P. syringae</italic> (this study). Thus, CCA1 and LHY presumably act through multiple downstream target genes to regulate plant defense. Identification of these additional defense genes controlled by CCA1 and LHY should advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which the circadian clock regulates plant defense.</p>
<p>Rhythmic variation in stomatal aperture is known to be regulated by the circadian clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Dodd1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Webb1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Salome1">[65]</xref>. Besides <italic>CCA1</italic> and <italic>LHY</italic>, other genes encoding components of the central oscillator may also affect stomatal defense. For instance, a mutation in <italic>EARLY FLOWERING 3</italic> (<italic>ELF3</italic>) was recently shown to suppress stomatal closure and disease resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Bhardwaj1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Kinoshita1">[66]</xref>. <italic>ELF3</italic> might act through the <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T</italic> gene, which is highly expressed in stomata of the <italic>elf3</italic> mutant and has been shown to affect stomatal activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Kinoshita1">[66]</xref>. In addition, the <italic>timing of cab expression1-1</italic> (<italic>toc1-1</italic>) mutant also shows defects in stomatal aperture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Millar1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Somers1">[67]</xref>. It is tempting to speculate that <italic>ELF3</italic>-mediated defense is related to its role in stomatal control and <italic>TOC1</italic> could also contribute to plant defense. However, further experiments are necessary to validate these speculations. Nevertheless, these observations suggest that the circadian clock can influence stomatal activity and possibly also stomatal defense via different pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g012">Figure 12B</xref>).</p>
<p>Stomata have been proposed as a critical battleground during plant-bacterium interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Melotto1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Underwood1">[2]</xref>. However, it is not known whether stomatal defense can also restrict the invasion of pathogens with different life styles from those of bacteria. The oomycete pathogen <italic>Hpa</italic> does not enter host organs through stomata; rather, germinating spores produce hyphae that penetrate between host epidermal cells and extend through the intracellular space in the mesophyll layer. However, near the end of the infection cycle, hyphal tips emerge through the stomata to the exterior of the leaf and then differentiate into spore-bearing structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Slusarenko1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Coates1">[69]</xref>. Thus, it is possible that host control of stomatal aperture could influence this stage of the life cycle. Although the role of stomata in defense against <italic>Hpa</italic> has not been well established, the fact that <italic>cca1-1lhy-20</italic> showed enhanced susceptibility to <italic>Hpa</italic> infection relative to the single mutants and wt suggests such a role of the circadian clock. Interestingly, while conferring enhanced disease susceptibility to <italic>P. syringae</italic>, <italic>CCA1ox</italic> heightened resistance to <italic>Hpa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g006">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Wang3">[28]</xref>), suggesting that <italic>CCA1ox</italic> plants employ different mechanisms to defend against these two pathogens.

<title>Defense activation reciprocally regulates the circadian clock</title>
<p>While regulating multifaceted physiological activities of plants, the circadian clock can also be influenced by external signals, such as changes of light, temperature, hormones, and nutrients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Salom1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Millar2">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Gutierrez1">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Jones2">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Rawat1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Hanano1">[74]</xref>. Here we show that infection with both virulent and avirulent <italic>P. syringae</italic> strains shortens circadian period in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g010">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003370.s007">S7</xref>). We further found that such feedback regulation can be recapitulated with flg22 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g011">Figure 11A</xref>). Thus, defense activation can also serve as an input signal to regulate clock activity besides being an output of the circadian clock.</p>
<p>Since flg22-triggered callose deposition and expression of genes involved in flg22 sensing and signal transduction were previously shown to be under circadian clock control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Bhardwaj1">[27]</xref>, we conclude that the clock-defense crosstalk involves flg22 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g012">Figure 12B</xref>). Production of SA is circadian regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Goodspeed1">[75]</xref>, however, activation of SA defense does not affect clock activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003370-g011">Figure 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003370.s008">S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Hanano1">[74]</xref>). Therefore, SA is an output of the circadian clock but does not serve as an input factor. Since our data showed that CCA1 and LHY act largely independently of SA, we speculate that other circadian clock components may act through SA as an output in defense control.</p>
<p>What would be the advantages for plants to have clock-defense crosstalk? A properly tuned circadian clock enhances growth vigor and confers better survival rate and competitive advantage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Michael1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Green1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Dodd1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Graf1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Dong1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Ni1">[16]</xref>. Regulation of defense by the circadian clock suggests that timing of effective defense against pathogens is crucial for host fitness in the presence of pathogens. However, defense is an energy-costly process intricately connected with plant growth and development. A feedback regulation of the circadian clock by defense activation could be important for the host to balance growth, development, and defense responses, for instance, to redirect the energy from costly disease resistance to primary metabolism. Consistent with this idea, several phytohormones are potential components of the clock-defense circuitry. For instance, auxin regulates clock activity as an input <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Hanano1">[74]</xref> while auxin production and signaling are affected by the circadian clock and thus are clock output events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Rawat1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Covington1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Jouve1">[77]</xref>. Other hormones, such as abscisic acid, brassinosteroids, cytokinins, and gibberellic acid, have been shown to serve as clock inputs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Hanano1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Robertson1">[78]</xref>. Interestingly, cytokinin affects the phase but not the period of the clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Hanano1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Salome2">[79]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Zheng1">[80]</xref>. However whether these hormones are also on the output pathways of the circadian clock remains to be investigated. On the other hand, ethylene and jasmonic acid production and/or signaling are on the output pathways of the circadian clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Shin1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Goodspeed1">[75]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Finlayson1">[81]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Thain1">[82]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Jasoni1">[83]</xref> although ethylene does not serve as a clock input in Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Thain1">[82]</xref>. The role of jasmonic acid as a clock input is currently unknown. All these phytohormones have been implicated in defense control besides their critical roles in regulating plant growth and development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Bari1">[84]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Spoel1">[85]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003370-Kazan1">[86]</xref>. Therefore further investigating the roles of these phytohormones in clock-defense crosstalk should shed light on the molecular mechanisms by which plants employ to regulate growth, development, and responses to pathogen invasion. Such information could potentially lead to a better control of plant growth and resistance to devastating pathogens, ultimately enhancing productivity of plants.</p>
