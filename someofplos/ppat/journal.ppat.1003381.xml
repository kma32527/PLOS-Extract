<p><italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<italic>Lm</italic>) is an invasive foodborne pathogen that leads to severe central nervous system and maternal-fetal infections. <italic>Lm</italic> ability to actively cross the intestinal barrier is one of its key pathogenic properties. <italic>Lm</italic> crosses the intestinal epithelium upon the interaction of its surface protein internalin (InlA) with its host receptor E-cadherin (Ecad). InlA-Ecad interaction is species-specific, does not occur in wild-type mice, but does in transgenic mice expressing human Ecad and knock-in mice expressing humanized mouse Ecad. To study listeriosis in wild-type mice, InlA has been “murinized” to interact with mouse Ecad. Here, we demonstrate that, unexpectedly, murinized InlA (InlA<sup>m</sup>) mediates not only Ecad-dependent internalization, but also N-cadherin-dependent internalization. Consequently, InlA<sup>m</sup>-expressing <italic>Lm</italic> targets not only goblet cells expressing luminally-accessible Ecad, as does <italic>Lm</italic> in humanized mice, but also targets villous M cells, which express luminally-accessible N-cadherin. This aberrant <italic>Lm</italic> portal of entry results in enhanced innate immune responses and intestinal barrier damage, both of which are not observed in wild-type <italic>Lm</italic>-infected humanized mice. Murinization of InlA therefore not only extends the host range of <italic>Lm</italic>, but also broadens its receptor repertoire, providing <italic>Lm</italic> with artifactual pathogenic properties. These results challenge the relevance of using InlA<sup>m</sup>-expressing <italic>Lm</italic> to study human listeriosis and <italic>in vivo</italic> host responses to this human pathogen.</p>

<p>Co-evolution of microbes with their hosts can select stringently specific host-microbe interactions at the cell, tissue and species levels. <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<italic>Lm</italic>) is a foodborne pathogen that causes a deadly systemic infection in humans. <italic>Lm</italic> crosses the intestinal epithelium upon the interaction of its surface protein InlA with E-cadherin (Ecad). InlA-Ecad interaction is species-specific, does not occur in wild-type mice, but does in transgenic mice expressing human Ecad and knock-in mice expressing humanized mouse Ecad. To study listeriosis in wild-type mice, InlA has been “murinized” to interact with mouse Ecad. Here, we demonstrate that in addition to interacting with mouse Ecad, InlA<sup>m</sup> also uses N-cadherin as a receptor, whereas InlA does not. This artifactual InlA<sup>m</sup>-N-cadherin interaction promotes bacterial translocation across villous M cells, a cell type which is not targeted by InlA-expressing bacteria. This leads to intestinal inflammation and intestinal barrier damage, both of which are not seen in humans and humanized mouse models permissive to InlA-Ecad interaction. These results challenge the relevance of using InlA<sup>m</sup>-expressing <italic>Lm</italic> as a model to study human listeriosis and host responses to this pathogen. They also illustrate that caution must be exercised before using “murinized” pathogens to study human infectious diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Co-evolution of microbes with their hosts can select stringently specific host-microbe interactions at the cell, tissue and species levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Brown1">[1]</xref>. Species-specific host-microbe interactions, which are the rule rather than the exception, pose a challenge for the use of laboratory animal models to study human pathogens, including <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<italic>Lm</italic>), the etiological agent of listeriosis, a deadly foodborne infection. <italic>Lm</italic> is able to actively cross the intestinal barrier, reach the systemic circulation and cross the blood-brain and placental barriers, leading to its dissemination to the central nervous system and the fetus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Lecuit1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>The mouse is a genetically amenable model that is widely used to investigate human diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Buer1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Lecuit2">[4]</xref>. To obtain a mouse model in which the pathogenic properties of a given pathogen are similar to what is observed in human, species specificity can be circumvented by humanizing the mouse by transgenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Dorner1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Lecuit3">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Ren1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Sun1">[8]</xref>, knock-in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Disson1">[9]</xref>, knock-out <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Mathur1">[10]</xref> or xenograft techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Song1">[11]</xref>. One can also adapt the pathogen to the mouse by multiple passages on cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Chua1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Monk1">[13]</xref> or <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Marchetti1">[14]</xref>, or specifically “murinize” a pathogen ligand so that it interacts with the mouse ortholog of a species-specific human receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Bitzegeio1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Wollert1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>The <italic>Lm</italic> surface protein InlA interacts with E-cadherin (Ecad) and mediates <italic>Lm</italic> entry into epithelial cells, which express this adherens junction protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Gaillard1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Mengaud1">[18]</xref>. Cadherins constitute a family of calcium-dependent cell adhesion receptors. Ecad is expressed mainly in epithelia, whereas N-cadherin (Ncad) is found primarily in neuronal cells and endothelial cells together with VE-cadherin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Dejana1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Derycke1">[20]</xref>. Ncad can also be coexpressed with Ecad in epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Makagiansar1">[21]</xref>. Importantly, Ncad has been reported to not act as a receptor for InlA, and so far Ecad is the only known classical cadherin acting as a receptor for InlA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Mengaud1">[18]</xref>. In contrast to Ecad from human, guinea pig, rabbit and gerbil, mouse Ecad (mEcad) and rat Ecad are not recognized by InlA and do not promote bacterial entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Disson1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Lecuit4">[22]</xref>. The interaction of InlB, another <italic>Lm</italic> invasion protein, with its host receptor is also species-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Khelef1">[23]</xref>. InlB recognizes the hepatocyte growth factor receptor Met of human, mouse, rat and gerbil but not that of guinea pig and rabbit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Disson1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Khelef1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Shen1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>Two mouse lines have been established to study InlA-Ecad interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>: a transgenic mouse line expressing human Ecad (hEcad) in enterocytes (hEcad Tg) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Lecuit3">[6]</xref>, and a humanized mEcad knock-in mouse line (E16P KI) with an E16P amino acid substitution which enables mEcad to interact with InlA without affecting Ecad homophilic interactions and allows <italic>Lm</italic> internalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Disson1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Lecuit4">[22]</xref>. Using these two humanized mouse models, we have demonstrated that InlA mediates <italic>Lm</italic> crossing of the intestinal epithelium upon targeting of luminally-accessible Ecad around goblet cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Lecuit3">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Disson1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Nikitas1">[25]</xref>, and that InlA and InlB act interdependently to mediate the crossing of the placental barrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Disson1">[9]</xref>. Epidemiological investigations have confirmed the relevance of these experimental findings, and shown that InlA is implicated in <italic>Lm</italic> crossing of human intestinal and placental barriers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Disson1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Jacquet1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>In 2007, Wollert <italic>et al.</italic> engineered a genetically modified InlA with the purpose of increasing its binding affinity to hEcad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Wollert1">[16]</xref>. Two amino acid substitutions in InlA, S192N and Y369S, were shown to enhance InlA binding affinity to hEcad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Wollert1">[16]</xref>. Neither S192N nor Y369S substitution has been observed in the more than 500 <italic>Lm</italic> isolates InlA sequences we have checked (our unpublished results). Wollert <italic>et al.</italic> published that this increased affinity for hEcad translates into an increased bacterial entry into human epithelial cells (Caco-2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Wollert1">[16]</xref>. Importantly, Wollert <italic>et al.</italic> also showed that this modified InlA binds the extracellular cadherin domain 1 (EC1) of mEcad in solution with a comparable affinity to that of the wild-type (wt) InlA for hEcad EC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Wollert1">[16]</xref>. They hypothesized that this interaction would allow <italic>Lm</italic> expressing this “murinized” InlA (InlA<sup>m</sup>) to cross intestinal barrier and would render wt mice orally permissive to <italic>Lm</italic> infection, a phenotype which is mediated by InlA in permissive models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Lecuit3">[6]</xref>. In support of this hypothesis, Wollert <italic>et al.</italic> found an increased intestinal, spleen and liver bacterial loads of wt mice orally inoculated with <italic>Lm</italic> expressing InlA<sup>m</sup>, yet only after 3 to 4 days post infection, which is later than in models permissive to InlA-Ecad interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Lecuit3">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Disson1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Wollert1">[16]</xref>. Moreover, the ability of InlA<sup>m</sup> to mediate mEcad-dependent <italic>Lm</italic> internalization into host cells has never been tested. In addition, InlA<sup>m</sup> unexpectedly promoted pronounced inflammation and intestinal epithelial cell damages in wt mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Wollert1">[16]</xref>, whereas wt InlA mediates the crossing of the intestinal barrier without inducing significant intestinal response and tissue damage in hEcad transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Lecuit3">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Lecuit5">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>This prompted us to investigate the detailed properties of InlA<sup>m</sup> in cultured cells, as well as the <italic>in vivo</italic> cell and tissue tropisms of bacteria expressing InlA<sup>m</sup>, as compared to that of its isogenic parental <italic>Lm</italic> strain that expresses wt InlA. Here, we demonstrate that InlA<sup>m</sup> promotes bacterial entry not only into mEcad-positive but also into mEcad-negative mouse cells. We show that InlA<sup>m</sup>-mediated entry into mEcad-negative cells is mouse Ncad (mNcad)-dependent. Importantly, InlA<sup>m</sup>-mNcad interaction allows bacteria to specifically target Ncad-positive villous M cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, a cell type which is not targeted by <italic>Lm</italic> in humanized mouse models permissive to InlA-Ecad interaction. This leads to enhanced intestinal inflammatory responses and disruption of the intestinal barrier integrity, both of which are not observed in <italic>Lm</italic>-infected humanized mice and human listeriosis. Together, these results demonstrate that the murinization of InlA not only extends <italic>Lm</italic> host range, but also broadens its receptor repertoire, consequently changing <italic>Lm</italic> cell tropism and enhancing host immune responses to <italic>Lm</italic>. These results challenge the relevance of using InlA<sup>m</sup>-expressing <italic>Lm</italic> to study human listeriosis and <italic>in vivo</italic> host responses to this human pathogen.</p>

<title>Murinization of InlA promotes bacterial entry into mEcad-expressing cells but has no impact on bacterial entry into hEcad-expressing cells</title>
<p>We first investigated whether the increased affinity of InlA<sup>m</sup> to hEcad translates into an enhanced invasion of hEcad-expressing cells, as proposed by Wollert <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Wollert1">[16]</xref>. To this end, we assessed InlA<sup>m</sup>-dependent entry into LoVo cell, a human epithelial cell line expressing hEcad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Lecuit4">[22]</xref>. <italic>Lm</italic> wt strain and <italic>Lm</italic> expressing InlA<sup>m</sup> (<italic>Lm</italic>-<italic>inlA<sup>m</sup></italic>) invaded LoVo cells at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003381-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Because <italic>Lm</italic> can be internalized by InlA-independent pathways such as InlB-Met, we transferred either <italic>inlA</italic> or <italic>inlA<sup>m</sup></italic> onto the chromosome of <italic>Listeria innocua</italic> (<italic>Li</italic>), a naturally non-invasive and non-pathogenic <italic>Listeria</italic> species, in which heterologous expression of <italic>inlA</italic> has been shown to confer invasiveness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Gaillard1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Mengaud1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Lecuit6">[28]</xref>. <italic>Li</italic> expressing either InlA (<italic>Li</italic>-<italic>inlA</italic>) or InlA<sup>m</sup> (<italic>Li</italic>-<italic>inlA<sup>m</sup></italic>) were equally invasive in LoVo cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003381-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These results indicate that contrary to what is reported by Wollert <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Wollert1">[16]</xref>, the increased affinity of InlA<sup>m</sup> to hEcad does not translate into an increased level of bacterial entry. Both <italic>Li-inlA</italic> and <italic>Li-inlA<sup>m</sup></italic> recruited hEcad when incubated with LoVo cells, suggesting that hEcad is involved in both InlA- and InlA<sup>m</sup>-mediated entries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003381-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, upper panel). Because purifed InlA<sup>m</sup> interacts with the purified EC1 domain of mEcad, Wollert <italic>et al.</italic> have proposed, although not tested, that InlA<sup>m</sup> would mediate bacterial entry into mEcad-expressing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Wollert1">[16]</xref>. We therefore tested the ability of InlA<sup>m</sup> to promote bacterial entry into the mouse epithelial cell line Nme, which expresses mEcad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Vleminckx1">[29]</xref>. InlA<sup>m</sup> promoted bacterial entry into mEcad-expressing Nme cells, although to a lower level than InlA in hEcad-expressing LoVo cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003381-g001">Figure 1C and D</xref>). <italic>Li</italic>-<italic>inlA<sup>m</sup></italic> also recruited mEcad during cell invasion, whereas as expected, <italic>Li</italic>-<italic>inlA</italic> does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003381-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, lower panel). Together, these results show that (<italic>i</italic>) the increased affinity of InlA<sup>m</sup> to hEcad does not enhance bacterial entry into hEcad-expressing cells, and (<italic>ii</italic>) the murinization of InlA confers to <italic>Lm</italic> an enhanced ability to be internalized into mEcad-expressing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Wollert1">[16]</xref>.</p>

<title>Respective ability of InlA and InlA<sup>m</sup> to promote bacterial entry into hEcad- and mEcad-expressing cells.</title>
<p>Bacterial entry into hEcad-expressing human epithelial cells (LoVo) (A for <italic>Lm</italic> and B for <italic>Li</italic>) and mEcad-expressing mouse epithelial cells (Nme) (C for <italic>Lm</italic> and D for <italic>Li</italic>) was performed by counting intracellular gentamicin resistant bacteria following 1 hr of infection and 1 hr of gentamicin incubation. No significant difference was observed between InlA- and InlA<sup>m</sup>-expressing bacteria when invading LoVo cells, whereas InlA<sup>m</sup> expression promoted bacterial entry into Nme cells. Values are expressed as a mean + SD (n = 3). Statistical analysis was performed with the unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic> test. (E) Recruitment of Ecad was performed by incubating <italic>Li-inlA</italic> or <italic>Li-inlA<sup>m</sup></italic> with the cells cultured on coverslips for 1 hr, followed by PBS wash and fixation before staining. The cells were stained with the anti-<italic>Li</italic> antibody and anti-hEcad or anti-mEcad antibody. Right panels show separated channels and merge of boxed regions, showing the recruitment of cadherin by bacteria.

(B) The expression of mNcad was decreased in the cells transfected with mNcad–specific siRNAs compared to that transfected with scrambled siRNAs. Decrease of mNcad expression in CT26 cells reduced the entry of InlA<sup>m</sup>-expressing bacteria but not that of InlA-expressing bacteria into CT26 cells. (C) To evaluate the function of different cadherins as receptors, BHK21 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 expression vector harboring the cDNAs of each cadherin.

Expression of hEcad provides gain-of-function for both InlA- and InlA<sup>m</sup>-expressing <italic>Li</italic> to invade.

A genetically engineered <italic>Lm</italic> strain expressing a murinized InlA (InlA<sup>m</sup>) enabling interaction with mEcad <italic>in vitro</italic> has been proposed to constitute an attractive alternative model to study human listeriosis in wt mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Wollert1">[16]</xref>. A practical advantage of this latter system is that it can be readily used to infect several different mouse lines. However, a systematic study comparing the properties of <italic>Lm</italic> expressing InlA<sup>m</sup> to that of its isogenic parental strain has not been performed, neither <italic>in vitro</italic> nor <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Here we show that InlA<sup>m</sup> is able to recruit mEcad and mediate mEcad-dependent entry into cultured cells. We also show that InlA<sup>m</sup> mediates entry into goblet cells of wt mice, which express luminally-accessible mEcad. These results confirm that the S192N and Y369S substitutions confer to InlA a phenotype in wt mice which is observed in humanized mice permissive to InlA-Ecad interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Nikitas1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>Importantly, we also uncover that InlA<sup>m</sup> is able to recruit Ncad and mediate Ncad-dependent internalization. This artifactual interaction translates <italic>in vivo</italic> into InlA<sup>m</sup>-dependent targeting of villous M cells, intestinal inflammatory responses, disruption of intestinal barrier integrity and delayed bacterial systemic dissemination in wt mice, as well as in humanized mice. Such stricking phenotypes are not observed in humanized mice orally-inoculated with wt <italic>Lm</italic>, suggesting that they depend on InlA<sup>m</sup>-Ncad interaction and invasion of villous M cells, but not on InlA<sup>m</sup>-Ecad interaction and invasion of goblet cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003381-g008">Figure 8</xref>). It is important to note that these phenotypes are also present in E16P KI and hEcad Tg mice infected with <italic>Lm-inlA<sup>m</sup></italic>, indicating that intestinal inflammation is a direct consequence of InlA<sup>m</sup>-mediated intestinal invasion, and proving that the absence of inflammation in <italic>Lm</italic>-infected humanized mice is not a side effect of mouse humanization, but is a genuine property of InlA-dependent intestinal invasion. These results are in agreement with the observation by Wollert <italic>et al.</italic> that infection with <italic>Lm</italic>-<italic>inlA<sup>m</sup></italic> leads to severe intestinal inflammation and tissue damage in wt mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Wollert1">[16]</xref>, and with our earlier observation that InlA has little impact on <italic>Lm</italic> intestinal responses in mice permissive to InlA-Ecad interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Lecuit3">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Lecuit5">[27]</xref>. This indicates that the murinization of InlA, in addition to broadening the host range of <italic>Lm</italic>, also extends its receptor repertoire to another member of the classical cadherin family, Ncad, therefore modifying its cell tropism, host responses and the dynamics of infection.</p>

<title>Revisited model of InlA<sup>m</sup>-expressing bacteria at the intestinal epithelium.</title>
<p>In humanized mEcad-expressing E16P mouse, as well as in human, <italic>Lm</italic> targets accessible Ecad around intestinal goblet cells to cross intestinal epithelium, without inducing significant intestinal response. The wt InlA of <italic>Lm</italic> does not interact with mEcad, thus limits the ability of <italic>Lm</italic> to cross wt mouse intestinal epithelium. Murinization of InlA enables <italic>Lm</italic>-<italic>inlA<sup>m</sup></italic> to interact with mEcad and also Ncad of mouse. <italic>Lm-inlA<sup>m</sup></italic> therefore invades not only the goblet cells but also the villous M cells expressing accessible Ncad in the intestinal epithelia of mice. Targeting of villous M cells, which is not observed in <italic>Lm</italic>-infected E16P KI mice and is not predicted to occur in humans, results in severe intestinal inflammation which induces polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) infiltration, intestinal barrier damage and a delayed systemic dissemination in wt mice, all of which are not observed in human listeriosis and <italic>Lm</italic>-infected humanized mice.</p>

<p>The engineering of InlA<sup>m</sup> was based on the rational protein design of a modified InlA that would increase InlA-hEcad binding affinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Wollert1">[16]</xref>. Indeed, S192N and Y369S substitutions in InlA lead to a 6,700-fold increase in the binding affinity of InlA to hEcad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Wollert1">[16]</xref>. Here we have shown that this does not translate into increased invasion of hEcad-expressing cells. Before drawing this conclusion, we ensured that the BHK21 cell line we used does not express other cadherins than the one we intended to study. A possible reason for the observed increased level of invasion of <italic>Lm-inlA<sup>m</sup></italic> in Caco-2 cells observed by Wollert <italic>et al.</italic> is the coexpression of Ecad and Ncad in these cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Makagiansar1">[21]</xref>. These results suggest that InlA-hEcad interaction, although it is of relatively low affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 8±4 µM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Wollert1">[16]</xref>, has been naturally selected to mediate an optimal level of infection.</p>
<p>We have shown that InlB, another major invasion protein of <italic>Lm</italic>, does not play a significant role for the crossing of the intestinal barrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Khelef1">[23]</xref>. In contrast, InlB has been reported to promote <italic>Lm</italic> expressing InlA<sup>m</sup> to invade intestinal villi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Pentecost1">[34]</xref>. Our results shed light onto these apparent contradictory results and raise the possibilty that InlA<sup>m</sup>-Ncad mediated invasion of villous M cells may involve the InlB pathway.</p>
<p><italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, the etiological agent of bacillary dysentery is associated with strong polymorphonuclear infiltration, severe local inflammation, disruption of intestinal barrier integrity, yet no systemic dissemination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Phalipon1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Sansonetti1">[36]</xref>. In contrast, listeriosis in human and humanized mice is characterized by the paucity of intestinal symptoms, the absence of polymorphonuclear intestinal infiltration, little local inflammation, the absence of intestinal barrier disruption, but systemic dissemination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Lecuit3">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Lecuit5">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Sansonetti1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Munoz1">[37]</xref>. We have demonstrated that <italic>Lm</italic>-<italic>inlA<sup>m</sup></italic> triggers pro-inflammatory response and disrupts epithelial integrity in intestinal tissue of wt and humanized mice, and exhibits a delayed systemic dissemination, compared to <italic>Lm</italic>-infected humanized mice. These observations strongly suggest that the targeting of villous M cells by InlA<sup>m</sup>-expressing bacteria triggers pro-inflammatory host responses which contain bacterial invasion but lead to intestinal epithelium damages. This fits with the observation that antigen delivery via villous M cells stimulates immune reponses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Nochi1">[38]</xref>. Like InlA<sup>m</sup>, Als3 is a <italic>Candida albicans</italic> invasin that binds both Ecad and Ncad to invade host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Phan1">[39]</xref>. <italic>Candida albicans</italic> has been shown to favor gut inflammation and promotes food allergy accompanied by gut epithelial barrier hyperpermeability, the underlying mechanisms of which are so far unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Kumamoto1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Yamaguchi1">[41]</xref>. Our study indicates that <italic>Candida albicans</italic> may use Als3 to target Ncad-positive villous M cells, and thereby trigger intestinal inflammation. The specific functions of villous M cells remain poorly understood, yet villous M cells are a particularly abundant constituent of the intestinal epithelium. Our results show that InlA<sup>m</sup>- and Als3-expressing microorganisms would be particularly instrumental to study villous M cell functions.</p>
<p>Repeated infection of mice <italic>in vivo</italic> or mouse cells <italic>in vitro</italic> allows the obtention of “murinized” pathogens adapted to the mouse. Despite the great adaptability of microbes, evolutionary constraints limit pathogen variability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003381-Arnold1">[42]</xref>. A mutation beneficial under certain environmental conditions may end up as disadvantageous in another, highlighting the fine-tuning of host-microbe interactions. The structure-based rational design of InlA<sup>m</sup> was proposed as a subtle and elegant way to electively “murinize” a microbial ligand with least impact on the pathogen. However, we provide here evidence that the rationally designed InlA<sup>m</sup> has gained the unfortunate ability to interact with another surface protein than its cognate receptor Ecad. Even though InlA<sup>m</sup> mediates <italic>Lm</italic> crossing of the intestinal barrier, a phenotype which is strictly dependent on InlA-Ecad interaction, the way by which <italic>Lm</italic> crosses the intestinal barrier in an InlA<sup>m</sup>-dependent manner differs from what observed with wt <italic>Lm</italic> in humanized mice and humans, as does the resulting infection process. This illustrates that murinization of human-specific pathogens, although an elegant and rational approach, may unfortunately mislead rather than ease the understanding of human infectious diseases' pathophysiology. Caution must therefore be exercised before engineering and using “murinized” pathogens to study human infectious diseases.</p>
