<abstract>
<p>The 146-kDa <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic> toxin (PMT) is the main virulence factor to induce <italic>P. multocida</italic>-associated progressive atrophic rhinitis in various animals. PMT leads to a destruction of nasal turbinate bones implicating an effect of the toxin on osteoblasts and/or osteoclasts. The toxin induces constitutive activation of Gα proteins of the G<sub>q/11</sub>-, G<sub>12/13</sub>- and G<sub>i</sub>-family by deamidating an essential glutamine residue. To study the PMT effect on bone cells, we used primary osteoblasts derived from rat calvariae and stromal ST-2 cells as differentiation model. As marker of functional osteoblasts the expression and activity of alkaline phosphatase, formation of mineralization nodules or expression of specific transcription factors as osterix was determined. Here, we show that the toxin inhibits differentiation and/or function of osteoblasts by activation of Gα<sub>q/11</sub>. Subsequently, Gα<sub>q/11</sub> activates RhoA via p63RhoGEF, which specifically interacts with Gα<sub>q/11</sub> but not with other G proteins like Gα<sub>12/13</sub> and Gα<sub>i</sub>. Activated RhoA transactivates the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade via Rho kinase, involving Ras, MEK and ERK, resulting in inhibition of osteoblast differentiation. PMT-induced inhibition of differentiation was selective for the osteoblast lineage as adipocyte-like differentiation of ST-2 cells was not hampered. The present work provides novel insights, how the bacterial toxin PMT can control osteoblastic development by activating heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-family and is a molecular pathogenetic basis for understanding the role of the toxin in bone loss during progressive atrophic rhinitis induced by <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic>.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic> causes as a facultative pathogen various diseases in men and animals. One induced syndrome is atrophic rhinitis, which is a form of osteopenia, mainly characterized by facial distortion due to degradation of nasal turbinate bones. Strains, which especially affect bone tissue, produce the protein toxin <italic>P. multocida</italic> toxin (PMT). Importantly, PMT alone is capable to induce all symptoms of atrophic rhinitis. To cause osteopenia PMT influences the development and/or activity of specialized bone cells like osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Recently, we could identify the molecular mechanism of PMT. The toxin constitutively activates certain heterotrimeric G proteins by deamidation. Here, we studied the effect of PMT on the differentiation of osteoblasts. We demonstrate the direct action of PMT on osteoblasts and osteoblast-like cells and as a consequence inhibition of osteoblastic differentiation. Moreover, we revealed the underlying signal transduction pathway to impair proper osteoblast development. We show that PMT activates small GTPases in a Gα<sub>q/11</sub> dependent manner via a non-ubiquitously expressed RhoGEF. In turn the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is transactivated leading to inhibition of osteoblastogenesis. Our findings present a mechanism how PMT hijacks host cell signaling pathways to hinder osteoblast development, which contributes to the syndrome of atrophic rhinitis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bone tissue is a common target for bacterial infections. Diseases like caries, periodontitis or osteomyelitis are due to infections by <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, <italic>Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans</italic> or <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> inter alia. The mechanism of bacterial-induced bone damage may be caused by factors released from pathogens, which interact with bone matrix or affect bone cells, or by bacteria which directly invade bone cells to initiate pathological changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Henderson1">[1]</xref>. One of the skeleton affecting bacteria is <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic>, which causes various diseases in men and an`imals. As a commensal <italic>P. multocida</italic> is found mainly in the nasal/pharyngeal space of domesticated and wild animals and is frequently isolated from cat and dog bites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Harper1">[2]</xref>. <italic>P. multocida</italic> is directly or as a supportive factor connected to several diseases like haemorrhagic septicaemia in hoofed animals, avian cholera or snuffles in rabbits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Wilkie1">[3]</xref>. In the case of the economically important progressive atrophic rhinitis <italic>P. multocida</italic> has a central role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-deJong1">[4]</xref>. Atrophic rhinitis is characterized by drastic degeneration of nasal turbinate bones, leading to a shortening and/or twisting of the snout accompanied by growth retardation of young pigs. Besides domesticated pigs, rabbits, wild pigs and cattle show atrophic rhinitis-like symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Wilkie1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>The causative agent of atrophic rhinitis is <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic> toxin (PMT), which is produced by capsular type D and some type A strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Frandsen1">[5]</xref>. Inoculation of PMT alone is sufficient to generate all symptoms of atrophic rhinitis in animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-MartineauDoize1">[6]</xref>. Bone tissue is constantly rebuilt by the action of osteoblasts and osteoclasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Rodan1">[7]</xref>. Accordingly, analysis of nasal turbinates in atrophic rhinitis disclosed effects of PMT on both types of cells. Besides bone resorption areas, a depletion of osteoblasts was reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Gwaltney1">[8]</xref>. In <italic>in vitro</italic> models the toxin inhibits osteoblastic differentiation and stimulates the differentiation of osteoclasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-SternerKock1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Kimman1">[11]</xref>. Moreover, a PMT-induced activation of RhoA seems to be important for the blockade of osteoblast differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Harmey1">[12]</xref>. Notably, PMT induces bone destruction but exhibits no obvious cytotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Wilkie1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Rozengurt1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Up to date a detailed analysis of PMT-activated signaling pathways in osteoblasts was hampered by the fact that the intracellular substrate of the toxin was unknown. Recently, we identified the molecular mechanism of PMT. The toxin stimulates heterotrimeric G protein signaling. In the switch II region of the α-subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, PMT deamidates a specific Gln residue, which is involved in GTP hydrolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Orth1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Orth2">[15]</xref>. Once the α-subunits are deamidated, they have a constitutive active phenotype. PMT targets α-subunits of the Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-, Gα<sub>12/13</sub>- and Gα<sub>i</sub>-family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Orth3">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Wilson1">[20]</xref>. A consequence is the activation of multiple signal transduction pathways, leading in a cell type specific manner to strong mitogenicity, anti-apoptotic effects or restructuring of the cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Seo1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Preuss2">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Differentiation and activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts are tightly regulated. Osteoblast differentiation is stimulated by various factors like BMP, PTH or growth factors as IGF or TGF, acting on different types of receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Chen1">[23]</xref>. In addition, previous studies showed that various heterotrimeric G proteins and G protein-coupled receptors are involved in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation. Thereby, Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>i</sub> signaling appear to control differentiation of bone cells in an opposite manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Sakamoto1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Hsiao1">[25]</xref>. The opposing effects of Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>i</sub> on osteoblasts depend at least partly on the regulation of adenylyl cyclase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Peng1">[26]</xref>. Furthermore, it was shown that a constitutive active mutant of Gα<sub>q</sub> blocked differentiation of osteoblasts. Transgenic mice, expressing this mutant in osteoblast progenitors, developed osteopenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Ogata1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Also the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway contributes to bone development. However, the data available are inconsistent, because studies provide evidence for positive as well as for negative effects on bone cell development upon MAPK activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Zhang1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Choi1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>Elucidation of the molecular mechanism of PMT and recent progress in the understanding of bone cell development prompted us to analyze the effects of PMT on osteoblasts and osteoblast precursors in more detail. Here we present evidence that PMT controls the differentiation of osteoblasts by constitutive activation of Gα<sub>q/11</sub>, subsequent stimulation of RhoA/Rock pathway via p63RhoGEF and transactivation of MAPK cascade.</p>

<title>PMT inhibits osteoblastic differentiation in ST-2 cells</title>
<p>To study the effects of PMT on osteoblast differentiation, we used the established cell culture model of ST-2 cells. ST-2 cells are characterized by their potency to differentiate into osteoblast or adipocyte lineages. Thus, in respect to differentiation, the cells are comparable to osteoblast progenitor cells. The primary effect of PMT is the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by deamidation of a conserved glutamine. Recently, a monoclonal antibody was described, which selectively recognizes the PMT-deamidated G proteins but not the unaffected ones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Kamitani1">[32]</xref>. By using this antibody, we could demonstrate that the toxin-induced deamidation takes place also in ST-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Thus, we studied osteoblastic differentiation by measuring the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) after 10 d, which is an early marker of osteoblasts and indicates proper differentiation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, PMT but not the catalytically inactive mutant PMT<sup>C1165S</sup> inhibited the osteoblast formation. Moreover, as determined by the concentration dependent blockade of ALP activity, the toxin was found to be a strong inhibitor of osteoblastic differentiation. 10 pM PMT nearly abolished osteoblastic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Additionally, osteoblastic differentiation can be visualized by using the phosphatase substrate <italic>enzyme labeled fluorescence</italic> (ELF) 97, which specifically stains ALP. Control cells showed strong staining with ELF97, indicating proper osteoblast differentiation, whereas no alkaline phosphatase staining was visible in PMT-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). To exclude that PMT induces degradation of ALP, we quantified mRNA levels. In PMT-treated cells ALP expression levels decreased as compared to cells solely cultured in osteoblastic differentiation medium. In contrast, PMT<sup>C1165S</sup> exhibited no effect on mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>

<title>PMT does not inhibit adipocyte formation</title>
<p>Because ST-2 cells possess the potency to differentiate to diverse lineages, we tested whether PMT also affects differentiation into the adipocyte lineage. Induction of adipocyte differentiation was monitored by the formation of lipid vacuoles. ST-2 cells were incubated for 6 d with adipocyte differentiation medium and lipid droplets were visualized by Oil Red O staining. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, coincubation with PMT did not impair adipocyte differentiation. In contrast, PMT but not PMT<sup>C1165S</sup>, even increased lipid droplet formation compared to the induction by differentiation medium alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The increase in Oil Red O staining could be due to more intense staining or more cells showing staining. To address this question we counted positive- and un-stained cells. PMT treatment significantly increased the total cell number (adipocyte differentiation medium (adm) 183, ±21 SD; adm+PMT 255, ±20 SD, p&lt;0.01, n = 8) and the relative portion of Oil Red O-positive cells (adm 30.5%, ±4% SD; adm+PMT 38.0%, ±3.8% SD, p&lt;0.01, n = 8).</p>

<p>Adipocytes are characterized by the expression of several marker proteins, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) or CCAAT/enhancer-binding family of proteins (C/EBPα). Congruently, quantification of mRNA expression levels of those markers showed no inhibitory effects of PMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>To exclude the possibility that PMT is not able to activate heterotrimeric G proteins under adipogenic conditions, we verified G protein deamidation in an immunoblot. PMT but not PMT<sup>C1165S</sup> led to deamidation under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>

<title>PMT inhibits functions of primary osteoblasts</title>
<p>A system of primary osteoblasts from calvariae of neonatal rats was used to strengthen our studies. Also these primary osteoblasts were directly targeted by PMT as shown by deamidation of heterotrimeric G proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). For functional studies, primary osteoblasts were cultivated for 4–10 d and ALP activity was determined by the ALP activity assay or the ELF97 staining, respectively. As found for the differentiation of ST-2 cells to the osteoblastic lineage, PMT inhibited ALP activity of primary osteoblasts at picomolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). In the PMT-treated primary osteoblasts no ALP staining was detectable with ELF97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). In accordance with the diminished ALP activity, also mRNA levels of ALP were reduced by PMT. Specific transcription factors, e.g. runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) or osterix (SP7) regulate osteoblast differentiation. qPCR analysis of SP7 and Runx2 expression revealed that PMT treatment significantly reduced the expression of SP7 but not Runx2 in primary osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). The formation of mineralization nodules is another marker for osteoblasts. Also mineralization nodules, detected by van Kossa staining, were nearly abolished in PMT-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>

<p>The small GTPase RhoA is one of the downstream effectors of PMT-activated heterotrimeric G proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Orth4">[17]</xref>. Furthermore, it was shown that RhoA is involved in inhibition of osteoblastic differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Harmey1">[12]</xref>. Therefore, we tested whether the direct activation of RhoA is sufficient to block osteoblastogenesis.</p>
<p>To this end, we utilized cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF)y from <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic>, which is a specific activator of RhoA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Hoffmann1">[33]</xref>. PMT and CNFy activate RhoA as shown by effector pulldown of activated RhoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Treatment of ST-2 cells with increasing concentration of CNFy blocked osteoblastogenesis as measured by the activity of the ALP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). RhoA activates several effector proteins like the Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase (Rock). Pharmacological inhibition of Rock with Y27632 abrogated the inhibitory effect of PMT on osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). In ST-2 cells Y27632 not only reversed the effect of PMT but also increased osteoblastic differentiation. This pro-osteoblastic effect of Y27632 was already previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Jun1">[34]</xref> and might be due to the reduction of RhoA/Rock signaling below the basal activity level. Our results demonstrate that active RhoA/Rock-signaling inhibits osteoblastogenesis. In turn blockade of RhoA/Rock impairs the PMT effect on differentiation.</p>

<title>p63RhoGEF links Gα<sub>q/11</sub> to RhoA</title>
<p>A specific RhoGEF protein, which couples Gα<sub>q/11</sub> to RhoA, is p63RhoGEF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Lutz1">[36]</xref>.

To this end, we depleted endogenous p63RhoGEF by sh-RNA, using an adenoviral transfection system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Wuertz1">[39]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g005">Fig. 5 A/B</xref>, sh-p63RhoGEF effectively reduced the endogenous content of p63RhoGEF in stromal ST-2 cells and rat primary osteoblasts.

<p>Figure A/B shows the knockdown of p63RhoGEF. ST-2 cells (A) and primary osteoblasts (B) were transduced with adenoviral vector, encoding for GFP and shRNA for GFP (con) or p63RhoGEF for indicated times. p63RhoGEF expression was analyzed by immunoblot. Equal loading was demonstrated by detection of tubulin. Note: p63RhoGEF is known to have two splice variants and is palmitoylated. All variants are knocked down. (C/D) ST-2 cells (C) and primary osteoblasts (D) were infected with indicated adenovirus for 4 d and PMT-induced RhoA activation was determined by effector pulldown assay.

<p>Moreover, we analyzed the ability of PMT to inhibit osteoblast function in primary osteoblasts after p63RhoGEF-knockdown. In control cells PMT inhibited ALP activity as measured by the ELF97 staining. In contrast, in p63RhoGEF-knockdown cells the inhibitory effect of PMT on osteoblastogenesis was significantly abrogated as shown by strong activity of ALP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g005">Fig. 5E/F</xref>). By this approach we confirmed that the Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-p63RhoGEF-RhoA axis is of major importance for PMT-dependent inhibition of osteoblast differentiation.</p>

<title>Transactivation of MAPK-signaling</title>
<p>The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has been implicated in regulation of osteogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Marie1">[40]</xref>. Therefore, we tested whether PMT stimulates the MAPK pathway in osteoblasts by measuring phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2.

<p>Next, we asked whether PMT-induced MAPK activation is involved in the inhibition of osteoblast differentiation. The MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059 effectively abrogated the PMT effect on osteoblastogenesis in ST-2 cells and primary osteoblasts as measured by ALP activity. PD98059 also blocked PMT-induced ERK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g006">Fig. 6B/C</xref>). The MAPK/ERK pathway depends on the small GTPase Ras, which is the major switch between MAPK cascade and the growth hormone receptor. We addressed the question, whether the PMT-dependent MAPK activation depends on Ras. To this end, we utilized TpeL (toxin <italic>perfringens</italic> large), a toxin produced by <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic>. TpeL mono-O-GlcNAcylates specifically Ras and inhibits thereby Ras signaling and Ras-Raf interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Guttenberg1">[41]</xref>. However, at higher concentrations TpeL is also known to affect Rac1. Therefore, we confirmed that in ST-2 cells and at utilized concentrations TpeL only acts on Ras but not on Rac1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003385.s001">Protocol S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003385.s002">Figure S1</xref>). For further experiments a Ras-selective concentration of TpeL was used. Preincubation of ST-2 cells with TpeL inhibited PMT- and CNFy-induced ERK phosphorylation, demonstrating that MAPK activation by PMT and CNFy depends on functional Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p>
<p>This result prompted us to study, whether the activation of MAPK depends directly on PMT-induced RhoA activity. Y27632, a known inhibitor of the RhoA-regulated Rock I and II, impaired ERK phosphorylation in ST-2 cells and primary osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). Additionally, the Gα<sub>q/11</sub>- induced MAPK activation was studied by using the inhibitor YM-254890 and the p63RhoGEF knockdown cells. YM-254890 abolished PMT-induced ERK phosphorylation. Most interestingly, also the knockdown of p63RhoGEF decreased PMT-induced MAPK signaling in stromal ST-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). Both results implicate a Gα<sub>q/11</sub> dependent transactivation of the MAPK cascade via the p63RhoGEF-RhoA-Rock axis. This signaling pathway negatively controls osteoblastogenesis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Atrophic rhinitis is characterized by increased bone resorption by osteoclasts and a lack of bone regeneration by osteoblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Gwaltney1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Felix1">[42]</xref>. In this study we focused on the effect of the causative agent of atrophic rhinitis, PMT, on osteoblast differentiation and activity. Osteoblasts develop from mesenchymal stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Owen1">[43]</xref>. These stem cells are multipotent cells, having the potential to differentiate amongst others to adipocytes, osteoblasts or chondrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Muruganandan1">[44]</xref>. Therefore, we utilized stromal ST-2 cells derived from murine bone marrow as a cell culture model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Ogawa1">[45]</xref>. Like primary mesenchymal stem cells, ST-2 cells give rise to different cell lineages like adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Ding1">[46]</xref>, osteoblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Otsuka1">[47]</xref>, or hematopoiesis supporting cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Hardy1">[48]</xref>. Under osteogenic conditions ST-2 cells differentiate into osteoblasts. This can be determined by the measurement of various specific markers of osteoblasts like alkaline phosphatase activity. We found that PMT is able to inhibit osteogenic differentiation of stromal cells as measured by the activity and mRNA expression of the alkaline phosphatase. This effect completely depended on the catalytic action of PMT as the inactive mutant (PMT<sup>C1165S</sup>) exhibited no inhibitory effect on osteoblastic differentiation of ST-2 cells. The high potency of PMT is reflected by the low concentrations sufficient for impairment of cell differentiation.</p>
<p>Because of the high potency and effectiveness of PMT to block osteogenic differentiation, we were prompted to test, whether the toxin inhibits any kind of differentiation in stromal ST-2 cells; e.g. osteogenic and/or adipogenic differentiation. Therefore, we cultured stromal ST-2 in a medium forcing adipogenesis. Interestingly, PMT was not able to reduce differentiation of the adipocyte lineage. In line with these findings, the toxin was not able to reduce the mRNA levels of PPARγ and C/EBPα, which typically increase during adipogenesis of ST-2 cells. However, PMT even increased Oil Red O staining. Whether the observed rise in cell number completely accounts for increased Oil Red O staining or the increased expression of transcription factors like C/EBPα is additionally involved, should be clarified in further studies. If the toxin even enhances adipocyte development should also be addressed in a subsequent work.</p>
<p>The data indicate that PMT is not a general inhibitor of any type of differentiation but a specific inhibitor of osteoblastic but not adipogenic differentiation in stromal cells like ST-2. In another cell culture model PMT inhibited adipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Aminova1">[49]</xref>. However, a different cell type (NIH3T3-L1) was used, which is hardly comparable with ST-2 cells.</p>
<p>Primary osteoblasts from newborn rat calvariae were used to verify the results obtained with the cell culture model ST-2. Martineau-Doizè and colleagues previously demonstrated that PMT-challenged rats develop atrophic rhinitis like symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-MartineauDoize2">[50]</xref>. Therefore, our model system of primary osteoblasts from rat calvariae should provide insights into the pathogenesis under veterinarian conditions. As observed for ST-2 cell differentiation, PMT strongly impaired the osteogenic development of primary osteoblasts as measured by early markers (ALP) or late markers of osteoblastogenesis (mineralization nodules). Osteoblast development is under the control of specific transcription factors. For example RUNX2 and osterix (SP7) are well known regulators of osteogenic differentiation, RUNX2 as an early transcription factor and SP7 as a late one <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Muruganandan1">[44]</xref>. PMT induced a significant down regulation of the transcription factor SP7, indicating that not only expression of osteoblast specific proteins, like ALP, is down regulated, but also master regulators of osteoblast differentiation are affected by PMT. However, PMT affected SP7 much stronger as compared to RUNX2. This might be due to the differentiation status of primary osteoblasts, which already undergo differentiation. Therefore, the late transcription factor SP7 might be more active and can be more efficiently regulated by PMT.</p>
<p>PMT reportedly affects primary osteoblasts and osteoclasts in various <italic>in vitro</italic> systems. Mulan and coworkers performed studies with co-cultures of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. They discussed the question whether both osteoblasts and osteoclasts are directly affected by PMT or whether the toxin targets one cell type to induce effects in the other cell type in a paracrine manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Mullan1">[51]</xref>. To unambiguously clarify that PMT directly acts on Gα proteins in osteoblasts, we utilized a monoclonal antibody, which selectively detects a PMT-induced deamidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Kamitani1">[32]</xref>. This toxin-induced modification of Gα subunits was observed in osteoblastic cells indicating a direct action of PMT.</p>
<p>Although PMT did not impair adipocytic differentiation of ST-2 cells, we could also verify the toxin activity under adipocytic conditions. Therefore, we conclude that PMT specifically inhibits the osteoblastic differentiation of stromal ST-2 cells but not adipocytic differentiation, although G proteins are deamidated under both conditions.</p>
<p>To analyze the signal transduction pathway of PMT-induced blockade of osteoblastogenesis, the role of Rho proteins was studied. RhoA is a common effector of Gα<sub>12/13</sub> and Gα<sub>q/11</sub> and PMT was shown to stimulate RhoA via both G protein families <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Orth4">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Vogt1">[52]</xref>. Because previous studies gave evidence for an important role of RhoA in PMT-induced blockade of osteoblast differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Harmey1">[12]</xref>, we started to investigate the pathway utilized by PMT to induce RhoA activation. We observed an increased RhoA activity, after treatment of ST-2 cells and primary osteoblasts with PMT. Interestingly, a specific inhibitor of Gα<sub>q/11</sub>, YM-254890 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Takasaki1">[37]</xref>, inhibited toxin-induced RhoA activation. These results indicate that in the cells studied, RhoA stimulation is predominantly dependent on Gα<sub>q/11</sub> but not on Gα<sub>12/13</sub>.</p>
<p>In a next step we studied the effect of Gα<sub>q/11</sub> inhibition on PMT-dependent blockade of osteoblast differentiation. Gα<sub>q/11</sub> inhibition by YM-254890 abolished the inhibitory effect of PMT on the expression of osteoblast markers (e.g., alkaline phosphatase) during osteoblast differentiation. These results confirmed the important role of Gα<sub>q/11</sub> in PMT-induced effects. Moreover, our results are in line with the studies of Ogata <italic>et al.</italic> showing that ectopical expression of a constitutive active mutant of Gα<sub>q</sub> impairs differentiation and induces osteopenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Ogata1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Ogata2">[53]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition, inhibition of Rock abrogated the effects of PMT on osteoblast differentiation in stromal ST-2 cells and primary osteoblasts reconfirming the pivotal role of active RhoA/Rock as a negative regulator of osteoblastic differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Harmey1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Jun1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>Because RhoA and Gα<sub>q/11</sub> play pivotal roles in PMT-induced osteoblast impairment, we were encouraged to elucidate the missing link between these signaling factors. Heterotrimeric G proteins activate RhoA via RhoGEF proteins, e.g. p115RhoGEF (Gα<sub>12/13</sub>) or LARG (Gα<sub>12/13</sub>, Gα<sub>q/11</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Hart1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Kozasa1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Pfreimer1">[55]</xref>. Moreover, p63RhoGEF specifically couples Gα<sub>q/11</sub> but not Gα<sub>12/13</sub>, to RhoA activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Lutz1">[36]</xref>. By immunoblot analysis we detected expression of several splice variants of p63RhoGEF in stromal ST-2 cells and primary osteoblasts. To clarify the involvement of p63RhoGEF in PMT-induced inhibition of osteoblastogenesis, we utilized an adenoviral shRNA knockdown of p63RhoGEF. p63RhoGEF knockdown in osteoblasts dramatically diminished PMT-induced RhoA activity. These findings indicate that a major portion of RhoA activation depends on the Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-p63RhoGEF axis. Therefore the Gαα<sub>12/13</sub>-induced RhoA activation via other RhoGEFs may represent only a minor part of entire RhoA activity. Finally, the inhibitory effect of PMT on osteoblastogenesis in primary osteoblasts was compared to p63RhoGEF knockdown cells. Primary osteoblasts depleted for p63RhoGEF were not affected by PMT, whereas differentiation of control cells was inhibited by PMT intoxication. These results strongly suggest that Gα<sub>q/11</sub> activity is inhibitory to osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, RhoA stimulation due to the Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-specific p63RhoGEF is sufficient for this effect.</p>
<p>The contribution of MAPK signaling in osteoblast differentiation is under discussion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Marie1">[40]</xref>. Inhibition of MAPK cascade at the level of growth factor receptor, MEK-1 or ERK leads to an increased differentiation of osteoblasts in different models as primary calvaria-derived osteoblasts or in pre-osteoblastic cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Zhang1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Lin1">[29]</xref>. It is known that PMT induces mitogenic signaling via MAPK-pathway in various cell lines as rat fibroblasts or HEK293 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Rozengurt1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Seo1">[21]</xref>. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of PMT on the MAPK pathway in osteoblastic cells by measuring ERK phosphorylation. PMT was found to be a strong activator of MAPK signaling in ST-2 cells and primary osteoblasts. In line with our observation, it is described that MAPK activation blocks osteoblast differentiation. Congruently, inhibition of PMT-induced ERK phosphorylation abrogated the toxin's effect on osteoblastogenesis. Utilizing various approaches, we examined the PMT-utilized pathway to stimulate MAPK signaling in ST-2 cells and primary osteoblasts. Inhibition of Gα<sub>q/11</sub>, Rock and knockdown of p63RhoGEF blocked the toxin-induced ERK phosphorylation. This indicates, that PMT-activated Gα<sub>q/11</sub> leads via p63RhoGEF, RhoA and Rock to a transactivation of the MAPK cascade. Inhibition of Ras by TpeL toxin, which inactivates Ras by GlcNAcetylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Guttenberg1">[41]</xref>, supported the hypothesis that the transactivation of the MAPK cascade by PMT depends on functional Ras. Moreover, direct activation of RhoA by CNFy was sufficient to transduce MAPK activation in a Ras dependent manner. However, it is loosely understood how Rho/Rock signaling leads to Ras-dependent MAPK activation. It was suggested that actin dynamics provide a link between Rock and Ras activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Croft1">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previously, RhoA-induced MAPK signaling has been implicated in osteoblastogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Marie1">[40]</xref>. More recently, a genome wide analysis revealed the GEF Trio responsible for sustained MAPK pathway activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Vaque1">[57]</xref>. Trio contains a primary Rac-specific and a secondary Rho-specific GEF domain, of which the latter one is highly homologous to p63RhoGEF and can be activated by Gα<sub>q/11</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Lutz2">[58]</xref>. Here, in osteoblastic cells, we identified p63RhoGEF as a G<sub>q</sub> effector, involved in MAPK transactivation via RhoA. p63RhoGEF exhibits a restricted tissue distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Souchet1">[38]</xref> and may represent a specific RhoGEF in osteoblastic cells, important for Gα<sub>q/11</sub> dependent signaling. Thus, we suggest that PMT affects pre-/osteoblasts by activating the Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-p63RhoGEF-RhoA axis. This leads to transactivation of the MAPK pathway resulting in inhibition of the osteoblastogenesis.</p>
<p>Besides Gα<sub>q/11</sub> PMT activates α-subunits of the Gα<sub>12/13</sub> and Gα<sub>i</sub> family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Orth3">[16]</xref>. Also these G proteins are associated with proliferative signaling, i.e. MAPK pathway stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Radhika1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Gudermann1">[60]</xref>. However, in the tested osteoblastic cells, stromal ST-2 cells and rat calvaria-derived primary osteoblasts the PMT-activated Gα<sub>q/11</sub> pathway apparently prevails.</p>
<p>The pivotal clinical symptom of atrophic rhinitis is the atrophy of nasal turbinate bones. Over the last decades it was discovered that infections with <italic>P. multocida</italic> and/or <italic>Bordetella bronchiseptica</italic> give rise to atrophic rhinitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Horiguchi1">[61]</xref>. The virulence factors of <italic>B. bronchseptica</italic> and <italic>P. multocida</italic> are dermonecrotic toxin (DNT) and PMT, respectively. DNT activates small GTPases of the Rho family like RhoA, Rac and Cdc42 by deamidation or polyamination and impairs osteoblastogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Horiguchi1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Horiguchi2">[62]</xref>. Our results with the specific RhoA activator CNFy strengthen the hypothesis that DNT-induced activation of the small GTPase RhoA is the key for the observed effects on bone cells. However, combined effects of DNT, directly acting on Rho GTPases, and PMT, activating Rho GTPases via Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-p63RhoGEF, might account for the exacerbation of the disease in the case of coinfection. A single infection with <italic>B. bronchiseptica</italic> causes only moderate bone loss whereas coinfection with <italic>P. multocida</italic> induces more drastic effects called progressive atrophic rhinitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Horiguchi1">[61]</xref>. Moreover, de Jong and Nielson recognized <italic>P. multocida</italic> as the causative agent of progressive atrophic rhinitis without any coinfection necessary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-deJong1">[4]</xref>. This drastic degradation of bone tissue might be explained by the synergy of the PMT-induced effects on bone cells. On the one hand, PMT specifically inhibits osteoblastic differentiation and function and, therefore, hinders new bone formation. For this purpose, PMT utilizes a distinct signaling pathway, which we present in this work. On the other hand, PMT stimulates osteoclast activity and induces thereby a reduction of bone mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Horiguchi1">[61]</xref>. Whether the effect of PMT on osteoclast activity and/or differentiation is direct or indirect is under discussion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Mullan1">[51]</xref>. For example, osteoclast differentiation is regulated by osteoblast-derived factors. E.g. receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) is a positive osteoblast-derived factor for osteoclastogenesis; whereas osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a negative regulator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Sims1">[63]</xref>. Therefore, PMT should at least indirectly affect osteoclast development by targeting osteoblasts. In further studies it would be of interest to clarify the effect of PMT on osteoclasts and osteocytes, which also participate in bone tissue renewal.</p>
<p>Besides this obvious impact on bone tissue, the inhibition of osteoblastogenesis by PMT might result in a further pathogenetic advantage for <italic>P. multocida</italic> as a strong functional interaction of bone and the immune system takes place <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Jones1">[64]</xref>. Recently, the involvement of osteoblasts in B cell differentiation was demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Mercier1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Wu1">[66]</xref>. Additionally, it is known that PMT is a poor immunogene. Pigs suffering from atrophic rhinitis do not develop protective or specific immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-vanDiemen1">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-vanDiemen2">[68]</xref>. Moreover, colonization of piglets with toxigenic but not with non-toxigenic strains of <italic>P. multocida</italic> reduces serum IgA and IgG response to ovalbumin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Hamilton1">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Jordan1">[70]</xref>. Whether the inhibition of osteoblast differentiation via the Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-p63RhoGEF axis is associated with these previously described immune modulatory effects of PMT should be analyzed in further studies. This would present an important function of PMT in addition to the manifest destruction of bone tissue.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings indicate that PMT-induced Gα<sub>q/11</sub> activation impairs osteoblastogenesis via a RhoA – MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003385-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). In pre-/osteoblasts, Gα<sub>q/11</sub> and RhoA/Rock is linked by p63RhoGEF. PMT-induced RhoA/Rock activation leads to a Ras-dependent transactivation of the MAPK cascade, which is responsible for inhibition of osteoblastogenesis. Thus, the bacterial toxin PMT regulates the osteoblastic cell fate in a heterotrimeric G protein dependent manner.</p>

<title>Scheme of PMT-stimulated pathway to impair osteoblastogenesis.</title>
<p>Model of signaling pathways downstream of PMT-activated Gα<sub>q/11</sub>, inhibiting differentiation of osteoblasts. PMT permanently activates members of the Gα<sub>q/11</sub> family. This activation is independent of any GPCR interaction. In osteoblasts, Gα<sub>q/11</sub> stimulates RhoA via p63RhoGEF. RhoA-Rock stimulates in turn the MAPK pathway in a Ras dependent manner leading to altered gene expression. GPCR – G protein-coupled receptor; Rock – Rho kinase, ERK – extracellular signal-regulated kinase; RTK – receptor tyrosine kinase.</p>

<title>Cell culture and lysates</title>
<p>Murine stromal ST-2 cells were obtained from the Leibniz Institute DSMZ (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures) and cultivated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS. ST-2 cells were incubated to differentiate into adipocytes or osteoblasts in the corresponding induction medium for 10 days. The adipocyte differentiation medium (adm) consisted of RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10 µg/mL insulin (Sigma) and 40 ng/mL dexamethasone (Sigma). The osteoblast differentiation medium (odm) consisted of RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with ascorbic acid (284 µM) and β-glycerophosphate (200 µM). Medium including supplements was changed every two days.</p>
<p>Primary osteoblasts were isolated from 2–3 day old rats using collagenase digestion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003385-Panupinthu1">[71]</xref>. The crushed skulls were incubated at 37°C in RPMI 1640 Medium containing 0.1% collagenase P for 15 min per digestion cycle. Extracted cells were harvested and resuspended in RPMI 1640 Medium containing 10% FCS. Fractions 2 to 5 were pooled and used for further experiments. After 3 days cultures were trypsinized and seeded for further experiments.</p>
<p>Cell lysates were prepared as follows: Cells were grown to confluency and serum starved overnight. After 30 min preincubation with the indicated inhibitors the cells were incubated with PMT (1 nM, 5 h).
