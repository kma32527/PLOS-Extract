<abstract>
<p>The triple-gene-block protein 3 (TGBp3) of <italic>Bamboo mosaic virus</italic> (BaMV) is an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein which is assumed to form a membrane complex to deliver the virus intracellularly. However, the virus entity that is delivered to plasmodesmata (PD) and its association with TGBp3-based complexes are not known. Results from chemical extraction and partial proteolysis of TGBp3 in membrane vesicles revealed that TGBp3 has a right-side-out membrane topology; i.e., TGBp3 has its C-terminal tail exposed to the outer surface of ER. Analyses of the TGBp3-specific immunoprecipitate of Sarkosyl-extracted TGBp3-based complex revealed that TGBp1, TGBp2, TGBp3, capsid protein (CP), replicase and viral RNA are potential constituents of virus movement complex. Substantial co-fractionation of TGBp2, TGBp3 and CP, but not TGBp1, in the early eluted gel filtration fractions in which virions were detected after TGBp3-specific immunoprecipitation suggested that the TGBp2- and TGBp3-based complex is able to stably associate with the virion. This notion was confirmed by immunogold-labeling transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the purified virions. In addition, mutational and confocal microscopy analyses revealed that TGBp3 plays a key role in virus cell-to-cell movement by enhancing the TGBp2- and TGBp3-dependent PD localization of TGBp1. Taken together, our results suggested that the cell-to-cell movement of potexvirus requires stable association of the virion cargo with the TGBp2- and TGBp3-based membrane complex and recruitment of TGBp1 to the PD by this complex.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Plant viruses spread their infectious entities from cell to cell via plasmodesmata (PD) through the assistance of virus-encoded movement proteins and host factors. Some RNA viruses encode three functionally coordinated movement proteins organized into a triple gene block (TGB) to facilitate their cell-to-cell movement. TGBp2 and TGBp3 are known to associate with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and ER-derived vesicles. The ER- or vesicle-associated TGBp2 and TGBp3 presumably form a membrane complex to deliver the viruses. However, the identity of the “viral RNA cargo” and whether the cargo is able to associate with the TGBp2- and TGBp3-containing membrane complex during intracellular transport remain unclear for potex-like viruses. Taking advantage of an HA-tagged and a His-tagged TGBp3 construct of <italic>Bamboo mosaic virus</italic> (BaMV), we have been able to determine the membrane topology of TGBp3, isolate the TGBp3-based complex and detect the existence of a stable TGBp2-TGBp3-virion complex. Moreover, we have clarified that TGBp3 plays a key role in virus cell-to-cell movement by enhancing the TGBp2- and TGBp3-dependent PD localization of TGBp1. These results suggested that the cell-to-cell movement of potexvirus requires stable association of the virion cargo with the TGBp2- and TGBp3-containing membrane complex and recruitment of TGBp1 to the PD by this complex.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plant viruses spread their genomes from infected cell to uninfected cell via plasmodesmata (PD) with the assistance of virus-encoded movement proteins. Some RNA viruses, like those in <italic>Virgaviridae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Adams1">[1]</xref> and <italic>Flexiviridae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Adams2">[2]</xref> families, encode three movement proteins organized into a triple gene block (TGB) to facilitate cell-to-cell and long distance movement of viruses. According to phylogenetic comparisons and differences in the mechanism of movement, the TGB-encoding viruses or the TGB proteins are classified into hordei-like and potex-like classes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Morozov1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>Bamboo mosaic virus</italic> (BaMV) belonging to the potex-like class has a monopartite, positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome with a 5′ cap and a 3′ poly(A) tail. The five open reading frames (ORFs) between the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions of the BaMV genome encode the 155-kDa replicase, 28-kDa TGBp1, 13-kDa TGBp2, 6-kDa TGBp3 and 25-kDa CP, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Lin1">[4]</xref>. The three TGB proteins are absolutely required for virus movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Lin2">[5]</xref>. Functional mechanisms of the TGB proteins have been investigated. TGBp1 is located at the cytoplasm and nuclei in the form of inclusions in BaMV- and PVX-infected tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Chang1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Samuels1">[7]</xref>. The cytoplasmic TGBp1 inclusions release functional TGBp1 with ATP-binding, ATPase, and RNA-binding activities, and the efficiency of TGBp1 release is significantly enhanced by the presence of vRNA and CP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Wung1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Lin3">[11]</xref>. Moreover, TGBp1 has helicase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Kalinina1">[12]</xref> and the ability to increase the size exclusion limit (SEL) of PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Angell1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Howard1">[15]</xref> as well as to promote translation of virus-derived RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Atabekov1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Rodionova1">[18]</xref>. TGBp2 is an integral membrane protein of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER-derived granular vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Samuels1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Hsu2">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Solovyev1">[23]</xref> with both its N- and C-terminal tails exposed to the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Hsu2">[19]</xref> and it is able to bind vRNA in a non-specific manner <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Hsu3">[24]</xref>. Ala substitutions of the two conserved Cys residues at the C-terminal tail of TGBp2 make the cell-to-cell movement of BaMV relatively inefficient and systemic movement severely inhibited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Tseng1">[25]</xref>. TGBp3 was found to reside in the ER at the same location of replicase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Bamunusinghe1">[26]</xref>. Moreover, TGBp3 is able to interact with TGBp2 as ectopically co-expressed in yeast and to target TGBp2 to the cortical ER tubules of cell periphery by the sorting signal in the C-terminal region of TGBp3 in both yeast and plant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Lee1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Wu1">[28]</xref>. The interactions among the TGB proteins and CP in various combinations, like TGBp2-TGBp1, TGBp2-CP, TGBp3-TGBp2-TGBp1 and TGBp3-TGBp2-CP, have been observed using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Wu1">[28]</xref>. However, the relation of these interactions to virus movement remains unclear.</p>
<p>Detailed models have been proposed to describe how hordei-like and potex-like viruses move from cell to cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-VerchotLubicz1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Torrance1">[30]</xref>. In hordei-like viruses, the TGBp1 encapsidated viral (v)RNA first associates with the TGBp2- and TGBp3-based complex on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network to form a virus movement complex which is then directed to PD by the PD-targeting signal of TGBp3. CPs are dispensable in the process. In potex-like viruses, both TGBp2-based and TGBp3-driven processes have been proposed. In the TGBp2-based process, two pathways have been considered. In the first pathway, TGBp1 interacts with virion or virion-like particle to form a complex which is transported to and across the PD. In the second pathway, TGBp2 induces novel vesicles containing TGBp3 to bud from the ER. The vesicles associate with actin and move toward the PD; however, it is uncertain whether they are able to mediate the transport of vRNA cargo. In the TGBp3-driven process, TGBp2 and TGBp3 colocalized in the ER are proposed to drive viral genome, either in the form of virion (virion or TGBp1-virion) or non-virion ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex (TGBp1-vRNA-CP) to peripheral membrane bodies (PMB) through the trafficking signals of TGBp3 and across the PD through the assistance of a TGBp2-interacting protein (TIP) and β-1,3-glucanase. CPs are indispensable in both the TGBp2-based and TGBp3-driven processes. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the TGBp2- and TGBp3-based complex in the ER or ER-derived vesicles is able to directly mediate transport of vRNA cargo.</p>
<p>This study was aimed to identify the “vRNA cargo” and to clarify whether it is able to associate with the TGBp3-containing membrane complex. In other words, we aimed to identify the main components of virus movement complex during intracellular transport of potexvirus. To fulfill this goal, we determined the membrane topology of BaMV TGBp3 having a C-terminal HA or His-tag fusion and isolated the TGBp3-based complex from membrane fraction of infected tissues through Sarkosyl extraction. Results from gel filtration analysis of the Sarkosyl extract, analyses of protein components in the TGBp3-specific immunoprecipitate of gel filtration samples and immunogold-labeling transmission electron microscopy of purified BaMV virions demonstrated that the virion can be the “vRNA cargo” that stably associates with the TGBp2- and TGBp3-containing membrane complex. Moreover, mutational and confocal microscopy analyses revealed that TGBp3 plays a key role in virus cell-to-cell movement by enhancing the TGBp2- and TGBp3-dependent PD localization of TGBp1.</p>

<title>The C-terminal HA fusion of TGBp3 does not have any negative effect on both cell-to-cell and long-distance movement of BaMV</title>
<p>The study was aimed to isolate and characterize the movement complex of BaMV. To fulfill this goal, a co-immunoprecipitation strategy was adopted. TGBp3 which assists the targeting of the ER-localized TGBp2 or the TGBp2-containing vesicles to cell periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Ju1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Ju2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Lee1">[27]</xref> and thus the movement of virus across cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Wu1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-VerchotLubicz1">[29]</xref> was chosen as the primary target for co-immunoprecipitation. However, the preparation of anti-TGBp3 using the hydrophilic region of TGBp3 or the His-tagged TGBp3 as immunogen was unsuccessful. Thus, other small tag such as HA or Flag was fused to the C-terminus of TGBp3 through recombinant DNA technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), hoping that the anti-tag could enable us to immunologically detect TGBp3 and co-immunoprecipitate the virus movement complex after infection of the host with the recombinant plasmid clone of BaMV, pCB-P3:tag. Luckily, pCB-P3HA expressing TGBp3:HA had an infectivity similar to that of its wild-type (Wt) counterpart, pCB, on <italic>Chenopodium quinoa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that TGBp3:HA is able to assist cell-to-cell movement of BaMV. However, the C-terminal fusion of TGBp3 with a Flag tag made BaMV lose its infectivity similar to that observed for the fusion of TGBp3 with GFP or mCherry (data not shown). Moreover, TGBp3:HA did not affect long distance movement of BaMV as evidenced by the presence of a severe disease symptom in the systemic leaves of <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>TGBp3 is an integral membrane protein with its C-terminal tail exposed to the outer surface of membrane structure</title>
<p>To immunologically detect TGBp3:HA, the <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves infected with pCB-P3HA were first separated into P1 (cell wall, organelle and cell debris), S30 (cytoplasm) and P30 (membrane) fractions and then probed with monoclonal anti-HA. TGBp3:HA in monomeric form was clearly detected in P30 of the pCB-P3HA-infected <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> but not in S30 and the control P30 prepared from that inoculated with mock, pCB or pCBG (pCB with a green fluorescence protein gene) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, TGBp3:HA is mainly associated with the membrane fraction. However, an anti-HA cross-reacting signal (as indicated by *) migrated a bit slower than the 31-kDa marker protein was also detected.</p>
<p>It has been reported that BaMV TGBp2 has the ability to oligomerize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Hsu2">[19]</xref>. To see whether TGBp3 also has the ability to oligomerize, effect of redox condition on multimerization of TGBp3:HA in P30 prepared from BaMV-infected tissues was first performed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, significant increase in dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric TGBp3:HA were observed when the P30 was treated with the oxidation reagent, Cu(OP)<sub>2</sub>, and solubilized with sample application buffer containing 9 M urea but lacking reducing agent, β-mercaptoethanol, before being electrophoresed on Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel (left panel). However, the relative level of dimeric TGBp3:HA decreased significantly as β-mercaptoethanol was incorporated into the sample application buffer (right panel). Additionally, multimerization of TGBp3:HA in the presence of a membrane-impermeable bismaleimide crosslinker, BM(PEG)<sub>2</sub>, was tested. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, an increase in the level of dimeric TGBp3:HA was observed. Taken together, these results indicated that TGBp3:HA proteins in the membrane fraction (P30) prepared from the BaMV-infected tissues are able to associate with each other to form oligomers.</p>
<p>To identify the membrane domain with which TGBp3:HA associates, co-fractionation of TGBp3:HA with two ER marker proteins, BiP and TGBp2, was examined by linear sucrose density gradient (20 to 45%) centrifugation, with which both marker proteins are mainly associated with rough ER and sediment at higher sucrose concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Hsu2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Sumin1">[31]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g001">Figure 1G</xref>, TGBp3:HA closely co-fractionated with both TGBp2 and BiP at higher sucrose concentration, indicating that TGBp3 is mainly associated with ER.

<p>To analyze the membrane topology of TGBp3, trypsin digestion of TGBp3:HA in membraneous extracts (P30) was first performed. Since both the HA-tag and the sole trypsin-cleavage site, Arg-43, are located in the C-terminal tail region of TGBp3:HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), the detection of a gradual decrease in HA signal by increasing the dose of trypsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) indicated that the C-terminal tail of TGBp3:HA is exposed to the outer surface of the membrane structure. Moreover, we favored that TGBp3:HA in the membraneous extract (P30) possesses a right-side-out membrane topology because the same topology was obtained for the marker protein, TGBp2, under the same condition of membrane sample preparation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Hsu2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Zamyatnin1">[34]</xref>. In parallel, the TGBp3:H6 in <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted proteoliposomes were subjected to partial proteolysis and examination with anti-His-tag. Consistent with the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, the His-tag signal of TGBp3:H6 gradually disappeared as an increasing amount of proteinase K was added into the digestion mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, left panel); while the His-tag signal of TGBp3:H6 was quickly eliminated as the proteoliposomes were treated with TritonX-100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, right panel). These results indicated that the C-terminal tail of TGBp3:H6 is exposed to the outer surface of proteoliposome. To further confirm this idea, sequential maleimide modification assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Hsu2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Wang1">[35]</xref> was performed. AMS and MPB are the two maleimides employed. MPB contains a biotin moiety which can be easily detected by avidin-HRP. If the two cysteine residues (Cys-32 and Cys-47) in the C-terminal tail of TGBp3:H6 are exposed to the outer surface of membrane, they would be pre-modified with AMS, which in turn would lower the level of subsequent modification of TGBp3:H6 with MPB. As shown in the left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, the MPB-modified signal of TGBp3:H6 was insignificant as the proteoliposomes were pretreated with AMS, no matter whether Triton X-100 was present or not (lanes 1 and 2). However, the MPB-modified signal of TGBp3:H6 was significantly increased as AMS was omitted (lanes 3 and 4). According the above results and the similarity in the level of TGBp3:H6 in each of the assayed samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, right panel), we concluded that TGBp3 have its C-terminal tail exposed to the outer surface of the membrane structure.</p>

<title>Extraction of the TGBp3-based complex with Sarkosyl</title>
<p>The membrane integration of TGBp3 led us to presume that extraction of the TGBp3-based complex from the ER or ER-derived membrane vesicles with a compatible detergent would enable us to isolate the virus movement complex if the TGBp3-based complex really serves as a vehicle for virus movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-VerchotLubicz1">[29]</xref>. However, non-ionic detergent such as n-Dodecyl-β-maltoside (DDM), IGEPAL CA-630 or Triton X-100 failed to extract TGBp3-based complex from P30 (data not shown).

However, no TGBp3:HA was able to be extracted from P30 (P) to S100 (S) after treatment with higher temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g003">Figure 3</xref>, lanes 3 and 4), NDSBs (lanes 5 and 6), pH (lanes 9 and 10) or mβCD (lanes 11 and 12), indicating that extraction of TGBp3-based protein complex from P30 remained inefficient after the above-mentioned treatments. The inefficiency of TGBp3 extraction, we thought, might be due to co-precipitation of the Triton X-100 extracted TGBp3-based protein complex with certain existing large complexes during ultracentrifugation, since the concentration of Triton X-100 (1%) used for the extraction was much higher than the critical micellar concentration of Triton X-100 (0.015%). To avoid the precipitation problem, an ionic detergent, Sarkosyl, used to purify BaMV RNA-capping enzyme and assay the endogenous RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity of BaMV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Li1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Cheng1">[40]</xref> was adopted.

<title>Association of TGBp1, TGBp2, CP, replicase and vRNA with the TGBp3-based complex</title>
<p>To identify the proteins associated with the Sarkosyl-extracted TGBp3:HA-based protein complex, immunoprecipitation of TGBp3:HA in the complex with anti-HA was first performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). To begin with, the S100 samples (lanes 3 and 4) prepared from the healthy (H) and BaMV-infected (I) tissues were pre-cleaned with Protein A-Sepharose to generate Inp, the sample used for immunoprecipitation (lanes 5 and 6). After immunoprecipitation of the Inp with anti-HA, a significant portion of TGBp3:HA was found to reside in both IpP, the immunoprecipitate (lane 8) and IpS, the supernatant (lane 10). However, the cross-reacting signal (as indicated by *) migrating more slowly than the 31-kDa marker protein remained in IpS (lanes 9 and 10). These results indicated that the immunoprecipitation is specific for TGBp3:HA. Therefore, we further examined the proteins specifically co-immunoprecipitated with TGBp3:HA (IpP) by silver staining after Tricine SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Two proteins, P28 and P25 (lanes 6, 8 and 10), absent from the immunoprecipitate prepared in parallel from healthy leaves (lanes 5, 7, and 9), were detected. Both proteins were recovered from the gel, subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003405.s005">Text S1</xref>) and identified to be TGBp1 and CP, which are essential for BaMV movement. To see whether there were other viral components associated with the TGBp3-based complex, the IpP was further subjected to western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g004">Figures 4C–E</xref>) and RdRp assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). In western blotting, CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, lane 8), TGBp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, lane 8) and TGBp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, lane 8) were detected. The detection of CP and TGBp1 was consistent with data obtained from LC-MS/MS analysis. In RdRp assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g004">Figure 4F</xref>), similar patterns of RNA transcripts were observed for replication with IpP prepared from infected tissues and with positive control (C), the 1.5% NP-40 solubilized P30 fraction containing BaMV replicase and endogenous vRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Lee2">[41]</xref>.

<title>Stable association of BaMV virion with the TGBp2- and TGBp3-based complex</title>
<p>To further analyze the TGBp3-based complex, the Sarkosyl extracted fraction (S100) was applied onto a Sephacryl S-1000 gel filtration column suitable for separation of large complexes with molecular masses up to 10<sup>8</sup> (100 MDa) or for separation of spherical particles up to 400 nm. The distributions of TGBp1, TGBp2, TGBp3 and CP along the filtration profile were analyzed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Apparently, substantial co-fractionation of TGBp3, TGBp1 and CP was observed in the largest peak, peak C. However, substantial co-fractionation of the main protein components required for intracellular virus transport, TGBp2 and TGBp3, and the early eluted CP (all peaked apparently at F11), but not TGBp1, was mainly observed in peak B. These results suggested to us that the TGBp2- and TGBp3-based complex is able to stably associate with the CP-coated virions but not non-virion vRNP which is assumed to possess TGBp1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-VerchotLubicz1">[29]</xref>. To corroborate this idea, three sample fractions (F11, F12 and F14) from peak B and four (F7, F21, F22 and F26) from peaks A, C and D, respectively, were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA. The immunoprecipitate was then analyzed with anti-TGBp1, anti-TGBp2, anti-HA and anti-CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g006">Figure 6</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, TGBp3:HA was able to be immunoprecipitated with anti-HA in all the tested fractions, except F26 (peak D). Significant co-immunoprecipitation of TGBp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) with TGBp3:HA was mainly significantly detected in fractions (F11, F12 and F14) of peak B. Significant co-immunoprecipitation of CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g006">Figure 6D</xref>) was observed in fractions (F11, F12, F14, F21 and F22) of peaks B and C. However, TGBp1 was unable to be co-immunoprecipitated with TGBp3:HA in all of the tested fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Taken together, these results suggested that peak B contains TGBp2-TGBp3-based complex and BaMV virions rather than non-virion vRNP. In other words, the TGBp2-TGBp3-based complex may be able to associate with CP on the virions. To confirm this idea, the immunoprecipitate was examined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Just as expected, virus particles similar to the purified BaMV-S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g006">Figure 6E</xref>, left panel) were observed in the immunoprecipitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g006">Figure 6E</xref>, right panel), indicating that the TGBp2-TGBp3-based complex is able to stably associate with virions.</p>

<title>Association of BaMV virions with the TGBp2-TGBp3-based complex as analyzed by immunogold-labeling (IGL) TEM</title>
<p>To confirm the stable association of virions with the TGBp2-TGBp3-based complex, we purified the BaMV virions from the pCB-P3HA-infected leaves using a method with Triton X-100 extraction (see Material and Methods). We thought that the Triton X-100-extracted TGBp2-TGBp3-based complexes could be precipitated with the virions if they are truly able to stably associate with virions. The purified virions were thus analyzed with immunogold-labeling (IGL) TEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In this analysis, the 18 nm colloidal gold-conjugated secondary antibody was specific for the recognition of anti-HA and thus the localization of TGBp3:HA; while the 12 nm colloidal gold-conjugated secondary antibody was specific for the recognition of either anti-CP, anti-TGBp2 or anti-TGBp1 and thus the localization of CP, TGBp2 or TGBp1, correspondingly. As a result, TGBp3:HA (the 18 nm particles as indicated by arrows) appeared to locate at the ends and both sides of the purified virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), indicating that the virions are truly associated with the TGBp3-based complex. TGBp2 appeared to cluster at the ends and both sides of the virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), indicating that they associate with the virions in multimeric form. Moreover, TGBp3 and TGBp2 were detected in the same virion at the same cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g007">Figures 7C and 7D</xref>), indicating that the virions are able to associate with the TGBp2-TGBp3-based complexes.

The PD-localization of TGBp1 under the co-expression of both TGBp2 and TGBp3 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g008">Figure 8C</xref>. Clearly, TGBp1 was redistributed from cytosol (upper panels) to the PD (lower panels). Thus, both TGBp2 and TGBp3 are essential for efficient targeting of TGBp1 to the PD in potexvirus and the C-terminal HA-tag on TGBp3 does not interfere with TGBp1 recruitment.</p>

<title>The two conserved cysteine residues, Cys-31 and Cys-46, of TGBp3 play a key role in virus cell-to-cell movement by enhancing the TGBp2- and TGBp3-dependent PD localization of TGBp1</title>
<p>To have a more direct link of the TGBp3-TGBp2-virion complex to virus movement, the effects of mutations of TGBp2 and TGBp3 on virus movement have to be examined. The Cys-to-Ala substitutions in BaMV TGBp2 have been reported to render the cell-to-cell movement of BaMV relatively inefficient and systemic movement severely inhibited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Tseng1">[25]</xref>. To see the importance of TGBp3 to virus movement, three mutant BaMV having either one or both of the two conserved cysteine residues (Cys-31 and Cys-46) being replaced with alanine were constructed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the wild-type (WT) plasmid clone of BaMV, pCBG, as template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). Our results showed that all of the three mutant BaMV lost their infectivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003405.s003">Figure S3</xref>) and that the loss of infectivity was neither due to the defect of mutant BaMV in replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003405.s004">Figure S4A</xref>) nor to the defect of TGBp3 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003405.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). Since the WT and mutant BaMV all contain an expressible green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene in their genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g009">Figure 9A</xref>), green fluorescence spread in mesophyll cells was expected if the tested BaMV has the ability move from cell to cell. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g009">Figure 9B</xref>, green fluorescence spread was observed in mesophyll cells of <italic>C. quinoa</italic> leaves 10 dpi with the WT (pCBG); however, it was restricted in a single cell as the leaves were inoculated with pGC31A, pGC46A or pGC31, 46A. These results clearly demonstrated that the two conserved cysteine residues, Cys-31 and Cys-46, of TGBp3 are essential for cell-to-cell movement of BaMV.</p>

<p>To clarify whether Cys-31 and Cys-46 of TGBp3 are critical for the TGBp2- and TGBp3-dependent PD targeting of TGBp1, pBA-p2/p3HA, pBA-p2/p3C31AHA, pBA-p2/p3C46AHA or pBA-p2/p3C31, 46AHA (capable of co-expressing TGBp2 with the WT or mutant TGBp3) along with pBA-Y-p1 (capable of expressing YFP:TGBp1) were introduced into <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves by agroinfiltration. Localization of TGBp1 to the PD was analyzed two days later by examining the fluorescence of YFP:TGBp1 and aniline blue in the PD. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g009">Fig. 9C</xref>, clear co-localization of YFP:TGBp1 and aniline blue-stained callose in the PD was observed as TGBp2 and the WT TGBp3 were co-expressed; however, such a phenomenon was absent when any one of the Cys-to-Ala substitution mutant of TGBp3 was co-expressed instead. Clearly, Cys-31 and Cys-46 of TGBp3 are both critical for efficient TGBp2- and TGBp3-dependent PD targeting of TGBp1. Taken together, our results suggested that TGBp3 in the TGBp3-TGBp2-virion complex plays a key role in virus cell-to-cell movement by enhancing the TGBp2- and TGBp3-dependent PD targeting of TGBp1.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have found that the TGBp2-TGBp3-based complex is able to form a stable minimal complex with virion (or that TGBp2-TGBp3-virion is the main frame of virus movement complex). Thus, the virion can be an entity for intracellular delivery of potexvirus to the PD. In addition, we have also found that TGBp3 plays a key role in virus cell-to-cell movement by enhancing the TGBp2- and TGBp3-dependent PD localization of TGBp1.</p>
<p>The exposure of the C-terminal tail of TGBp3 to the outer surface of ER membrane as determined by using the right-side-out membrane sample prepared from the BaMV-infected tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g002">Figures 2B</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted TGBp3-containing proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g002">Figures 2D and 2E</xref>) is consistent with the observation that the BaMV GFP:TGBp3 expressed ectopically in yeast was resistant to protease, which suggests that the N-terminal region of TGBp3 is inside the ER lumen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Lee1">[27]</xref>. Owing to the significant difference in the numbers of amino acid residues residing in ER lumen and cytosol (3 to 39 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) in TGBp3, it is reasonable to predict that certain amino acid residues in the C-terminal tail of TGBp3 play a cortical ER-targeting role. This notion can be supported by the fact that I33A, I35A, I40A, I42A, and G44A mutations in the C-terminal tail eliminate the sorting of TGBp3 to cortical ER tubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Wu1">[28]</xref> and that mutations of the conserved cysteine residues in the same C-terminal tail of TGBp3 cause a movement-defective phenotype of BaMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Thus, the abrogation of TGBp3 activity in intracellular trafficking and virus movement by C-terminal fusion of TGBp3 with GFP (this study), 3×HA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Lee1">[27]</xref>, mCherry (this study) or Flag tag (this study) must be due to blocking of the functional amino acid residues or destabilization of the functional structure in the C-terminal region of TGBp3.</p>
<p>The strong enhancement of PD localization of TGBp1 by TGBp2 and TGBp3 as reported in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g008">Figure 8</xref>) is intriguing and significant. However, the inability of TGBp2 or TGBp3 alone to enhance PD localization of TGBp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g008">Figures 8A and 8B</xref>, lower panels) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Samuels1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Krishnamurthy1">[45]</xref> seems to indicate that TGBp2 and TGBp3 need assistance from each other for the PD localization of TGBp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g008">Figure 8C</xref>, lower panel). On the basis of the results of this study and those from recent publications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Lee1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Wu1">[28]</xref>, we conclude that TGBp2 in the TGBp2-TGBp3-containing membrane complex may serve as a “cooperator” that interact with TGBp1; while TGBp3 in the same complex serves as a “driver” to target the whole movement complex to the cortical ER of cell periphery. Moreover, there seems to be an important yet unknown communication mechanism between the TGBp3 “driver” and the TGBp2 “cooperator” for efficient PD localization of TGBp1 according to the observation of a significant reduction in PD localization of TGBp1 by the Cys-to-Ala substitution(s) in the C-terminal tail of TGBp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g009">Figure 9C</xref>).</p>
<p>The existence of a minimal stable TGBp2-TGBp3-virion complex (or possibly a main frame of virus movement complex) and the absence of TGBp1 from this complex under a certain circumstance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g006">6</xref>) suggests that the association of TGBp1 with TGBp2-TGBp3-virion is transient. In other words, the protein components in the TGBp2-TGBp3-based virus movement complex may be modified during the movement process. This feature may endow the virus being delivered a flexibility to regulate not only the efficiency of virus transport but also the cellular events concerning virus multiplication, like silencing suppression or virus disassembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Atabekov1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Rodionova1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Bayne1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Senshu1">[47]</xref>. We assume that the association of TGBp1 with the complex of TGBp2-TGBp3-virion occurs after recognition of the virion by the TGBp2-TGBp3-containing membrane complex and that this association would enhance the efficiency of TGBp1 targeting to the PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g009">Figure 9</xref>) where an increase in size exclusion limit of PD by both TGBp1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Angell1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Howard1">[15]</xref> and TGBp2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Tamai1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Haupt1">[49]</xref> is absolutely required for virus transport across the PD. Following the same logic of modification, the association of replicase with TGBp3-containing membrane complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g004">Figure 4F</xref>) may indicate the existence of a state in which certain replicase-dependent event occurs during virus movement. This idea can be supported by the finding that interaction between viral CP and the helicase-like domain of replicase is essential for virus movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Lee2">[41]</xref>. The overlapping function of replicase in virus movement and replication, the presence of TGBp3 and replicase in ER at the same location <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Bamunusinghe1">[26]</xref>, and the co-localization of TGBp3-containing granular vesicles with virions in X-body, where virus replication occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Tilsner1">[50]</xref> suggest that the TGBp3-containing membrane complex may also be a base for virus replication. Moreover, the existence of a stable TGBp3-TGBp2-virion complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g007">7</xref>) in combination with the strong requirement of TGBp2 and TGBp3 for efficient CP targeting to cell periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Wu1">[28]</xref>, the strong enhancement of PD localization of TGBp1 by both TGBp2 and TGBp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g008">Figure 8</xref>) and the defect of cell-to-cell movement caused by the Cys-to-Ala substitutions of TGBp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g009">Figure 9</xref>) suggest that the PD localization of virions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-SantaCruz1">[51]</xref> and the subsequent virus penetration into the adjacent cell can be achieved through the help of the minimal stable TGBp3-TGBp2-virion complex in accompany with TGBp1.</p>
<p>Based on our results, a refined model for the PD-targeting of virion involving the formation of a stable TGBp2-TGBp3-virion complex is proposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g010">Figure 10</xref>). On the perinuclear ER-derived membrane-bound body (MBB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-VerchotLubicz1">[29]</xref> or viral replication complex (VRC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Tilsner1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Tilsner2">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Verchot1">[53]</xref>, the putative factory for viral RNA translation, synthesis and encapsidation, the newly formed virions would associate stably with the membrane complex containing TGBp2 and TGBp3, co-expressed on the same MBB or VRC, through the interaction between TGBp2 and virion CP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Wu1">[28]</xref>. Subsequently, TGBp1, which is also synthesized on MBB or VRC and stays in cytosol would be recruited to the complex of TGBp3-TGBp2-virion during the transport of this complex via the interactions between TGBp1 and TGBp2, or/and TGBp1 and virion CP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Wu1">[28]</xref>. The TGBp1-TGBp2-TGBp3-virion complex then moved alongside the ER network toward the PD by the targeting signal of TGBp3 (Path 1 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003405-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Alternatively, the virus movement may adapt “Path 2”, in which the virions would associate with the TGBp2-induced ER-derived TGBp2- and TGBp3-containing membrane vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Ju1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003405-Ju2">[21]</xref>. The virion-associated vesicles are then transported to the PD through actin filament. If TGBp1 do not joint the TGBp2-TGBp3-virion movement complex on MBB or VRC, the association of cytoplasmic TGBp1 with the virion-associated complex may occur during the process of movement complex trafficking.</p>
