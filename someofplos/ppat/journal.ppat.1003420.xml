<abstract>
<p>Glycan masking is an emerging vaccine design strategy to focus antibody responses to specific epitopes, but it has mostly been evaluated on the already heavily glycosylated HIV gp120 envelope glycoprotein. Here this approach was used to investigate the binding interaction of <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> Duffy Binding Protein (PvDBP) and the Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) and to evaluate if glycan-masked PvDBPII immunogens would focus the antibody response on key interaction surfaces. Four variants of PVDBPII were generated and probed for function and immunogenicity. Whereas two PvDBPII glycosylation variants with increased glycan surface coverage distant from predicted interaction sites had equivalent binding activity to wild-type protein, one of them elicited slightly better DARC-binding-inhibitory activity than wild-type immunogen. Conversely, the addition of an N-glycosylation site adjacent to a predicted PvDBP interaction site both abolished its interaction with DARC and resulted in weaker inhibitory antibody responses. PvDBP is composed of three subdomains and is thought to function as a dimer; a meta-analysis of published PvDBP mutants and the new DBPII glycosylation variants indicates that critical DARC binding residues are concentrated at the dimer interface and along a relatively flat surface spanning portions of two subdomains. Our findings suggest that DARC-binding-inhibitory antibody epitope(s) lie close to the predicted DARC interaction site, and that addition of N-glycan sites distant from this site may augment inhibitory antibodies. Thus, glycan resurfacing is an attractive and feasible tool to investigate protein structure-function, and glycan-masked PvDBPII immunogens might contribute to <italic>P. vivax</italic> vaccine development.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>An important goal of many vaccine efforts is to inhibit pathogen invasion of host cells, but few approaches exist to target vaccine antibodies on invasion blocking epitopes. Glycan masking is a vaccine design strategy to hide protein surfaces with carbohydrates and focus antibodies on exposed surfaces. This approach has mostly been evaluated on the heavily glycosylated HIV envelope glycoprotein, but it has never been tested on eukaryotic pathogens, such as <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, which have limited N-glycosylation machinery and therefore may provide a better platform to explore this strategy. Here, we used glycan masking to investigate the binding interaction between <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> Duffy binding protein (PvDBP) and the Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC). This study showed that addition of an N-glycan site in a predicted host interaction surface abolished binding and potentially covered up an inhibitory antibody epitope. In contrast, addition of multiple N-glycan sites distant from predicted interaction surfaces did not inhibit binding but did slightly enhance elicitation of inhibitory antibodies. This analysis shows that glycan resurfacing offers an integrated approach to characterize protein function and immunogenicity and that glycan resurfacing of PvDBPII immunogens may have utility in <italic>P. vivax</italic>-malaria vaccine development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> invasion of human reticulocytes is strongly dependent on an interaction between the <italic>P. vivax</italic> Duffy Binding Protein (PvDBP) and the Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) on the reticulocyte surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Chitnis1">[1]</xref>. DARC-negative individuals are highly resistant to <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Miller1">[2]</xref> and the DARC-null phenotype has independently arisen in different human populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Tournamille1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Zimmerman1">[4]</xref>. Although an alternative pathway of <italic>P. vivax</italic> invasion has recently been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Menard1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Wurtz1">[6]</xref>, DARC-null carriers have reduced susceptibility to <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Zimmerman1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Kasehagen1">[7]</xref> and the FyA DARC allele shows reduced binding to PvDBP and is more susceptible to antibody blocking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-King1">[8]</xref>. Thus, the PvDBP-DARC interaction has a critical role in <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection making it an attractive vaccine target.</p>
<p>The molecular mechanisms of PvDBP-DARC binding and immune evasion are only partially understood. PvDBP is a member of the Erythrocyte Binding-Like (EBL) protein superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Adams1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Fang1">[11]</xref>. The extracellular region of PvDBP has been divided into six regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Adams2">[10]</xref>, of which DARC binding has been localized to region II (PvDBPII) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Chitnis2">[12]</xref>. The structure of PvDBPII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Batchelor1">[13]</xref> and a related Duffy binding protein of the simian malaria parasite <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> (Pkα-DBL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Singh1">[14]</xref> has been solved and is composed of three subdomains – subdomain 1, 2 and 3. PvDBPII binds to the N-terminal 65 residues of DARC with a sulfated tyrosine on DARC at position 41 having a critical role in binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Choe1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Horuk1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although the PvDBP structure has been solved, the precise extent of the DARC binding “footprint” remains unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Hans1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-VanBuskirk1">[18]</xref>, and there is limited understanding of the epitopes for DARC-inhibitory antibodies on PvDBP. Two different PvDBP-DARC binding models have been proposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The “just in time” model hypothesizes that PvDBP engages DARC in a monomer-monomer interaction and that binding occurs so rapidly that the binding site is not under strong antibody attack <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Singh1">[14]</xref>. In this model, the putative sulfotryosine binding pocket is located at a relatively flat surface in subdomain 2, on the opposite surface from a cluster of polymorphic residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Chitnis1">[1]</xref>. It has also been proposed that adjacent residues from subdomain 1 form the sulfotyrosine-binding pocket, in an analogous manner to how sulphated tyrosines facilitate the gp120-CCR5 interaction during HIV invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Bolton1">[19]</xref>. For convenience, we will refer to the flat surface on subdomain 2 as the sulfotryosine binding pocket (STBP) when referring to this location (light blue residues in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g001">Figure 1</xref>), although this remains to be established. The second model, termed “receptor-mediated ligand dimerization”, hypothesizes that DARC binding drives dimerization between PvDBP monomers and that the sulfotyrosine-binding pocket and DARC binding pocket are formed at the dimer interface, at distinct residues from the “just in time” model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Batchelor1">[13]</xref>.</p>

<p>These two binding models are not necessarily exclusive but lead to different predictions about how antibodies may inhibit <italic>P. vivax</italic> invasion of reticulocytes. High titer and broadly neutralizing antibodies to PvDBP are only found after repeated infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Chootong1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Michon1">[23]</xref>, indicating that PvDBP is not highly immunogenic during infection. Naturally acquired inhibitory antibodies map to the dimer interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Batchelor1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Chootong1">[20]</xref>, suggesting that one mechanism of antibody action may be interference with receptor dimerization. Other inhibitory epitopes have been mapped to the highly conserved subdomain 3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Siddiqui1">[24]</xref> and a polymorphic residue located near the putative STBP in subdomain 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-VanBuskirk2">[25]</xref>, indicating that some inhibitory epitopes may be selected for immune evasion. <italic>P. vivax</italic> dependence on DARC for invasion and its restrictive preference for reticulocytes supports PvDBP vaccine development. However, the rapid kinetics of parasite invasion (less than one minute) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Dvorak1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Gilson1">[27]</xref> combined with PvDBP polymorphism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Gosi1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Xainli1">[29]</xref> pose challenges for vaccine development that may be addressable by the rational redesign of PvDBPII for improved immunogenic properties.</p>
<p>Structural vaccinology is an emerging strategy that uses three dimensional structure to guide immunogen design to improve functional antibody responses. Viral enveloped pathogens, like HIV, use a number of mechanisms to evade immune surveillance, one of them being glycan shielding of epitopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-KarlssonHedestam1">[30]</xref>. Glycan masking, or surface glycoengineering, has been applied to HIV vaccine development as a means to shield regions of the gp120 surface from antibody recognition, but this has not resulted in elicitation of more potent or more broadly-cross-reactive neutralizing antibody responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Garrity1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Selvarajah2">[35]</xref>. However, gp120 is one of the most heavily glycosylated proteins in nature, so it may not offer the optimum protein scaffold to evaluate this strategy. Conversely, many deep branching eukaryotic pathogens, such as <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Giardia</italic>, have limited N-glycosylation machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Samuelson1">[36]</xref>, and consequently are not as highly evolved for glycan shielding. Thus, malaria proteins may be more amenable to glycan masking. Here, glycan masking was employed as a strategy both to investigate the PvDBP-DARC binding model and to evaluate whether it increased DARC-binding-inhibitory antibodies.</p>

<title>Design of surface re-engineered PvDBPII recombinant proteins containing additional N-linked glycan sites</title>
<p>The monomeric crystal structure of the <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> α DBL domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Singh1">[14]</xref> was used to guide glycan masking of PvDBPII recombinant proteins. Defined secondary structure regions in PvDBPII are largely helical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Batchelor1">[13]</xref> – subdomain 1 contains a β-hairpin, subdomain 2 is a four-helix bundle, and subdomain 3 contains a double helical bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g001">Figure 1</xref>). N-glycosylation sites occur most frequently in regions of change in secondary structure, and least frequently on helices than any other secondary structural element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Petrescu1">[37]</xref>. The PvDBPII dimer interface is formed between contacts across helical domains in the two monomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Batchelor1">[13]</xref>, and consequently N-glycan acceptor sites were not added to this location. Instead, glycosylation sites were mostly added on surface exposed loops and the ends of helices that were not expected to contribute to invasion blocking epitopes but were expected to be accessible to antibodies.</p>
<p>The PvDBP sequence from the <italic>P. vivax</italic> Salvador 1 strain (Sal1) contains three potential N-glycosylation sites at positions 255, 351 and 420 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g002">Figure 2</xref>). As the three native positions were located at the surface of subdomain 2 or subdomain 3 of PvDBPII distinct from the putative DARC interaction surface or dimerization surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g001">Figure 1</xref>), all three were retained in all of the hyperglycosylated variant sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003420-t001">Table 1</xref>). Three DBPII glycosylation variants were designed containing a total of four, six and 11 N-linked glycans, called “STBP glycan”, “P1” and “Max” respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003420-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003420.s001">Figure S1</xref>). To evaluate the PvDBP-DARC interaction model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Singh1">[14]</xref>, the “STBP glycan” was generated by adding an N-glycan site at position 374, where it would potentially cover the predicted sulfotyrosine binding pocket in subdomain 2 (model 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and inhibit binding to reticulocytes. The remaining two glycan variants were designed to shield polymorphic residues in PvDBP but retain exposure of proposed interaction surfaces for DARC binding and/or PvDBP dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g002">2</xref>). There are at least 36 polymorphic positions in PvDBPII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Gosi1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Xainli1">[29]</xref>, but many sequence variants are extremely rare (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003420.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The majority of polymorphic residues are dimorphic and localized to subdomain 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Critical DARC binding residues and several linear antibody inhibitory epitopes have been mapped to the N-terminus of subdomain 1, helices 2–5, and the connecting loop between subdomains 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g002">Figure 2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Hans1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Chootong1">[20]</xref>. P1, the second DBPII glycosylation variant was generated by adding three extra N-linked glycosylation sites at positions 264, 462, 486. The addition of an N-glycan site at 264, along with the native N- glycan sites at position 255 and 351 was designed to shield polymorphic residues that are present in subdomain 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g002">2</xref>). N-glycan sites at position 462 and 486 along with the native glycosylation site at position 420 were designed to cover a portion of subdomain 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g002">2</xref>). A third DBPII glycosylation variant, “Max”, contained the six N-glycan sites on P1, plus five additional N-glycan sites at 232, 341, 412, 467 and 495, thus bringing the consensus N-linked glycan sites in Max to 11. Addition of N-glycan sites at 412, 462, 467, 486, and 495, along with the native site at 420, were designed to cover all the surface accessible loops on subdomain 3. Further addition of N-glycan sites at positions 264 and 341, along with the native N-glycosylation sites at 255 and 351, were designed to cover all loops in subdomain 2 including a polymorphic loop between helices 1 and 2 and the highly polymorphic helix 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g002">2</xref>). The Max glycosylation variant, with 11 N-glycans, should have a large surface area of PvDBPII shielded by glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g001">Figure 1</xref>), but none of the N-glycosylation sites are at the dimer interface or predicted to interfere with DARC binding.</p>

<title>Expression and purification of surface re-engineered PvDBPII recombinant proteins containing additional N-linked glycan residues</title>
<p>To produce glycoengineered recombinant proteins, constructs were secreted from the mammalian cell line HEK293F. All of the recombinant proteins were purified to homogeneity, and no truncation products were seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g003">Figure 3A–B</xref>). Each N-glycan adds about 2 kDa to the protein. A ladder effect consistent with increasing N-glycosylation was observed for the recombinant proteins. The wild-type PvDBPII (3 N-glycan sites), STBP glycan and P1 ran at their expected molecular weight, whereas Max migrated slightly lower than the expected fully glycosylated molecular weight of 65 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Partial glycosylation (underutilization) of some of the 11 N-linked glycosylation sites could account for this. When the proteins were subjected to N-glycosidase treatment, all of DBPII glycosylation variants and the wild-type protein were reduced to a similar size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). These results suggest that many of the introduced sites were appropriately glycosylated in PvDBPII and its N-glycan variants.</p>

<title>Functional characterization of hyperglycosylated PvDBPII variants by standard in vitro binding assay</title>
<p>The functional effect of adding N-glycans on PvDBPII was assessed by using an established in vitro PvDBPII cytoadherence assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Chitnis2">[12]</xref>. In this assay PvDBPII is expressed at the surface of COS-7 cells as a fusion protein with HSVgD1 to aid in surface expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Michon1">[23]</xref>. A GFP reporter is added at the cytoplasmic tail to facilitate identification of transfected cells. Fluorescent cells covered with five or more RBCs, termed rosettes, are considered positive for binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Mayer1">[38]</xref>. As expected, nearly all of the cells transfected with wild-type PvDBPII bound to RBCs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003420-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, addition of the single, extra N-glycan site at N374 nearly completely abolished binding of the STBP glycan mutant (4%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003420-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), while both the P1 and Max variants exhibited binding similar to wild type PvDBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g004">Figure 4C and D</xref>). The reduced binding activity of the STBP glycan mutant was not due to defective surface expression, since it was surface expressed as well or better than the wild-type, P1, or Max glycosylation variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003420.s003">Figure S3</xref> for flow cytometry gating strategy). Furthermore, although it was difficult to resolve if there was a difference between STBP glycan and wild-type DBPII in the COS-7 system, P1 and Max migrated slower than wild-type protein prior to N-glycosidase treatment indicating they were hyperglycosylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003420.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Thus, consistent with prior data showing that mutation at I376 strongly reduces DARC binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Hans1">[17]</xref>, we find that introduction of the N374 glycan site (I374N/I376T) nearly abolishes DARC binding, either as a consequence of the mutation or addition of N-glycosylation. In addition, the P1 and Max mutants were functionally folded, despite additional surface glycoengineering.</p>

<p>A meta-analysis of previous PvDBP-DARC binding studies and the new glycan mutants was performed. The majority of previous site-directed mutagenesis was concentrated in subdomains 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003420.s007">Table S1</xref>). Fewer residues had been mutated in subdomain 3 and many of these were buried residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003420.s007">Table S1</xref>). In this study, a total of two, three and seven surface residues were modified in subdomains 1, 2, and 3 with no effect on DARC binding. Overall, critical binding residues (30% or more loss of binding) are concentrated to the predicted binding sites in subdomains 1 and 2 (model 1) or at the dimer interface (model 2), suggesting both areas are critical for DARC binding. Conversely, no surface changes in the highly conserved subdomain 3 have affected DARC binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g001">Figure 1G, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003420.s007">Table S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Immunogenic characterization of PvDBPII and its hyperglycosylated variants</title>
<p>To investigate immunogenicity, mice were immunized with wild-type and DBPII glycosylation variants.

In this approach, mice were immunized by DNA electroporation with plasmid DNA and boosted with the matching DBPII wild-type or DBPII glycosylated variant protein produced in HEK293F cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

<p>Antibody titers were compared using the <italic>E. coli</italic> recombinant protein that lacks N-glycosylation and therefore has no potential antibody epitopes hidden. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of individual mouse ELISA titers showed no significant difference in antibody titer between any of the six immunization groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003420.s008">Table S2</xref>) at the time of the final bleed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). This indicated that there was no loss of immunogenicity of glycoengineered recombinant proteins (groups 4–6), despite having significant surface glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, mice that received four protein immunizations with 5 µg of protein per immunization (groups 1 and 2) had similar final antibody titers to mice that received four DNA immunizations followed by two protein boosts with 2.5 µg of protein per immunization (group 3). Thus, DNA electroporation–protein boost offers a strategy to circumvent issues that arise due to limited availability of recombinant PvDBPII protein. However, DNA electroporation alone was insufficient to elicit strong adhesion blocking antibody responses. The antibody titer increased by more than an order of magnitude after the two protein boosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) and there was almost no inhibitory activity following the fourth DNA immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Conversely, plasma obtained after the two protein boosts exhibited considerable inhibitory activity even at 1∶1800 dilution in a standard COS-7 cell-red blood cell (RBC) binding inhibition assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Michon1">[23]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

<title>Inhibition of PvDBPII binding to DARC on erythrocytes</title>
<p>Plasma from the different immunization groups were evaluated for inhibitory activity using the COS-7 cell–RBC binding assay. The inhibitory assay was carried out for plasma dilutions ranging from 1∶200 to 1∶10800 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g006">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003420.s004">S4</xref>). A 1∶200 dilution of pre-immune plasma showed no inhibition of RBC binding (rosette formation) and was used as control. A statistical comparison of the Least Squared Distance of data points shows that the non-linear model provides a good fit. Thus, the percent inhibition of rosette formation was plotted against log plasma dilution and analyzed by non-linear regression to determine the IC50. The IC50 values of the wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> and HEK293 DBPII proteins were similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003420.s005">Figure S5</xref>). To investigate the effect of glycan masking the IC50 values of wild-type PvDBPII and the three DBPII glycosylation variants in the DNA-protein prime boost regimen were compared. Individual values ranged from 1∶2100 to 1∶2800 and were not statistically different in the non-linear model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003420.s009">Table S3</xref>).

<title>Inhibition of PvDBPII binding to recombinant DARC</title>
<p>To further investigate whether any of the glycosylated immunogens provided a small improvement in inhibitory antibodies, we developed a novel flow cytometry based antibody-inhibition assay that is easier to quantify and more amenable to high-throughput analysis than the COS-7-RBC binding assay. In this assay, wild-type PvDBPII, minus the 3 native N-glycan sites, is expressed by yeast surface display <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Chao1">[39]</xref> and probed with recombinant DARC-Fc. Binding of DARC-Fc is detected using an antibody to the Fc fusion domain. In control experiments, the wild-type YY-DARC-Fc recombinant protein bound to transfected yeast cells, while the YF-DARC-Fc variant lacking the critical sulfotyrosine site at position 41 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Choe1">[15]</xref> did not bind (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003420.s006">Figure S6</xref>). The percent inhibition of wild-type DARC-Fc binding was then plotted against log plasma dilutions from the four immunization groups. In this assay, plasma from the STBP glycan variant had slightly weaker inhibitory activity than the wild-type PvDBP immunogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), while P1 and Max elicited stronger inhibitory activity. The IC50 values for P1 and Max were 7-fold and 20-fold lower than for wild-type immunogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003420.s009">Table S3</xref>). This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.02 for both P1 and Max, one tailed Student's <italic>t</italic> test). Moreover, the percent inhibition by P1 or Max plasma was significantly better than wild-type at multiple plasma dilutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). This analysis suggests that an inhibitory epitope in PvDBPII was eliminated in the STBP glycan immunogen, whereas increased levels of DARC-binding-inhibitory antibodies were elicited by P1 and Max DBPII glycosylation variants.</p>

<title>Effect of the FyA/B DARC allele on binding inhibition</title>
<p>A potential explanation for the discrepancy in antibody inhibition results between COS-7 and yeast display formats is that the yeast assay may be more sensitive to detect differences in antibody inhibitory activity. In the yeast assay, antibodies are challenged to inhibit an interaction of limited valency (the binding of DARC-Fc to yeast-displayed-PvDBPII is mono- or bi-valent) while in the COS-7 assay, antibodies are challenged to inhibit an interaction between two cells (RBCs displaying DARC and COS-7 cells displaying PvDBPII) that is likely to be multi-valent and potentially highly multi-valent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g007">Figure 7</xref>). We initially conducted our assays using an FyB RBC donor (COS-7) or an FyB DARC recombinant protein (yeast) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Choe1">[15]</xref>. However, the FyA allele is more common in <italic>P. vivax</italic> endemic regions, and recent work suggests it has lower PvDBP binding activity and greater susceptibility to antibody blockade than FyB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-King1">[8]</xref>. To investigate if the immune plasma would have greater activity on FyA donors in the COS-7 format, we screened five FyA/FyA donors and one FyB/FyB donor using the COS-7 cell–RBC binding assay. Surprisingly, only two of the five FyA donors exhibited reduced binding activity. This was mostly manifest as smaller RBC rosettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g008">Figure 8</xref> inset). The COS-7 cell–RBC antibody inhibition assay was then repeated with RBCs from the weakest binding FyA donor and an FyB donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Notably, a similar percentage of transfected COS-7 cells bound FyA and FyB RBCs. However, FyA RBCs formed smaller rosettes and were more susceptible to antibody inhibition from each of the four immunization groups than FyB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g008">Figure 8</xref>). P1 plasma had measurably higher inhibitory activity than wild-type plasma at 1∶200 and 1∶600 dilutions against FyA and FyB RBCs, but this trend only achieved significance for one dilution value in the FyB experiments and was not apparent at higher dilutions. No equivalently significant trends were observable for STBP or Max plasma.</p>

In the yeast-PvDBPII display assay, PvDBPII present on the yeast surface interacts with dimeric recombinant DARC-Fc recombinant protein (N-terminal 65 mer region). The two assays offer different platforms to reveal inhibitory effects of antibodies using a potentially higher affinity, multimer-multimer interaction (COS-7 format) or a lower affinity multimer-dimer interaction (yeast display).

Although <italic>P. vivax</italic> is highly restricted to reticulocytes and theoretically poses fewer challenges for blood stage vaccine development than <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, PvDBP is polymorphic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Gosi1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Xainli1">[29]</xref> and vaccine-induced antibodies are only partially effective at inhibiting the PvDBP-DARC binding interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Grimberg1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Siddiqui1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-ArevaloHerrera1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Yazdani1">[44]</xref>. Therefore, new immunogen design strategies and adjuvants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Wiley1">[45]</xref> are required to enhance neutralizing antibody responses and confer cross-strain protection.</p>
<p>Glycan masking is an emerging vaccine design strategy to target antibodies to specific antibody epitopes. A glycan shield is employed by HIV and other enveloped viruses, such as influenza, to hide regions of viral surface proteins from neutralizing antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Alexander1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Wyatt1">[48]</xref>. N-linked glycans are bulky, flexible structures, more than 20 times the size of an amino acid side-chain. Carbohydrates are poorly immunogenic, and the large carbohydrate unit effectively shields the underlying amino acids from antibody recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Back1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-McCaffrey1">[52]</xref>. Although some HIV-broadly-neutralizing antibodies isolated from natural infection utilize glycans as part or all of their epitope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Chao1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Calarese1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Walker1">[56]</xref>, the basis for glycan-targeting in these cases may be due to the extraordinarily high density of glycans on HIV Envelope (which may create “non-self” epitopes from “self” glycan molecules) and/or to the fact that HIV infection causes significant dis-regulation of the immune system or other factors. Indeed, glycan reactive monoclonal antibodies display extensive somatic hypermutation and/or unusually long complementarity determining regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Pancera1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Pejchal2">[58]</xref>, suggesting that their elicitation may require highly persistent infection. In the context of vaccine design, glycan masking has mostly been evaluated on HIV Envelope glycoproteins. Glycan masking has reduced monoclonal antibody recognition of targeted epitopes on HIV Envelope gp120/gp140, but it has not led to broader neutralizing antibody responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Pantophlet1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Selvarajah1">[34]</xref>. However, gp140 contains 30 potential N-glycosylation sites on average, and most of its surface is predicted to be covered by N-glycans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Schief1">[59]</xref>. In contrast, malaria encodes a minimal N-glycosylation machinery and malaria surface proteins may contain limited or no N-glycosylation. <italic>P. falciparum</italic> encodes an identifiable Alg7 glycosyltransferase and SST3 oligosaccharyltransferase, and it is predicted that only a short GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> group would be transferred to proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Samuelson1">[36]</xref>. Thus, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> proteins may be better platforms to evaluate this vaccine design strategy because they are not already highly evolved to evade antibody responses via glycan masking.</p>
<p>Here, glycan masking was used both to probe PvDBP binding function and to test a vaccine strategy to focus antibodies on critical interaction surfaces. Although several different PvDBP-DARC binding mutagenesis studies have been done, there is still controversy surrounding the PvDBPII-DARC binding model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Batchelor1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Singh1">[14]</xref>. The first mutagenesis studies were performed before the PvDBP structure was solved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Hans1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-VanBuskirk1">[18]</xref> and there has been limited structure-guided mutagenesis analysis. The present study shows that elements of both the “just in time” and “receptor-mediated dimerization” models are correct. We found that an N-glycan site added to a predicted sulfotryosine binding pocket in subdomain 2 abolished DARC binding, and that N-glycan sites added distant from this interaction site or the dimer interface had no effect on DARC binding. These findings confirm the importance of the subdomain 2 interaction site for DARC binding, as predicted in the “just in time” model, and extend our understanding of the DARC “binding footprint”. The meta-analysis also suggests that residues critical for DARC binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Batchelor1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Hans1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Bolton1">[19]</xref> are localized to the dimer interface (as predicted by the “receptor-mediated dimerization” model) and at a narrow patch on subdomain 2 and wrapping around to adjacent regions in subdomain 1 (consistent with the “just in time” model). It is possible that the DARC interface encompasses both regions or that the DARC binding site and dimer interface are separate and distinct, but both may contribute to efficient DARC binding. There are still many surface residues in close proximity to the predicted DARC interface in model 1 that need to be evaluated for binding, including the adjacent subdomain 3.</p>
<p>In mouse immunization studies, glycoengineered proteins were equally immunogenic to wild-type proteins by ELISA. This finding is encouraging because it suggests that substantial glycoengineering did not inadvertently blunt T helper cell priming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Drummer1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Jackson1">[61]</xref> or the development of anti-PvDBP antibody responses. However, differentially glycosylated PvDBP variants failed to yield significant differences in antibody inhibitory activity in the COS-7-RBC binding assay. While the response of P1 plasma at 1∶200 and 1∶600 dilutions hints at improved response against the P1 variant, the difference in response was insufficient to allow proper determination of a significant difference in elicited IC50.</p>
<p>In contrast, consistent and significant enhancement of PvDBP∶DARC binding inhibition was observed in the yeast display assay used in this study. Of particular interest is the observed increase in inhibitory potency elicited by the P1 and Max constructs with increased glycosylation distal to predicted inhibitory antibody binding areas, as well as correspondingly decreased inhibition elicited by the STBP construct. The extra N-glycosylation site in the STBP construct covers a linear inhibitory antibody epitope from natural <italic>P. vivax</italic> infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Chootong1">[20]</xref>, adding plausibility to the interpretation that inhibitory antibodies map near this region and can be targeted by vaccination. The yeast display assay provides greater ease and throughput and may be more sensitive to inhibitory antibody responses due to the lower PvDBP-DARC binding valency in the yeast format (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This sensitivity to detect small differences in antibody activity may be important in engineering more potent PvDBP immunogens in the future. Indeed, small 2-fold differences in DARC surface levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Zimmerman1">[4]</xref> or FyA allelic polymorphism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-King1">[8]</xref>, are thought to affect PvDBP binding activity and the ability of anti-PvDBP antibodies to block parasite invasion (model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, this interaction may be particularly vulnerable to antibody blockade.</p>
<p>If the P1 and Max variants successfully enhanced inhibitory binding titers as implied by the yeast display assay, critical questions for further study are whether the increased potency observed in the yeast assay is indeed clinically relevant, and whether the glycosylated constructs developed in this study are amenable to further engineering and concomitant improvement in elicited immune response. One possibility is that in designing the current constructs we may have inadvertently masked inhibitory epitopes that have recently been localized to subdomain 3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Siddiqui1">[24]</xref> and are only partially mapped <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Chootong1">[20]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003420-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, it remains possible that the more pronounced activity of Max plasma in the yeast assay compared to the COS-7 platform may be a consequence of the fact that the PvDBP constructs in the COS-7 and yeast display assays were smaller than the PvDBP vaccine immunogen and slightly different from each other to facilitate protein expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003420.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In particular, the N-terminus of the yeast display construct was 8 amino acids shorter than the COS-7 construct and 18 amino acids longer at the C-terminus. Thus, potentially inhibitory antibodies directed against the C-termini of PvDBP would be less likely to be detected in the COS-7 assay than the yeast assay. As more inhibitory epitopes are mapped in PvDBP, it may be possible to improve glycoengineered PvDBPII immunogens by repositioning N-glycosylation sites to shield off-target epitopes and focus antibodies on more strain-conserved inhibitory epitopes. Whereas this study used a DNA and protein prime-boost approach, glycoengineering could also be applied with viral vectored vaccines, or with protein-only immunization if a strategy for improved PvDBP expression could be developed.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this analysis shows that PvDBPII recombinant proteins retain immunogenicity despite considerable glycoengineering and that glycan resurfacing offers an integrated approach to characterize protein function and immunogenicity. Glycan resurfacing of PvDBPII immunogens may have utility in <italic>P. vivax</italic>-malaria vaccine development.</p>

After 10 mins incubation, the cells were washed with PBSF again and binding of the DARC-Fc protein was detected with a 1∶250 dilution of phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-human polyclonal antibody preadsorbed against mouse and rabbit antibodies. DARC-Fc and DARC-Fc Y43F inactive mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003420-Hans1">[17]</xref> were used as positive and negative controls respectively in wells without immune plasma incubations. Antibody-labeled cells were washed and resuspended in PBS and analyzed by LSRII (Becton Dickinson). The data was analyzed by FlowJO 8.1 software (Tree Star Inc.). To calculate plasma inhibition, the population of PvDBPII expressing yeast was first determined by comparing uninduced to induced yeast after incubation with DARC-Fc and secondary antibody.
