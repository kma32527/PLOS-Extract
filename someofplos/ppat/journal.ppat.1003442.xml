<abstract>
<p>Suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) negatively regulates STAT3 activation in response to several cytokines such as those in the gp130-containing IL-6 receptor family. Thus, SOCS3 may play a major role in immune responses to pathogens. In the present study, the role of SOCS3 in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection was examined. All <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre, Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> (with SOCS3-deficient myeloid and lymphoid cells, respectively) and <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup> mice</italic>, with a mutation in gp130 that impedes binding to SOCS3, showed increased susceptibility to infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. SOCS3 binding to gp130 in myeloid cells conveyed resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection via the regulation of IL-6/STAT3 signalling. SOCS3 was redundant for mycobacterial control by macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic>. Instead, SOCS3 expression in infected macrophages and DCs prevented the IL-6-mediated inhibition of TNF and IL-12 secretion and contributed to a timely CD4+ cell-dependent IFN-γ expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. In T cells, SOCS3 expression was essential for a gp130-independent control of infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, but was neither required for the control of infection with attenuated <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG nor for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in BCG-vaccinated mice. <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> mice showed an increased frequency of γδ+ T cells in different organs and an enhanced secretion of IL-17 by γδ+ T cells in response to infection. <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> γδ+ T cells impaired the control of infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Thus, SOCS3 expression in either lymphoid or myeloid cells is essential for resistance against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> via discrete mechanisms.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Tuberculosis is a severe disease caused by infection with the intracellular bacteria <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. The protein “suppressor of cytokine signalling 3” (SOCS3) inhibits the responses of cells to several cytokines and growth factors that signal via the STAT3 transcription factor. Since STAT3 is a major controller of immune and inflammatory responses, we studied the role of SOCS3 in the control of infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Mice deficient in the expression of SOCS3 either in myeloid or lymphoid cells were extremely susceptible to infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> as measured by elevated bacterial levels, worsened pathology and reduced survival. In myeloid cells, SOCS3 hindered a detrimental role of IL-6. In absence of SOCS3, IL-6 hampered the release of IL-12 by antigen-presenting cells. In T cells, SOCS3-mediated protection was independent of IL-6 signals, and of adequate IFN-γ secretion by antigen-specific T cells. Instead, SOCS3 inhibited the <italic>in vivo</italic> accumulation of, and the IL-17 secretion by γδ+ T cells. γδ+ T cells accounted in part for the susceptibility to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection of mice with SOCS3-deficient T cells. Thus, SOCS3 controls diverse immune mechanisms of myeloid and lymphoid cells that are required for containment of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, remains a leading public health problem worldwide. The global incidence of TB is rising with 8.8 million new cases and 2 million deaths each year <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-WHO1">[1]</xref>. However, while immune responses to TB clearly show their importance in host defence, it is clear that there are still gaps in our knowledge of the host factors determining the outcome of infection.</p>
<p>Host responses of mycobacterial infections are primarily Th1 immune responses involving cellular effector mechanisms such as macrophage activation. IFN-γ is known to be an important mediator of mycobacterial control during clinical and experimental infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Nathan1">[2]</xref>. IL-12 is crucial for optimal differentiation and maintenance of IFN-γ-secreting antigen-specific Th1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Feng1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Khader1">[4]</xref>, and in controlling mycobacterial infections in mice and man <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Cooper1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-FilipeSantos1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>The “suppressor of cytokine signalling” (SOCS) proteins are a family of eight members that inhibit STAT activation by different receptors. SOCS proteins bind either the Janus-activated kinases (JAKs) directly inhibiting their kinase activity, or the intracellular domain of cytokine receptors thereby targeting the receptor complex for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Yoshimura1">[7]</xref>. SOCS3 inhibits STAT3-mediated signalling by binding to the IL-6 receptor family subunit gp130, G-CSF, leptin and the IL-12 receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Carow1">[8]</xref>. Since SOCS3-deficient mice die during embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Marine1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Roberts1">[10]</xref>, the role of SOCS3 <italic>in vivo</italic> has been studied using conditional knockdown mice. Conditional knockdown of SOCS3 in macrophages protects mice from LPS shock by reducing the secretion of IL-12 and TNF due to the enhanced anti-inflammatory effect of STAT3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Yasukawa1">[11]</xref>. However, mice with SOCS3-deficient macrophages and neutrophils succumb to toxoplasmosis, probably due to reduced IL-12 and IFN-γ responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Whitmarsh1">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, SOCS3 can also inhibit STAT1 activation thereby preventing IFN-γ-like responses in cells stimulated with IL-6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Lang1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Croker1">[14]</xref>. SOCS3 also may have several roles in T cell function. SOCS3 expression in T cells can both obstruct the differentiation of inflammatory IL-17-producing Th17 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Qin1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Chen1">[16]</xref> and inhibit the secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and TGF-β by T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Kinjyo1">[17]</xref> and mice with SOCS3-deficient T cells are more susceptible to infection with <italic>Leishmania major</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Kinjyo1">[17]</xref>. On the other hand, SOCS3 has also been shown to impair T-cell memory development, T cell-mediated IFN-γ secretion and LCMV virus clearance in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Pellegrini1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the present study, the role of SOCS3 in the outcome of infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> was investigated. We report that the expression of SOCS3, in either myeloid or T cells, is independently required for the control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection in mice. SOCS3 expression in myeloid cells allows a proper IL-12 secretion by hampering an IL-6-mediated inhibition of IL-12 expression. SOCS3 expression in T cells reduces the frequency of γδ+ T cells in different organs and the secretion of IL-17 by + T cells in response to infection in a gp130-independent manner.</p>

<p>Mouse BMM were infected with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> at a MOI of 5∶1 (A–C). BMM were treated with the indicated concentrations of BAY-117082 1 h before infection (B).

<p>Whether a defect of macrophages to control intracellular mycobacterial growth could account for the enhanced susceptibility of <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> mice to mycobacteria was then studied. <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> BMM, pulmonary and peritoneal macrophages showed diminished intracellular levels of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003442-g002">Figure 2E–G</xref> and data not shown). The IFN-γ-mediated control of mycobacteria by macrophages is essential for the intracellular control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Incubation of BMM with IFN-γ decreased the number of intracellular <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.

Thus, the increased iNOS response of SOCS3-deficient macrophages was dependent on signalling via gp130.

<p>Since IL-12 secretion by dendritic cells (DCs) is required for Th1 differentiation, we investigated whether DCs from <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> mice also showed an impaired secretion of IL-12. <italic>Socs3</italic> mRNA levels were reduced in <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) indicating the expression of the LysM cre recombinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003442-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). The <italic>Il-12 p40</italic> mRNA and IL-12 protein expression by <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> BMDC after infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> was reduced as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003442-g004">Figure 4F, G</xref>). As shown for BMM, incubation with exogenous IL-6 further diminished IL-12 secretion by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> BMDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003442-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). In order to exclude that the diminished IL-12 secretion in BMDC cultures was due to the response of contaminant macrophages in the culture, the expression of <italic>Il-12 p40</italic> mRNA was tested in CD11c+ sorted cells. Both, CD11c+ and CD11c- cells showed diminished <italic>IL-12 p40</italic> mRNA accumulation after infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003442-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> splenic DCs displayed a diminished secretion of IL-12 after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003442-g004">Figure 4I</xref>). Thus, SOCS3 expression promotes IL-12 secretion in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-stimulated DCs.</p>
<p>Since IL-12 is required for IFN-γ secretion by NK cells, we tested the effect of SOCS3 expression by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected DCs in the regulation of IFN-γ secretion by NK cells. Co-incubation with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected splenic CD11c+ DCs induced IFN-γ secretion by NK cells.

<p>Lower <italic>Il-12 p40</italic> mRNA levels were also found in lungs of <italic>M. tuberculosis-</italic>infected <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> mice compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003442-g004">Figure 4J</xref>) and similarly, lower <italic>Ifn-γ</italic> mRNA accumulation in lungs from <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> mice was detected 2.5 weeks after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003442-g004">Figure 4K</xref>). In order to examine whether an effect of SOCS3-deficient myeloid cells on the cytokine production by CD4+ T cells accounted for the elevated numbers of bacteria in <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> mice, we depleted CD4+ cells during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection by administration of anti-CD4 neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003442.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). CD4+ cell depletion decreased the <italic>Ifn-γ</italic> mRNA accumulation in lungs from <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice.

In contrast to the decreased <italic>Ifn-γ</italic> mRNA expression, the frequency of CD44+ and CD62L+ CD4+ activated T cells in the lungs of <italic>M. tuberculosis-</italic>infected <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> and <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice was similar, and higher than in uninfected animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003442.s004">Figure S4B</xref>, C).

<p>Regulatory FoxP3+ T-cells have been shown to expand in mice with SOCS3-deficient DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Matsumura1">[26]</xref>.

<p>The outcome of infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> of <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice reconstituted with control or <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> T cells was then compared. Lungs and spleens from <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice transferred with Socs3<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> total T cells (CD90+) showed lower bacterial levels than non-transferred mice while <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> T cells failed to transfer protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003442-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). Moreover, the transfer of a 1∶1 mixture of <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> and control T cells conferred no protection to <italic>Rag1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003442-g006">Figure 6F</xref>), suggesting that SOCS3-deficient T cells can hamper <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> control by wild type T cells. <italic>Rag1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice transferred with CD4+ Socs3<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> cells unlike those transferred with total T cells from the same mice, showed reduced <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> levels compared to non-transferred controls indicating that in <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> mice CD3+CD4− T cells hamper the protective ability of CD4+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003442-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether γδ+ T cells could account for the suppressive activity of CD3+CD4− cells. Indeed, <italic>Rag1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice transferred with γδ+ cell-depleted CD90+ <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> T cells showed lower bacterial levels than those transferred with total <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003442-g006">Figure 6 H</xref>).</p>
<p>Since SOCS3 expression in T cells has been shown to impair IL-17 production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Chen2">[27]</xref>, we speculated that a differential release of IL-17 could be related with the susceptibility of <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> mice to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Lungs from <italic>M. tuberculosis-</italic>infected Socs3<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> mice showed higher levels of <italic>Il-17</italic> mRNA than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003442-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). The levels of IL-17 in supernatants from lung cells of <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> mice stimulated or not with mycobacterial Purified protein derivate (PPD) were higher than controls 2.5 weeks after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, when no differences in bacterial load in lungs were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003442-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Thus, the impaired control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infection in <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> mice was associated with increased IL-17 levels. γδ+ T cells have been shown to dominate IL-17 secretion during infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Lockhart1">[28]</xref>. In line with this observation, the incubation of naïve spleen T cells with mycobacteria-infected BMDCs or their supernatants resulted in the secretion of IL-17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003442-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Furthermore, IL-17 was secreted by γδ+ and total (CD90+) but not by CD4+ T cells after incubation supernatants from mycobacteria-infected BMDCs. The levels of IL-17 secreted by γδ+ T cells were higher than those by similar numbers of total T cells. The IL-17 content in supernatants from γδ+ and total <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> T cells was higher compared to <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003442-g007">Figure 7D</xref>).</p>

<p>Surprisingly, lungs and spleens from <italic>M. tuberculosis-</italic>infected <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice transferred prior to infection with either <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup></italic> or WT T cells contained similar bacterial levels, indicating that T cells play, if any, a redundant role in the gp130-mediated control of <italic>M. tuberculosis.</italic> Bacterial levels in mice transferred with WT or <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup></italic> cells were lower than those of non-transferred controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003442-g009">Figure 9E</xref>).

Thus, the susceptibility of <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> mice to infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is mediated by receptors other than gp130.</p>
<p>Since T cells did not account for the increased susceptibility of <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice and <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice were significantly more susceptible to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> than <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> mice, we studied the relative contributions of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell lineages to the susceptibility of <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice to infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Reciprocal bone marrow (BM) radiation chimeras between WT and <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice were generated by inoculation of BM cells into irradiated recipients.

<p>Thus, these data suggest that non-lymphoid, hematopoietic cells only partially account for the susceptibility of <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and suggest a relevant role for non-hematopoietic cells in the high sensitivity of these mice to infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we demonstrated that SOCS3 expression in lymphoid and myeloid cell populations is essential for the resistance against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in mice via distinct mechanisms. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and BCG infections were potent stimuli for <italic>Socs3</italic> expression <italic>in vivo</italic> and in myeloid cell populations <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>In line with previous studies, we found that SOCS3 expression in macrophages was mediated by MyD88 and NF-κB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Narayana1">[29]</xref>. By using <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> mice, our data suggest that myeloid SOCS3 expression contributes to a timely CD4+ cell-dependent IFN-γ-secretion rather than to improved innate effector immune mechanisms by macrophages. The observation that CD4+ cell-depleted <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> and control mice had similar bacterial loads supports this hypothesis. Moreover, SOCS3-deficient and control BMM as well as pulmonary macrophages showed comparable intracellular mycobacterial growth, and IFN-γ diminished bacterial numbers with equal efficiency in <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> and WT macrophages, as also recently demonstrated for <italic>T. gondii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Whitmarsh1">[12]</xref>. However, whether a defective IFN-γ secretion either by antigen-specific CD4+ T cells, or alternatively by NKT or CD8+ T cells underlies the susceptibility of <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> mice to infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> remains to be determined.</p>
<p>SOCS3-deficient BMM showed increased STAT3 activation and diminished secretion of TNF and IL-12 after infection with either <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> or BCG. This confirms previous data showing reduced TNF and IL-12 release by <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> and <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup></italic> macrophages in response to LPS, when co-incubated with IL-6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Yasukawa1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-ElKasmi1">[30]</xref>. Moreover, constitutively active STAT3 has been found to inhibit <italic>Il-12 p40</italic> mRNA accumulation in LPS-stimulated BMDC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Hoentjen1">[31]</xref>. Even though the LysM promoter is primarily active in neutrophils and macrophages, LysM promoter activity in DCs has previously been shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Matsumura1">[26]</xref>. <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> BMDC showed limited IL-12 production in response to mycobacterial stimulation and <italic>Il-12 p40</italic> levels were also reduced in the lungs of infected <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> and <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice. Importantly, we found that IFN-γ levels were diminished in lungs of <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> at 16 days but not at later time points after infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. This delay in the establishment of immune protective responses might underlie the increased susceptibility of <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> mice. In support of this notion, the resistance of different mouse strains to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is associated with the timing of IFN-γ responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Maurya1">[32]</xref>. Although we observed a reduced secretion of IFN-γ by NK-cells during <italic>in vitro</italic> co-culture with <italic>M. tuberculosis-</italic>infected <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> and control splenic DCs, the NK cell involvement in the enhanced susceptibility of <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> mice is unlikely since NK cells were not required for controlling mycobacterial infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Feng2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-JunqueiraKipnis1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>TNF is of major importance in the control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Flynn1">[35]</xref>. Although TNF secretion by infected SOCS3-deficient macrophages is reduced, TNF expression in the lungs of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> mice was not diminished, suggesting that a role for TNF in the susceptibility to infection of <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> mice is unlikely.</p>
<p>The reduction of TNF and IL-12 levels observed in <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup></italic> BMM was reversed when using <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup> Il-6</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells, and addition of rIL-6 further diminished the release of IL-12 and TNF by either mycobacteria-infected, or Pam3CSK4-stimulated <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> BMM, suggesting that in macrophages, SOCS3 allows proper TNF and IL-12 secretion by hampering an IL-6-mediated inhibition of the secretion of these cytokines.</p>
<p>Lungs from <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM</italic> cre and <italic>lck cre</italic> mice contained higher <italic>Il-6</italic> mRNA levels than controls. However, neither macrophages nor T cells are likely to account for the elevated IL-6 levels in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-infected SOCS3-deficient mice. Epithelial cells, fibroblasts and adipocytes have all been shown to secrete IL-6 in response to inflammatory stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Kim1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Ogura1">[37]</xref>. Whether non-hematopoietic cells are major IL-6 producers during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection remains to be investigated.</p>
<p><italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> mice showed a dramatically enhanced susceptibility to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. However, SOCS3 expression in T cells was not required for the development of protective immune responses against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in BCG-vaccinated mice. Thus, the requirement of SOCS3 in the control of mycobacterial infection depends on the mycobacterial species and on the immune status of the host.</p>
<p>Our results show a hitherto unknown role for SOCS3 controlling the frequency of γδ+ T cells in different organs before and during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection while frequencies of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were not regulated by SOCS3. Moreover, γδ+ T cells impaired the transfer of protection by <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> CD4+T cells, suggesting that SOCS3 inhibits a non-redundant detrimental role of γδ+ T cells in the outcome of infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. The detrimental activity of SOCS3-deficient γδ+ T cells contrasts with previous reports that have shown a minor role of WT γδ+ T cells in resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-DSouza1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Mogues1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>SOCS3 can impair the secretion of IL-17 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Chen1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Hill1">[40]</xref>. The increased IL-17 mRNA and protein levels in <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> mice in <italic>M. tuberculosis-</italic>, but not in BCG-infected mice suggested that IL-17 levels might be causally associated to the increased susceptibility to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. When γδ+ T cells but not CD4+ Socs3<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> T cells were adoptively transferred in <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, an increased IL-17 secretion by lung cells and impaired transfer of protection against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> was observed. The function of IL-17 during primary mycobacterial infections is controversial since only after high dose intratracheal infection mice deficient in IL-17 were reported to be unable to control <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Aujla1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-OkamotoYoshida1">[43]</xref>. On the other hand, IL-17 has been implicated to increase bacterial dissemination, recruitment of neutrophils and morbidity during infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Desvignes1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Redford1">[46]</xref>. <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> mice showed elevated levels of neutrophil-derived molecules and necrotic granulomas during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. Our results confirmed a previous report indicating that γδ+T cells dominate IL-17 production during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Lockhart1">[28]</xref>. SOCS3 also hampered the secretion of IL-17 by γδ+ T cells when incubated with infected DCs or their supernatants. However, SOCS3 did not impair the development of γδ+ T cells that are capable of secreting IL-17. Thus, the increased IL-17 levels in Socs3<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> mice are probably the consequence of both the increased numbers of γδ+ T cells and their unrestricted secretion of IL-17 in response to cytokines released by mycobacteria-stimulated DCs.</p>
<p>The increased susceptibility to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> of Socs3<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> mice was not associated to an impaired IFN-γ secretion by antigen-specific T cells, suggesting that SOCS3 is not required for IFN-γ secretion by T cells and that γδ+ T cells do not modulate IFN-γ secretion by αβ+ T cells.</p>
<p>Since SOCS3 regulates signalling via various receptors, we investigated whether signals mediated via the gp130 receptor account for the susceptibility to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> of SOCS3 conditional knockdown animals. We found that <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice are highly susceptible to infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. The susceptibility of <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup></italic> is mediated by both IL-6-dependent as well as IL-6-independent signalling events, since <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup>Il-6</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice showed lower bacterial load than <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice but higher bacterial levels than controls. The cytokine responses of <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup></italic> and <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> macrophages to mycobacterial infections were similar suggesting that the protective role of SOCS3 in myeloid cells is dependent on gp130.</p>
<p>IL-1β and IL-23 have been shown to stimulate IL-17 production by γδ+ T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Sutton1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Flynn2">[48]</xref>, but SOCS3 impairs IL-23 signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Chen2">[27]</xref>. Thus, IL-1 β and IL-23 might mediate the elevated IL-17 secretion in <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> T cells. Moreover, IL-23 signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Parham1">[49]</xref> as well as the increased frequency of γδ+ T cells in Socs3<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> lck cre</italic> mice are both independent of gp130 signalling (data not shown). Accordingly, T cells from highly susceptible <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice transferred resistance to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> as previously shown for <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003442-Silver1">[50]</xref>. Since <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup></italic> were more susceptible to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> than <italic>Socs3<sup>fl/fl</sup> LysM cre</italic> mice, and lethally irradiated WT that were reconstituted with <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup></italic> BM were more resistant to infection than <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup></italic> or WT BM→ <italic>gp130<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice, we also suggest that gp130-dependent SOCS3-signalling in non-hematopoietic cells contributes to the control of infection with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p>
<p>Collectively, our data indicate that the expression of SOCS3 either in myeloid or in T cells is essential for control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003442-g010">Figure 10</xref>). SOCS3 mediates protection through inhibition of IL-6/gp-130 signalling in myeloid cells, while gp130-independent, SOCS3-mediated mechanisms in T cells contribute to the control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p>
