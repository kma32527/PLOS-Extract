<abstract>
<p>In higher eukaryotes, induced resistance associates with acquisition of a priming state of the cells for a more effective activation of innate immunity; however, the nature of the components for mounting this type of immunological memory is not well known. We identified an extracellular subtilase from Arabidopsis, <italic>SBT3.3</italic>, the overexpression of which enhances innate immune responses while the loss of function compromises them. <italic>SBT3.3</italic> expression initiates a durable autoinduction mechanism that promotes chromatin remodeling and activates a salicylic acid(SA)-dependent mechanism of priming of defense genes for amplified response. Moreover, <italic>SBT3.3</italic> expression-sensitized plants for enhanced expression of the <italic>OXI1</italic> kinase gene and activation of MAP kinases following pathogen attack, providing additional clues for the regulation of immune priming by SBT3.3. Conversely, in <italic>sbt3.3</italic> mutant plants pathogen-mediated induction of SA-related defense gene expression is drastically reduced and activation of MAP kinases inhibited. Moreover, chromatin remodeling of defense-related genes normally associated with activation of an immune priming response appear inhibited in <italic>sbt3.3</italic> plants, further indicating the importance of the extracellular SBT3.3 subtilase in the establishment of immune priming. Our results also point to an epigenetic control in the regulation of plant immunity, since <italic>SBT3.3</italic> is up-regulated and priming activated when epigenetic control is impeded. SBT3.3 represents a new regulator of primed immunity.</p>

<p>Following a first encounter with a pathogen, higher eukaryotes develop enhanced resistance to subsequent infections by a broad spectrum of pathogens. This type of induced resistance (IR) exhibits memory characteristics after the first encounter with a pathogen —training effect— and appears evolutionarily conserved.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plants are continuously faced with threats from pathogenic microorganisms. They counteract microbial infections via activation of an innate immune system in a timely, accurate, and effective manner following pathogen recognition. The innate immune response is thought to act naïvely to individual pathogen encounters and is dependent on the recognition of broadly conserved molecular features, known as microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), by plasma membrane proteins known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRR perception of MAMPs at the cell surface leads to a pattern-triggered immune response called PTI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Jones1">[1]</xref>. PTI is characterized by the rapid generation of ion fluxes, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), phosphorylation cascades, and a transcriptional reprograming that favors defense responses over routine cellular requirements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Moore1">[2]</xref>. The defense programme is ultimately controlled through the build-up of specific signalling hormone blends, of which salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) are particularly important, and eventually establish a broad systemic alert state throughout the plant.</p>
<p>Plants develop heightened activation of the innate immune response state resulting from the initial infection manifested in the form of enhanced resistance to subsequent infections by a broad spectrum of pathogens. This type of induced resistance (IR) or cross-protection exhibits memory characteristics after the first encounter with a pathogen - training effect - and appears evolutionarily conserved, even outside the plant kingdom. Netea <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Netea1">[3]</xref> coined the term “trained immunity” to differentiate it from “innate immunity” (as it is induced only secondarily in hosts that have previously encountered a primary infection), or from “adaptive immunity” (as this implies specificity through T and B cells). In plants, two distinct types of this resistance form have been described: systemic acquired resistance (SAR), and induced systemic resistance (ISR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Durrant1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-VanWees1">[5]</xref>; both represent a functional immune acclimation requiring the defense response regulator NPR1.</p>
<p>Particularly relevant in IR responses is the observation that defence genes, in both the local (infected) and distal tissue, respond to much lower levels of a pathogenic stimulus in a more rapid and robust manner than controls, thus revealing a “priming” phenomenon. In fact, priming has long been known as a component of IR responses in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Ku1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Zimmerli1">[7]</xref> and mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Hayes1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Koerner1">[10]</xref>, and more recently in invertebrates, which like plants lack adaptive immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Pham1">[11]</xref>. Similarly, Arabidopsis mutants attenuated in pathogen defense (i.e. <italic>npr1</italic>) are also compromised in priming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Beckers1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Kohler1">[13]</xref>. Organic and inorganic compounds can also induce this form of resistance in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Dempsey1">[14]</xref>. Among these, azelaic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Jung1">[15]</xref>, SA, and its functional analogue benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Ryals1">[16]</xref>, or the non-protein amino acid β-aminobutyric acid (BABA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Zimmerli2">[17]</xref> have attracted marked interest as they potentiate pathogen-specific defense mechanisms, and induction of a primed state. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanism(s) and signals that set a priming state in motion, or the identity of molecular components that pertain to the maintenance of a long lasting immune primed state, such as SAR.</p>
<p>Conrath <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-PrimeAPlant1">[18]</xref> hypothesized that IR or cell priming could be built on the accumulation of dormant or inactive signalling proteins, integral in signal amplification that becomes operative following a challenge with another pathogen, thereby initiating signal amplification leading to a faster and stronger activation of defense responses. However, the identity of such signalling components remains elusive. Interestingly, Beckers <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Beckers1">[12]</xref> have shown that during development of BTH induced resistance in Arabidopsis, priming is associated with accumulation of inactive proteins of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs), MPK3 and MPK6. Exposure to the challenges of biotic and abiotic stressors results in stronger activation of the two kinases in primed plants relative to non-primed plants, which is linked to enhanced defense gene expression. Priming of defense gene expression was reduced in <italic>mpk3</italic> or <italic>mpk6</italic> mutants, showing that pre-stress deposition of a MPK cascade is a critical step in priming plants for a full defense response induction during IR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Beckers1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Essential IR response components must rely in a plant's capacity to reprogram gene expression. Among the mechanisms involved in immune-related transcriptional reprogramming, the importance of chromatin remodeling and covalent histone modifications is emerging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Spoel1">[19]</xref>. Jaskiewicz <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Jaskiewicz1">[20]</xref>, reported that during primed BTH immunity, increased acetylation of histone H3 at Lys-9 (H3K9ac) and trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys-4 (H3K4me3) was detected at promoter regions of several SA-responsive genes encoding transcription factors (i.e. WRKY6, WRKY29, and WRKY52). Similarly, constitutively increased H3K4me3 and H3K9ac mark setting in chromatin of the SA-dependent <italic>PR1</italic> gene was initially reported in <italic>sni1</italic> (<italic>suppressor of nrp1-1, inducible 1</italic>) mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Mosher1">[21]</xref>. The settling of these histone modifications lead chromatin into a suitable state for efficient SA-responsive gene induction when needed. The results also indicated a causal link between priming and chromatin remodeling, pointing to a histone memory for information storage in the plant stress responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Spoel1">[19]</xref>. On the other hand RNA Polymerase V is an enzyme critical in the epigenetic RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway and is involved in regulating both DNA methylation and histone modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Law1">[22]</xref>. In this context, López <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Lpez1">[23]</xref> reported that RNA Polymerase V defective mutants carry a constitutive priming phenotype where SA-related defense genes are poised for enhanced activation via similar H3K4me3 and H3K9ac histone modifications in their promoters. These results emphasized the importance of epigenetic control as an additional layer of complexity in plant immunity and IR regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Lpez1">[23]</xref>. Furthermore, DNA methylation has been implicated in the transmission of a priming state or stress memory, endowing progeny of pathogen-inoculated plants with heightened resistance (transgenerational IR), suggesting plants can inherit priming sensitization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Luna1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Slaughter1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the present study, we report on identification and characterization of the inducible Arabidopsis subtilase SBT3.3 to characterize additional cellular components mediating initiation and or/maintenance of primed immunity. This extracellular proteolytic enzyme serves a signaling role in establishing immune priming. The mechanism subsequently activates chromatin remodeling and defense genes become poised for enhanced activation following pathogen attack. Our study provides strong evidence that SBT3.3 is a primary switch in immune priming, and it may represent one of the missing components in systemic IR establishment.</p>

<title>The Arabidopsis subtilase gene <italic>SBT3.3</italic> is up-regulated in the <italic>csb3</italic> mutant</title>
<p>The Arabidopsis enhanced disease resistance <italic>csb3</italic> (<italic><underline>c</underline>onstitutive <underline>s</underline>u<underline>b</underline>tilisin3</italic>) mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Gil1">[26]</xref> was isolated during a search for negative disease resistance regulators in a mutant screening that evaluated constitutive expression of GUS activity driven by the 5′ promoter region of a pathogen-induced subtilase gene (<italic>P69C</italic>) from tomato plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Jorda1">[27]</xref>. Arabidopsis possess fifty-six highly similar genes encoding subtilases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Rautengarten1">[28]</xref>, therefore constitutive expression of the Arabidopsis gene homologous to <italic>P69C</italic> would be similarly up-regulated in the <italic>csb3</italic> mutant. Constitutively expressed genes differentially expressed in the <italic>csb3</italic> mutant with respect to wild-type plants were identified by microarray analysis of RNA transcripts using ATH1 Affymetrix chips. The microarray analysis (NCBI GEO Series number GSE35507) identified one hundred down-regulated genes and 367 up-regulated genes in the <italic>csb3</italic> mutant (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003445.s010">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003445.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Among the genes up-regulated ≥2-fold (p values&lt;0.05) in the <italic>csb3</italic> mutant, we identified 23 genes that could be linked to disease resistance and SA-mediated responses based on published results (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003445.s011">Table S2</xref>). It was notable that among them one encoded a subtilase: <italic>SBT3.3</italic> (At1g32960). Moreover, public microarray data mining showed that <italic>SBT3.3</italic>, out of the 56 paralogous subtilases from Arabidopsis, with the exception of At1g32940, is the one showing strongest response to pathogen attack and to pathogen-related stress signals (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003445.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>Coincident with what has been described in the tomato genome, where the <italic>P69C</italic> subtilase clusters with three additional P69C-like ORFs (i.e. <italic>P69A</italic>, <italic>P69D</italic>, <italic>P69C</italic>, and <italic>P69B</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Jorda2">[29]</xref>, the <italic>SBT3.3</italic> subtilase gene was similarly embedded in a genomic cluster encompassing three additional subtilases (i.e. <italic>SBT3.5</italic>, <italic>SBT3.4</italic>, <italic>SBT3.3</italic> and <italic>SBT3.2</italic>) in Chromosome 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Thus, it seems very likely that the Arabidopsis SBT3.3 subtilase, could represent the evolutionarily conserved ortholog of the P69C subtilase from tomato, and the promoter activation was the clue for identifying the <italic>csb3</italic> mutant.</p>

<title>Expression pattern of <italic>SBT3.3</italic> following pathogen inoculation</title>
<p>To mode of <italic>SBT3.3</italic> gene regulation in plant immunity was assessed by inoculating Col-0 leaves with the bacterial pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> DC3000 (<italic>Ps</italic>DC3000), carrying or not the avirulence gene <italic>AvrRpm1</italic>, and temporal gene expression patterns were determined by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). <italic>SBT3.3</italic> was barely detectable in mock-inoculated plants, but strongly induced during the <italic>Ps</italic>DC3000 immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). However, inconsistent with observations for SA-regulated marker genes (<italic>i.e. PR-1</italic> and <italic>PR-2</italic>), <italic>SBT3.3</italic> induction was transient, peaking at 48 hpi (hours post inoculation) and abruptly decaying thereafter. The strongest induction was observed following inoculation with the avirulent strain <italic>Ps</italic>DC3000 (<italic>AvrRpm1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g001">Figure 1C</xref>); induction was again transient, peaking at 12 h.p.i, and decayed thereafter. <italic>SBT3.3</italic> expression preceded <italic>PR-1</italic> and <italic>PR-2</italic> gene induction, suggesting that the signals that set in motion transcriptional reprogramming of these two types of gene responses might differ. Expression of <italic>PR-1</italic> and <italic>PR-2</italic> genes in the distal non-inoculated leaves was also observed for <italic>SBT3.3</italic>, although distal expression was not as high as that attained in local leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>).

<title>SBT3.3 functions in disease resistance</title>
<p>The importance of SBT3.3 in plant immunity was investigated by characterizing the response of two independent T-DNA insertion lines for <italic>SBT3.3</italic> (<italic>sbt3.3-1</italic> and <italic>sbt3.3-2</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) to <italic>Ps</italic>DC3000 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). We also characterized the response of two independent T-DNA lines available for one of the linked subtilase genes (i.e. <italic>SBT3.4</italic>) within the same genomic cluster (<italic>sbt3.4-1</italic> and <italic>sbt3.4-2</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

Disease performance was assayed by measuring bacterial growth in the inoculated leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). The two control mutant lines, <italic>sbt3.4-1</italic> and <italic>sbt3.4-2</italic> behaved as inoculated Col-0 plants, indicating that SBT3.4 is not essential to activate immune responses.

The enhanced disease susceptibility was accompanied by development of disease symptoms in the form of visible chlorotic lesions on inoculated leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>).

<title>SBT3.3 is required for expression of SA-responsive genes</title>
<p>Compromised expression of SA-responsive genes is observed in mutants defective in resistance to biotrophic pathogens (i.e. <italic>npr1</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Dong1">[31]</xref>). Consequently, we considered the possibility that the increased susceptibility towards pathogens observed in SBT3.3 defective mutants might be similarly accompanied by a compromised expression of SA-responsive genes. Therefore, induction of PR-1 accumulation was examined by Western blot in <italic>sbt3.3</italic>, <italic>npr1</italic>, and Col-0 plants following inoculation with <italic>Ps</italic>DC3000. The PR-1 protein, as expected, was nearly absent in <italic>npr1</italic> plants, even at 48 hpi with <italic>Ps</italic>DC3000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), while PR-1 accumulation was notable in Col-0 following inoculation. Interestingly, <italic>sbt3.3-1</italic> and <italic>sbt3.3-2</italic> plants exhibited results similar to the <italic>npr1</italic> mutant, showing a notable impediment to induced PR-1 protein accumulation post pathogen inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). These results were confirmed at the transcriptional level by measuring <italic>PR-1</italic> transcript level by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). As for NPR1 being required for full immunity, our results suggest that SBT3.3 is required for full expression of downstream SA-responsive genes. This helps explaining why mutants defective in SBT3.3 are compromised in disease resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g002">Figure 2A and B</xref>).</p>

The mCherry-tagged subtilase was co-expressed with either a construct bearing the plasma membrane integral protein PIP1 fused to YFP, or alternatively with a free cytosolic YFP protein to more precisely define its localization. SBT3.3-mCherry was localized externally to the cytoplasm, as revealed when co-expressed with a free cytosolic YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Furthermore, SBT3.3-mCherry was found to be sandwiched between the PIP1-YFP-tagged plasma membrane marker of adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>) and thus unambiguously localized to the extracellular matrix. SBT3.3 extracellular localization was also confirmed upon expression of a SBT3.3-GFP protein fusion in the presence of FM4-64, a plasma membrane specific fluorescent dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).

<p>Chichkova <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Chichkova1">[36]</xref> demonstrated that following agro-infiltration with a GFP-tagged phytaspase, an Arabidopsis cell death-associated subtilase of similar size to SBT3.3; two proteins of ∼110 and ∼120 kD corresponding to the mature and the pro-protein phytaspases, respectively, accumulated in crude extracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Schaller1">[34]</xref>. Following expression of SBT3.3-GFP, two similar protein bands of ∼110 and ∼120 kD were detected in Western blots using an anti-GFP antibody (upper panel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). The difference between the theoretical mature 98,2 kD SBT3.3-GFP fusion and the observed mature 110 kD proteins must be due to posttranslational modifications. In fact, glycosylation was early proposed to regulate activity of plant subtilases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Bykova1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Cedzich1">[38]</xref>. We performed Western blots of the same leaf extracts and developed the nitrocellulose filters with Concanavalin A (Con A) coupled to horseradish peroxidase to identify if SBT3.3 is glycosylated. These analyses revealed that Con A recognized the 120/110 kD doublet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>) in extracts expressing the <italic>SBT3.3-GFP</italic> construct, thus confirming that SBT3.3 is glycosylated. Interestingly, Con A also recognized a band of ∼70 kD that only accumulated following SBT3.3-GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). This ∼70 kD band was reminiscent of a glycosylated 69 kD P69 subtilase conserved in the Solanaceous species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Jorda1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Tornero1">[30]</xref>.

Interestingly, when we extended this analysis to other defense-related proteins, i.e. by using antibodies against the PR-1a isoform from tobacco, we observed that overexpression of SBT3.3-GFP similarly triggered SA-responsive PR-1a protein accumulation (lower panel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). We subsequently created a missense mutant in the SBT3.3-GFP “catalytic triad” (S555A; SBT3.3m-GFP), to ascertain if the observed signaling required integrity of the subtilase proteolytic activity. Expression of the missense mutant in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> no longer promoted local accumulation of the corresponding endogenous P69 subtilase, or the PR-1a protein (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003445.s007">Figure S7</xref>). All of these observations are consistent with a model in which Arabidopsis SBT3.3 subtilase local expression autonomously triggers immune-like responses in a heterologous system, and the serine proteolytic activity of the subtilase is necessary for this effect. As occurs in <italic>SBT3.3OEX1</italic> plants (see below), expression of the <italic>SBT3.3-GFP</italic> gene construct in transgenic Arabidopsis plants conferred enhanced disease resistance to <italic>Ps</italic>DC3000 and is in contrast with the lack of effect observed for the <italic>SBT3.3m-GFP</italic> construct (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003445.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Moreover, the same <italic>SBT3.3-GFP</italic> gene construct is able to abrogate the characteristic enhanced disease susceptibility phenotype of <italic>sbt3.3</italic> plants, conferring enhanced disease resistance to <italic>Ps</italic>DC3000 to the stably transformed <italic>sbt3.3</italic> mutant plants (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003445.s009">Figure S9</xref>).

<title><italic>SBT3.3</italic> artificial expression in transgenic Arabidopsis triggers expression of the endogenous gene</title>
<p>The above observations indicated that SBT3.3 promotes the expression and accumulation of a homologous subtilase (i.e. P69) in N. benthamiana. We studied a stable transgenic Arabidopsis line constitutively expressing SBT3.3 under the control of the 35S promoter (SBT3.3OEX) by measuring activation on the corresponding endogenous SBT3.3 gene to test if the same phenomenon could be reproduced in Arabidopsis. Antibodies against SBT3.3 were not available; therefore we instead performed RT-qPCR measurements using 2 different pairs of oligonucleotides. One of those pairs discriminates between the endogenous <italic>SBT3.3</italic> mRNAs (<italic>endoSBT3.3</italic>), transcribed from its own gene, and the other pair was designed to measure the whole amount of <italic>SBT3.3</italic> mRNAs (<italic>SBT3.3</italic>). In Col-0 plants, as expected, both <italic>SBT3.3</italic> and <italic>endoSBT3.3</italic> transcript expression was very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>). In contrast, in the transgenic <italic>SBT3.3OEX</italic> line, <italic>SBT3.3</italic> transcript accumulation was prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>), and importantly, this was also followed by a high <italic>endoSBT3.3</italic> transcript accumulation. This effect gives support to the hypothesis that <italic>SBT3.3</italic> expression is able <italic>per se</italic> to signal its own gene activation. This induction appears “self” controlled, since endogenous <italic>PR-1</italic> transcript levels in transgenic plants do not exhibit significant variation with respect to Col-0 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>). However, in agro-infiltrated tobacco leaves we observed that <italic>SBT3.3-GFP</italic> expression promotes accumulation of both the endogenous P69 subtilase homolog, and the SA-dependent PR-1a protein. This difference can only be explained by noting that in the experiments with <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> is inevitably present, which in turn may supply PAMPs in collaboration with SBT3.3, triggering a downstream SA signaling pathway, and in turn SA-defense related gene activation. If this mechanism operated effectively, then SBT3.3 would be required to facilitate early immune signaling preceding defense response activation.</p>

<title><italic>SBT3.3</italic> expression confers enhanced activation of MPK kinases</title>
<p>Elevated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activation is genuinely linked to IR development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Beckers1">[12]</xref>, and in general to innate immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Asai1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Bethke1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Bethke2">[42]</xref>. Therefore, our next objective was to demonstrate if the enhanced resistance phenotype mediated by the sole SBT3.3 subtilase expression could elicit elevated MPKs activation. We subsequently employed an antibody recognizing the phosphorylated residues within the MAPK activation loop (the so called <italic>p</italic>TE<italic>p</italic>Y motif, where <italic>p</italic> denotes the phosphorylated residue). Western blot analysis of protein extracts derived from healthy Col-0 plants or from two <italic>SBT3.3OEX</italic> lines revealed positive immunoreactive signals in two polypeptides corresponding to MPK6 and MPK3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Bethke2">[42]</xref>. Following densitometric scanning of Western blots, the two immunoreactive bands appeared moderately more intense in the overexpression lines relative to Col-0 control lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g005">Fig. 5D–E</xref>). Inoculation with <italic>Ps</italic>DC3000 promoted a further activation-associated dual TEY phosphorylation of MPK3 and MPK6, which was higher in the two <italic>SBT3.3OEX</italic> lines than in Col-0 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g005">Fig. 5D–E</xref>). In addition, MPK4/MPK11, which migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Bethke2">[42]</xref>, became activated only following bacterial inoculation, and activation was again more intense in the two <italic>SBT3.3OEX</italic> lines. Therefore, dual phosphorylation of the TEY amino acid motif within the MPK activation loop, which is required for kinase activity appeared increased in plants expressing SBT3.3. However, despite these differences at the protein level, no significant differences were detected with respect to transcript accumulation induction for these MPKs between Col-0 and <italic>SBT3.3OEX</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>OXI1 is a serine/threonine kinase of the AGC protein kinase family required for oxidative burst-mediated signaling in Arabidopsis; its expression was consistent with that of <italic>SBT3.3</italic>, and was induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Rentel1">[33]</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). OXI1 was required for MPK3 and MPK6 activation and for basal resistance to <italic>H. arabidopsidis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Rentel1">[33]</xref>. In view of these observations, we hypothesized that the imposed <italic>SBT3.3</italic> expression might sensitize cells to bring earlier or higher <italic>OXI1</italic> expression levels following pathogen infection, and in turn provide an explanation for the higher activation observed in MPKs. We measured <italic>OXI1</italic> comparative transcript level between Col-0 and two <italic>SBT3.3OEX</italic> lines following <italic>Ps</italic>DC3000 infection by RT-qPCR. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> indicated the two <italic>SBT3.3OEX</italic> lines expressed <italic>OXI1</italic> to higher levels than Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g005">Fig. 5G</xref>). This offers a viable explanation as to why MPKs exhibited increased activation in <italic>SBT3.3OEX</italic> plants following pathogen attack, even in the absence of differential gene expression relative to Col-0. Moreover, in <italic>sbt3.3</italic> mutant lines MPKs activation following inoculation with <italic>Ps</italic>DC3000 was drastically reduced in comparison to Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). This observation reinforces the consideration that SBT3.3 appears to function as a positive regulator of the pathway leading to activation of MAP kinases. Interestingly, MPKs activation was not altered in the enhanced disease susceptibility <italic>nrp1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g005">Figure 5H</xref>) and neither was the expression of the <italic>SBT3.3</italic> gene altered in this same mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). This served as a control towards the specific requirement of SBT3.3 for MAKs activation and suggest that this specific signal module operates upstream of the NPR1 regulator.</p>

<p>Poising SA–related genes and primed immunity concur in plants defective in the RdDM pathway, such as mutants affected in different subunits of the RNA Pol V (<italic>i.e. nrpd2</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Lpez1">[23]</xref>, and also following pharmacological treatment with the priming agent BTH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Jaskiewicz1">[20]</xref>. In both cases, chromatin histone activation marks appeared enriched in SA-related gene promoters. Consequently, we hypothesized that following expression of <italic>SBT3.3</italic> SA-related defense genes could be poised for enhanced activation by differential histone modification. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we analyzed H3 Lys4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3 Lys9 acetylation (H3K9ac) on the <italic>PR-1</italic>, <italic>WRKY6</italic> and <italic>WRKY53</italic> gene promoter region in both Col-0 plants and <italic>SBT3.3OEX</italic> plants. The enhanced disease resistant mutant <italic>nrpd2</italic>, defective in RNA PolV activity and compromised in the RdDM pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Lpez1">[23]</xref>, was included as a control. On the <italic>PR-1</italic> promoter, H3K4me3 and H3K9ac activation marks increased more than two and three-fold, respectively in <italic>SBT3.3</italic> overexpressing plants when compared to Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). The two activation marks were similarly increased in <italic>nrpd2</italic> plants, with only some differences in intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). As for <italic>PR-1</italic>, the histone marks also showed increases in the <italic>WRKY6</italic> and <italic>WRKY53</italic> promoters in <italic>SBT3.3</italic> overexpressing plants, and to a lesser extent in <italic>nrpd2</italic> plants, relative to Col-0 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Therefore, chromatin marks normally associated with active genes abound in the promoter regions of SA-related genes in SBT3.3 overexpressing plants, although gene activation does not occur in these plants.

<title>SBT3.3 expression increases H3K4me3 activation marks in its own promoter</title>

ChIP for H3K4me3 and H3K9ac marks at the <italic>SBT3.3</italic> promoter region in <italic>SBT3.3</italic> overexpressing plants revealed that the H3K4me3 mark was notably increased compared to Col-0 plants, and moreover, the enhancement in H3K4me3 marks was mirrored in <italic>nrpd2</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). However, H3K9ac marks in the <italic>SBT3.3</italic> gene promoter did not increase in the <italic>SBT3.3</italic> overexpressing plants and the <italic>nrpd2</italic> mutant when compared to Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). These results contrasted with the common increase of both activation marks in the <italic>PR-1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), and suggested the existence of specific histone codes regulating gene expression. Alternatively, because the increase in H3K4me3 activation marks observed in the <italic>SBT3.3</italic> gene promoter between <italic>nrpd2</italic> and <italic>SBT3.3OEX</italic> plants were matched, we reasoned that <italic>nrpd2</italic> plants might also carry constitutive <italic>SBT3.3</italic> gene expression. <italic>SBT3.3</italic> transcript level determination by RT-qPCR in Col-0 and <italic>nrpd2</italic> plants showed the mutant constitutively expressing <italic>SBT3.3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>SBT3.3</italic> expression is under negative epigenetic control, and expression is relieved following inhibition of RdDM. In fact, treatment of Col-0 seedlings with sulfamethazine (SMZ), a chemical suppressor of epigenetic gene silencing (i.e. RdDM) that derepress silenced genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Zhang1">[45]</xref>, relieved <italic>SBT3.3</italic> and promoted transcript accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>), to levels similar to those attained in <italic>nrpd2</italic> plants. These observations therefore support the contention of an epigenetic control towards <italic>SBT3.3</italic>, and indicate that SBT3.3 acts as a positive regulator of a priming phenomenon for more efficient deployment of immune responses. In addition, a low concentration (100 µM) pharmacological treatment with of the priming agent BTH administered to Col-0 plants promoted the enhanced deposition of H3K4me3 and H3K9ac marks in the <italic>PR-1</italic> gene promoter, and to a minor extent also in <italic>WRKY6</italic> and <italic>WRKY53</italic> gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>), as was observed in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Jaskiewicz1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Lpez1">[23]</xref>. Similarly, BTH also induced H3K4me3 activation marks, and to a less extent also of H3K9ac marks, in the <italic>SBT3.3</italic> gene promoter in Col-0 plants. Thus, as a priming agent, BTH not only induced chromatin remodeling of SA-related genes similar to the RdDM-defective and enhanced resistance mutant <italic>nrpd2</italic>; it also mimicked <italic>SBT3.3</italic> chromatin remodeling triggered by the SBT3.3 itself.</p>

<p>The importance of SBT3.3 in mediating activation of chromatin remodeling during priming induction was further evaluated in SBT3.3 defective plants. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003445-g007">Figure 7D, F and G</xref> show that BTH-mediated increases of H3K4me3 and H3K9ac activation marks in the <italic>PR-1, WRKY6</italic> and <italic>WRKY53</italic> gene promoters was partially impeded in <italic>sbt3.3</italic> plant when compared to Col-0 plants.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Priming, an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon where cells respond to much lower levels of a pathogenic stimulus in a more rapid and robust manner, is an important component of the various forms of IR described in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Hayes1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Koerner1">[10]</xref>, plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Ku1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-PrimeAPlant1">[18]</xref> and invertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Pham1">[11]</xref>. Despite the importance of priming, the signal component(s) mediating this sensitized state remain elusive. The sensitized state is in part explained by presumably dormant or silent component characters, which accumulate during priming, and are required only after pathogenic challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-PrimeAPlant1">[18]</xref>. In this respect, pre-stress deposition of two MPK family members of signaling enzymes, MPK3 and MPK6, has been described to play an important role for priming in Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Beckers1">[12]</xref>. However, it remains undetermined whether or not activation of additional factors operating upstream of the two MPKs is required to establish priming.</p>
<p>Reverse genetic analysis was applied to identify the Arabidospsis <italic>SBT3.3</italic> gene, encoding a serine protease of the subtilisin clan, which is pivotal in control of a priming mechanism that leads to sensitization for activation of SA-dependent defense responses and IR. <italic>SBT3.3</italic> overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis plants elicited enhanced disease resistance to pathogens. However, this enhanced resistance was not preceded by a high constitutive expression of SA-responsive genes as occurs in different disease resistant mutants, which in general carry associated dwarfism, such as in <italic>cpr1</italic>, <italic>edr1</italic> or <italic>csb3</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Gil1">[26, and references therein]</xref> to mention a few. Instead, the SBT3.3-mediated resistance can be explained by accelerated and heightened activation of SA-responsive genes, only elicited by pathogen inoculation, therefore mimicking a wild type plant activated for priming. This phenotype is blocked in a <italic>sid2</italic> mutant background, which lacks SA, and is also blocked in the <italic>npr1</italic> mutant affected in signaling downstream of SA. SBT3.3 thus functions as a positive regulator of innate immunity operating upstream of the SA pathway. Consistent with the gain-of-function phenotype, <italic>SBT3.3</italic> suppression impairs induction of SA-responsive genes and causes enhanced susceptibility to infection by pathogens.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <italic>SBT3.3</italic> expression is rapidly demanded during activation of innate immunity preceding the activation of SA-responsive genes. However, in contrast to <italic>PR</italic> genes, <italic>SBT3.3</italic> expression does not require the SA pathway through the NPR1 regulator. Moreover, <italic>SBT3.3</italic> activation responds very rapidly to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, a common ROS species generated very early during PAMP recognition by PRR leading to activation of innate immune responses. Consistent with other early induced and SA-independent genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Coego1">[46]</xref>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> might be the first signal for early transcriptional reprogramming of <italic>SBT3.3</italic>. Congruently, Daudi <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Daudi1">[47]</xref> showed that knocking down the Arabidopsis cell wall peroxidases PRX33/PRX34, required for apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation during innate immune responses, leads to changes in the cell wall proteome with depletion of various PAMP-elicited proteins, among which SBT3.3 was conspicuous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-OBrien1">[48]</xref>. Localized <italic>SBT3.3</italic> expression in the heterologous <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> system led to expression of the endogenous P69 homologue. Similarly, its stable expression in transgenic plants also led to activation of the endogenous <italic>SBT3.3</italic> gene by what appears to be a self-induction mechanism, which adds further novelty to the <italic>SBT3.3</italic> activation mode. We hypothesize that to a subsequent initial activation by a pathogen, the expressed SBT3.3 subtilase could initiate a signaling process, which would lead to its own expression, at least to a certain threshold level, as if forming a regulatory positive feedback loop circuit. Maintenance of this expression threshold level should be sufficient to keep cells in a sustained sensitized mode. The autonomous and sustained <italic>SBT3.3</italic> expression pattern should consequently be the basis to explain the memory-based characteristics of priming and IR, manifested only secondarily in hosts after a primary infection. Thus, SBT3.3 appears key in regulating this type of training effect leading to IR. Interestingly, MPK3 and MPK6 activation, and to a lesser extend also MPK4/MPK11, were enhanced in <italic>SBT3.3OEX</italic> plants following infection with <italic>Ps</italic>DC3000, and conversely, this activation was compromised in <italic>sbt3.3</italic> plants. These results are congruent with increased <italic>OXI1</italic> expression in <italic>SBT3.3OEX</italic> plants, a kinase required for MPK3 and MPK6 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Rentel1">[33]</xref>, and indicates that following <italic>SBT3.3</italic> expression, plants respond faster to pathogenic stimuli. Because the MPK3 and MPK6 activation is critical for priming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Beckers1">[12]</xref>, and activation requires OXI1 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Rentel1">[33]</xref>, our data suggest SBT3.3 positively modulates immune responses upstream of the MAPK kinase pathway, and confirms that accumulation of defense signaling components, such as SBT3.3 itself, prior to a secondary pathogen challenge is essential for priming and induced resistance.</p>
<p>Similarly, the observation that sole <italic>SBT3.3</italic> expression poises SA-responsive defense genes for enhanced activation following perception of a pathogenic cue provides further support to SBT3.3 as an integral component in mounting primed immunity. ChIP assays revealed this poising effect for enhanced gene expression triggered by SBT3.3 was mediated by selective increases of histone activation marks on the promoter region of SA-responsive genes. Since similar histone activation marks have been found to appear in SA–related genes when wild type plants are treated with the priming agent BTH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Jaskiewicz1">[20]</xref>, our data therefore strongly support a model where SBT3.3 positively mediates OXI1-mediated MPK activation, and concurrent chromatin remodeling at SA-responsive genes as specific hallmarks for primed immunity. Furthermore, the observation that immune priming, and similar chromatin remodeling of SA-responsive genes is mirrored in plants defective in the RdDM pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Lpez1">[23]</xref> provides support for a hypothesis that the observed SBT3.3-mediated priming mechanism might be under similar epigenetic control. Moreover, the fact that <italic>SBT3.3</italic> gene expression is constitutively up in the <italic>nrpd2</italic> mutant favors this interpretation. Furthermore, (1) the observation that histone activation marks are established in the promoter of the <italic>SBT3.3</italic> gene and in the promoters of SA-dependent genes by individual SBT3.3 overexpression in transgenic plants; (2) the reproducibility of similar chromatin remodeling of the <italic>SBT3.3</italic> gene promoter in <italic>nrpd2</italic> plants; (3) its similar remodeling in Col-0 plants following BTH treatment; (4) and the observation that such chromatin remodeling is strongly abrogated in <italic>sbt3.3</italic> plants, further substantiates the importance of SBT3.3 gene activation as a prerequisite for establishment of immune priming.</p>
<p>How does then a proteolytic enzyme such as SBT3.3, which accumulates in the extracellular matrix trigger activation of such a complex signaling pathway mediating priming and IR? One simple explanation is via SBT3.3-mediated protein substrate processing that co-localizes extracellularly. This substrate could exist in a soluble form, or be an extracellular domain (ectodomain) of a larger protein, likely functioning as a receptor located in the plasma membrane. After proteolytic shedding of the ectodomain by SBT3.3, the receptor could become activated and initiate a down stream immune signaling process. This mechanism has been identified as common in activating a variety of signaling processes in animal through the involvement of protease-activated receptors (PARs), a group of receptors mediating different cellular processes including proinflammatory responses, and is also a common principle in various diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Ossovskaya1">[49]</xref>. Moreover, the proteolytic processing mechanism of an extracellular substrate is reminiscent of that mediating activation of innate immunity in invertebrates through the transmembrane Toll receptor, or Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in humans; PRR-type receptors consisting of a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) ectodomain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytosolic signaling domain [Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR)], which becomes activated only after the binding of a proteolytically processed peptide ligand (<italic>i.e.</italic> spätzle) by complex cascades of CLIP-domain serine proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Buchon1">[50]</xref> or less common following specific cleavage of the receptor ectodomain by extracellular proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Brunn1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-deZoete1">[52]</xref>. Alternatively, SBT3.3 processes the extracellular substrate and the cleaved polypeptide can be released and function as a ligand recognized by a nearby specific extracellular receptor, which in turn can initiate a downstream signaling. Tornero et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Tornero1">[30]</xref> reported SBT3.3 homologous P69C subtilase can specifically process LRP in disease tomato plants, an extracellular LRR-containing protein of unknown function, and the first subtilase substrate identified in plants. This suggesting SBT3.3 could similarly be involved in the cleavage and activation of LRR-containing proteins, including PRR-type receptors, which in turn may activate innate immune responses. The recent finding that the lectin receptor kinase (<italic>Lec</italic>RK)-VI.2, a member of the LRR-containing superfamily of RLKs proteins existing in Arabidopsis, is required for immune priming acting upstream of MPK-mediated signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003445-Singh1">[53]</xref> can give further support to this hypothesis.</p>
<p>The results of the present study identified SBT3.3 as a determinant host factor mediating activation of primed immune responses. Our immediate future challenge is to identify the target substrate processed by this subtilase and elucidate the mechanism transducing the substrate into a signal for immune prime activation.</p>
