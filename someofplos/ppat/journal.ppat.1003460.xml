<abstract>
<p>Influenza A virus is a major human pathogen with a genome comprised of eight single-strand, negative-sense, RNA segments. Two viral RNA segments, NS1 and M, undergo alternative splicing and yield several proteins including NS1, NS2, M1 and M2 proteins. However, the mechanisms or players involved in splicing of these viral RNA segments have not been fully studied. Here, by investigating the interacting partners and function of the cellular protein NS1-binding protein (NS1-BP), we revealed novel players in the splicing of the M1 segment. Using a proteomics approach, we identified a complex of RNA binding proteins containing NS1-BP and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), among which are hnRNPs involved in host pre-mRNA splicing. We found that low levels of NS1-BP specifically impaired proper alternative splicing of the viral M1 mRNA segment to yield the M2 mRNA without affecting splicing of mRNA<sub>3</sub>, M4, or the NS mRNA segments. Further biochemical analysis by formaldehyde and UV cross-linking demonstrated that NS1-BP did not interact directly with viral M1 mRNA but its interacting partners, hnRNPs A1, K, L, and M, directly bound M1 mRNA. Among these hnRNPs, we identified hnRNP K as a major mediator of M1 mRNA splicing. The M1 mRNA segment generates the matrix protein M1 and the M2 ion channel, which are essential proteins involved in viral trafficking, release into the cytoplasm, and budding. Thus, reduction of NS1-BP and/or hnRNP K levels altered M2/M1 mRNA and protein ratios, decreasing M2 levels and inhibiting virus replication. Thus, NS1-BP-hnRNPK complex is a key mediator of influenza A virus gene expression.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Influenza A virus is a major human pathogen, which causes approximately 500,000 deaths/year worldwide. In pandemic years, influenza infection can lead to even higher mortality rates, as in 1918, when ∼30–50 million deaths occurred worldwide. In this manuscript, we identified a novel function for the cellular protein termed NS1-BP as a regulator of the influenza A virus life cycle. We found that NS1-BP, together with other host factors, mediates the expression of a key viral protein termed M2. NS1-BP and its interacting partner hnRNP K specifically regulate alternative splicing of the viral M1 mRNA segment, which generates the M2 mRNA that is translated into the essential viral M2 protein. The M2 protein is key for viral uncoating and entry into the host cell cytoplasm. Altogether, inhibition of NS1-BP and hnRNP K functions regulate influenza A virus gene expression and replication. In sum, these studies revealed new functions for the cellular proteins NS1-BP and hnRNP K during viral RNA expression, which facilitate the influenza A virus life cycle.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Influenza A virus belongs to the <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family of RNA viruses and infects mammals and birds. Pathogenic strains of influenza A virus cause high mortality in humans, which usually results in ∼250,000 to 500,000 deaths/year worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-WHO1">[1]</xref>. In pandemic years, influenza infection can lead to even higher mortality rates, as in 1918, when at least 20 million deaths occurred worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Webster1">[2]</xref>. Influenza A virus is an enveloped virus with a genome comprised of eight single-strand, negative-sense RNA segments that encode an increasing list of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Palese1">[3]</xref>. Projecting from the viral surface are two glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which determine the subtypes of influenza A viruses. Underneath the lipid bilayer, there are viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) comprised of RNAs and viral polymerase complex (PB1, PB2, and PA). Each viral RNA segment is wrapped with viral nucleoprotein (NP), and the viral polymerase complex binds to a panhandle/fork/corkscrew structure formed by the complementary base pairing at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the untranslated regions of viral RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Palese2">[4]</xref>. In addition, N40 is a newly identified viral protein derived from the PB1 segment whose function is unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Wise1">[5]</xref>, and some viruses also encode the PB1-F2 protein, which is expressed from a different open reading frame within the PB1 segment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Chen1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Gibbs1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Zamarin1">[8]</xref>. Recently, a ribosomal frameshift product derived from the RNA segment that encodes PA has been identified and termed PA-X <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Jagger1">[9]</xref>. This protein was then shown to modulate host response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Jagger1">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, additional products from the PA segment have been reported including PA-N155 and PA-N182, which may also function in virus replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Muramoto1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Two of the influenza virus RNA segments generate spliced products: NS segment encodes the non-structural protein (NS1) and nuclear export protein (NEP/NS2); M segment encodes the matrix protein (M1) and ion channel (M2). More recently, a splicing variant of M2 has been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Wise2">[11]</xref>. In addition, another splice product of the NS segment termed NS3 has been identified by adaptation of a human virus in a mouse host but its function remains unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Selman1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Influenza A virus initiates infection by attaching to sialic acids on the host cell surface via its HA protein, and then enters the cell through endocytosis. The low pH environment of the endosome triggers membrane fusion between the viral envelope and endosomal membrane, which is induced by HA. The viral core is acidified by the opening of the M2 ion channel, resulting in the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. Influenza virus replication depends on cellular factors present in the nucleus, so the released cytoplasmic vRNPs are imported into the nucleus and generate two positive-sense RNAs, mRNA and cRNA. Viral mRNA is then exported to the cytoplasm for translation. On the other hand, cRNP is used as template for producing progeny vRNA. The newly synthesized vRNPs are exported to the cytoplasm where new viral particles are assembled and then exit the host cell by budding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Medina1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>The influenza A virus non-structural protein (NS1) down-regulates host pathways to evade the host innate immune system. In the cytoplasm, NS1 represses interferon α/β production by inhibiting signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Versteeg1">[14]</xref>. In the nucleus, NS1 interacts with constituents of the mRNA processing and export machineries, including CPSF and poly(A) binding protein II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Nemeroff1">[15]</xref>, and the mRNA export complex containing the NXF1/TAP-p15/NXT export receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Satterly1">[16]</xref>. These nuclear interactions result in blockage of host mRNA nuclear export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Satterly1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Zhang1">[17]</xref>, which requires pyrimidines and prevents expression of mRNAs that encode antiviral factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Zhang1">[17]</xref>. In addition, NS1 was found to interact with a host protein termed NS1 binding protein (NS1-BP), which was previously shown to inhibit pre-mRNA splicing of a reporter gene <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Woff1">[18]</xref>. Upon infection, NS1-BP was dispersed from speckles and re-distributed throughout the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Woff1">[18]</xref>. In this regard, NS1 was also found to alter the subcellular localization of splicing factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Fortes1">[19]</xref>. However, the role of NS1-BP during influenza A virus infection remained unknown. Here, we used biochemical and functional approaches to investigate NS1-BP function in the context of host cell-viral interaction. We found that NS1-BP interacted with the heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K to promote splicing of M1 mRNA, which yields the viral M2 mRNA segment. Thus, NS1-BP and hnRNP K were revealed as key mediators of influenza A viral gene expression and replication.</p>

<title>NS1-BP interacts with RNA binding proteins</title>
<p>To investigate the function of NS1-BP, we first took a systematic biochemical approach to identify its interacting partners. We developed polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognized NS1-BP and immunoprecipitated NS1-BP from cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, top panel). Knockdown of NS1-BP with siRNA oligos followed by immunoblot analysis further demonstrate antibody specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom panel). As also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003460.s005">Table S1</xref>, we identified NS1-BP interacting partners by mass spectrometry, which included RNA-binding proteins. These proteins can be classified into the following categories: heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein and splicing factors (hnRNP family), RNA helicase (DEAD box polypeptide family), antiviral proteins [nuclear factor associated with dsRNA (NFAR-2), zinc finger antiviral protein], poly(A) binding protein, nuclear cap binding protein, chaperones (Hsp70 and Hsp90), and DNA damage repair protein [poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, PARP]. Next, we examined whether these interactions were RNA-dependent or independent. NS1-BP was then immunoprecipitated in the absence or presence of RNase A. While NS1-BP interacted with RNA-binding proteins in the absence of RNase, most of these interactions were lost in the presence of RNase A. However, hnRNPs K and M remained associated with NS1-BP to a lesser extent upon RNase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These results suggested that NS1-BP is likely an RNP-binding protein, which could be involved in gene expression.</p>

<p>(A) Top panel, HeLa cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with control IgG or NS1-BP antibodies. Interacting proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and identified by mass spectrometry. Bottom panel, A549 cells were treated with non-targeting or NS1-BP siRNAs (1, 2, and 3) for 48 h. Cell extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis, which shows NS1-BP knockdown. β-actin served as loading control.

Western blots were then performed with the depicted antibodies, selected based on the proteins identified in A. (C) A549 cells were mock-infected or infected with influenza virus at MOI 5 for 5 h. Cells were lysed and subjected to size exclusion chromatography. The fractions were concentrated by TCA precipitation and analyzed by western blot with the indicated antibodies.

<p>By comparing our proteomics results with other interactomes, we noticed that certain proteins that bound NS1-BP were found associated with the influenza A virus ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) or the heterotrimeric polymerase complex including PARP-1, NFAR-2, poly(A)-binding protein, hnRNP M, hnRNP A1, DDX17, Hsp70, and Hsp90 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Bortz1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Jorba1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Mayer1">[22]</xref>. In addition, host-influenza polymerase interactomes also identified the largest subunit of cellular RNA polymerase II (Pol II CTD), which has been shown to bind the viral polymerase complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Engelhardt1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Engelhardt2">[24]</xref>. Since NS1-BP shared some of the binding partners of the host-influenza polymerase interactome, we investigated the sedimentation profile of hnRNP M, viral and host polymerases, viral NP protein, which binds viral polymerase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Biswas1">[25]</xref>, and NS1-BP. Cell extracts were subjected to gel filtration and fractions were processed for immunoblot analysis with antibodies against NS1-BP, hnRNP M, PB1, NP, and host RNA polymerase II. We showed that a pool of NS1-BP, hnRNP M, PB1, NP, and a pool of the host polymerase II sedimented with high molecular weight complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, PB1 and NP are only found co-sedimenting with high molecular weight complexes. We then tested whether NS1-BP binds the cellular and viral RNA polymerases. Indeed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g001">figure 1D</xref>, immunoprecipitation of NS1-BP revealed its interaction with both viral and host RNA polymerase II. Taking together all the results above, these findings indicated that NS1-BP physically interacts with hnRNPs and viral and host polymerases to likely regulate gene expression.</p>

<title>NS1-BP and its interacting partner hnRNP K regulate splicing of influenza A virus M1 mRNA</title>
<p>To investigate the function of NS1-BP in the influenza virus life cycle, we knocked down NS1-BP in cells and infected them with A/WSN/33. We first assessed whether NS1-BP depletion affected viral entry or vRNP nuclear import by examining the localization of viral nucleoprotein (NP) in NS1-BP-depleted cells after infection and in the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide. Compared to control, NS1-BP knockdown did not decrease nuclear NP staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003460.s001">Figure S1</xref>), indicating that reduction of viral RNAs in NS1-BP depleted cells did not alter viral entry or vRNP nuclear import. Then, viral protein levels were assessed over time by immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). While the levels of most viral proteins were not significantly altered, we observed an abnormal M2/M1 protein ratio in NS1-BP depleted cells suggesting a role for NS1-BP in regulating splicing of a specific viral mRNA, the M1 mRNA segment.</p>

<title>NS1-BP promotes splicing of influenza A virus M1 mRNA segment to yield proper levels of M2 mRNA and protein.</title>
<p>(A) A549 cells were transfected with non-targeting or NS1-BP siRNAs for 48 h and infected with A/WSN/33 at MOI 2 for the indicated time points. Cells lysates were subjected to western blot analysis using antibodies against influenza virus proteins. α-tubulin was used as loading control. Each protein band was quantified by ImageJ and normalized to α-tubulin levels. (B) M1 mRNA and its alternatively spliced products are depicted and the arrowheads show primer positions for detection of various mRNAs in the following experiments.

<p>To investigate this potential effect on splicing, mRNA levels of M2 and M1 were measured by RT-qPCR. Indeed, the ratio of the M2 over M1 mRNAs decreased in cells depleted of NS1-BP and infected with A/WSN/33, indicating a splicing defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>). The dynamics of M2 and M1 expression in control cells was similar to what has been previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Valcarcel1">[26]</xref>. Different dynamics of M2 and M1 expression has also been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Robb1">[27]</xref>, which may be due to differences in cell types. M2 mRNA is derived from alternative splicing of the M1 mRNA segment. In addition, the M1 mRNA segment can generate mRNA<sub>3</sub> and, in certain strains such as A/WSN/33, mRNA4. However, it is unknown whether mRNA<sub>3</sub> encodes a functional peptide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Lamb1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Lamb2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Shih1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Winter1">[31]</xref>. Recently, mRNA4 was shown to express an isoform of the M2 ion channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Wise2">[11]</xref>. The 5′ splice site that yields mRNA<sub>3</sub> is strong and has to be inhibited by influenza A virus polymerase to allow usage of the downstream weak splice site that generates the M2 mRNA, which happens later in infection. Therefore, we also examined mRNA<sub>3</sub> and M4 levels relative to M1 mRNA over time and found no difference between control and NS1-BP knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g002">Figure 2D and 2E</xref>). Together, these findings reveal that sequences surrounding the M2-specific 5′ splice site and/or factors bound to this region are required for NS1-BP activity on splicing. We have also tested another viral segment, NS, which undergoes alternative splicing and generates the NS1 and NS2 mRNAs. In this case, no differences in ratio were observed between control and NS1-BP depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g002">Figure 2F and 2G</xref>). Upon NS1-BP knockdown under these conditions, NS1-BP mRNA levels remained down-regulated throughout these mRNA measurements as compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g002">Figure 2H</xref>). Thus, these findings show that NS1-BP specifically regulates splicing of the M1 mRNA segment.</p>
<p>NS1-BP effect on M1 mRNA splicing is consistent with our findings of NS1-BP interaction with the influenza virus polymerase, which was previously reported to regulate splicing of the M1 mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Shih2">[32]</xref>. In addition, our proteomics analysis showed NS1-BP interaction with hnRNPs previously known to be involved in splicing such as hnRNP M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Hovhannisyan1">[33]</xref> and hnRNP K <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Marchand1">[34]</xref>. Thus, we tested whether NS1-BP and the hnRNPs that interacted with NS1-BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>) bound directly to M1 RNA. Capped and <sup>32</sup>P-labeled M1 RNA was incubated with nuclear extracts and direct protein-RNA interactions were crosslinked with UV, followed by RNA digestion and immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific to various individual hnRNPs. The hnRNPs bound to a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled nucleotide (C or U) were then detected. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, hnRNP U and NS1-BP did not directly bind M1 RNA whereas hnRNPs A1, M, L, and K directly interacted with M1 RNA. By contrast, we detect no binding of hnRNP K to a control RNA derived from the CD45 pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003460.s002">Figure S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Lynch1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Rothrock1">[36]</xref>. However, NS1-BP bound the viral M1 segment upon formaldehyde cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In this case, A549 cells were infected with influenza A/WSN/33 virus at MOI 5 for 5 h, crosslinked with formaldehyde, and then lysed. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation, and the associated viral RNAs were isolated and quantified by RT-qPCR. Each experiment included three conditions as following: immunoprecipitations were performed with NS1-BP antibodies using lysates with or without formaldehyde crosslinking, and control IgG was incubated with lysates subjected to formaldehyde crosslinking. The results indicate that formaldehyde cross-linked M1 mRNA to NS1-BP as opposed to three host mRNAs encoding GAPDH, β-actin, and α-tubulin, which were not cross-linked to M1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Since NS1-BP interacted with the M1 segment upon formaldehyde treatment but not upon UV crosslinking, these results indicate that NS1-BP likely requires adaptor proteins, such as hnRNPs, to interact with the M1 segment.</p>

<p>The hnRNPs that directly bound the M1 mRNA were then tested for regulation of M1 mRNA splicing in virus-infected cells.

<title>NS1-BP and hnRNP K are required for optimal expression of viral proteins and viral replication</title>
<p>To determine whether the effect of NS1-BP or hnRNP K on viral gene expression would result in alteration of viral protein levels and replication, we examined both parameters in cells depleted of NS1-BP or hnRNP K versus control cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, the ratio of M2 to M1 at the protein level follows the effect of NS1-BP depletion on the ratio of M2 and M1 mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Regulation of M2 expression by NS1-BP is an important step in the viral life cycle as M2 is the ion channel that allows entry of hydrogen ions from the endosome into the viral particle resulting in uncoating of the virus and release of viral content into the cytoplasm. Consequently, the observed effects of NS1-BP depletion on viral gene expression resulted in down-regulation of influenza A virus replication in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). siRNA oligo 1 was more efficient in down-regulating virus replication (∼21 fold at 24 h and ∼12 fold at 36 h) than oligos 2 and 3 (∼4–6 fold). While all oligos down-regulated NS1-BP levels efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g005">Figure 5F</xref>), the range of viral titers is likely due to differences in the kinetics of knockdown for each siRNA oligo. ATP levels were also measured and the results did not show significant difference in cell death between control and NS1-BP depletion during the experimental period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g005">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>), indicating that the decrease of virus replication in NS1-BP depleted cells was not due to cell death but likely due to NS1-BP effects on viral gene expression. We have also analyzed virus replication in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) and observed a decrease in influenza A virus replication between ∼3–9 fold, depending on the siRNA oligo and depicted time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g005">Figure 5E and 5F</xref>).</p>

<p>Furthermore, depletion of hnRNP K followed by influenza virus infection at high MOI, single round of viral replication, resulted primarily in an abnormal ratio of M2 to M1 protein expression, which reduced M2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) and demonstrated a dramatic consequence of the splicing defect shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g004">Figure 4B</xref>. Consequently, viral replication was clearly compromised upon hnRNP K depletion as infection at low MOI, in which multiple rounds of viral replication are allowed, showed diminished overall viral protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) and viral titer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), without causing cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003460-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we report a novel function for the cellular NS1-BP protein. NS1-BP interacted with cellular RNA-binding proteins, including splicing factors and RNA polymerase II, in the absence or presence of virus infection, suggesting a role in the regulation of gene expression. During infection, our results indicate that the influenza A virus RNA polymerase and viral RNAs associate with the NS1-BP/RNP complex to likely regulate viral RNA splicing of the M1 mRNA segment to generate the M2 protein. Furthermore, we identified hnRNP K as the interacting partner of NS1-BP that directly binds the M1 mRNA to promote splicing and induce expression of M2 mRNA. Thus, these findings revealed a novel function for NS1-BP and hnRNP K as key regulators of influenza A virus infection.</p>
<p>Influenza A virus polymerase transcribes and replicates the viral genome by interacting at the 5′ end with cRNA and vRNA. In addition to these primary roles, influenza A virus polymerase has been shown to regulate the choice of alternative 5′ splice sites in influenza A virus M1 mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Shih2">[32]</xref>. The influenza A virus polymerase binds M1-specific sequences in M1 mRNA in addition to the 5′-terminal cap structure which results in the switch to the downstream M2 5′ splice site. Since NS1-BP binds the influenza A virus polymerase and together with hnRNP K regulates M1 mRNA splicing, a model can be proposed in which binding of the NS1-BP-hnRNP K complex to the influenza virus polymerase and M1 mRNA blocks the proximal 5′ splice site causing the switch to the downstream splicing site, yielding expression of M2 mRNA. In this regard, hnRNP K was previously shown to regulate splicing of HIV-1 pre-mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Marchand1">[34]</xref>. The acceptor site A7 on HIV-1 pre-mRNA has an essential role for expressing <italic>tat</italic> and <italic>rev</italic> mRNAs, which encode proteins essential for viral mRNA synthesis and export. hnRNP K was show to down-regulate A7 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Marchand1">[34]</xref>. In addition, hnRNP K was reported as a repressor of hepatitis B virus replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Ng1">[37]</xref> but promoted herpes simplex virus-1 propagation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Schmidt1">[38]</xref>. Together, these findings demonstrate that hnRNP K has a key regulatory role in the replication of evolutionarily diverse viruses and it can act in a positive or negative manner, depending on the context or virus.</p>
<p>Splicing of the M1 mRNA is a fundamental process for virus replication as it generates the M2 ion channel, which is essential for vRNP release into the host cytoplasm upon entry and for release of newly synthesized virions via budding from the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Rossman1">[39]</xref>. Moreover, M2 expression is also required to prevent a premature conformational change of the HA of a subset of highly pathogenic H5 and H7 influenza A viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Ciampor1">[40]</xref>. Thus, depletion of NS1-BP or hnRNP K is likely to have more impact on these highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.</p>
<p>The influenza A virus NS1 protein was recently shown to regulate the M1 mRNA splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Robb1">[27]</xref> and the involvement of the influenza A virus polymerase is not clear in this case. However, NS1 was previously shown to interact with the influenza A virus polymerase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Marion1">[41]</xref> and temperature-sensitive viruses expressing C-terminal truncations of NS1 presented defective RNA replication and late gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Falcon1">[42]</xref>. Therefore, future studies are necessary to determine whether NS1 regulates influenza A virus polymerase function in splicing and if this mechanism is related to NS1-BP function. One possibility is that influenza A virus may use NS1-dependent and independent mechanisms to regulate splicing of the M1 mRNA segment, which might occur at different stages of infection. In fact, host splicing can be differentially regulated depending on various stimuli, resulting in diverse effects such as differential protein-protein interactions, nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking and transcription elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Heyd1">[43]</xref>. Further experimentation using influenza A virus lacking the NS1 gene, which replicates in interferon-deficient systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-GarciaSastre1">[44]</xref>, will be necessary to understand the impact of NS1 on NS1-BP function. Interestingly, NS1-BP levels did not affect splicing of the NS mRNA, indicating again differential splicing or factors involved in the splicing regulation of the M1 and NS1 mRNAs.</p>
<p>In sum, our findings reveal a novel role for NS1-BP and hnRNP K as host regulators of influenza A virus RNA biogenesis. In future studies, these findings may serve as paradigm to uncover a potential role for NS1-BP in splicing of specific classes of host pre-mRNAs. Since specific sequences surrounding the M2 5′ splice site are required for NS1-BP-hnRNP K activity on splicing, one can envisage NS1-BP regulating splicing, via hnRNP K, of a subset of host pre-mRNAs containing similar sequences. It would be interesting if host mRNAs regulated by NS1-BP and hnRNP K encode proteins involved in immune response during viral infection, which is an interesting topic for future investigation. In sum, the study presented here exposed novel host-viral interactions that regulate splicing of influenza A virus RNA, which play a significant role in the virus life cycle.</p>

<title>SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis</title>
<p>Gel electrophoresis was performed using the Tricine-SDS PAGE system as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003460-Schagger1">[49]</xref>. Acrylamide gels used in this study were 7%, acrylamide solution was 40%, and acrylamide/bis-acrylamide ratio was 5%. Running gel buffer contained 1.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.45; stacking gel buffer contained 0.3 M Tris-HCl and 0.4% SDS, pH 7.8. Cathode buffer contained 0.1 M Tris, 0.1 M Tricine, and 0.1% SDS, pH 8.25. Anode buffer was 0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.9. Thirty ml of the running gel mixture was prepared for 4 gels, which includes 5.25 mL of acrylamide solution, 10 mL of running gel buffer, 4 g glycerol, 10.64 mL water, 100 µL ammonium persulfate (10%), and 10 µL of TEMED (N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethane-1,2-diamine). The stacking gel mixture contained 1.23 mL of acrylamide solution, 3 mL of stacking gel buffer, 7.77 mL of water, 100 µL of ammonium persulfate (10%), and 10 µL of TEMED. Samples were mixed with equal volume of 2× sample buffer [100 mM Tris-HCl, 8% SDS, 24% glycerol, 200 mM DTT, and 0.02% bromophenol blue, pH 7.8], heated at 95°C for 10 min, and loaded onto the wells. The electrophoresis was performed at a constant voltage of 120 V until the tracking dye reached the edge of the gel.</p>
<p>After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore) using a mini transfer electrophoretic cell with transfer buffer [20 mM Tris, 192 mM Glycine, and 10% methanol] at a constant voltage of 30 V overnight. The PVDF membrane was then blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS for 1 h, followed by two PBS-T (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) washes, and incubated with primary antibody (prepared in 10 mg/mL BSA/PBS) at room temperature for 1 h. After incubation, the membrane was washed 5 times with PBS-T buffer for 5 min each, and then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for another hour. Finally, the PVDF membrane was washed 4 times with PBS-T buffer for 10 min each, submerged in ECL reagent (34096, Pierce, Thermo Scientific) for 5 min, and exposed to a film in the dark room for 20 s to 5 min until the signal was visible.</p>

<title>Expression and purification of GST-NS1-BP</title>
<p>The plasmid pGEX-NS1BP was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. A single colony was inoculated into 2.5 ml of LB with 100 µg/ml of ampicillin and incubated at 37°C in a shaker at 225 rpm overnight. Next day, the overnight culture was added into 250 ml of 2-YT broth (Invitrogen) and grown to OD 0.6 at 37°C. Protein expression was induced by 0.2 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 20°C for 6 h. Bacteria were pelleted and re-suspended in 25 ml of cold lysis buffer [20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaCl, and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)]. Cells were lysed by five passages through an EmulsiFlex-C5 homogenizer (Avestin, Canada) at 8000 psi, and lysates were centrifuged at 13,000×g for 15 min. The supernatant was incubated with 2 ml (50% slurry) glutathione Sepharose beads at 4°C for 1 h, and beads were washed 10 times with cold lysis buffer.

<title>Immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy</title>
<p>A549 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 1×10<sup>5</sup> cells/well the day before siRNA transfection. At the second day, cells were treated with 50 nM of non-targeting or NS1-BP siRNAs. After 24 h, cells in each well were trypsinized and split into 4 wells of 24-well plate including a coverslip per well, and incubated for another 24 hours. To synchronize the infection, cells were pre-chilled on ice for 10 min before infection, washed with cold PBS, and infected with influenza virus at MOI 50. After 45 min adsorption on ice, cells were washed with PBS and overlaid with 0.5 ml of warm infection media including 1 mM cycloheximide. At the indicated time points, cells on coverslips were fixed with 3% formaldehyde/PBS at room temperature for 15 min, washed 3× with PBS, and then permeabilized with 0.5% TritonX-100/PBS at room temperature for 5 min. Then, coverslips were incubated with NP antibody (ab20343, Abcam) prepared in BSA solution (1 mg/ml) at a dilution of 1∶3200 at room temperature for 1 h. After washed 3× in PBS, coverslips were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1∶500 in BSA for another 1 h, followed by three washes in PBS. Coverslips were further incubated with Hoechst (0.5 µg/ml) (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 5 min and washed in PBS. After the final PBS wash, coverslips were mounted onto glass microscope slides with mounting media (Dako, Denmark). Images were taken and processed in the Zeiss Axioplan 2E microscope, Hamamatsu monochrome digital camera, and OpenLab software.</p>
