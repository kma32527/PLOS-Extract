<abstract>
<p>Natural genetic transformation is widely distributed in bacteria and generally occurs during a genetically programmed differentiated state called competence. This process promotes genome plasticity and adaptability in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Transformation requires the binding and internalization of exogenous DNA, the mechanisms of which are unclear. Here, we report the discovery of a transformation pilus at the surface of competent <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> cells. This Type IV-like pilus, which is primarily composed of the ComGC pilin, is required for transformation. We provide evidence that it directly binds DNA and propose that the transformation pilus is the primary DNA receptor on the bacterial cell during transformation in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Being a central component of the transformation apparatus, the transformation pilus enables <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, a major Gram-positive human pathogen, to acquire resistance to antibiotics and to escape vaccines through the binding and incorporation of new genetic material.</p>

<p>Natural genetic transformation, first discovered in <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> by Griffith in 1928, is observed in many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. This process promotes genome plasticity and adaptability. In particular, it enables many human pathogens such as <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus</italic> or <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> to acquire resistance to antibiotics and/or to escape vaccines through the binding and incorporation of new genetic material. While it is well established that this process requires the binding and internalization of external DNA, the molecular details of these steps are unknown. In this study, we discovered a new appendage at the surface of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> cells. We show that this appendage is similar in morphology and composition to appendages called Type IV pili commonly found in Gram-negative bacteria. We demonstrate that this new pneumococcal pilus is essential for transformation and that it directly binds DNA. We propose that the transformation pilus is an essential piece of the transformation apparatus by capturing exogenous DNA at the bacterial cell surface.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Natural transformation, first discovered in <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Griffith1">[1]</xref>, is observed in many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Johnsborg1">[2]</xref>. It increases bacterial adaptability by promoting genome plasticity through intra- and inter-species genetic exchange <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Popa1">[3]</xref>. In <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, a major human pathogen responsible for severe diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis and septicemia, transformation is presumably responsible for capsular serotype switching and could therefore reduce the efficiency of capsule-based vaccines after a short period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Hiller1">[4]</xref>. In this species, it occurs during a genetically programmed and differentiated state called competence that is briefly induced at the beginning of exponential growth. During this competent state, pneumococci secrete a peptide pheromone called Competence-Stimulating-Peptide (CSP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Havarstein1">[5]</xref>, which spreads competence in the pneumococcal population. Interestingly, in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, some antibiotics and DNA-damaging agents induce competence, which would act as an alternative SOS response and ultimately increases bacterial resistance to external stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Prudhomme1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>During transformation, environmental DNA is bound at the surface of competent cells and transported through the cell envelope to the cytosolic compartment. This process has been mostly studied in the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> with additional information coming from studies in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Chen1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Claverys1">[8]</xref>. In both species, a DNA translocation apparatus mediates the transfer of DNA through the cellular membrane. In <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, it is composed of ComEA, EndA, ComEC and ComFA. Incoming double-stranded DNA would bind the membrane receptor ComEA. One DNA strand crosses the membrane through ComEC while the endonuclease EndA degrades the other strand. On the cytoplasmic side, ComFA, an ATPase that contains a helicase-like domain, would facilitate DNA internalization through ComEC. Once inside the bacterium, single-stranded DNA is either integrated into the chromosome by RecA-mediated homologous recombination or entirely degraded.</p>
<p>Strikingly, all transformable Gram-positive bacteria also carry a <italic>comG</italic> operon that resembles operons encoding Type IV pili and Type II secretion pseudopili in Gram-negative bacteria, as well as a gene encoding a prepilin peptidase homolog, <italic>pilD</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Chen1">[7]</xref>. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>comG</italic> and <italic>pilD</italic> genes are exclusively expressed in competent cells and are essential for transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Chen2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Dagkessamanskaia1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Peterson1">[11]</xref>. In <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, the <italic>comG</italic> operon encodes a putative ATPase (ComGA), a polytopic membrane protein (ComGB) and five prepilin candidates named ComGC, ComGD, ComGE, ComGF and ComGG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003473-g001">Figure 1A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003473.s004">table S1</xref>). By homology with Type IV pili, it is generally proposed that these proteins could be involved in the assembly of a transformation pseudo-pilus at the surface of competent cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Chen1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Claverys1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Kaufenstein1">[12]</xref>. So far, two studies show that a large macromolecular complex containing ComGC can be found at the surface of competent <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Chen2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Kaufenstein1">[12]</xref>. In this complex, ComGC subunits appear to be linked together by disulfide bridges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Chen2">[9]</xref>. All the other ComG proteins and the PilD homolog, ComC, are necessary for the formation of this complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Chen2">[9]</xref>. It was proposed that this complex could correspond to the transformation pseudo-pilus.</p>

<title>Genes potentially essential for transformation pilus assembly in <italic>S. pneumonia and</italic> prepilin sequences.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genes that are potentially essential in transformation pilus assembly. The <italic>comG</italic> operon contains 7 genes named <italic>comGA</italic> to <italic>comGG</italic>. A gene that encodes a pre-pilin peptidase homolog, <italic>pilD</italic>, is found elsewhere on the chromosome. The name used to designate the <italic>comG</italic> and <italic>pilD</italic> genes varies in different pneumoccocal strains. For clarity, we refer to the comG nomenclature used in B. subtilis. Names of the corresponding genes in different S. pneumoniae strains are found in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003473.s004">Table S1</xref>. (<bold>B</bold>) Alignment of the N-terminal extremity of the five possible prepilins show that ComGC, ComGD, ComGE and comGF contain a canonical prepilin cleavage motif (red rectangle) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Strom2">[20]</xref>. All four proteins also contain a conserved glutamic acid residue in position 5 after the cleavage site (red asterisk), a conserved feature of all Type IV pilins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Hansen1">[43]</xref>. ComGG has a degenerated peptidase motif and does not contain a conserved glutamic acid in position 5. Secondary structure predictions for the five proteins propose a N-terminal hydrophobic helix and a C-terminal soluble domain of variable size (not shown in the figure), the typical topology found in Type IV pilins.</p>

<p>Despite these first clues, no transformation appendage could be directly visualized at the surface of any competent Gram-positive bacterium. In addition, the function of the ComG proteins during transformation remains unclear. Mutations in the cytosolic ComGA protein abolish DNA binding at the surface of both <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Berge1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Briley1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Chung1">[15]</xref>. This strongly suggests that the ComGC-containing macromolecular complex detected at the surface of competent <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells could bind DNA. However, it was recently shown that ComGA is the only ComG protein essential to the initial DNA binding at the surface of competent <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Briley1">[14]</xref>. This protein would interact with an unknown DNA receptor at the surface of competent cells while the other ComG proteins would only be required at a later stage during transformation.</p>
<p>In this study, we provide the first direct evidence for the existence of a transformation pilus in a Gram-positive bacterium. We discovered a new appendage at the surface of competent pneumococci that we could visualize using immuno-fluorescence and electron microscopy. Competent cells harbor one or a few appendages that are morphologically similar to Type IV pili found in Gram-negative bacteria. We were able to purify this pilus and showed that it is essentially composed of the ComGC pilin. We also demonstrate that pilus assembly is required for transformation. As we provide direct evidence that the transformation pilus binds extracellular DNA, we propose it is the primary DNA receptor at the surface of competent pneumococci.</p>

<title>An extracellular appendage containing ComGC is detected at the surface of competent <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic></title>
<p>Mechanical shearing is frequently used to release bacterial surface appendages and to study their protein composition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Nunn1">[16]</xref>. To see if ComGC was part of a macromolecular complex at the surface of competent <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, we adapted the method to this bacterium and raised antibodies against the purified soluble domain of ComGC. Using this antibody, we showed that ComGC could be detected by immunoblotting in the sheared fraction of competent bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003473-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). While ComGC level in the cell fraction was not affected, no ComGC could be found in the sheared fraction in a <italic>comGA</italic> knockout mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003473-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). These data strongly suggest that ComGC is part of an extra-cellular appendage and that ComGA is necessary to its assembly.</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Detection of ComGC in the sheared and cellular fractions by immunoblot. ComGC was detected in the sheared fraction of reference (R1501) and ComGC-FLAG (RL001) competent strains. ComGC was not detected in the sheared fraction of cultures that were not competence-induced. Deletion of <italic>comGA</italic> completely abolished detection of the ComGC pilin in the sheared fraction in both reference and ComGC-FLAG strains. Substitution of the conserved glutamic acid in position 5 of the mature ComGC pilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003473-g001">Figure 1</xref>) by alanine (ComGC<sub>(E5V)</sub>) also completely abolished detection of ComGC in the sheared fraction. For the reference and ComGC<sub>(E5V)</sub> strains, detection of ComGC was performed with a polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against the soluble domain of ComGC. With the ComGC-FLAG strain, the FLAG-tagged pilin was detected by an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody.

<title>A ComGC-containing appendage is visualized at the surface of competent pneumococci</title>
<p>We inserted a FLAG tag at the C-terminus of ComGC to directly visualize the competence-induced appendages by immuno-fluorescence. It was not possible to insert the sequence encoding the tag at the <italic>comGC</italic> locus on the chromosome because <italic>comGC</italic> and <italic>comGD</italic> genes overlap in the <italic>comG</italic> operon. Therefore, a copy of <italic>comGC</italic> encoding a C-terminally FLAG-tagged ComGC (ComGC-FLAG) was integrated ectopically into the chromosome of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> under the control of a competence-induced promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Martin1">[17]</xref>. The transformation efficiency was not affected in this strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003473-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Using anti-FLAG antibodies, we could show by immuno-fluorescence that almost all the cells appeared to harbour one or a few ComGC foci or distinct fluorescent appendages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003473-g003">Figure 3A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003473.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Due to sample preparation, many broken appendages were also found in the background. No preferential location of the foci/appendages at the cell surface was observed. They are absent in <italic>comGA</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003473-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Note that anti-ComGC antibodies were not able to label the competent cells. They probably recognize epitopes that are masked when ComGC is included in the appendages.</p>

<title>Competence-induced appendage morphology and composition</title>
<p>Using electron microscopy, we observed filaments attached to the cell surface of negatively stained competent pneumococci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003473-g004">Figure 4A and B</xref>). These flexible filaments are 5–6 nm in diameter. Their length could reach up to 2–3 micrometers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003473-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). A maximum of 2–3 filaments per cell could be observed. Their average length was difficult to assess because they break easily into smaller fragments during sample preparation. Using the ComGC-FLAG expressing strain, we confirmed by immunogold-labelling that they contain ComGC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003473-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>Appendages were then purified using anti-FLAG affinity chromatography after mechanical shearing. Appendage fragments of between 50 and 500 nm in length were observed by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003473-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), showing that these filamentous structures do not disassemble during purification. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified fraction showed that ComGC is the major component of the appendages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003473-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Using whole protein mass profiling by high-resolution mass spectrometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-ChamotRooke1">[18]</xref>, we could only detect ComGC and ComGC-FLAG in the purified material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003473-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), confirming that ComGC is the major constituent of these appendages. Monoisotopic mass measurements of intact proteins and top-down fragmentation using a variety of activation techniques confirmed that the ComGC prepilin is cleaved after the alanine residue in position 15 and that the first amino acid of the mature protein is methylated, presumably by PilD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003473.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Indeed, PilD homologs in Gram-negative bacteria catalyze this post-translational modification of the Type IV pilins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Strom1">[19]</xref>. No other post-translational modification was detected in ComGC. Other proteins, including other ComG proteins, were not detected in the purified material by the methods used in this study. This suggests that these proteins are either absent, present in very low amount within the appendage or weakly bound to it and lost during sample preparation. These morphological and biochemical features are typical of Gram-negative Type IV pili. Therefore, we propose that the competence-induced appendage observed in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> belongs to the Type IV pilus family.</p>

<title>The competence-induced pili are required for transformation</title>
<p>It was important to determine whether these competence-induced pili were involved in transformation.

<title>Transformation pili bind extracellular DNA</title>
<p>The nature of the primary DNA receptor at the surface of transformable Gram-positive bacteria is not known. It is generally proposed that the transformation pseudopilus would bind extracellular DNA at the surface of competent Gram-positive bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Claverys1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Burton1">[21]</xref>. However, this hypothesis has never been confirmed experimentally. Using affinity purification, we show that DNA naturally released in the culture medium co-fractionates with the purified pili. No DNA could be found in the purified fraction in absence of the pilus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003473-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). These data were a first hint suggesting that DNA present in the environment could bind to the transformation pilus. However, it was not clear if this binding was related to the transformation process or fortuitous. By using specific electron microscopy methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Dupaigne1">[22]</xref>, we visualized DNA directly bound to the transformation appendage after adding linear double stranded DNA (dsDNA) to competent bacteria. Long stretches of dsDNA interacting with the transformation pilus were observed with clearly visible multiple contact points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003473-g006">Figure 6 B–E</xref>). Interestingly, it was extremely difficult to see DNA bound on the pilus in the reference bacteria (R1501 strain), which are known to internalize exogenous DNA quickly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Mejean1">[23]</xref>. On the other hand, in <italic>ComEC</italic> and <italic>comFA</italic> mutants, we could easily observe bound DNA on transformation pili. These strains are defective for DNA uptake and accumulate bound DNA at their surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Berge1">[13]</xref>. Given that the dsDNA was added in large excess, no difference between the reference and mutant strains should be observed if DNA binding on the pili was a coincidental event. The fact that the uncoupling of DNA binding and uptake processes facilitates the observation of the DNA/pilus interaction is a strong indication that DNA binding on the transformation pilus is related to the transformation process.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The <italic>comG</italic> operon is conserved in all transformable Gram-positive bacteria. This operon encodes proteins that are homologous to proteins involved in Type IV pilus assembly in Gram-negative bacteria. Therefore it has been proposed that a pilus (or pseudopilus) could be assembled at the surface of competent Gram-positive bacteria. Since all <italic>comG</italic> genes are essential for transformation, this pilus could be directly involved in transformation. The first biochemical clues for the existence of a transformation pilus were found in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> although decisive observational support was lacking. In addition, it was not clear if the ComGC-containing macromolecular complex found in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> was a common feature of competent Gram-positive bacteria or specific to this species. Finally, the function of this putative transformation pilus, and in general of the ComG proteins, was unclear.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Discovery of a new pneumococcal appendage</title>
<p>The pneumococcal transformation pilus represents a newly discovered pneumococcal surface structure. For a long time, no external appendage could be found at the surface of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> cells while many electron microscopy images were published in the literature. Recently, sortase-mediated pili have been discovered in some pathogenic <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Barocchi1">[24]</xref>. To our knowledge, no specific ultrastructural study of competent <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> has ever been described. Here, we analysed a laboratory strain that is commonly used to study the transformation process in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Dagkessamanskaia1">[10]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Berge1">[13]</xref>. In this strain, competence can be induced in a rapid and synchronous manner upon addition of synthetic CSP in the medium of an exponentially growing culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Havarstein1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Alloing1">[25]</xref>. To make sure that the appearance of the transformation pilus is a common feature of competent pneumococci and not a mere one-off property of our reference strain, we observed negatively stained G54 and CP strains by electron microscopy. The G54 strain is a wild-type clinical strain. The CP strain is a laboratory strain that has a different genetic background than our reference strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Pestova1">[26]</xref>. In both cases, transformation pili were observed at the surface of competent cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003473.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Therefore, we think that transformation pili are found at the surface of most, if not all, pneumoccocal strains, including clinical strains.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>The transformation pilus is a Type IV pilus</title>
<p>The pneumococcal transformation pilus is morphologically very similar to Type IV pili found in many Gram-negative bacteria. Its major component, the ComGC pilin, is cleaved and probably methylated by a PilD homolog. We therefore propose that the transformation pilus is a <italic>bona fide</italic> Type IV pilus. Since its length can reach up to 2–3 µm, we think that the “pseudo-pilus” appellation does not apply to the pneumococcal transformation appendage. By comparison, the type II secretion pseudo-pilus is just 50–100 nm long <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Campos1">[27]</xref>. The transformation pilus is the first Type IV pilus clearly observed in a Gram-positive bacterium. So far, Type IV pilus-dependent gliding motility had been described in <italic>Clostridium</italic> species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Varga1">[28]</xref>. However, no clear picture of this pilus was provided. A recent genomic study show the existence of numerous and diverse Type IV pilus-like operons in a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Imam1">[29]</xref>. This suggests that many other Type IV-like pili remain to be discovered in these bacteria. The conservation of <italic>comG</italic> operons argues in favor of the presence of a transformation pilus in all naturally transformable Gram-positive bacteria. However, species-specific variations in pilus length can be anticipated because of variations in thickness of the capsule and/or the cell wall.</p>
<sec id="s3b1">
<title>Pilus function</title>
<p>We envision the transformation pilus to act as a “DNA-trap” to capture DNA in the environment. In Gram-negative bacteria, Type IV pilus assembly is also essential for natural transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Craig1">[30]</xref>. It is proposed that this pilus interacts directly with DNA but the molecular details of this interaction remains enigmatic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Biswas1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Dougherty1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-vanSchaik1">[33]</xref>. No DNA binding protein could be identified in the pilus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Lang1">[34]</xref>. Recently a minor pilin, ComP, has been identified as a DNA receptor specific of genus-specific DNA uptake sequence (DUS) motifs in <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Cehovin1">[35]</xref>. Our data explicitly show that the pneumoccocal transformation pilus binds DNA. At this stage, it is not clear if this DNA binding ability is due to the physicochemical properties of the pilus and/or due to a yet undetected minor pilin. Interestingly, only ComGA homolog was found indispensable for initial DNA binding at the surface of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Briley1">[14]</xref>. These bacteria could assemble only short transformation pili that are not sufficient to bind DNA at the surface of the competent cells. An unknown DNA receptor that interacts with ComGA ATPase could be required for efficient DNA binding in this species. It is possible that the mechanism of initial DNA binding at the surface of competent Gram-positive bacteria vary.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b2">
<title>Pilus assembly and retraction</title>
<p>In Gram-negative bacteria, 12 to 15 proteins are necessary for Type IV pilus biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Carbonnelle1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Georgiadou1">[37]</xref>. The assembly of the pneumococcal transformation pilus could require the simplest Type IV pilus assembly apparatus discovered so far in bacteria. Indeed, only 7 ComG proteins might be sufficient to assemble this pilus. Strikingly, Type IV pili are retractile appendages in Gram-negative bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Merz1">[38]</xref>. It is therefore appealing to propose that the transformation pilus could retract to guide bound DNA through the cell wall and the polysaccharide capsule that is often present in bacteria (as in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>), and, ultimately deliver it to the ComEA/EndA complex located in the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Chen1">[7]</xref>. It is unlikely that this DNA would find its way along several hundreds of nanometers through the cell wall and capsule without pilus retraction. However, a dedicated ATPase called PilT powers pilus retraction in Gram-negative bacteria and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> genome does not encode any PilT homolog. All the <italic>comG</italic> operons that have been identified so far in Gram-positive bacteria encode only one ATPase, ComGA, that is required for the pilus assembly. Therefore, the possible retraction of the transformation pilus and role of ComGA in this process should be assessed.</p>
<p>Our data clearly establish the existence and function of a transformation pilus at the surface of competent pneumococci. As an essential component of the transformation apparatus, it enables this major human Gram-positive pathogen to acquire resistance to antibiotics and to escape vaccines through the binding and incorporation of new genetic material. Future work should establish whether transformation pili exist and play similar roles in other transformable pathogens. Intriguingly, ComG proteins also appear to play an important and direct role in phagosomal escape and virulence in <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003473-Rabinovich1">[39]</xref>. It would be interesting to determine whether they also assemble into a pilus to play this role.</p>

<p>Protein samples were desalted and eluted directly into a 10 µL spray solution of methanol∶water∶formic acid (75∶25∶3). Approximately 4 µL was loaded into a coated, medium sized, nano-ESI capillary (Proxeon) and introduced into an Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer, equipped with ETD module (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) using the off-line nanospray source in positive ion mode. A full set of automated positive ion calibrations was performed immediately prior to mass measurement. The transfer capillary temperature was lowered to 100°C, sheath and axillary gasses switched off and source transfer parameters optimised using the auto tune feature.
