<abstract>
<p>The type I interferons (IFN-Is) are critical not only in early viral control but also in prolonged T-cell immune responses. However, chronic viral infections such as those of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in humans and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in mice overcome this early IFN-I barrier and induce viral persistence and exhaustion of T-cell function. Although various T-cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors are known to contribute to induction of chronic conditions, the roles of IFN-I negative regulators in chronic viral infections have been largely unexplored. Herein, we explored whether 2′–5′ oligoadenylate synthetase-like 1 (OASL1), a recently defined IFN-I negative regulator, plays a key role in the virus-specific T-cell response and viral defense against chronic LCMV. To this end, we infected <italic>Oasl1</italic> knockout and wild-type mice with LCMV CL-13 (a chronic virus) and monitored T-cell responses, serum cytokine levels, and viral titers. LCMV CL-13-infected <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice displayed a sustained level of serum IFN-I, which was primarily produced by splenic plasmacytoid dendritic cells, during the very early phase of infection (2–3 days post-infection). <italic>Oasl1</italic> deficiency also led to the accelerated elimination of viremia and induction of a functional antiviral CD8 T-cell response, which critically depended on IFN-I receptor signaling. Together, these results demonstrate that OASL1-mediated negative regulation of IFN-I production at an early phase of infection permits viral persistence and suppresses T-cell function, suggesting that IFN-I negative regulators, including OASL1, could be exciting new targets for preventing chronic viral infection.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Chronic viral infections, such as those of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in humans, remain serious health problems worldwide, necessitating alternative targets/reagents for better treatment. Although the production of and/or response to type I interferon (IFN-I), a critical antiviral reagent, are known to be dysregulated in chronic viral infections, no serious effort has been performed to determine whether any host IFN-I negative regulator can importantly contribute to inducing and/or maintaining chronic viral infections. In this study, we used a mouse model of chronic viral infection, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, and asked whether 2′–5′ oligoadenylate synthetase-like 1 (OASL1), a recently defined IFN-I negative regulator, plays a key role in the viral defense against chronic LCMV infection. Our data show that OASL1 suppresses IFN-I production during very early phase of infection, thus inhibits efficient viral control and the induction of functional virus-specific T-cell response, permitting viral persistence. These results indicate that OASL1-mediated suppression of IFN-I production is a critical step for permitting chronic viral infection and suggest that IFN-I negative regulators, including OASL1, could be exciting new targets for preventing chronic viral infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) displayed on innate immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (Macs) sense pathogens by recognizing conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Lee1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Takeuchi1">[2]</xref>. Major trans-membrane PRRs that sense viruses are the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) such as TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9, and such cytosolic PRRs are retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) such as RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Barbalat1">[3]</xref>. Upon recognition of cognate ligands, these PRRs initiate various signaling pathways that lead to the production of inflammatory cytokines, including type I interferons (IFN-Is), such as IFN-αs/β, which are critical for inhibiting early viral replication in the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Barbalat1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Kawai1">[4]</xref>. Additionally, antigen-presenting cells (APCs), particularly DCs, up-regulate co-stimulatory molecules and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules upon viral sensing and induce the differentiation of effector T cells which are key adaptive immune cells required for later viral clearance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Iwasaki1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Iwasaki2">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>The host immune system can effectively induce virus-specific T-cell activation, expansion, and successful generation of memory T cells upon acute viral infections. However, the immune system cannot induce such response upon chronic viral infections such as those of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or Epstein Barr virus (EBV) in humans, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in mice. As a result, the hosts live with a persistent viral load throughout their life-spans and have fundamentally dysfunctional T cells that produce dampened effector cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Virgin1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-West1">[8]</xref>. Various virus-specific T-cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors have been known to contribute to inducing and/or maintaining the chronic conditions. Virus-specific T-cell-intrinsic factors include elevated expression of inhibitory receptors such as programmed death-1 (PD-1), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin protein-3 (TIM-3), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), and lymphocyte-activation gene-3 (LAG-3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Barber1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Jin2">[14]</xref>, whereas virus-specific T-cell-extrinsic factors include altered antigen presentation by impaired DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Abbas1">[15]</xref>, enhanced immune suppression by regulatory T (Treg) cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Ebinuma1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Vignali1">[17]</xref>, and increased immunosuppressive cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Brooks1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Ejrnaes1">[19]</xref> and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Alatrakchi1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Li1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition, suppression of IFN-I production and response could be a major contributing factor leading to the chronic condition. Suppression may be a result of the reduced number of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), a major cellular source of IFN-I upon various viral infections. Indeed, the numbers of pDCs are reduced in humans and mice during infections with HIV, HCV, EBV, and LCMV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Kanto1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Lee2">[27]</xref>. Alternatively, such suppression could be actively regulated by host- and virus-derived negative factors that act on diverse PRR-signaling components and two major transcription factors (TFs), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and IRF7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Richards1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Akhtar1">[30]</xref>, involved in IFN-I production as well as on IFN-I receptor signaling components involved in the IFN-I response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Richards1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Akhtar1">[30]</xref>. To overcome the dysregulated IFN-I production, IFN-I has been used clinically to treat patients infected with certain chronic viruses such as HCV. However, high dose and long-lasting IFN-I treatment is known to be necessary to achieve any therapeutic benefit, implying that there are some underlying mechanisms to negatively regulate the IFN-I response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Aghemo1">[31]</xref>. Therefore, whether host-derived IFN-I negative regulator plays any significant role in promoting viral persistence in the setting of chronic viral infection is quite an important question.</p>
<p>Recently, we showed that 2′–5′ oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-like 1 (OASL1), an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG), is a novel translation inhibitor of IRF7, the IFN-inducible IFN-I master TF, and negatively regulates robust IFN-I production during acute viral infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Lee3">[32]</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesized that OASL1 could suppress IFN-I production during chronic LCMV infection by inhibiting IRF7 production and permit persistent viral infection. In the present study, we show that <italic>Oasl1</italic> knockout (KO) mice displayed a sustained level of IFN-I during early viral infection with LCMV clone 13 (LCMV CL-13, a chronic virus), controlled viremia quickly and induced better functional T-cell responses compared with wild-type (WT) mice. In addition, we show that IRF7 protein expression was higher in virus-infected <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO spleen than in WT spleen and that IFN-I receptor signaling during this early period was necessary for accelerated viral control and the enhanced T-cell immune response in the <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice. These results indicate that OASL1-mediated negative regulation of IFN-I production at the early phase of the infection is critical in permitting viral persistence.</p>

<title>An accelerated control of viremia and a better virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell differentiation in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice upon chronic LCMV infection</title>
<p>To investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of OASL1 in T-cell differentiation and viral defense upon chronic viral infection, we infected both WT and <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice with LCMV CL-13 and monitored CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell numbers and phenotypes as well as viral titers in the blood for 35 days (d) post-infection (p.i.). The percentage of total CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) became much higher in KO mice than in WT mice (&gt;3-fold at 15 d p.i.) upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g001">Fig. 1A and 1B</xref>). In addition, the frequency of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing CD44 was maintained at a slightly higher percentage in KO mice than in WT mice after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g001">Fig. 1A and 1B</xref>). The CD44-expressing cells in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice at 35 d p.i. were mostly specific to various LCMV epitopes (approximately 80% of CD44<sup>+</sup> cells) (data not shown). Notably, the number of LCMV GP<sub>33–41</sub> (GP33) peptide-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was more strongly increased in KO mice compared with WT mice (&gt;10-fold at 15 d p.i., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g001">Fig. 1C and 1D</xref>). These results indicate that virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells undergo much more massive expansion in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice compared with WT mice.</p>

<p>Expression of PD-1 on GP33 peptide-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells did not appear to be significantly induced in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice after LCMV CL-13 infection, although WT mice exhibited strongly induced PD-1 expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g001">Figs. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003478.s001">S1A</xref>). CD127, a marker of memory T cells, was progressively up-regulated in KO mice but not in WT mice after initial downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g001">Figs. 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003478.s001">S1B</xref>). These data imply that CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses might also be better qualitatively in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice upon chronic viral infection. Remarkably, there was complete control of viremia in serum at 15 d p.i. in LCMV CL-13-infected <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice, but viremia remained continuously high in WT mice serum by 35 d p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>). Consistent with accelerated viral control in KO mice, the mice recovered rapidly from an initial loss in body weight, whereas WT mice did not recover after an even longer period of time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003478.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). As expected, <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice also controlled LCMV Armstrong (LCMV Arm, an acute strain of LCMV) infection much more quickly than WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003478.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Interestingly, the viral titers in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice at 4 and 9 d p.i. upon LCMV CL-13 infection were quite comparable to those in LCMV Arm-infected WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003478.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). The observation that <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice control the LCMV CL-13 infection as quickly as the WT mice control the LCMV Arm infection and the known fact that T-cell differentiation occurs efficiently in WT mice upon LCMV Arm infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Wherry1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Wherry2">[34]</xref>, together imply that rapid viral control in the blood of <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice upon LCMV CL-13 infection may be one of the major contributing factor for the enhanced CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell differentiation in the KO mice.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Efficient induction of functional virus-specific T cells in tissues and complete control of LCMV CL-13 in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice during the late phase of infection</title>
<p>We next asked whether the enhanced immune features observed in the blood from <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice were also present in tissues at a later phase of infection (more than 2 months p.i.). We included another tetramer specific to GP<sub>276–286</sub> (GP276), an immunodominant epitope other than GP33, to exclude the possibility that the T-cell responses were virus epitope-specific phenomena. Frequencies and numbers of both GP33- and GP276-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly higher at 75 d p.i. in the spleen and lung of <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice than in those of WT mice, whereas the frequencies and numbers of such T cells seemed to be lower in the liver of KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g002">Fig. 2A and 2B</xref>). The observation that a slightly lower number of virus-specific T cells in the liver (a nonlymphoid tissue) of <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice is not unusual because frequent antigen exposure to T-cell receptor of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the condition of chronic infection is known to enable virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to migrate preferentially into nonlymphoid tissues rather than lymphoid tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Wherry1">[33]</xref>. However, PD-1 expression levels in GP33- and GP276-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly lower in the spleen, lung, and liver of <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice than in those of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Furthermore, we observed much higher frequencies of virus-specific memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD127<sup>+</sup>) in all the tissues collected from KO mice at 75 d p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Even CD127<sup>+</sup> CD62L<sup>+</sup> central memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were easily detectable in the spleen of KO mice at 130 d p.i., but to a lesser extent in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Together, these results indicate that differentiation of virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells progresses more efficiently in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice than in WT mice during the late period of LCMV CL-13 infection.</p>

<p>To confirm whether virus-specific T cells in KO mice truly demonstrate better function, we assessed the ability of CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to produce effector cytokines such as IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and IL-2 at the individual cell level.

<p>Although viral titers in the spleen, lung, and liver of both WT and KO mice at 75 d p.i. were already below a detectable level, the titer in the kidney (a well-known life-long reservoir of chronic LCMV) was detectable, much less in KO mice than in WT mice, indicating better viral control in KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>, data not shown).

<title>The major contribution of virus-specific T-cell-extrinsic factors in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice to the expansion of virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells</title>
<p>In the next set of experiments, we attempted to clarify whether the better virus-specific T-cell responses in the absence of OASL1 protein were caused either by virus-specific T-cell-intrinsic change or T-cell-extrinsic change. We also wanted to investigate whether the expanded population of virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice was due to better proliferation or decreased apoptosis of such T cells. To address these questions, we employed LCMV GP<sub>33–41</sub> epitope-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice (P14 mice). After purifying Thy1.1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from naïve P14 mice, the P14 Thy1.1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were adoptively transferred into both naïve WT and <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice. The following day, recipient mice were infected with LCMV CL-13 and sacrificed 5 d p.i. when the virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell population expands enormously.</p>
<p>Identical virus-specific P14 CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells transferred into WT and KO mice displayed noticeably different responses after the chronic virus infection. The P14 donor cells exhibited approximately 3-fold more expansion in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice than in WT mice <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). When restimulated <italic>in vitro</italic> with cognate GP<sub>33–41</sub> peptide, P14 cells isolated from KO mice at 5 d p.i. generated many more cells co-producing effector cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, than those from WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). These results indicate that virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells respond better to viral antigens in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice both quantitatively and qualitatively. Collectively, these data show that unknown T-cell-extrinsic factors generated in the absence of OASL1 protein play a major role in inciting the donor P14 Thy1.1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to dramatically increase expansion and cytokine production at the early phase of LCMV CL-13 infection.</p>

<title>Prolonged IFN-I production in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice during the early phase of LCMV CL-13 infection as a T-cell-extrinsic factor</title>
<p>To explore which T-cell-extrinsic factors play major roles in the early rapid expansion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice, we measured the levels of major inflammatory cytokines in serum and those of co-stimulatory/MHC molecules expressed on splenic DCs during the early phase of LCMV CL-13 infection.

<title>Higher production of IRF7 protein but similar production of IRF3 in LCMV CL-13-infected <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice</title>
<p>We previously reported that <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO cells produce more IFN-I upon acute viral infection, which was caused by higher production of IRF7 proteins in KO cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Lee3">[32]</xref>. Thus, we next asked whether chronic LCMV infection also caused higher IRF7 protein production in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice to produce the sustained IFN-I. To this end, we first determined the tissue that had the highest IFN-I expression after LCMV CL-13 infection. Among the four tissues that we collected at 2 d p.i., at the time point when the IFN-I level in serum was clearly stronger in KO mice, the spleen showed the most dominant expression of IFN-I mRNA: a 20-fold more IFN-I mRNA signal compared with other tissues of both WT and KO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003478.s008">Fig. S8</xref>). Importantly, in the spleen, the IFN-I mRNA level was significantly higher (6- to 8-fold) in KO than in WT mice. Thus, we next focused on spleens to measure the expression of two major TFs responsible for IFN-I mRNA expression during early LCMV CL-13 infection. Upon LCMV CL-13 infection, as expected, IRF7 mRNA (but not IRF3 mRNA), similar to IFN-I mRNA and OASL1 mRNA, was strongly induced at 1 d p.i. and declined over the next several days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Similar to serum IFN-I levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO spleens expressed much more IFN-I mRNA during the declining several days. Consistent with our previous report that OASL1 specifically inhibits the translation of IRF7 mRNA upon viral infection, IRF7 protein levels were much higher in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO cells during the days, whereas IRF3 protein levels were similar between WT and KO spleens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). These results together indicate that the more production of IFN-I in the <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice during the early phase of LCMV CL-13 infection was caused by high production of IRF7 proteins in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we showed that <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice produced sustained level of IFN-I during the very early phase (2–3 d p.i.) of chronic LCMV CL-13 infection, cleared the virus quickly (earlier than 15 d p.i.) from the blood circulation, and induced rapid expansion of virus-specific effector T cells. We also showed that <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice cleared the virus even from the kidney, a place for long-lasting existence of LCMV CL-13, at the late phase of infection (by 130 d p.i.) and induced the production of polyfunctional virus-specific memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Furthermore, we showed that IFN-I receptor signaling during the very early stage of LCMV CL-13 infection was necessary for the higher T-cell number, efficient T-cell differentiation, and early viral control in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice.</p>
<p>The sustained production of IFN-I and more effective viral clearance in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice after chronic LCMV CL-13 infection observed in the present study resembles our previous observation that <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice are more resistant to acute infections with encephalomyocarditis virus and herpes simplex virus-1 and produce higher levels of IFN-I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Lee3">[32]</xref>. Because OASL1 is a specific translation inhibitor of IRF7, the IFN-inducible IFN-I master TF, the sustained and stronger expression of IFN-I in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice upon LCMV infection is thought to be caused by the release of such inhibition and effective activation of the more translated IRF7 protein in KO mice. Indeed, we observed that the IRF7 protein level in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice was much higher during the early phase of chronic LCMV CL-13 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Because most viruses induce IFN-I and in turn IRF7 expression and can activate the resulting IRF7 protein effectively, <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice are expected to be resistant to most viral infections that do not produce viral effectors to degrade the function of IRF7. Consistent with this expectation, <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice turned out to be more resistant to chronic LCMV CL-13 infection as well as acute LCMV Arm infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g001">Figs. 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003478.s003">S3</xref>), although LCMV is equipped with nucleoprotein (NP), a virus-derived IFN-I negative regulator that interferes with activation of IRF3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-MartinezSobrido1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-MartinezSobrido3">[44]</xref>. In both acute LCMV Arm and chronic LCMV CL-13 infections, OASL1 expression was similarly strongly induced (&gt;20-fold) during the very early phase of infection, and then declined gradually (1–4 d p.i.) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003478.s010">Fig. S10</xref>). However, at later time points (9–15 d p.i.), only with LCMV CL-13 infection, OASL1 expression was still marginally up-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003478.s010">Fig. S10</xref>), which would reflect the presence of viruses in the mice infected with LCMV CL-13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g001">Figs. 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003478.s003">S3</xref>). Therefore, as expected, the mRNA expression of OASL1 (as an ISG) is dominantly regulated by IFN-I induced upon viral infection.</p>
<p>The cellular source of IFN-I upon chronic LCMV CL-13 infection seems to include pDCs and other innate immune cell types such as cDCs and Macs as recently reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Macal1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Wang1">[46]</xref>. Among these cells, we showed in our study that the critical cellular source for the sustained and higher serum IFN-I level in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice at the early stage of infection (2 d p.i. when the IFN-I level in serum became clearly stronger in the KO mice than in WT mice) was pDCs (CD11c<sup>int</sup>B220<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+/−</sup>), although cDCs and Macs of <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice also produced significantly more IFN-I than those of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). However, IFN-I expression in these cells was not inversely correlated with OASL1 expression in these cells, indicating that other factors also affect the expression of IFN-I. The pDC-dominant IFN-I production in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice at the early stage of LCMV CL-13 infection could be explained by the differences in expressed viral sensors and in IRF7 expression levels among these cells, with the demonstrated role of OASL1 as a specific IRF7 translation inhibitor. It has been well known that cDCs and Macs express viral sensors such as TLR3 and RIG-I/MDA5 that sense dsRNA produced during viral replication, including that of the ssRNA virus LCMV, whereas pDCs dominantly express TLR7 that sense ssRNAs and TLR9 that sense DNAs among known viral sensors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-GonzalezNavajas1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Kawai2">[47]</xref>. Because the IRF7 expression level in pDCs is much higher than that in cDCs and Macs at a steady state (data not shown) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Dai1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Izaguirre1">[49]</xref>, and cell membrane-associated receptor TLR7 can sense the ssRNA viral genome directly even without viral replication upon LCMV infection, pDCs are expected to produce IFN-I initially by sensing the viral genome first and inducing activation of IRF7 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Kawai1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Macal1">[45]</xref>. After initial production of IFN-I, pDCs would amplify IFN-I production by inducing an IFN-I-mediated positive feedback signaling loop in an autocrine fashion, leading also to accumulation of IRF7 mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Kawai1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Honda1">[50]</xref>. In this later phase of IFN-I production, IRF7 protein levels would be much higher in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO pDCs than in WT pDCs because OASL1 protein derived from <italic>Oasl1</italic> mRNA induced by the IFN-I-mediated positive feedback signaling loop would inhibit IRF7 translation in WT cells. Thus, <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO pDCs could produce much higher levels of IFN-I at the very early stage of LCMV infection: we observed a more than 8-fold higher IFN-I level in KO cells than in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003478-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to reducing viral titers during the early phase of viral infection, such a sustained level of IFN-I in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice might act directly and indirectly on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to enhance their numbers and function. IFN-I receptor signaling in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells triggered by the sustained IFN-I level in KO mice appears to be critical for the massive expansion of virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, given that such signaling in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is known to prevent apoptosis of T cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, allowing clonal expansion and differentiation upon viral infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Curtsinger1">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Pinto1">[56]</xref>. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells could also be a direct target for IFN-I in KO mice because IFN-I was reported to act directly on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to sustain their clonal expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-HavenarDaughton1">[57]</xref> and promote Th1 differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Huber1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Strengell1">[60]</xref>. In addition to the direct IFN-I effect on T cells, IFN-I was reported to enhance the function of DCs by inducing maturation, such as upregulation of costimulatory molecules and MHC class molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Gallucci1">[61]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Montoya1">[63]</xref>. However, a sustained and increased level of IFN-I in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice does not seem to critically affect DC maturation in the setting of chronic LCMV infection because there was no apparent difference in the expression of costimulatory molecules and MHCs in DCs isolated from WT and <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003478.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). The level of IFN-I produced in WT mice could be sufficient to induce DC maturation, and its higher and sustained level in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice might not create any additional effects on DC maturation. It would be interesting, in the future, to determine whether other types of cells influenced by IFN-I also contribute to the better virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell response observed in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice.</p>
<p>The complete elimination of chronic virus and efficient induction of the adaptive immune response in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice observed in this study is extraordinary because WT mice infected with chronic LCMV CL-13 suffer from a sustained viral load throughout their life spans and have fundamentally dysfunctional T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Wherry2">[34]</xref>. There has been considerable number of molecules known to significantly affect viral persistence like an OASL1. For example, functional blockage of IL-10, a well-known immunosuppressive molecule, during the chronic phase of LCMV CL-13 infection reduced viral load; IL-21 receptor signaling in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was critical for limiting LCMV viral load <italic>in vivo</italic>; IL-7, the major T-cell survival factor, enhanced LCMV viral clearance; the functional blockage of PD-1, a T-cell-intrinsic signaling inhibitor, led to LCMV viral load reduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Ejrnaes1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Elsaesser1">[64]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Pellegrini1">[66]</xref>. However, most of these previously characterized molecules, if not all, are not related directly to IFN-I production and its regulation but are mostly involved in controlling adaptive immune responses. Therefore, our report demonstrating the critical role of OASL1, as a direct negative regulator of IFN-I production, in permitting chronic viral persistence is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of a role of any host IFN-I negative regulator in viral clearance in the setting of chronic infection.</p>
<p>The negative role of OASL1, as an IFN-I negative regulator, in viral clearance suggests that inhibition of the expression/function of OASL1 or IFN-I treatment during the early phase of chronic viral infections could prevent viral persistence. Indeed, a recent study showed that IFN-I treatment in WT mice at 3 d and 5 d p.i. (when the IFN-I level is downregulated after its initial peak) after LCMV CL-13 infection dramatically reduced the LCMV viral load and promoted virus-specific CD8 T-cell responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Wang1">[46]</xref>. This observation is consistent with our data that a sustained level of IFN-I at approximately 2–4 d p.i. in <italic>Oasl1</italic> KO mice led to rapid control of viremia and functional virus-specific T-cell responses. However, in the previous study, IFN-I treatment in WT mice later than 1 week of infection did not have any meaningful effect on viral load <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Wang1">[46]</xref>, suggesting that the timing of IFN-I treatment is critical for controlling viremia and restoring the T-cell response and that other factors may degrade IFN-I-mediated responses. Given that the ineffectiveness of exogenous IFN-I at the later phase of chronic virus infection, it is worthwhile to note that <italic>Oasl1</italic> expression in pDCs was still sustained at a later phase (30 d p.i.) of chronic LCMV CL-13 infection but not of acute LCMV Arm infection, whereas <italic>Ifna/b1</italic> expression in the pDCs returned to the basal level by that phase in both LCMV infections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003478.s011">Fig. S11</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that, at the later phase of chronic viral infection, exogenously administered IFN-I itself is not sufficient to induce an adequate level of IFN-I production for viral clearance because the production of IRF7 protein, the key player necessary for going through the IFN-I-mediated positive feedback signaling loop, would still be inhibited by OASL1 protein. In this regard, suppression of OASL1 function or expression during the chronic phase of LCMV infection may help to eliminate the virus by releasing OASL1-mediated suppression of IFN-I production, although we cannot exclude the possibility that other factors, including other IFN-I negative regulators, still promote viral persistence.</p>
<p>Our results showing that reversal of the defective production of IFN-I during chronic virus infection by nullifying OASL1 can inhibit viral persistence raise the possibility that inhibiting the functions of other negative regulators acting on the process of IFN-I production and/or IFN-I receptor signaling pathways would improve the host defense against chronic viral infections. Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin 1), which induces degradation of IRF3 protein, and two ubiquitin E3 ligases, tripartite motif-containing 21 (TRIM21) and RTA-associated ubiquitin ligase (RAUL), which induce the degradation of both IRF3 and IRF7 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Richards1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Yu1">[67]</xref>, are host factors more directly involved in negatively regulating IFN-I production. Negative host factors involved in IFN-I receptor signaling pathways include inhibitors of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway downstream of the IFN-I receptor such as Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS), Src homology 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP), and protein inhibitors of activated STAT (PIAS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Naka1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Shuai1">[69]</xref>. Because most of the currently known negative factors not only regulate IFN-I but also other cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003478-Richards1">[28]</xref>, OASL1 is a rather unique host negative factor regulating IFN-I production that specifically functions in IRF7 protein production. In the future, a combinatorial approach for controlling the expression and/or function of OASL1 and regulating diverse other targets might be worthy of investigation. However, blockade of virus-encoded IFN-I suppressors may also be necessary for these approaches to be more effective.</p>
