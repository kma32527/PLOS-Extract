<abstract>
<p>The signaling of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) induces host defense against microbial invasion. Protein posttranslational modifications dynamically shape the strength and duration of the signaling pathways. It is intriguing to explore whether de-SUMOylation could modulate the TLR signaling. Here we identified SUMO-specific protease 6 (SENP6) as an intrinsic attenuator of the TLR-triggered inflammation. Depletion of SENP6 significantly potentiated the NF-κB-mediated induction of the proinflammatory genes. Consistently, SENP6-knockdown mice were more susceptible to endotoxin-induced sepsis. Mechanistically, the small ubiquitin-like modifier 2/3 (SUMO-2/3) is conjugated onto the Lysine residue 277 of NF-κB essential modifier (NEMO/IKKγ), and this impairs the deubiquitinase CYLD to bind NEMO, thus strengthening the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) activation. SENP6 reverses this process by catalyzing the de-SUMOylation of NEMO. Our study highlights the essential function of the SENP family in dampening TLR signaling and inflammation.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Given the double-edged nature of the TLR functions, the strength and duration of the TLR signaling are dynamically modulated via protein posttranslational modifications, which ensure that the invading microbes are quickly eliminated and the damages to the host are reduced to the minimum. Besides the ubiquitin, ubiquitin-like proteins are emerging as novel protein tags to fine-tune the TLR signaling. It is intriguing to explore how the SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs) contributes to balancing the SUMOylation status of the TLR signaling. Our study reveals that NEMO, a critical protein of the TLR signaling pathways, is covalently modified by SUMO-2/3. This modification is resversed by the de-SUMOylation activity of SENP6. Thus, SENP6 faciliates CYLD to bind NEMO and to remove the polyubiquitin chains on NEMO, ultimately dampening the IKK activation. This study sheds new light on the dynamic functions of the SUMOylation in restricting proinflammatory response.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Toll like receptors (TLRs) are a family of membrane receptors that sense a wide range of invading pathogens, including bacteria, fungi and viruses. Upon activation, TLRs trigger innate immune responses and prime the adaptive immune system to eliminate the pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Kawai1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Medzhitov1">[2]</xref>. However, the excessive activation of TLR signaling causes injuries to the host (inflammation and autoimmune diseases) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Cook1">[3]</xref>. Thus, the TLR signaling pathways are subjected to stringent regulations spatially and temporally.</p>
<p>TLR signaling triggers the activation of NF-κB, interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs) and activator protein 1 (AP-1). These transcriptional factors coordinate to induce the expression of a broad range of proteins important in the immune and inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Beutler1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Akira1">[5]</xref>. TLR-mediated activation of NF-κB depends on the activity of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) kinase (IKK) complex. The IKK complex is composed of two related catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, NF-κB essential modifier (NEMO/IKKγ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Karin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Zandi1">[7]</xref>. Although NEMO does not display catalytic activity, it is indispensable for the activation of the IKKα/β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Israel1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Rothwarf1">[9]</xref>. Recent studies propose that NEMO contains the unique ubiquitin-binding domain, which recognizes the K63-linked and linear polyubiquitin chains and triggers IKK activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Wu1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Laplantine1">[11]</xref>. Intriguingly, NEMO <italic>per se</italic> is modified by the polyubiquitin chain, which is also critical for the IKK activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Tang1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Tokunaga1">[13]</xref>. Notably, the deubiquitinase CYLD could interact with NEMO and cleave these polyubiquitin chains, thus acting as a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Kovalenko1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, NEMO and IκBα are dynamically modified by SUMO-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Huang1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Desterro1">[16]</xref>. The SUMO-1 modification of IκBα makes it resistant to the signal-induced degradation. It is intriguing to understand the potential function of the SUMOylation of NEMO, in particular, to address the synergistic or antagonistic effect between the ubiquitination and SUMOylation of NEMO. Futhermore, it remains unknown whether NEMO could be modified by SUMO-2/3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Israel2">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Like ubiquitination, SUMOylation is a dynamic process, which involves three classes of enzymes: E1 activating enzyme (SAE1/SAE2), E2 conjugating enzyme (Ubc9) and possibly E3 ligases. SUMOylation is reversed by a family of sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Hay1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-GeissFriedlander1">[19]</xref>. SENP family has six members (SENP1-3 &amp; SENP5-7), each of which exhibits distinct expression patterns and substrate specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Mukhopadhyay1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Yeh1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>Much is known about the biological functions of SENP1 and SENP2. For example, SENP1 and SENP2 could process newly synthesized SUMOs into their mature forms. SENP1 plays critical roles in the hypoxic responses, by reversing the SUMOylation of HIF1α and impairing the VHL protein to bind HIF1α, thus stabilizing HIF1α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Cheng1">[22]</xref>. SENP2 modulates adipogenesis by the de-SUMOylation and stabilization of C/EBPβ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Chung1">[23]</xref>. SENP2 is essential for suppressing the polycomb group protein-mediated gene silencing, via targeting Pc2/CBX4, during embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Kang1">[24]</xref>. However, the physiological functions of the other SENPs are largely unknown, and this represents an emerging frontier for further investigation.</p>
<p>In this study, we report that SUMO-2/3 are conjugated onto the Lysine residue 277 of NEMO. This modification prevents the deubiquitinase CYLD from binding to NEMO and thus strengthens the IKK activation. SENP6 specifically reverses this process by catalyzing the de-SUMOylation of NEMO. Knockdown of SENP6 significantly potentiates the TLR-mediated induction of the proinflammatory genes. The <italic>in vivo</italic> ‘knockdown’ of SENP6 by siRNA confirms its critical role in tolerance to LPS in endotoxic shock models. This study reveals the essential function of SENP6 for dampening TLR-induced inflammation, shedding new light on the dynamic functions of the SUMOylation in innate immunity.</p>

<title>Identification of SENP6 as a novel regulator of TLR signaling</title>
<p>To probe the potential function of the SUMO-specific proteases, we screened out individual siRNAs, which respectively diminish the expression of the corresponding SENPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g001">Fig. 1A, 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003480.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). An RNAi-based screening showed that the depletion of SENP6, rather than other members of the SENP family, apparently enhanced the TNF-α-induced activation of the κB-luciferase reporter and the E-selectin-luciferase reporter, which are both tightly regulated by NF-κB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Likewise, the activation of κB-luciferase reporter was apparently boosted upon SENP6 depletion in response to TLR4, TLR3 or TLR7 signaling in RAW264.7 cells when stimulated with extracellular LPS, poly (I:C), imiquimod (R837), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>

C, SENP6 potentiates TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. 5×κB-luciferase (left panel) or E-selectin-luciferase (right panel) and pTK-Renilla reporters were transfected into HEK293T cells together with the indicated siRNA. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for eight hours before luciferase reporter assays were performed. D, SENP6 potentiates TLR-triggered NF-κB activation. The nonspecific control (N.C.) or SENP6 siRNA were transfected into RAW264.7 cells with 5×κB-luciferase and pTK-Renilla reporters. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with LPS (1 µg/mL), poly (I:C) (50 µg/ml), R837 (10 µg/ml) for 8 h before luciferase assays were performed. E, SENP6 has no effect on the NF-κB activation in response to DNA damage. HEK293T cells were transfected with 5×κB-luciferase and pTK-Renilla reporters together with the nonspecific control (N.C.), SENP6 siRNA or SENP2 siRNA. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with doxorubicin (500 ng/ml) for eight hours before luciferase reporter assays were performed. F, SENP6 has no influence on the activation of AP-1. HEK293T cells were transfected with AP-1-luc and pTK-Renilla reporters together with the nonspecific control (N.C.) or SENP6 siRNA. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with PMA (20 ng/ml) for eight hours before luciferase reporter assays were performed.

<p>A recent study suggested that SENP2 could potentially inhibit the NF-κB activation in response to DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Lee1">[25]</xref>, which is confirmed by us (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). However, silencing of SENP6 apparently displayed no effect on the genotoxic-stress-induced NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Neither could SENP6 influence the PMA-induced activation of the AP-1-luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>). These data suggest that SENP6 may play a negative regulatory role for TLR signaling.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Knockdown of SENP6 potentiates TLR-mediated NF-κB activation</title>
<p>To substantiate, we explored the effect of SENP6 knockdown on the expression of the endogenous NF-κB-responsive genes induced by LPS, using qPCR (quantitative PCR) and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). As expected, SENP6 knockdown markedly potentiated the induction of the NF-κB-responsive genes (<italic>IL-6</italic>, <italic>TNF-α</italic>, and <italic>ICAM-1</italic>), whereas SENP7 knockdown displayed no such effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003480.s002">Fig. S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003480.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). In contrast, the induction of IRF3-responsive genes (<italic>ISG15</italic> and <italic>ISG56</italic>) was unaffected by SENP6 depletion upon LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003480.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). Consistently, in response to poly (I:C) or Sendai virus stimulation, knockdown of SENP6 resulted in augmented production of NF-κB-targeted cytokines as well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003480.s003">Fig. S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003480.s005">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>

<title>SENP6 negatively regulates TLR4-induced NF-κB signaling.</title>
<p>A, Loss of SENP6 promotes LPS-induced NF-κB-responsive genes. MEF cells transfected with the indicated siRNAs were incubated with LPS (1 µg/mL) for the indicated time periods. Induction of <italic>IL-6</italic>, <italic>TNF-α</italic>, and <italic>ICAM-1</italic> mRNA was measured by quantitative PCR. B, Catalytic activity of SENP6 is required for its action in TLR signaling. MEF cells were transfected with the nonspecific control (N.C.) or SENP6 siRNA and then rescued with the indicated siRNA-resistant SENP6 constructs. After LPS (1 µg/mL) stimulation, induction of <italic>IL-6</italic> mRNA was measured by quantitative PCR. C, SENP6 has no effects on LPS-induced auto-ubiquitination of TRAF6. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous TRAF6 from lysates of LPS-treated MEF cells transfected with the nonspecific control (N.C.) or SENP6 siRNA, followed by immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. D, SENP6 knockdown enhances the phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB p65. Immunoblot analysis of phosphorylated (p-) IκBα, NF-κB p65 and JNK in WT and SENP6 knockdown MEFs stimulated with LPS (1 µg/mL). E, RNAi of SENP6 accelerates the nuclear translocation of p65. Immunofluorescence microscopy of NF-κB p65 (red) in WT and SENP6 knockdown MEF cells stimulated with LPS (1 µg/mL); nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 50 µm. Original magnification, ×63. Data in A–B are presented as means ± S.D. from three independent experiments. *, P&lt;0.05; **, P&lt;0.01.</p>

<p>To rule out the potential off-target effects of the SENP6 siRNA, we generated several RNA interference (RNAi)-resistant SENP6 constructs, namely rSENP6 WT and rSENP6 C1030S (the catalytically inactive mutant which loses the de-SUMOylation activity, see below), in which silent mutations were introduced into the sequence targeted by the siRNA without changing the amino acid sequence of the corresponding proteins. MEF cells were first transfected with control or SENP6 siRNAs, followed by transfection of the control or indicated rSENP6 plasmids, respectively. Then, the induction of <italic>IL-6</italic> mRNA was measured after LPS stimulation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, the up-regulation of the <italic>IL-6</italic> mRNA, in SENP6 knockdown cells, was reversed by introducing rSENP6 WT. But this is not reversed by rSENP6 C1030S. Collectively, these data indicate that SENP6 negatively modulates TLR-mediated NF-κB signaling, and this is dependent on its de-SUMOylation activity.</p>
<p>To further elucidate the signaling node targeted by SENP6, we observed that LPS-induced TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination was not affected by endogenous SENP6 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). In contrast, knockdown of SENP6 led to an apparent increase in the phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB p65, but not that of JNK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Consistently, the nuclear translocation of p65, induced by LPS, was markedly accelerated when depleting the SENP6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). In addition, we observed that exogenous expression of MyD88, TRAF6 or IKKβ could respectively activate the κB-luciferase reporters, and these activations were markedly potentiated when knocking down SENP6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003480.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). In contrast, SENP6 knockdown had no effect on the activation of the κB-luciferase reporter, when cells were stimulated with the exogenous p65 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003480.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). Given the hierarchical relationships among these signaling molecules, we reasoned that SENP6 modulates NF-κB activation around the IKK protein complex.</p>

<title>NEMO/IKKγ is specifically modified by SUMO-2/3</title>
<p>Biochemically, SENP6 has been characterized to preferentially remove SUMO-2/3 from the pseudo-substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Mukhopadhyay1">[20]</xref>. Given the observation that SENP6 modulates the NF-κB signaling via its de-SUMOylation activity, we hypothesized that the IKK complex is a target for the SUMO-2/3 modification. To explore this possibility, IKKα, IKKβ or NEMO was respectively co-expressed with SUMO-3 in HEK293T cells. The cell lysates were subjected to the denaturing immunoprecipitation of Flag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) or the Ni-NTA pulldown of His-SUMO-3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003480.s007">Fig. S7A</xref>). Then the precipitates were probed with the indicated antibodies. Apparently, NEMO was robustly modified by SUMO-3, whereas neither IKKα nor IKKβ could be modified by SUMO-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g003">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003480.s007">Fig. S7A</xref>).</p>

<title>NEMO is modified on K277 by SUMO-2/3.</title>
<p>A, NEMO, rather than IKKα or IKKβ, is modified by SUMO-3 in an overexpression system. Flag-IKKα, IKKβ or NEMO were individually transfected into HEK293T cells along with HA-SUMO-3. Cell lysates were subjected to denaturing immunoprecipitation with Flag antibody and then immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. B, Either SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 could be attached to NEMO. Flag-NEMO was co-transfected into HEK293T along with HA-SUMO-2 or HA-SUMO-3. Cell lysates were subjected to denaturing immunoprecipitation with Flag antibody and then immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. C, The SUMOylation of NEMO is independent of its IKK-binding domain. Expression vectors for Flag-NEMO and its mutants as shown in upper panel were transfected into 293T cells along with HA-SUMO-3 (lower panel). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with Flag antibody and then immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. KBD, IKK-binding domain; CC1 and CC2, coiled-coil domain 1 and 2; LZ, leucine-zipper motif; ZF, zinc-finger domain. D, Endogenous NEMO is covalently modified by endogenous SUMO-2/3. After mock or LPS (1 µg/ml) stimulation, lysates from RAW264.7 cells were immunoprecipitated with NEMO antibody or control IgG and then immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. The intensity of the SUMOylated NEMO was quantified and normalized to that of the corresponding immunoprecipitated NEMO. The relative levels of SUMOylated NEMO are shown as fold change compared with the control. E, K277 was the major acceptor site on NEMO for SUMO-3. HEK293T cells were transfected with Flag-NEMO or its mutants along with HA-SUMO-3. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with Flag antibody and then immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. F, K277 of NEMO is sufficient for the SUMO-3 modification. HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with Flag antibody and then immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.</p>

Additionally, this modification took place in a IKKα and IKKβ-independent manner, as deletion of the N-terminal IKK-binding domain of NEMO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-May1">[26]</xref> did not affect the SUMOylation of NEMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Furthermore, endogenous NEMO was confirmed to be SUMOylated as the above observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). Interestingly, the SUMOylation of NEMO was markedly enhanced when stimulated respectively with LPS (TLR4 agonist), poly (I:C) (TLR3 agonist), or imiquimod R837 (TLR7 agonist) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g003">Fig. 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003480.s008">Fig. S8</xref>). Taken together, these data indicated that exogenously expressed and endogenous NEMO can be targeted for SUMO-2/3 modification.</p>
<p>A highly conserved motif ΨKxD/E (where Ψ is a hydrophobic residue and x represents any residue) has been proposed as the SUMOylation sites for any given substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-GeissFriedlander1">[19]</xref>. We uncovered three putative SUMO conjugation sites on NEMO(K139, 277 and 285) through bioinformatics analysis. Then, we carried out a systematic lysine (K) to alanine (A) mutation scanning to identify the potential SUMOylation sites on NEMO. SUMO-3 was expressed along with the NEMO constructs harboring different K to A point mutations, followed by IP or Ni-NTA pulldown analysis. Whereas NEMO K139A and NEMO K285A were SUMOylated as well as the wild-type NEMO, the SUMOylation of the NEMO K277A was almost abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g003">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003480.s007">Fig. S7C</xref>), indicating that the K277 was the major acceptor site on NEMO for SUMO-3.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we generated the NEMO (3A) mutant, in which all of the three lysines (139, 277 and 285) were mutated to alanines. As expected, NEMO (3A) could barely be modified by SUMO-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g003">Fig. 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003480.s007">Fig. S7D</xref>). On the background of this NEMO (3A) mutant, we generated three more NEMO mutants (K139, K277 or K285 respectively), in which a lysine residue was re-introduced back to the original site. We observed that, only when K277 was re-installed into the NEMO (3A) mutant could the SUMOylated band re-appeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g003">Fig. 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003480.s007">Fig. S7D</xref>).

<title>SENP6 catalyzes the de-SUMOylation on the NEMO K277</title>
<p>Given that NEMO could be modified by SUMO-2/3, we speculated that the SUMOylated NEMO is a potential substrate of SENP6. To address this possibility, we analysed the catalytic center of the SENP family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003480.s009">Fig. S9A</xref>) and generated several SENP6 point mutants. The SENP6 C1030S (Cys to Ser mutation at 1030 residue) is the catalytically inactive mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Dou1">[27]</xref>; whereas the SENP6 D1029E (Asp to Glu mutation at 1029 residue) is the catalytically active one, serving as a control.</p>
<p>A cell-based de-SUMOylation assay was performed to determine whether SENP6 could deconjugate the SUMOylated NEMO. The indicated SENP6, SENP3 or SENP7 construct was individually co-transfected with NEMO and SUMO-3.

Then the precipitates were probed with the indicated antibodies. As expected, NEMO was robustly SUMOylated in the presence of SUMO-3. Notably, this modification was drastically reduced by the expression of SENP6. In contrast, SENP6 C1030S, SENP3 as well as SENP7 could not influence the SUMOylation status of NEMO. In addition, SENP6 D1029E decreased the NEMO SUMOylation similar to that of the SENP6 (WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003480.s009">Fig. S9B</xref>).</p>

<p>We went on to investigate whether SENP6 can remove the SUMO-3 modification on the NEMO K277. As expected, the NEMO K277 (see above) was modified by SUMO-3, as well as that of the NEMO (WT). Notably, the conjugation of SUMO-3 onto the K277 of NEMO was almost completely abolished in the presence of SENP6 (WT). In contrast, SENP6 C1030S could not influence the SUMOylation status of the NEMO K277 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Furthermore, knocking down endogenous SENP6 could enhance the basal SUMOylation of Flag-NEMO, whereas knocking down endogenous SENP3 displayed no such effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Consistently, SENP6 knockdown apparently potentiated the SUMOylation of the endogenous NEMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Given the critical functions of TLR signalings in immunity, they are stringently modulated in a multi-layered and highly-ordered manner, so as to ensure that the strength and duration of the TLR signal is appropriate for any given immune response. The dynamic regulations are mainly realized by the protein post-translational modifications, in response to the intrinsic and environmental cues.</p>
<p>Besides phosphorylation, it is recently well established that TLR signaling molecules (TRAFs, RIPs, IRAKs, IKKs, IκBs, Rels, IRFs) are extensively regulated by ubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Wertz1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Liu1">[30]</xref>. To counterbalance, A20, CYLD, OTUB1, OTUB2, Cezanne, and YopJ are implicated in promoting the de-ubiquitination of these signaling proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Kovalenko1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Wertz2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Enesa1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Zhou1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Li1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Sun1">[35]</xref>. However, it remains a great challenge to elucidate <italic>in vivo</italic>, the functional relationship among these modifications, as well as the corresponding molecular mechanisms of the conformational switches. Interestingly, SUMO, the ubiquitin-like protein, is also emerging as the active modulator of the TLR signaling. For example, SUMO-1 could covalently attach itself onto TANK upon TLR7 stimulation, and this relieves the inhibition of TANK towards TLR7 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Renner1">[36]</xref>. In addition, previous studies demonstrated that SENP1 and SENP2 could regulate the activation of IRF8 and IRF3, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Chang1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Ran1">[38]</xref>. It remains to address the functions and mechanisms of the de-SUMOylation in TLR signaling. In particular, the physiological functions of other SENPs are largely unknown and this represents an evolving frontier for further investigation.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that SENP6 negatively regulates TLR-induced NF-κB signaling. Several lines of evidence substantiate this claim. (a) Knockdown of SENP6 results in the potentiation of the expression of the NF-κB-responsive genes induced by LPS; this effect is reversed by exogenously expressing siRNA-resistant SENP6. (b) Consistently, <italic>in vivo</italic> ‘knockdown’ of SENP6 induces more proinflammatory cytokines and accelerates the death rate of the mice in the endotoxic shock model. (c) The action of SENP6 is dependent on its enzymatical activity. (d) Notably, we observe that NEMO could be modified by SUMO-2/3 <italic>in vitro and in vivo</italic>. This modification is mapped onto the lysine residue 277 of NEMO (IKKγ). (e) Mechanistically, the SUMOylation of NEMO impairs the deubiquitinase CYLD to bind NEMO, and this prevents CYLD from removing polyubiquitin chains from NEMO, thus potentiating the IKK activation. (f) To counterbalance, SENP6 selectively interacts with the SUMOylated NEMO, but not with the unmodified NEMO. Consequently, SENP6 catalyzes the de-SUMOyaltion on the K277 of NEMO.</p>
<p>Since IKKα/β interact with the N-termini of NEMO, the SUMOylation of NEMO does not influence the binding affinity among IKKα/β/γ. In addition, the NEMO SUMOylation site does not overlap with its CYLD-binding domain. However, the SUMOylation effectively impairs the interaction between NEMO and CYLD, suggesting that the SUMO-moiety (∼12 kDa) might directly mask the binding surface. Another possibility is that the SUMOylation triggers a corresponding conformational change on NEMO, thus abolishing their interaction. Interestingly, SENP6 displays weak affinity towards SUMO-3 alone. We speculate that the selectivity of SENP6 to the SUMOylated NEMO may be initated by interaction bewteen SUMO-3 and SENP6, and this is further consolidated by the conformational change induced by the SUMOylation, which probably forms a new binding surface on NEMO. Future structural analysis will hopefully provide insights to the putative mechanism. Taken together, our study reveals that NEMO is modified by SUMO-2/3. This modification synergizes the polyubiquitination of NEMO and the activation of IKK kinases, via preventing the access of CYLD to the IKK complex. To counterbalance, SENP6 reverses this synergy between the SUMOylation and ubiquitination of NEMO, via removing SUMO-3 from NEMO, thus facilitating the recruitment of CYLD and attenuating the IKK activation (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003480-g007">Fig. 7E</xref>).</p>
<p>Our current model of the SENP6 action substantiates the dynamic function of the ubiquitination in regulating IKK activation, establishing a functional link between the ubiquitination and SUMOylation. SUMOylation could promote or antagonize the ubiquitination of a given substrate, depending on the topology of the modification sites. For example, the SUMOylation of HIF1α induced by hypoxia leads to its polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation, whereas IκBαmodified by SUMO-1 is resistant to ubiquitin-mediated degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Desterro1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Cheng1">[22]</xref>. To our knowledge, SENP6 represents the first case that the de-SUMOylation facilitates the binding of a specific deubiquitinase.</p>
<p>The SUMO modification is highly dynamic, and it is catalyzed antagonistically by SUMO E2/E3 ligases and SENPs. It is not known about the identity of the potential E3 that catalyzes the SUMO-2/3 conjugation onto NEMO. It is speculated that Ubc9 (E2) is sufficient for this conjugation. SENP6 catalyzes the deconjugation of SUMO-3 from NEMO. In contrast, SENP1, SENP2 or SENP3 did not influence NEMO SUMOylation. Neither could any of them modulate the NF-κB activation stimulated by TLRs, highlighting the functional importance of SENP6 in inflammation and immunity. Interestingly, SENP6 has a unique insertion, not found in other SENPs, that splits the conserved catalytic domain. Whether this motif functions as a substrate determinant remains to be explored by structural analysis.</p>
<p>SENP6 (also named SUSP1), was recently identified as the largest member (1112 amino acids) of the SUMO-specific proteases family (the C48 cysteine proteases) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Kim1">[39]</xref>. Little is known about the physiological functions of SENP6, although the biochemical properties of SENP6 is established. It is recently suggested that SENP6 could modulate the SUMOylation of CENP-1 and PML. However, the underlying mechanism and functional consequences need further exploration. In addition, SENP6 could potentially modulates the SUMOylation status of RPA70, a pivotal factor for DNA repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003480-Dou1">[27]</xref>. In this study, we have linked SENP6 to dynamically regulate the IKK activation. Future studies will be focused on generating the SENP6 knockout mice and analyzing its critical function in immunity and inflammation. Biophysical approach will also be employed to probe the transient ubiquitination and SUMOylation status of NEMO, linking them to the activation status of IKK and NF-κB.</p>
