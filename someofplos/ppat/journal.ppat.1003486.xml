<abstract>
<p>The ability to tolerate <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, a human commensal of the gastrointestinal tract and vagina, implicates that host defense mechanisms of resistance and tolerance cooperate to limit fungal burden and inflammation at the different body sites. We evaluated resistance and tolerance to the fungus in experimental and human vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) as well as in recurrent VVC (RVVC). Resistance and tolerance mechanisms were both activated in murine VVC, involving IL-22 and IL-10-producing regulatory T cells, respectively, with a major contribution by the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1). IDO1 was responsible for the production of tolerogenic kynurenines, such that replacement therapy with kynurenines restored immunoprotection to VVC. In humans, two functional genetic variants in <italic>IL22</italic> and <italic>IDO1</italic> genes were found to be associated with heightened resistance to RVVC, and they correlated with increased local expression of IL-22, IDO1 and kynurenines. Thus, IL-22 and IDO1 are crucial in balancing resistance with tolerance to <italic>Candida</italic>, their deficiencies are risk factors for RVVC, and targeting tolerance via therapeutic kynurenines may benefit patients with RVVC.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>This study disentangles resistance and tolerance components of murine and human <italic>C. albicans</italic> vaginal infection and introduces the challenging notion of a disease due to a defective tolerance mechanism. Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and recurrent VVC (RVVC) are two forms of disease that affect a large number of otherwise healthy women. Uncomplicated VVC is associated with several predisposing factors, whereas RVVC, marked by idiopathic recurrent episodes, may be virtually untreatable. Despite a growing list of recognized risk factors, further understanding of anti-<italic>Candida</italic> host defense mechanisms in the vagina is needed to optimize vaccine development and immune interventions to integrate with, or even replace, antifungal therapy. Indeed, medical treatments that increase host resistance, such as antifungals, are highly effective for individual symptomatic attacks but do not prevent recurrences and there is concern that repeated treatments might induce drug resistance. As tolerance mechanisms are not expected to have the same selective pressure on pathogens, new drugs that target tolerance will provide therapies to which low-virulence pathogens, such as <italic>C. albicans</italic>, will not develop resistance. This study provides a proof-of-concept that targeting tolerance via therapeutic kynurenines may benefit patients with RVVC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Candida</italic> species are the causative agents of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and recurrent VVC (RVVC), two forms of disease that affect a large number of otherwise healthy women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Fidel1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Sobel1">[2]</xref>. Uncomplicated VVC is associated with several predisposing factors, including antibiotic and oral contraceptive usage, hormone replacement therapy, pregnancy and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and it usually responds to treatment. In contrast, RVVC, marked by idiopathic recurrent episodes, may be virtually untreatable. Despite a growing list of recognized risk factors, further understanding of anti-<italic>Candida</italic> host defense mechanisms in the vagina is needed to optimize vaccine development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Fidel2">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-DeBernardis1">[4]</xref> and immune interventions to integrate with, or even replace, antifungal therapy.</p>
<p>Colonization of the vaginal mucosa by the fungus induces both humoral and Th immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Fidel3">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Cassone1">[7]</xref>, with the contribution of epithelial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Yano1">[8]</xref> and dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-LeBlanc1">[6]</xref>. Acquired Th1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Carvalho1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Fidel5">[11]</xref> and Th17 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Pietrella1">[12]</xref> immunity have been described in murine and human VVC. Thus, multiple effector mechanisms of resistance to the fungus are apparently present in VVC. As IL-22 is known to contribute to antifungal resistance at mucosal surfaces by assuring epithelial integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-DeLuca1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Eyerich1">[15]</xref>, and low levels of IL-22 are associated with chronic and recurrent mucosal candidiasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Eyerich2">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Puel1">[19]</xref>, a role for this cytokine in vaginal immune resistance, beyond the polymorphonuclear neutrophil's (PMNs) response and alarmins production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Yano2">[20]</xref>, is likely.</p>
<p>In addition to resistance mechanisms that reduce pathogen burden during infection, tolerance mechanisms that protect the host from immune- or pathogen-induced damage have recently emerged in the area of animal immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Read1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Schneider1">[22]</xref>. It has been argued that a high rate of infection, but low virulence, should select for host tolerance, whereas the opposite condition should favor resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Restif1">[23]</xref>. Therefore, it is not surprising that tolerance is a complementary host defense trait that increases fitness in response to low-virulence <italic>C. albicans</italic> in the host-<italic>Candida</italic> symbiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Romani1">[24]</xref>. Considerable evidence for an association of recurrent episodes of symptomatic infection with immune hyper-reactivity to the fungus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Piccinni1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Yano3">[27]</xref> point to the contribution of a deregulated immune reactivity to the pathogenesis of VVC and support a role for immunoregulation in this disease. As a matter of fact, protection from VVC is associated with limited or absent inflammatory responses that will not necessarily cause the elimination of the fungus, whereas symptomatic infection is associated with a heavy vaginal cellular infiltrate of PMNs and a variable degree of fungal presence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Yano1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Fidel7">[28]</xref>. A plethora of tolerance mechanisms, despite less clarified than resistance mechanisms, have been described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Cobbold1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Saraiva1">[30]</xref>. In murine VVC, CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (Treg) cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Wormley1">[31]</xref>, γ/δ T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Wormley2">[32]</xref> and immunoregulatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor β, have all been demonstrated. Thus, resistance and tolerance are complementary host antifungal defense mechanisms that likely operate in the vaginal mucosa, where the ability to tolerate the fungus implies immune strategies that favor the induction of non-sterilizing protective immunity in an environment permissive for fungal persistence.</p>
<p>Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), the rate-limiting enzyme in tryptophan degradation along the kynurenine pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Mellor1">[33]</xref>, is a master regulator of antifungal tolerance at mucosal surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Zelante1">[34]</xref>. Pathogenic inflammatory responses due to IDO1 deficiency account for the inherent susceptibility of mice to aspergillosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Romani2">[35]</xref> and mucosal candidiasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-DeLuca2">[36]</xref>, owing to the unopposed inflammatory responses that compromise the host's ability to efficiently oppose fungal infectivity. By regulating the balance between Th17 and Treg cells, IDO1 may not only contribute to local immune homeostasis but also limit the pro-survival and virulence-promoting activity of IL-17A on fungal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Zelante2">[37]</xref>. A role for IDO1 in the genitourinary system seems likely, because of the intense IDO1-specific staining in a number of tissues from the genitourinary system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Dai1">[38]</xref>. There is also evidence for IDO1 involvement in persistent genitourinary <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Roth1">[39]</xref>. However, whether IDO1 contributes to protective tolerance to <italic>C. albicans</italic> in the vagina is presently unknown.</p>
<p>In the current study, we evaluated the role of IL-22 and IDO1 in murine and human VVC. We used mice with selective deficiency of IL-22 or IDO1 to explore innate and acquired Th/Treg mechanisms of antifungal protection and patients with VVC and RVVC in which common genetic variants in the <italic>IL22</italic> and <italic>IDO1</italic> genes were analyzed and correlated with local cytokine production. We found that genetic deficiencies of IL-22 or IDO1 were associated with VVC in mice, due to impaired resistance and tolerance mechanisms to the fungus. Two functional genetic variants in human <italic>IL22</italic> and <italic>IDO1</italic> were associated with a decreased risk for RVVC and correlated with increased local expression of IL-22, IDO1 and kynurenines. This study demonstrates that IL-22 and IDO1 mediate antifungal resistance and tolerance to <italic>C. albicans</italic> in the vagina and that their deficiencies are risk factors for RVVC.</p>

<title>IL-22 mediates resistance and IDO1 restrains inflammation in murine VVC</title>
<p>IL-22 and IDO1 are key mediators of resistance and tolerance to <italic>Candida</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-DeLuca1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-DeLuca2">[36]</xref> and other fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Gessner1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Romani2">[35]</xref> at mucosal surfaces. To assess the role of IL-22 and IDO1 in murine VVC, we intravaginally infected C57BL/6, IL-22- or IDO1-deficient mice with <italic>Candida</italic> blastospores and evaluated resistance to infection in terms of vaginal histopathology, PMN recruitment in vaginal lavages, expression of chemotactic S100A8 and S100A9 proteins, known to mediate PMN migration in murine VVC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Yano1">[8]</xref> and local fungal growth. In C57BL/6 mice, histological analysis revealed the presence of fungal and inflammatory cells infiltrating the vaginal parenchyma with signs of epithelial damage at the early stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Robust PMN recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, dpi 3), significant <italic>S100a8</italic> and <italic>S100a9</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and calprotectin production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) were also observed. Mice eventually controlled the infection, as indicated by a reduction in fungal burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), PMN number, <italic>S100a8 and S100a9</italic> expression, calprotectin level and amelioration of inflammatory pathology at 21 and 42 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g001">Figure 1A–D</xref>). The course of the infection was different in IL-22- <italic>vs.</italic> IDO1-deficient mice and in those mice <italic>vs.</italic> their respective wild-type counterparts. IL-22-deficient mice were susceptible to <italic>C. albicans</italic> in the early but not late stages of infection, as indicated by signs of vaginal epithelial damage and inflammation, robust PMN recruitment, high <italic>S100a8</italic> and <italic>S100a9</italic> gene expression, calprotectin levels and fungal growth at 3 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g001">Figure 1A–E</xref>). An opposite pattern of resistance was observed in IDO1-deficient mice, in which resistance to infection was increased early but not late in infection. Indeed, at days 21 and 42 after the infection, mice were unable to restrict fungal growth and inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g001">Figure 1A–E</xref>). Wild-type and IL-22-deficient, but not IDO1-deficient mice, showed resistance to re-infection (Figure S1A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003486.s001">Text S1</xref>), a memory response requiring an intact T cell compartment (Figure S1B–E in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003486.s001">Text S1</xref>). These findings suggest that IL-22 mediates early antifungal resistance, whereas IDO1 is required to restrain inflammation during ongoing infection and to provide antifungal memory.</p>

<p>To directly prove the role of IL-22, we evaluated levels of IL-22, as well as of companion cytokines, such as IL-17A and IL-17F, in infection and the consequences of IL-22 inhibition or administration. We found elevated levels of IL-22 through the infection in IDO1-deficient mice in which high levels of IL-17F, but not IL-17A, were also higher as compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Blocking IL-22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g001">Figure 1G</xref>) greatly increased fungal growth in IDO1-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g001">Figure 1H</xref>), whereas exogenous IL-22 decreased fungal growth in wild- type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g001">Figure 1I</xref>), a finding confirming that IL-22 mediates antifungal resistance in VVC particularly under conditions of IDO1 deficiency. Experiments in IL-17A- or IL-17F-deficient mice confirmed the superior activity of IL-22 <italic>vs.</italic> IL-17A in early anticandidal resistance in VVC. Despite both types of mice show a higher fungal burden early in infection, as compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), IL-17F-deficient, more than IL-17A-deficient, mice showed signs of inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and PMN recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g002">Figure 2C</xref> and inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) associated with high levels of IL-17A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, confirming recent findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Yano2">[20]</xref>, the neutrophil response in vaginal candidiasis occurs independently of IL-22 and IL-17F. Interestingly, the fact that IL-17A binds fungal cells in the vagina and affects fungal growth and morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Zelante2">[37]</xref>, may account for the numerous hyphae observed in vaginal fluids from IL-17F-deficient mice (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<title>IL-22 is produced by vaginal innate lymphoid cells via AhR</title>
<p>In gastrointestinal candidiasis, IL-22 is mainly produced by NKp46<sup>+</sup> NK1.1<sup>low</sup> cells, an innate lymphoid cell (ILC) subset expressing the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-DeLuca1">[13]</xref>. We searched for IL-22-producing NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells in the vagina of C56BL/6 mice along with γδ T cells, also known to produce IL-22 at mucosal surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Simonian1">[40]</xref>. Both types of cells, with the predominance of γδ T cells, were present in the vagina, as revealed by FACS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). However, NKp46<sup>+</sup>cells mainly produced IL-22, as shown by intracellular cytokine staining in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) and vaginal immunostaining in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Indeed, IL-22-producing NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells expanded in infection in wild-type but not IL-22-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).

<title>Treg cells control the Th1/Th17 cell balance in murine VVC</title>
<p>The increased resistance seen later in infection in IL-22-deficient but not IDO1-deficient mice, prompted us to define mechanisms of resistance that are independent from IL-22 but dependent on IDO1. We evaluated the production and expression of IFN-γ and IL-17A in the vagina and the expression of Th-specific transcription factor genes in purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the draining lymph nodes of re-infected mice. We found that resistance to re-challenge in C57BL/6 or IL-22-deficient mice correlated with high-level production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) of IFN-γ and IL-17A. IFN-γ but not IL-17A, production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) were instead reduced in IDO1-deficient mice in which <italic>Tbet</italic> expression was also lower and <italic>Rorc</italic> expression higher as compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Importantly, the production of IFN-γ and IL-17A by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from mice during the primary infection (3 dpi) was significantly lower than that observed upon re-challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Therefore, these data indicated that an appropriate Th1/Th17 cell balance is required for the expression of acquired antifungal immunity. Studies in IL-10-deficient mice confirmed that IL-10<sup>+</sup> Treg cells essentially control this balance. IL-10-deficient mice, although capable of restraining the fungal growth during the primary infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) and after re-challenge (Figure S1F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003486.s001">Text S1</xref>), were unable to control tissue inflammation (Figure S1G in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003486.s001">Text S1</xref>) and PMN recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g005">Figure 5E</xref>) during the infection, and this was associated with high-level production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) of IFN-γ and IL-17A, and with high <italic>Tbet</italic> and <italic>Rorc</italic> expressions in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus IL-10 is required to restrain immunopathology, to which Th17, more than Th1, cells contribute as revealed by subsequent studies in IFN-γ- or IL-17RA-deficient mice. While more resistant to the infection in the early stage– likely due to the high levels of IL-22 (Figure S2A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003486.s001">Text S1</xref>)–both IFN-γ- and IL-17RA-deficient mice progressively become susceptible to infection, as indicated by the failure to restrain fungal growth during the primary infection (Figure S2B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003486.s001">Text S1</xref>) or after re-challenge (Figure S2C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003486.s001">Text S1</xref>) and to limit inflammation (Figure S2D-F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003486.s001">Text S1</xref>). In contrast to IL-17A, the levels of IFN-γ were either absent or greatly reduced (Figure S2G in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003486.s001">Text S1</xref>), a finding indicating that IFN-γ is a key mediator of acquired resistance to the fungus, to which IL-17RA signaling contributes, as already suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-DeLuca1">[13]</xref>.

<title>Immunity and tolerance in murine VVC occur through distinct innate recognition receptors</title>
<p>We know that functional yet balanced reactivity to <italic>C. albicans</italic> at mucosal surfaces requires both the myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and the TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) as well as different upstream innate receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-DeLuca1">[13]</xref>. We evaluated resistance to the primary infection and re-challenge in MyD88-or TRIF-deficient mice intravaginally infected with the fungus. Early in infection, fungal burden was higher in MyD88-deficient mice and declined thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The inflammatory response with PMN recruitment observed early in infection resolved later in infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), at a time when those mice developed resistance to re-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Growth was instead restrained in TRIF-deficient mice early in infection, but fungal growth was observed in the vagina at a later stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), when mice effectively controlled fungal growth if re-challenged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), but not the associated inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Consistent with these findings, IL-22 and IL-17A were particularly lower in MyD88-deficient mice as compared to TRIF-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g006">Figure 6D</xref>), whereas IL-17A more than IFN-γ/IL-10 were present in TRIF-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003486-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). To identify the upstream innate receptors involved in the response, we infected mice deficient in receptors known to recruit the MyD88 (TLR2/TLR6/TLR9), TRIF (TLR3), or both (TLR4) pathways and whose expression was observed in the vagina (Figure S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003486.s001">Text S1</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study disentangles resistance and tolerance components of murine and human <italic>C. albicans</italic> vaginal infection and introduces the challenging notion of a disease due to a defective tolerance mechanism. While some degree of inflammation is required for protection, particularly at mucosal tissues during the transitional response occurring between the rapid innate and slower adaptive responses, progressive inflammation worsens disease and ultimately prevents pathogen eradication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Romani1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Romani2">[35]</xref>. Much like in gastrointestinal candidiasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-DeLuca1">[13]</xref>, resistance and tolerance mechanisms in VVC are activated through the contribution of innate and adaptive immune responses, involving distinct modules of immunity, i.e., IL-22 and Th1/Th17 cells for resistance and IL-10<sup>+</sup> Treg cells for tolerance. It has already been shown that IL-22 provides antifungal resistance through disparate mechanisms, including i) growth control of the early infecting morphotype, the yeasts, via the induction of antimicrobial peptides with anticandidal activity and ii)epithelial integrity control, via phosphorylation of STAT3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-DeLuca1">[13]</xref>, known to be required for limiting damage and inflammation in mucosal candidiasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Bonifazi1">[48]</xref>. Thus IL-22 variations may explain why some patients are at high risk of vaginal yeast infection.</p>
<p>Although many different cell types produce IL-22 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Sonnenberg1">[41]</xref>, intestinal ILCs expressing AhR, now termed ILC3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Spits1">[49]</xref>, are known to produce, in addition to other cytokines, IL-22 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Cherrier1">[50]</xref>. ILCs reflect many functions of CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells but expand and act shortly after stimulation. They play fundamental roles early in response to infection and injury, in the maintenance of homeostasis, and possibly in the regulation of adaptive immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Qiu1">[51]</xref>. We found here that NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells expanded in the vagina in infection and produced IL-22, more than IL-17A, likely via AhR. As expression of cytokines by ILCs is regulated by signals provided by epithelial cells in response to microbiota, our finding may provide a mechanistic explanation for the link between microbial dysbiosis and vaginal candidiasis. Indeed, the fact that IL-22 production is driven by commensals may explain how antibiotic therapy and iatrogenic immunosuppression are major predisposing factors in candidiasis and, more generally, how the bacterial-fungal population dynamics impact on vaginal homeostasis and inflammatory diseases.</p>
<p>Mutations in <italic>IL17F</italic>, <italic>IL17R</italic> and <italic>DECTIN1</italic> in patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, as well as neutralizing autoantibodies against IL-17 and IL-22 in patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy, directly impair IL-17 and IL-22 immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Ferwerda1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Glocker1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Puel2">[54]</xref>. We found here that IL-22, more than IL-17A, contributes to resistance to VVC. In mice, resistance was abrogated under conditions of IL-22 or IL-17F, more than IL-17A, deficiency, whereas a common genetic variant in human <italic>IL22</italic> leading to enhanced production of IL-22, but not IL-17A and TNF-α, conferred protection against RVVC. Thus, in addition to functional polymorphisms in genes coding for mannose-binding lectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Giraldo1">[55]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Wojitani1">[57]</xref>, IL-4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Babula1">[58]</xref>, and the inflammasome component NALP3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-LevSagie1">[59]</xref> in predisposing to RVVC, our study identified an <italic>IL22</italic> variant that is associated with a decreased risk for RVVC and is consistent with the findings obtained relative to <italic>DECTIN1</italic> deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Ferwerda1">[47]</xref>.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first genetic variant in <italic>IL22</italic> found to be associated with a human disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Sonnenberg1">[41]</xref>, and our finding confirms the important functions of the IL-22–IL-22R pathway in regulating immunity, inflammation and tissue homeostasis, and the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway in human disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Sonnenberg1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>Considered a master regulator of antifungal resistance and tolerance at mucosal surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Zelante1">[34]</xref>, IDO1 has gained reputation in the field of immune mycology owing to its ability to generate immunomodulatory kynurenines that induce Treg cells suppressing local antifungal T-cell responses, thus favoring fungal persistence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Zelante1">[34]</xref>. It is known that IDO1 activity exhibits relatively large interindividual variability, in particular under pathological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Logters1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Suzuki1">[61]</xref> and that there are naturally occurring polymorphisms that transcriptionally regulate the human <italic>IDO1</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Arefayene1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Soichot1">[63]</xref>. Thus, genetic factors are involved in interindividual variability of IDO expression and/or activity. We found that an <italic>IDO1</italic> variant leading to enhanced IDO1 expression and concomitant production of kynurenines was associated with decreased risk for RVVC. IDO1 regulates tolerance to the fungus at the vaginal level, as it ameliorates immunopathology that positively correlated with the magnitude of the immune response. It was indeed required for the generation of IL-10<sup>+</sup> Treg cells negatively affecting Th1/Th17 cells. Moreover, IDO1 also favored the induction of optimal antifungal memory resistance, an activity likely due to its ability to limit tissue damage, thus allowing for a higher magnitude and duration of the immune response than would have been otherwise possible. Finally, the finding that IL-22 was up-regulated in condition of IDO1 deficiency indicates that the resistance and tolerance mechanisms are to some extent reciprocally regulated.</p>
<p>Understanding the mechanisms that are critical for host survival is important for the choice of therapeutic approaches. Antifungal therapy is highly effective for individual symptomatic attacks but does not prevent recurrences. In addition to the associated costs that are very high <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003486-Foxman1">[64]</xref>, there is concern that repeated treatments might induce drug resistance. Thus medical treatments that increase host resistance, such as antibiotics, place selective pressures on pathogens. As tolerance mechanisms are not expected to have the same selective pressure on pathogens, new drugs that target tolerance will provide therapies to which low-virulence fungi, such as <italic>C. albicans</italic>, will not develop resistance. Kynurenines appear to fulfill this requirement.</p>

Primer sequences are available upon request. Each genotyping set comprised randomly selected replicates of sequenced samples and negative controls. Concordant genotyping was obtained for &gt;99% assays.</p>
<p>For the functional assays, and unless stated otherwise, measurements were performed in vaginal washes obtained from at least 10 different women without ongoing symptoms and that had negative culture results for each genotype under study, assessed in quadruplicates.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Student's T-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni's adjustment were used to determine statistical significance (P&lt;0.05). The data reported are either from one representative experiment out of three to five independent experiments (western blotting and RT–PCR) or pooled from three to five experiments, otherwise. The in vivo groups consisted of 6–8 mice/group. Data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 4.03 program (GraphPad Software). Genotype distributions among controls and VVC and RVVC patients were analyzed by Fisher's exact test and P values less than 0.05 were considered as significant. Genotype frequencies were distributed according to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for all SNPs (P&gt;0.05).</p>
