<abstract>
<p>Nef is the viral gene product employed by the majority of primate lentiviruses to overcome restriction by tetherin (BST-2 or CD317), an interferon-inducible transmembrane protein that inhibits the detachment of enveloped viruses from infected cells. Although the mechanisms of tetherin antagonism by HIV-1 Vpu and HIV-2 Env have been investigated in detail, comparatively little is known about tetherin antagonism by SIV Nef. Here we demonstrate a direct physical interaction between SIV Nef and rhesus macaque tetherin, define the residues in Nef required for tetherin antagonism, and show that the anti-tetherin activity of Nef is dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. SIV Nef co-immunoprecipitated with rhesus macaque tetherin and the Nef core domain bound directly to a peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of rhesus tetherin by surface plasmon resonance. An analysis of alanine-scanning substitutions identified residues throughout the N-terminal, globular core and flexible loop regions of Nef that were required for tetherin antagonism. Although there was significant overlap with sequences required for CD4 downregulation, tetherin antagonism was genetically separable from this activity, as well as from other Nef functions, including MHC class I-downregulation and infectivity enhancement. Consistent with a role for clathrin and dynamin 2 in the endocytosis of tetherin, dominant-negative mutants of AP180 and dynamin 2 impaired the ability of Nef to downmodulate tetherin and to counteract restriction. Taken together, these results reveal that the mechanism of tetherin antagonism by Nef depends on a physical interaction between Nef and tetherin, requires sequences throughout Nef, but is genetically separable from other Nef functions, and leads to the removal of tetherin from sites of virus release at the plasma membrane by clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Tetherin (BST-2, CD317 or HM1.24) is an interferon-inducible cellular restriction factor that prevents the release of enveloped viruses from infected cells. Human and simian immunodeficiency viruses have evolved to use different viral proteins to overcome the anti-viral effects of tetherin. Whereas HIV-1 Vpu and HIV-2 Env counteract human tetherin, most SIVs use the accessory protein Nef to counteract tetherin in their non-human primate hosts. Here we show that the mechanism of tetherin antagonism by SIV Nef involves a direct physical interaction between the core domain of Nef and the cytoplasmic domain of tetherin, which results in the removal of tetherin from sites of virus assembly and release on the cell surface by a mechanism that depends on clathrin and dynamin 2. The Nef-mediated internalization of tetherin leads to the accumulation of tetherin within lysosomal compartments, suggesting that, similar to CD4− and MHC I-downregulation, Nef promotes the lysosomal degradation of tetherin.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mammalian cells express a number of proteins that inhibit specific steps of virus replication. One such factor, tetherin (BST-2 or CD317), impairs the release of enveloped viruses from infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Mansouri1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Jouvenet1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Sakuma1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-VanDamme1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Neil1">[5]</xref>. Tetherin is a type II integral membrane protein with a topology that allows both ends of the molecule to be anchored in lipid membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Kupzig1">[6]</xref>. It has an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain followed by a single-pass transmembrane domain, an extracellular coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Kupzig1">[6]</xref>. Under conditions of interferon-induction, tetherin is upregulated and becomes incorporated into virus particles as they attempt to bud from infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-PerezCaballero1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Hammonds1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Fitzpatrick1">[9]</xref>. Captured virions are then internalized and routed to lysosomal compartments for degradation by a mechanism that involves interactions between the cytoplasmic domain of tetherin and the endocytosis machinery of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-PerezCaballero1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Miyakawa1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Tetherin has played an important role in shaping the course of lentiviral evolution in primates, having selected for at least three different viral gene products to overcome this restriction factor (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Evans1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-SerraMoreno1">[12]</xref>). Whereas HIV-1 Vpu and HIV-2 Env antagonize human tetherin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-VanDamme1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Neil1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-LeTortorec1">[13]</xref>, the majority of SIVs use Nef to counteract the tetherin proteins of their non-human primate hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Sauter1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Jia1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Zhang1">[16]</xref>. Indeed, HIV-1 Vpu and HIV-2 Env appear to have acquired the ability to antagonize tetherin due to the absence of sequences in the cytoplasmic domain of human tetherin that confer susceptibility to Nef <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Evans1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-SerraMoreno1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Alternative models have been proposed for the mechanism of tetherin antagonism by HIV-1 Vpu. Vpu physically associates with tetherin via membrane-spanning domain interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Iwabu1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Lv1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Mangeat1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Skasko1">[20]</xref>, recruits ßTrCP-2, a component of the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box ubiquitin ligase complex, promoting the ubiquitination of non-lysine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of tetherin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Tokarev1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Gustin1">[22]</xref>, and uses the ESCRT-mediated trafficking of tetherin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Janvier1">[23]</xref> for degradation in lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Iwabu1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Mangeat1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Mitchell1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Douglas1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Rong1">[26]</xref>. There is also evidence that Vpu may antagonize tetherin in the absence of degradation by sequestering the protein in a perinuclear compartment, either by retaining newly synthesized tetherin, or by blocking the recycling of tetherin to the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Mitchell1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Tervo1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Dube1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Schmidt1">[29]</xref>. Vpu-mediated downmodulation of tetherin and enhancement of virus release were also recently shown to be dependent in part on clathrin-mediated endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Lau1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>The mechanism of tetherin antagonism by HIV-2 Env depends on a physical interaction between Env and tetherin, and a conserved tyrosine-based endocytosis motif in the cytoplasmic tail of gp41 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-LeTortorec1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Hauser1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Gupta1">[32]</xref>. The sequences required for Env interactions with tetherin are poorly defined, but appear to reside in the extracellular domains of both proteins, as indicated by analyses of recombinant forms of Env and tetherin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-LeTortorec1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Lopez1">[33]</xref>, and the identification of substitutions in the ectodomains of each protein that disrupt tetherin antagonism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Gupta1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Lopez1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Abada1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Bour1">[35]</xref>. HIV-2 Env does not promote the degradation of tetherin, but leads to the internalization and sequestration of tetherin by a clathrin-dependent mechanism, consistent with the trapping of tetherin in recycling endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-LeTortorec1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Lau1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Hauser1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>Comparatively little is known about the mechanism of tetherin antagonism by Nef. The Nef proteins of phylogenetically diverse SIVs, including SIV<sub>smm/mac</sub>, SIV<sub>agm</sub> and SIV<sub>cpz</sub>, antagonize the tetherin proteins of their non-human primate hosts, but not human tetherin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Sauter1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Jia1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Zhang1">[16]</xref>. This specificity maps to a five amino acid sequence that is present in the cytoplasmic tails of non-human primate tetherin proteins (G/D<sub>14</sub>DIWK<sub>18</sub> in rhesus macaques, sooty mangabeys and chimpanzees), but absent from the corresponding region of human tetherin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Jia1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Zhang1">[16]</xref>. We previously reported that SIV Nef downregulates rhesus tetherin from the surface of transfected and infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Jia1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-SerraMoreno2">[36]</xref>. Zhang et al. further demonstrated that this activity is AP-2-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Zhang2">[37]</xref>. Here we demonstrate a direct physical interaction between SIV Nef and rhesus tetherin, define residues throughout Nef required for tetherin antagonism, and demonstrate that the anti-tetherin activity of Nef is dependent, at least in part, on clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</p>

<title>SIV Nef binds selectively to the cytoplasmic domain of rhesus tetherin</title>
<p>SIV Nef was tested for a physical interaction with tetherin by co-immunoprecipitation.

<p>(A) 293T cells were co-transfected with constructs expressing SIV Nef and either rhesus tetherin (rBST-2), human tetherin (hBST-2) or empty vector. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to tetherin, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Western blots were developed with a monoclonal antibody to SIV Nef. Western blots were also performed for whole cell lysates to determine the input levels of these proteins. (B &amp; C) Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses were performed to test for direct binding between Nef and rhesus tetherin or human tetherin. Peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of rBST-2 and hBST-2 were biotinylated at conserved cysteines and captured on neutravidin-coated CM5 sensor chips. The binding of Nef to tetherin was assessed by flowing purified recombinant SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 Nef<sub>4–263</sub> and Nef<sub>96–237</sub> proteins over the peptide-coated biosensor chips.

<p>To determine if this interaction is direct, SIV Nef was tested for binding to peptides corresponding to the N-terminal cytoplasmic domains of rhesus and human tetherin by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Tetherin peptides were biotinylated at conserved cysteine residues (C<sub>25</sub> in rBST-2 and C<sub>20</sub> in hBST-2) and coupled to the surface of neutravidin-coated CM5-BIAcore chips to mimic the native orientation of the N-terminus of tetherin on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Recombinant SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 Nef proteins containing residues 4–263 (Nef<sub>4–263</sub>) and 96–237 (Nef<sub>96–237</sub>) were flowed over the immobilized peptides to assess binding. SIV Nef<sub>96–237</sub> bound to the N-terminal peptide of rhesus tetherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), but not to the corresponding peptide of human tetherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The dissociation constant and the maximum response for SIV Nef<sub>96–237</sub> binding to rhesus tetherin were determined by equilibrium analysis (K<sub>d.app</sub> 401+/−114 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The nearly full-length Nef protein, Nef<sub>4–263</sub>, also bound to rhesus tetherin (data not shown). However, the K<sub>d</sub> of this interaction could not be determined due to artifacts at protein concentrations greater than 300 µM that may reflect Nef dimerization. These results reveal a direct physical interaction between SIV Nef and the cytoplasmic domain of rhesus macaque tetherin.</p>

<title>Identification of SIV Nef residues required for tetherin antagonism</title>
<p>To identify sequences in SIV Nef that contribute to tetherin antagonism, 103 pair-wise alanine-scanning substitutions were introduced throughout the N-terminal, globular core and the flexible loop regions of SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 Nef (residues 3–210), and these mutants were tested for their ability to counteract rhesus tetherin in virus release assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Mutations in the C-terminal domain (residues 211–263) were not tested, since these sequences can be deleted without affecting the anti-tetherin activity of Nef (data not shown). Virus release for 43 of the Nef mutants was reduced to a similar or greater extent than a myristoylation site mutant (G<sub>2</sub>A), which was previously shown to impair tetherin antagonism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Jia1">[15]</xref>. These results were corroborated by western blot analyses comparing p55 Gag expression in cell lysates to the accumulation of p27 capsid (CA) in the cell culture supernatant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003487.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This approach identified 9 substitutions in the N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), 27 substitutions in the globular core domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), and 7 substitutions in the flexible loop region of Nef (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) that disrupt tetherin antagonism.</p>

<title>Identification of residues that contribute to the interaction between Nef and tetherin</title>
<p>To define residues in SIV Nef that contribute to interactions with tetherin, Nef mutants lacking anti-tetherin activity were tested for binding to rhesus tetherin by co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The ratios of the band intensities for Nef and tetherin in immunoprecipitates were calculated to quantify differences in binding to tetherin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003487-t001">Table 1</xref>). Substitutions at positions 2, 5–6, 66–67, 68–69 and 70–71 in the N-terminal domain, positions 116–117 and 174–175 in the globular core domain, and positions 181–182, 193–194, 195–196 and 199–200 in the flexible loop region diminished the co-immunoprecipitation of Nef with tetherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g003">Figure 3A, 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003487-t001">Table 1</xref>). Some of the substitutions in the globular core, particularly at positions 178–179 and 180–181, resulted in reduced levels of Nef protein in cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003487-t001">Table 1</xref>). Hence, the loss of tetherin binding in these instances may reflect decreased Nef protein stability or expression rather than a disruption of tetherin contact residues. However, many of the core domain mutations that decreased steady-state levels of Nef did not result in a corresponding decrease in binding to tetherin, and a few paradoxically appear to have increased the stability of this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003487-t001">Table 1</xref>). Since many of these mutations did not completely abrogate binding to tetherin, combinations of alanine substitutions were also tested. The co-immunoprecipitation of Nef with tetherin was reduced to nearly undetectable levels by combining substitutions in the N-terminal domain, either alone (residues 66–71), or together with the substitutions in the globular core and flexible loop (x6: residues 66–71, 116–117, 174–175 and 181–182) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Co-immunoprecipitation assays with the Nef mutants that impair anti-tetherin activity were performed to identify residues that diminish binding to tetherin. 293T cells were co-transfected with constructs expressing rhesus tetherin, and either wild-type or mutant Nef proteins. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal antibody to tetherin, and blots were probed with monoclonal antibodies to SIV Nef and tetherin. (B) Combinations of alanine substitutions in Nef that were shown to impair binding to rhesus tetherin in panel A were tested in additional co-immunoprecipitation assays as described above. (C) Estimated K<sub>d.app</sub> values were determined for the binding of SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 Nef<sub>96–237</sub> with the indicated deletions in the flexible loop region to the cytoplasmic domain of rhesus tetherin by SPR. Bands corresponding to the antibody heavy and light chain are indicated (HC and LC). Asterisks indicate the absence of detectable Nef protein.</p>

<p>To determine if residues in the flexible loop of SIV Nef are needed for direct binding to rhesus tetherin, purified Nef proteins with deletions in the flexible loop were tested for binding to the cytoplasmic domain of rhesus tetherin by SPR. Recombinant SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 Nef<sub>96–237</sub> lacking residues 181–200, 181–195, 197–205 and 181–205 were flowed over BIAcore chips coated with a 26 amino acid peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of rhesus tetherin, as described for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g001">Figure 1B</xref>. All of the deletion mutants bound to the peptide within a similar range of apparent K<sub>d</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g003">Figure 3C</xref>; representative raw SPR data is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003487.s002">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>). The somewhat lower K<sub>d.app</sub> estimates for three of the deletion mutants (Δ181–200, Δ181–195 and Δ181–205) may be due to technical limitations with testing these mutants at high concentrations as a result of protein aggregation, rather than an actual increase in binding affinity. Some of these mutants also showed lower apparent K<sub>d</sub> values for binding to a TCRζ chain peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003487.s002">Figure S2C–S2E</xref>), an interaction that reflects direct binding of the SIV Nef core domain as corroborated by three-dimensional structural data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Kim1">[38]</xref>. Hence, these results demonstrate that the flexible loop of Nef is not required for direct binding to rhesus tetherin, implying that surfaces of the core domain are sufficient for the low affinity interaction with the N-terminus of rhesus tetherin observed by SPR.</p>
<p>Cytoplasmic domain variants of tetherin were also tested for binding to Nef by co-immunoprecipitation and SPR. Deletion of the first 10 amino acids of rhesus tetherin (rΔ10) significantly reduced, but did not eliminate, binding to Nef in both assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g004">Figures 4A, 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003487.s003">S3B</xref>), indicating that although these residues are not essential for binding to Nef, they contribute to the stability of the interaction. Consistent with previous studies mapping the anti-tetherin activity of Nef to a five amino acid sequence (G/D<sub>14</sub>DIWK<sub>18</sub>) that is missing from human tetherin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Jia1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Zhang1">[16]</xref>, alanine substitutions at positions 14–18 of rhesus tetherin (rA<sub>14</sub>-A<sub>18</sub>) diminished Nef binding, whereas the introduction of these residues into human tetherin partially restored binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g004">Figures 4A, 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003487.s003">S3C and S3D</xref>). Thus, although the specificity of tetherin antagonism by Nef is dependent on residues 14–18, and these sequences contribute to a physical interaction with Nef, they are not the sole determinant of Nef binding.</p>

<title>Identification of residues in rhesus tetherin that contribute to interactions with Nef.</title>
<p>Mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of rhesus and human tetherin were tested for their effects on binding to Nef by co-immunoprecipitation and SPR assays. (A) Co-immunoprecipitation of Nef in the presence of rhesus, human tetherin and the following tetherin mutants; a rhesus tetherin mutant lacking the first 10 residues of the protein (rΔ10), a rhesus tetherin mutant containing five alanine substitutions at positions 14–18 (rA<sub>14</sub>-A<sub>18</sub>) and a human tetherin mutant containing residues D<sub>14</sub>DIWK<sub>18</sub> from rhesus tetherin (hDDIWK). The ratios of the band intensities of Nef versus tetherin in the immunoprecipitates are shown beneath each lane. (B) SPR assays were performed as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g001">Figure 1</xref> to assess binding for Nef<sub>96–237</sub> and peptides corresponding to the tetherin mutants tested in panel A. (C) Virus release assays were performed to test the susceptibility of each of these tetherin mutants to Nef antagonism. 293T cells were co-transfected with SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 Δ<italic>nef</italic> proviral DNA and constructs coding for rhesus, human tetherin, each tetherin mutant or an empty vector. Constructs coding for Nef were provided <italic>in trans</italic>. Virus release was measured by SIV p27 antigen-capture ELISA and expressed as the percentage of maximal release in the absence of tetherin.</p>

<p>These tetherin variants were also tested in virus release assays to determine how Nef binding relates to susceptibility to antagonism. In accordance with partial binding of Nef to rΔ10 and hDDIWK, restriction of virus release by each of these mutants was partially counteracted by Nef (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). However, despite a physical interaction between rA<sub>14</sub>-A<sub>18</sub> and Nef that was detectable by co-immunoprecipitation and SPR assays, this mutant was resistant to antagonism and restricted virus release to an extent comparable to human tetherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Therefore, although a physical interaction may be necessary for tetherin antagonism by Nef, it is not sufficient. This raises the possibility that the anti-tetherin activity of Nef may require the recruitment of one or more additional cellular factors that participate in interactions with the G/D<sub>14</sub>DIWK<sub>18</sub> sequence.</p>

<title>Tetherin antagonism is separable from CD4-dowregulation, MHC class I-downregulation and infectivity enhancement</title>
<p>To determine if substitutions that impair tetherin antagonism also disrupt other activities of Nef, the Nef mutants were tested for CD4-downregulation, MHC I-downregulation and infectivity enhancement; three functional activities of Nef that require distinct protein sequences and cellular pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Swigut1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Pizzato1">[40]</xref>. CD4− and MHC class I-downregulation assays were performed by electroporating Jurkat cells with bicistronic constructs that express wild-type Nef, or a mutant Nef protein, together with green fluorescent protein (GFP), and comparing the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD4 and MHC class I staining on the surface of cells expressing Nef to cells transfected with an empty vector (pCGCG) (Figures S4 and S5). Infectivity enhancement was measured by infecting GHOST X4/R5 cells, which express GFP in response to HIV-1 or SIV infection, with SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 Δ<italic>nef trans</italic>-complemented with wild-type Nef or each of the Nef mutants, and measuring the percentage of infected GFP<sup>+</sup> cells by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003487.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the 43 Nef mutants with impaired anti-tetherin activity, only 5 retained the ability to downregulate CD4 within 3 standard deviations of wild-type Nef (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, black dotted line). In contrast, 16 of the mutants retained the ability to downregulate MHC I within 3 standard deviations of wild-type Nef (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, black dotted line). Whereas substitutions in the N-terminal domain and flexible loop region, with the exception of substitutions at positions 5–6 and 74–75, had little or no effect on MHC I-downregulation, many of the substitutions in the globular core impaired this activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003487.s005">S5</xref>). In most cases, the loss of MHC I-downregulation corresponded with a partial decrease in Nef protein levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003487-t001">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that the effects of these mutations were not necessarily specific to this function of Nef. Nevertheless, five Nef mutants with impaired anti-tetherin activity, and no significant effects on protein stability, retained the ability to downregulate both CD4 and MHC I molecules. These included Nef mutants with substitutions at positions 106–107, 181–182, 193–194, 199–200 and 209–210 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003487-t001">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, tetherin antagonism is separable from CD4− and MHC class I-downregulation.</p>

<title>CD4-downregulation, MHC class I-downregulation and infectivity enhancement mediated by SIV Nef mutants with impaired anti-tetherin activity.</title>
<p>The surface expression of CD4 (A) and MHC class I (B) was compared on cells expressing each of the SIV Nef mutants. Jurkat cells were electroporated with a bicistronic vector (pCGCG) expressing either wild-type Nef or the indicated Nef mutants together with GFP. Cells were stained with a PerCP-conjugated monoclonal antibody to CD4 and an APC-conjugated monoclonal antibody to HLA class I molecules. Cells were gated on the GFP<sup>+</sup> cell population and the percentage of CD4 and MHC I on the cell surface was determined relative to cells transfected with empty vector. Error bars indicate the standard deviation of duplicate transfections, and the black and red dotted lines correspond, respectively, to 3 and 5 standard deviations over the activity of wild-type Nef. (C) The Nef mutants with impaired anti-tetherin activity were also tested for infectivity enhancement. Viruses were generated by transient transfection of 293T cells with SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 Δ<italic>nef</italic> proviral DNA and constructs expressing each of the Nef mutants, wild-type Nef or an empty vector. The infectivity of these viruses was then determined on GHOST X4/R5 cells, which express GFP upon SIV infection, 48 hours post-inoculation by flow cytometry. The relative infectivity of SIV Δ<italic>nef trans</italic>-complemented with the Nef mutants was calculated relative to SIV Δ<italic>nef trans</italic>-complemented with wild-type Nef. Virus infectivity in the absence of Nef is indicated by the white bars, and the activities mediated by wild-type Nef and the G<sub>2</sub>A myristoylaton site mutant are indicated by black and red bars, respectively. Error bars indicate the standard deviation of duplicate infections, and the black and red dotted lines correspond, respectively, to 3 and 5 standard deviations over the infectivity of SIV Δ<italic>nef</italic> without <italic>trans</italic>-complementation. Substitutions in the N-terminal domain are indicated by green bars, substitutions in the globular core domain are indicated by blue bars, and substitutions in the flexible loop region are indicated by orange bars.</p>

<p>The infectivity of SIV Δ<italic>nef trans</italic>-complemented with each of the Nef mutants relative to SIV Δ<italic>nef trans</italic>-complemented with wild-type Nef was also determined to assess the effects of the substitutions on Nef-mediated infectivity enhancement. To control for assay-to-assay variation in the susceptibility of the GHOST X4/R5 cells to infection, the percentage of infected cells obtained for each of the Nef mutants was normalized to the percentage of infected cells obtained for wild-type Nef. Nef mutants were considered to retain the ability to enhance virus infectivity if the relative infectivity was at least 5 standard deviations above the infectivity of SIV Δ<italic>nef trans</italic>-complemented with an empty vector (pCGCG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). This analysis identified 12 Nef mutants that were impaired for infectivity enhancement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003487.s006">Figure S6A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003487.s006">S6C</xref>). In accordance with previous observations, the G<sub>2</sub>A substitution in SIV Nef did not have a significant effect on virus infectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Fackler1">[41]</xref>. Consistent with a study of this function of HIV-1 Nef <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Pizzato1">[40]</xref>, all of these mutants also lost the ability to bind to dynamin 2 (Dyn2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003487.s006">Figure S6D</xref>). Of these 12 Nef mutants, 10 also exhibited impaired anti-tetherin activity, suggesting that tetherin antagonism and infectivity enhancement may be linked, perhaps by a common dependence on a physical interaction with Dyn2. However, two of the substitutions in the core domain at positions 94–95 and 98–99 that disrupted infectivity enhancement did not significantly affect anti-tetherin activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g002">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003487.s006">S6B</xref>). Moreover, three of the substitutions that disrupted binding to Dyn2 (82–83, 146–147 and 168–169) did not impair binding to rhesus tetherin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003487-t002">Table 2</xref>). Thus, Nef appears to use distinct surfaces to bind Dyn2 and tetherin. In addition, since all but 10 of the 43 Nef mutants lacking anti-tetherin activity retained the ability to enhance infectivity, including the 5 mutants that retained both CD4− and MHC class I-downregulation, infectivity enhancement is independent of tetherin antagonism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g005">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003487-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

In addition, substitutions at positions 181–182, 199–200 and 209–210, not previously identified as AP-2 binding sites or known to be involved in the anti-tetherin activity of Nef, also impaired tetherin downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g006">Figure 6B and 6D</xref>).

Immunoprecipitates were separated by electrophoresis and western blots were probed with antibodies to Nef, α2, μ2 and tetherin. Wild-type Nef co-immunoprecipitated with α2 and μ2, both in the absence and in the presence of tetherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g006">Figures 6E and 6F</xref>). As expected, substitutions in the di-leucine and di-acidic motifs of Nef (193–194, 195–196, 203–204, 205–206) greatly diminished binding to both subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g006">Figures 6E and 6F</xref>). Substitutions at positions flanking these motifs (181–182 and 209–210) also disrupted binding to α2 and to μ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g006">Figures 6E and 6F</xref>). Whereas in the absence of tetherin, substitutions at positions 181–182, 203–204, 205–206 and 209–210 eliminated Nef binding to μ2, and substitutions at positions 193–194, 195–196, and 199–200 reduced Nef binding to μ2, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g006">Figure 6E</xref>), the binding of these Nef mutants to μ2 was partially restored in the presence of tetherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). These results suggest that the loss of anti-tetherin activity for each of the flexible loop mutants reflects a deficit in Nef binding to AP-2, and raises the possibility that AP-2 may form a multimeric complex with both Nef and tetherin that stabilizes an otherwise low affinity direct interaction between these two proteins.</p>

<title>Tetherin antagonism by Nef is dependent on dynamin 2 and clathrin</title>
<p>Since the activities of HIV-1 Vpu and HIV-2 Env in downregulating tetherin and facilitating virus release were recently shown to be dependent on AP180, a component of the clathrin assembly complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Lau1">[30]</xref>, and dynamin 2 (Dyn2), an ubiquitously expressed GTPase required for the scission of vesicular membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Urrutia1">[45]</xref>, we asked whether tetherin antagonism by Nef also requires AP180 and Dyn2. The effects of dominant-negative mutants of Dyn2 (Dyn2K44A) and AP180 (AP180C) on the surface expression of tetherin, and on virus release, were therefore tested in 293T cells expressing HA-tagged rhesus macaque tetherin. As a control, we also included the dominant-negative mutant of dynamin 1 (Dyn1K44A), which is exclusively expressed in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Cao1">[46]</xref>. Changes in tetherin expression on the cell surface were assessed by flow cytometry after co-transfection with constructs expressing Dyn2K44A, Dyn2, Dyn1K44A or AP180C, with or without Nef (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). In the absence of Nef, Dyn1K44A, Dyn2K44A and AP180C all slightly increased surface levels of tetherin, whereas wild-type Dyn2 decreased surface levels of tetherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), which may reflect a role for dynamin and clathrin in the constitutive endocytosis of tetherin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Rollason1">[44]</xref>. In the presence of Nef, the effects of the dominant-negative mutants were more pronounced. Whereas SIV Nef reduced the surface expression of rhesus tetherin by 2- to 3-fold, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Jia1">[15]</xref>, this effect was almost completely reversed by AP180C and Dyn2K44A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Although Dyn1K44A also increased the overall levels of tetherin at the cell surface, as shown in transfections with the empty vector, Nef was still able to downregulate tetherin in the presence of Dyn1K44A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Likewise, in the presence of wild-type Dyn2, Nef further decreased the surface levels of tetherin. These results demonstrate that the downregulation of tetherin by Nef is dependent, at least in part, on clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</p>

<title>Tetherin antagonism by Nef depends on clathrin and dynamin 2.</title>
<p>(A) Dominant-negative mutants of AP180 and Dyn2 were tested for disruption of Nef-mediated tetherin downregulation. 293T cells expressing HA-tagged rhesus tetherin were transfected with constructs expressing Nef, or empty vector, and constructs expressing AP180C, Dyn1K44A, Dyn2K44A and Dyn2. Surface expression of tetherin was measured by HA staining, and the percentage of tetherin expressed on the cell surface was determined by dividing the MFI of tetherin on cells expressing the dominant-negative mutants by the MFI of tetherin on cells transfected with empty vectors. (B) The dominant-negative mutants of AP180 and Dyn2 were also tested for their effects on Nef-mediated virus release. 293T cells were transfected with SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 or SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 Δ<italic>nef</italic> proviral DNA, and constructs expressing rhesus tetherin, and either AP180C, Dyn1K44A, Dyn2K44A, Dyn2 or empty vector. Virus release was measured by SIV p27 antigen-capture ELISA and expressed as the percentage of maximal release in the absence of tetherin. (C) Protein expression for Nef, tetherin, AP180C, Dyn1K44A, Dyn2K44A and Dyn2 was verified by western blot analyses using endogenous β-actin as a loading control. (D) Replication of wild-type SIV (WT SIV) versus SIV Δ<italic>nef</italic> in the presence and absence of Dynasore. 221 T cells were infected with 20 ng p27 of wild-type SIV or SIV Δ<italic>nef</italic>. Twenty-four hours post-infection, cells were treated with IFNα (100 U). Eight hours later, Dynasore (20 µM) was added to one of the cultures.

<p>To further confirm that Dyn2 and clathrin are required for tetherin antagonism by Nef, virus release for wild-type SIV versus SIV Δ<italic>nef</italic> was compared in the presence and absence of each of the dominant-negative mutants. 293T cells were co-transfected with proviral DNA for SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 or SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 Δ<italic>nef</italic>, together with a construct expressing rhesus macaque tetherin and expression constructs for AP180C, Dyn1K44A, Dyn2K44A or Dyn2, and the accumulation of virus particles in the cell culture supernatant was measured by SIV p27 antigen-capture ELISA. Whereas AP180C and Dyn2K44A completely abrogated the resistance of wild-type SIV to rhesus tetherin, as indicated by comparable levels of virus release for SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 and SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 Δ<italic>nef</italic>, virus release for wild-type SIV was not significantly affected by Dyn1K44A or Dyn2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Western blot analyses of cell lysates confirmed protein expression for tetherin, Nef and the dominant-negative mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). None of the dominant-negative mutants inhibited tetherin expression. On the contrary, increased steady-state levels were observed in the presence of AP180C, Dyn1K44A and Dyn2K44A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), consistent with the modest increase in cell surface expression of tetherin in the absence of Nef (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).</p>
<p>A role for Dyn2 in the anti-tetherin activity of Nef was further investigated by comparing virus replication of wild-type SIV and <italic>nef</italic>-deleted SIV with or without Dynasore, a chemical inhibitor of dynamin. A <italic>Herpesvirus saimiri</italic>-immortalized rhesus macaque CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Alexander1">[47]</xref>, was infected with SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 and SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 Δ<italic>nef</italic>, treated with IFNα to upregulate tetherin, and maintained in medium with or without Dynasore. While Dynasore had little effect on the replication of SIV Δ<italic>nef</italic>, which was suppressed relative to wild-type SIV by the IFNα-induced upregulation of tetherin, Dynasore significantly reduced wild-type SIV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Indeed, wild-type SIV replication in the presence of Dynasore was comparable to SIV Δ<italic>nef</italic> replication, suggesting that this compound fully negated the resistance provided by Nef to the antiviral effects of tetherin. However, since Dyn2 is also required for infectivity enhancement by Nef <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Pizzato1">[40]</xref>, these results may reflect an additional effect of Dynasore on viral infectivity.</p>

<title>Nef promotes the internalization of tetherin in SIV-infected cells</title>
<p>Changes in the subcellular distribution of tetherin in the presence of Nef were examined in uninfected and SIV-infected cells by confocal microscopy. 293T cells expressing HA-tagged rhesus tetherin were infected with VSV-G-pseudotyped SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 Δ<italic>env</italic> and stained for Nef and tetherin. In uninfected cells, tetherin was observed at the plasma membrane and within the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g008">Figure 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003487.s007">Figure S7</xref>), as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Habermann1">[48]</xref>. However, in SIV-infected cells, the overwhelming majority of tetherin was observed within intracellular compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). To better define the subcellular distribution of tetherin, cells were stained for markers of the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN46), endosomes (CD63) and lysosomes (LAMP-1). In some cells, tetherin co-localized with TGN46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g009">Figure 9A</xref>), but did not appear to co-localize with CD63 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). These results suggest that Nef may partially retain tetherin within the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network with little or no sequestration in endosomes. However, in the majority of the SIV-infected cells, tetherin was found to co-localize with LAMP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g009">Figure 9C</xref>), but not in uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003487.s007">Figure S7</xref>). These observations were supported by quantifying the extent of tetherin co-localization with TGN46, CD63 and LAMP-1 by calculating the Pearson's correlation coefficients for these markers in twenty SIV-infected cells. Although the distribution of cells exhibiting co-localization of tetherin with TGN46 was heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003487-g009">Figure 9D</xref>), it was higher than the extent of co-localization with CD63 (P = 0.042). In the case of LAMP-1, the extent of co-localization with tetherin was significantly higher than for either TGN46 (P = 0.0048) or CD63 (P&lt;0.000001). Therefore, similar to the effects of Nef on CD4 and MHC class I trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Schaefer1">[49]</xref>, Nef appears to direct tetherin to lysosomes.</p>

In accordance with the species-dependent activity of Nef in opposing restriction by tetherin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Jia1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Zhang1">[16]</xref>, we show for the first time that Nef selectively binds to rhesus macaque tetherin, but not to human tetherin. We identify residues in the N-terminus, globular core and flexible loop of Nef that are required for anti-tetherin activity, and demonstrate that, despite substantial overlap with sequences required for CD4 downregulation, tetherin antagonism is genetically separable from this activity, as well as from other Nef functions including MHC class I downregulation and infectivity enhancement. We also show that dominant-negative mutants of AP180 and Dyn2 impair tetherin antagonism by Nef, indicating that this activity is dependent, at least in part, on clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</p>
<p>Co-immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance assays revealed a selective physical interaction between SIV Nef and rhesus tetherin. The specificity of this interaction is determined by binding of the core domain of Nef to the cytoplasmic domain of tetherin, since a truncated form of the SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 Nef protein, containing the globular core of the protein, was sufficient for binding to a peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of rhesus tetherin. However, the affinity of this interaction was low (K<sub>d</sub>∼400 µM), suggesting that additional Nef sequences, and perhaps one or more cellular co-factors, contribute to the stability of this interaction in virus-infected cells. In support of this, an analysis of alanine-scanning substitutions identified sequences in the N-terminal, globular core and flexible loop domains of Nef that participate in binding to rhesus tetherin. Although the N-terminal domain and flexible loop were dispensable for binding by SPR, these sequences were required to detect an interaction by co-immunoprecipitation. The contribution of the N-terminus of Nef to interactions with tetherin may reflect an indirect effect on membrane association, since the targeting of Nef to cellular membranes is dependent on the myristyolation of a glycine residue at position 2, and structural studies suggest that the N-terminus of Nef is disordered in the absence of phospholipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Geyer1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Franken1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Sigalov1">[54]</xref>. Substitutions at positions 116–117, 174–175 in the globular core domain, and positions 181–182, 193–194, 195–196 and 199–200 in the flexible loop region also reduced binding to rhesus tetherin. Since the flexible loop contains a di-leucine and a di-acidic motif (E<sub>190</sub>xxxLM and D<sub>204</sub>D) required for binding to the AP-2 subunits (α2-σ2 and μ2, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Chaudhuri1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Roeth1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Chaudhuri2">[56]</xref>, and substitutions in these sites disrupt tetherin antagonism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Zhang2">[37]</xref>, it is conceivable that AP-2 stabilizes the binding of Nef to tetherin. Indeed, Nef was recently shown to form a trimolecular complex with the μ1 subunit of AP-1 to stabilize an otherwise low affinity bimolecular interaction with the cytoplasmic tail of MHC class I molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Singh1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Jia2">[58]</xref>. In support of a possible trimeric complex with AP-2, Nef and rhesus tetherin both co-immunoprecipitated with the μ2 and α2 subunits of AP-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Mitchell1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Rollason1">[44]</xref>. Taken together, these results suggest a model in which the specificity of SIV Nef for rhesus tetherin is driven by a direct physical interaction between the core domain of Nef and the N-terminus of tetherin, which is stabilized by residues in the N-terminal domain and flexible loop region, either through direct contacts or indirect effects on membrane association and/or the recruitment of additional cellular co-factor(s).</p>
<p>A systematic analysis of alanine-scanning substitutions throughout the SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 Nef protein identified a total of 43 mutations that impaired anti-tetherin activity. Substitutions in the C-terminal domain were not tested, since deletion of these sequences did not affect tetherin antagonism. Most of the mutations that disrupted the anti-tetherin activity of Nef also disrupted CD4-downregulation, MHC I-downregulation or infectivity enhancement. In some cases, both CD4− and MHC I-downregulation were lost due to effects on the association of Nef with cellular membranes, such as the G<sub>2</sub>A mutation and probably also the adjacent substitutions at positions 5–6. In other cases, these activities were lost due to a decrease in Nef expression or stability. While this was most evident for the changes at positions 178–179 and 180–181, some of the substitutions in the globular core domain also had partial effects on steady-state levels of Nef that may account for their reduced activity in CD4 and MHC class I downregulation assays. Although there was substantial overlap with sequences required for CD4-downregulation, five mutations were identified that disrupted the anti-tetherin activity of Nef, while retaining nearly wild-type levels of CD4-downregulation, as well as MHC class I-downregulation and infectivity enhancement. These mutations included alanine substitutions at positions 106–107 in the core domain and at positions 181–182, 193–194, 199–200 and 209–210 in the flexible loop region. Thus, tetherin antagonism by Nef is genetically separable from other functional activities of the protein.</p>
<p>In addition to the sequences identified by Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Zhang2">[37]</xref>, we identified residues in the flexible loop region outside of the known AP-2 binding sites that separate tetherin antagonism from CD4-downregulation. Substitutions at positions 181–182 and 199–200 (residues N<sub>181</sub>V<sub>182</sub> and Q<sub>199</sub>T<sub>200</sub> in SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 Nef) specifically impaired the anti-tetherin activity of Nef without affecting CD4-downregulation. These residues are well conserved among Nef alleles of SIV<sub>smm/mac</sub> and HIV-2 isolates, with identities of 61.1% for N<sub>181</sub>, 75% for V<sub>182</sub>, 94.4% for Q<sub>199</sub> and 84.7% for T<sub>200</sub> (Los Alamos database; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index" xlink:type="simple">http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index</ext-link>). Co-immunoprecipitation assays further demonstrated that these residues contribute to AP-2 binding. Our mutational analysis also identified residues in the N-terminal and globular core domains of Nef that are important for tetherin antagonism. Thus, our results reveal that the anti-tetherin activity of Nef is dependent on complex interactions involving multiple residues in the N-terminus, globular core and the flexible loop regions of the protein.</p>
<p>Nef is a multifunctional accessory protein that interacts with a number of different cellular factors to modulate cellular trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Roeth1">[55]</xref>. Nef reroutes MHC I molecules from the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network to lysosomes via AP-1 and promotes the internalization and lysosomal degradation of CD4 via AP-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Roeth1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Roeth2">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Jin1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Stove1">[61]</xref>. Nef also enhances virus infectivity by an undefined mechanism that depends on a physical interaction with Dyn2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Pizzato1">[40]</xref>. We previously demonstrated that Nef downmodulates tetherin from the surface of SIV-infected and transfected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Jia1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-SerraMoreno2">[36]</xref>, and this activity was later shown to occur by an AP-2-dependent pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Zhang2">[37]</xref>. Our experiments with dominant-negative mutants of AP180 and Dyn2 confirm that the internalization of tetherin by Nef, and the capacity of Nef to rescue virus release in the presence of tetherin, depends, at least in part, on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. A role for Dyn2 was further demonstrated by showing that Dynasore, a chemical inhibitor of dynamin, suppressed wild-type SIV replication to an extent comparable to <italic>nef</italic>-deleted SIV under conditions of interferon-induced upregulation of tetherin. Since Dyn2 is also required for Nef-mediated infectivity enhancement, the inhibition of virus replication by Dynasore may reflect an additional effect of this compound on virus infectivity. Although tetherin antagonism and infectivity enhancement are genetically separable, 10 of the 12 Nef mutants that lost the ability to enhance virus infectivity, and to bind to Dyn2, also lost the ability to counteract tetherin. The concordance of these activities suggests that a physical interaction with Dyn2 may be necessary for both Nef functions. However, two of the mutations in the globular core disrupted infectivity enhancement and binding to Dyn2 without impairing tetherin antagonism. Moreover, three of the mutants with impaired infectivity enhancement and binding to Dyn2 (mutants 82–83, 146–147 and 168–169) did not lose binding to tetherin, suggesting that Nef uses distinct protein surfaces to bind to Dyn2 and to tetherin. Therefore, unlike infectivity enhancement, the anti-tetherin activity of Nef does not depend on a physical interaction with Dyn2.</p>
<p>Consistent with previous studies demonstrating the downmodulation of rhesus tetherin by Nef <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Jia1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-SerraMoreno2">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Zhang2">[37]</xref>, SIV infection resulted in a striking redistribution of tetherin from the plasma membrane to compartments within the cell. An analysis of the distribution of tetherin in SIV-infected cells revealed co-localization with TGN46 and LAMP-1, but not with CD63, suggesting that in the presence of Nef, tetherin accumulates in the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network and in lysosomes. Localization of tetherin to the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network in uninfected cells has previously been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Habermann1">[48]</xref>. Thus, the contribution of Nef to directing tetherin to that compartment is unclear. The trafficking of tetherin to lysosomes raises the possibility that, similar to the effect of HIV-1 Nef on CD4 and MHC class I molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003487-Schaefer1">[49]</xref>, SIV Nef may direct rhesus tetherin for lysosomal degradation.</p>
<p>In summary, we show that the mechanism of tetherin antagonism by SIV Nef; (1) involves a direct physical interaction between the core domain of Nef and the cytoplasmic domain of rhesus tetherin, (2) requires sequences throughout the N-terminal, globular core and flexible loop domains, yet is genetically separable from other functional activities of Nef, and (3) depends, at least in part, on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. These results begin to reveal the molecular interactions and cellular pathways by which the majority of the primate lentiviruses counteract the tetherin proteins of their non-human primate hosts.</p>

Cell lysate (200 µl) was set aside to confirm tetherin and Nef expression by western blot analysis, and the rest of the sample (200 µl) was used for immunoprecipitation. Samples for immunoprecipitation were incubated on a rotating platform for 1 hour at 4°C with 1 µg of the anti-tetherin mouse monoclonal antibody 3H4 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Protein A sepharose beads or Protein A sepharose magnetic beads (50 µl) (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) were then added, and the incubation was continued overnight at 4°C. The beads were washed ten times in Lysis buffer (500 µl) and boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer. Denatured proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. The blots were probed with the monoclonal antibody 17.2 to detect Nef, a mouse monoclonal to detect GFP (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), a monoclonal antibody to detect the α2 subunit of AP-2 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), a rabbit monoclonal to detect the μ2 subunit of AP-2 (abcam, Cambridge, MA) at a dilution of 1∶1000, or a polyclonal antibody against tetherin (abcam, Cambridge, MA) at a dilution of 1∶500.

Purified samples of full-length, core domain or flexible loop deletion mutants of SIV<sub>mac</sub>239 Nef protein were injected at a flow rate of 5 µl/min over each experimental and control flow cell generating SPR sensorgrams. The sensorgram from the control cell was subtracted from the sensorgram of each experimental flow cell to correct for any nonspecific interaction with the CM5 or neutravidin surface. No regeneration step was required. Experiments were run in triplicate.
