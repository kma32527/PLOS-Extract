<abstract>
<p>Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a neurotropic virus causing vesicular oral or genital skin lesions, meningitis and other diseases particularly harmful in immunocompromised individuals. To comprehensively investigate the complex interaction between HSV-1 and its host we combined two genome-scale screens for host factors (HFs) involved in virus replication. A yeast two-hybrid screen for protein interactions and a RNA interference (RNAi) screen with a druggable genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) library confirmed existing and identified novel HFs which functionally influence HSV-1 infection. Bioinformatic analyses found the 358 HFs were enriched for several pathways and multi-protein complexes. Of particular interest was the identification of Med23 as a strongly anti-viral component of the largely pro-viral Mediator complex, which links specific transcription factors to RNA polymerase II. The anti-viral effect of Med23 on HSV-1 replication was confirmed in gain-of-function gene overexpression experiments, and this inhibitory effect was specific to HSV-1, as a range of other viruses including Vaccinia virus and Semliki Forest virus were unaffected by Med23 depletion. We found Med23 significantly upregulated expression of the type III interferon family (IFN-λ) at the mRNA and protein level by directly interacting with the transcription factor IRF7. The synergistic effect of Med23 and IRF7 on IFN-λ induction suggests this is the major transcription factor for IFN-λ expression. Genotypic analysis of patients suffering recurrent orofacial HSV-1 outbreaks, previously shown to be deficient in IFN-λ secretion, found a significant correlation with a single nucleotide polymorphism in the IFN-λ3 (IL28b) promoter strongly linked to Hepatitis C disease and treatment outcome. This paper describes a link between Med23 and IFN-λ, provides evidence for the crucial role of IFN-λ in HSV-1 immune control, and highlights the power of integrative genome-scale approaches to identify HFs critical for disease progression and outcome.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infects the vast majority of the global population. Whilst most people experience the relatively mild symptoms of cold sores, some individuals suffer more serious diseases like viral meningitis and encephalitis. HSV-1 is also becoming more common as a cause of genital herpes, traditionally associated with HSV-2 infection. Co-infection with HSV-2 is a major contributor to HIV transmission, so a better understanding of HSV-1/HSV-2 disease has wide implications for global healthcare. After initial infection, all herpesviruses have the ability to remain dormant, and can awaken to cause a symptomatic infection at any stage. Whether the virus remains dormant or active is the result of a finely tuned balance between our immune system and evasion techniques developed by the virus. In this study we have found a new method by which the replication of the virus is counteracted. The cellular protein Med23 was found to actively induce an innate anti-viral immune response in the form of the Type III interferons (IFN-lambda), by binding IRF7, a key regulator of interferons, and modulating its activity. Interferon lambda is well known to be important in the control of Hepatitis C infection, and a genetic mutation correlating to an increase in interferon lambda levels is strongly linked to clearance of infection. Here we find the same association between this genetic mutation and the clinical severity of recurrent cases of HSV-1 infection (coldsores). These data identify a Med23-interferon lambda regulatory axis of innate immunity, show that interferon lambda plays a significant role in HSV-1 infection, and contribute to the expanding evidence for interferon lambda in disease control.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Up to 90% of the global population is infected with the α-herpesvirus Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1). Whilst HSV-1 is largely responsible for outbreaks of vesicular oral skin lesions (fever blisters, or cold sores), it can also cause a variety of more severe diseases including encephalitis, meningitis and keratitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Arduino1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Karasneh1">[2]</xref>. Furthermore, the frequency of association with genital lesions (previously associated mainly with HSV-2 infection) is increasing. As co-infection with HSV is a significant contributing factor to transmission of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), our understanding of HSV disease, and herpesviruses in general, has wide implications for global healthcare.</p>
<p>Like all herpesviruses, HSV-1 establishes lytic (epithelial cells) and asymptomatic latent infection (sensory neurons in trigeminal and sacral ganglia) which undergoes periodic reactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Roizman1">[3]</xref>. The equilibrium between these two infection states requires a fine balance between innate and adaptive immune responses, and viral immune evasion mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Griffin1">[4]</xref>. Whilst aspects of the HSV-1 replication cycle have been intensively investigated, there remain gaps in our understanding of the complexity of virus:host interactions. For example, a proteomics study identified over 100 changes in the cellular proteome within the first 6h of infection with HSV-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Antrobus1">[5]</xref>, and a recent analysis of virion-incorporated cellular proteins found that about 30% of these directly affected virus growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Stegen1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>To systematically identify host factors (HFs) required for viral replication, RNAi screens have been performed with a range of different RNA and DNA viruses including HIV-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Brass1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Konig1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Zhou1">[9]</xref>, Influenza A virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Brass2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Karlas1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Konig2">[12]</xref>, Hepatitis C virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Li1">[13]</xref>, West Nile virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Krishnan1">[14]</xref>, Dengue virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Sessions1">[15]</xref>, Enterovirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Coyne1">[16]</xref> and Vaccinia virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Mercer1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Sivan1">[18]</xref>. The overlap between the results of these studies is generally very low <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Bushman1">[19]</xref>, reflecting either differences in biology, or different experimental set-ups, cutoff and selection criteria. In addition, microenvironmental effects might also play a role for the differences of the results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Snijder1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>Whilst loss-of-function siRNA screens provide functional information on specific genes, protein interaction studies can provide insight into the mechanism of action by identifying physical interaction partners between pathogen and host. Genome-scale virus-host protein interaction screens using the yeast-two-hybrid system have been performed for HCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-deChassey1">[21]</xref>, Influenza A virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Shapira1">[22]</xref>, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Calderwood1">[23]</xref>, Vaccinia virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-McCraith1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Zhang1">[25]</xref>, SARS coronavirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Pfefferle1">[26]</xref> and several non-human viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Friedel1">[27]</xref>. Based on these genome-scale studies and individual interactions found by literature curation, several virus-host interaction databases have been created including the HIV-1, human protein interaction database at NCBI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Fu1">[28]</xref>, VirHostNet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Navratil1">[29]</xref>, VirusMINT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Chatraryamontri1">[30]</xref>, PIG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Driscoll1">[31]</xref> and HPIDB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Kumar1">[32]</xref>. Although there is little overlap between individual cellular interactors of different viruses, targeting of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, nuclear transport and immune response appears to be conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Dyer1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>Understanding the complex interplay between viral and host components is critical to the definition of herpesvirus infection and pathogenesis. As herpesviruses encode a large number of proteins, in contrast to small RNA viruses such as HIV and Influenza, many cellular processes may be directly affected by viral proteins, and whilst there exists a wealth of information on individual viral proteins, there remain large gaps in our understanding of the HSV-1 life cycle and its interaction with its host. Here, we present data from the first integrative and systematic screening approach to characterise the role of cellular proteins in the HSV-1 life cycle. A genome-scale RNAi knockdown screen to identify HFs functionally influencing HSV-1 replication was performed in parallel with a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) protein interaction screen to simultaneously gain insight into potential mechanisms of action. Combined analyses confirmed the importance of known cellular proteins involved in processes such as cell cycle, proteins transport and gene expression important for virus replication. Furthermore, we identified a subunit of the Mediator multi-protein complex, Med23, as a key regulator of IFN-λ induction, which appears to be of crucial significance for the control of HSV-1 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. These data demonstrate the power of a combined screening strategy to investigate pathogen:host interactions and identify novel host factors and cellular pathway targets for the development of essential clinical interventions.</p>

<title>A siRNA depletion screen identifies host factors (HFs) for HSV-1 replication</title>
<p>Host factors (HFs) which positively or negatively regulate HSV-1 replication were identified by screening a druggable genome siRNA library (4 siRNAs per gene) targeting 7,237 human genes against a HSV-1 reporter virus expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP; HSV-1 strain C12) in the epithelial Hela cell line, due to their ease of transfection and susceptibility to HSV-1 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Arthur1">[34]</xref>.

<title>A genome-scale yeast two-hybrid protein interaction screen identifies novel viral protein interaction partners</title>
<p>HSV-1 is currently known to encode at least 84 proteins, expressed sequentially under strict temporal regulation during infection. To gain further mechanistic insight into host factors involved in HSV-1 infection, in parallel to the siRNA depletion screen we carried out a yeast two-hybrid protein interaction screen to identify cellular interaction partners of viral proteins. We generated a collection of 107 partial and full-length HSV-1 cDNA constructs and tested them for interactions with proteins encoded by a library of 12,381 human cDNA clones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Lamesch1">[35]</xref>. 231 HSV-1-human protein interactions were detected once (low confidence), and 63 more than once (high-confidence)(<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s002">Table S3 in Text S2</xref></bold>). Using these high-confidence interactions, the previously reported HSV-1 interactome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Uetz1">[36]</xref> was connected into a human interactome (62,310 published protein interactions) to generate a combined pathogen-host interactome (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s003">Figure S1a</xref></bold>). Both degree centrality (which indicates the number of interactions a protein has, where high values represent highly interactive ‘hubs’) and betweenness centrality (which indicates the number of shortest paths between any pair of proteins passing through the protein considered) were significantly increased for HSV-1 interactors, particularly in the high-confidence network (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s003">Figure S1b–e</xref></bold>). These data suggest HSV-1 proteins preferentially target highly connected central human proteins in the cellular interaction network, similar to other viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Calderwood1">[23]</xref>.</p>

<title>Validity and specificity of HSV-1 HFs</title>
<p>An extended literature and database search identified 599 cellular proteins that interact with or are involved in infection with human herpesviruses.

Of the 45 interactions tested, 26 (57.8%) were confirmed, with 15 strongly positive (z-score &gt;2) and 11 weakly positive (z-score 1–2) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s003">Figure S1g</xref></bold>). siRNA deconvolution (4 siRNAs per gene tested individually) was used to further validate 72 HFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003514-g002"><bold>Figure 2b</bold></xref><bold>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s004">Figure S2</xref></bold>). The replication phenotype could be confirmed (≥2 or more siRNAs gave the same or better replication slope than observed in the primary screen) in a high proportion (83.3%) of candidates, highlighting the reliability of the primary screen dataset. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of mRNA expression levels found a minimum depletion of 60% (mean 88%) in a subset of 52 genes (data not shown; <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s002">Table S6 in Text S2</xref></bold>) confirming the observed effects on HSV-1 replication are genuine and not due to ‘off-target’ effects or insufficient gene knockdown. To further investigate the virus-specificity of our identified HFs, we tested this subset for their effect on the replication of an additional α-herpesvirus (Varicella-Zoster virus, VZV), the β-herpesvirus Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and a completely unrelated RNA virus, Semliki Forest Virus (SFV). None of the three proteins which enhanced HSV-1 replication upon knockdown had an effect on either VZV or CMV, and one (<italic>NR3C2</italic>) was even inhibitory for SFV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003514-g002"><bold>Figure 2c</bold></xref>). Of the 64 siRNAs which inhibited HSV-1, 27 (42.2%) were also inhibitory for VZV, 60 for CMV (93.8%) and 23 (35.9%) for SFV replication (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s002">Table S7 in Text S2</xref></bold>). Some functional groups (transcriptional regulators) were required by most viruses, but there were notable differences between other proteins. For example IFITM-1, previously identified as an inhibitor of Influenza A, Dengue virus and WNV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Brass2">[10]</xref>, inhibited VZV yet had a positive effect on HSV-1 replication. These data suggest that whilst there are some HFs which are broad in their effects on virus replication, a large proportion are species-specific.</p>

(b) Validation of a subset of HFs by siRNA deconvolution. A subset of HFs was selected for validation with deconvoluted siRNAs to confirm the phenotype observed in the primary screen. The effect of the four individual siRNAs (1–4) and a reconstituted SMARTpool (SP) were tested by reverse-transfecting into Hela cells before infecting after 48 h with HSV-1-eGFP (C12) and monitoring replication. Replication slopes were calculated and normalized as described, and compared to the primary screen slope (1°).

Pathways included those involved in gene expression, transcription, splicing and translational regulation (RNAi screen), and protein transport, cell cycle, and transcriptional repressor activity (Y2H screen). A combined analysis of HFs from both screens found dominant functional categories centred on the regulation of transcription (RNA polymerase II-associated genes, splicing factors, transcription activation and the Mediator complex) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s005">Figure S3c, d</xref></bold>). The physiological relevance of some HFs and pathways was confirmed by further biological validation. Protein transport pathways (in the form of dynein microtubule networks) are exploited by HSV-1 early after infection to shuttle viral capsids to the nucleus. These screens confirmed known interactions between dynein subunits and viral proteins, and identified additional previously unknown interactions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s001">Text S1</xref> and</bold> <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s006">Figure S4a</xref></bold>). Several dynein chain subunits were found to be essential for virus replication, whilst the moderate effect of depletion of other subunits demonstrated a level of functional redundancy in HSV-1 capsid transport (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s006">Figure S4b–e</xref></bold>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Dohner1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Radtke1">[39]</xref>. Intrinsic anti-viral host defense mechanisms, in the context of cellular E2 ubiquitin ligases, were also investigated.

<title>Med23 inhibits HSV-1 replication by inducing a type III interferon (IFN-λ) response</title>
<p>Med23 could exert anti-viral effects either by having an inhibitory effect on viral transactivators or by interacting with and having a positive effect on an existing anti-viral factor. We first tested whether Med23 directly affects viral gene expression using luciferase reporters with HSV-1 promoters, however observed no inhibitory effect (data not shown). Since the Mediator complex and Med23 in particular is known to be involved in Jak/Stat-mediated interferon signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Lau1">[42]</xref>, we used the lung epithelial cell line A549 and its Stat-1-deficient derivative A549-V <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Hayman1">[43]</xref> to determine if Med23 influences HSV-1 replication by modulating innate immunity. In the parental A549 cells the phenotype of HSV-1 replication was the same as that observed in Hela cells, where depletion of Med23 enhanced replication and over-expression inhibited virus growth. However, in the Stat1-deficient A549-V cells HSV-1 replication was unaffected by both depletion and over-expression of Med23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003514-g004"><bold>Fig. 4a</bold></xref>), indicating that Med23 requires an intact Jak/Stat signalling pathway to exert its anti-viral effects.</p>

Replication was monitored, and slopes calculated and normalized to controls (RSCF siRNA or pCR3). Error bars represent the mean of at least three independent experiments. (b) Pre-treatment with Type III interferons prevents Med23-mediated enhancement of HSV-1 replication. A549 cells were mock-transfected or transfected with Med23 siRNA.

Replication was monitored and slopes calculated and normalized to unstimulated, mock-transfected cells. (c) Overexpression of Med23 preferentially induces type III interferons. pCR3 or Med23 were overexpressed in A549 cells and induction of type I (IFN-β) and type III (IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2/3) was measured by qRT-PCR. mRNA levels were normalized to HPRT and calibrated to mock transfected cells (control).

<p>To determine which interferon may be responsible for the anti-viral effects of Med23, A549 cells were depleted for Med23 and infected with HSV-1 following pre-stimulation with Type I (IFN-α or IFN-β), Type II (IFN-γ) or Type III (the distinct IFN-λ1 or the almost identical IFN-λ2 and -λ3, termed IFN-λ2/3) interferons. Whilst treatment with IFN-α, -β and -γ significantly decreased HSV-1 replication levels, the observed ∼2-fold enhancement of HSV-1 replication following Med23 depletion was still seen. However, pre-treatment with the both IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2/3 blocked the enhancing effect of Med23 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003514-g004"><bold>Figure 4b</bold></xref>). Investigation into the effect of Med23 on interferon induction by qRT-PCR found that whilst Med23 over-expression induced IFN-β (∼3-fold increase), induction of IFN-λ1 and λ2/3 was considerably and statistically significantly higher (∼26-fold induction; <italic>p</italic> = 0.003 and 0.002, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003514-g004"><bold>Figure 4c</bold></xref>). This induction was specific, as levels of other cytokines and interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs) were unaffected by Med23 overexpression (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s009">Figure S7a</xref></bold>). Secretion of IFN-λ2/3 protein was also increased in all cell lines tested, but most significantly to ∼11-fold in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003514-g004"><bold>Figure 4d</bold></xref>), which is consistent with a recent report showing that type III interferons are the dominant type of IFNs expressed by primary airway epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Ioannidis1">[44]</xref>. Furthermore, qPCR analysis found depletion of Med23 inhibited the induction of IFN-λ expression following HSV-1 infection of A549 cells in comparison to cells transfected with the RSCF siRNA control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003514-g004"><bold>Figure 4e</bold></xref>). Together, these data suggest that IFN-λ is responsible for the observed inhibitory effect of Med23 on HSV-1 replication.</p>

Y2H and confirmatory co-immunoprecipitation experiments in mammalian cells with a panel of IRFs found that Med23 interacted with IRF4 and IRF7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003514-g005"><bold>Figure 5a</bold></xref><bold>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s009">Figure S7b</xref></bold>).

To determine if this interaction had a functional effect, we looked at whether Med23 influenced IRF-mediated induction of IFN-λ. In a luciferase reporter assay, neither IRF4 nor IRF9 led to a significant induction of the IFN-λ1 promoter, either alone or in conjunction with Med23 (data not shown). IRF7 induced expression from the IFN-β and IFN-λ1 promoters to similar levels (∼7-fold and 9-fold higher than background, respectively), whilst the ISRE, induced by IRF7 and also present in the IRF7 promoter, was induced ∼15-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003514-g005"><bold>Figure 5b</bold></xref>).

<p>Taken together, these data identify Med23 as a novel anti-viral factor which acts as a key regulator of IFN-λ expression by interacting with and enhancing the activity of IRF7, a major transcription factor involved in innate immunity. Our observation of a link between the clinical severity of HSV-1 disease and, a CT/TT genotype at a SNP known to regulate IFN-λ3 secretion demonstrates the significance of IFN-λ in the control of HSV-1 replication <italic>in vivo</italic>. Whilst this study provides no direct link between the IFN-λ3 promoter polymorphism and Med23, these associations of IFN-λ with HSV-1 disease, combined with our observations that Med23 is required for the induction of IFN-λ following HSV-1 infection, identifies for the first time a link between Med23 and IFN-λ, provides a clinical context for Med23 regulation of IFN-λ expression and underscores the potential biological significance of these data.</p>
<p>The use of HSV-1 in a combined genome-scale screening approach has led to the identification of a regulatory axis in anti-viral innate immunity, and this important finding not only highlights the power of such combined genome-scale screening approaches to identify novel host candidates for anti-herpesvirus drug discovery, but provides an invaluable dataset to the herpesvirus and scientific community at large.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>By nature of their scale, high-throughput screening technologies have limitations. RNAi technology is limited by technical issues such as off-target effects, where an alternative gene to the intended target is degraded, and insufficient gene knockdown. Similarly, Y2H protein interaction screens can generate both false-positive interactions, due to ‘sticky’ proteins and auto-activation of the reporter gene used, and false-negative interactions. Whereas the number of false positives can be considerably reduced by stringent screening and selection criteria, the low sensitivity of the Y2H assay, which detects 20–30% of known interactions, is inherent to the system and can only be marginally improved. This poor sensitivity is caused by factors such as structural restraints of the Y2H bait and prey fusion proteins, a lack of or existence of distinct protein modification in yeast cells, and cellular localization signals in bait and prey proteins preventing nuclear import <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Bailer1">[52]</xref>. However, as all other high-throughput methods for measuring binary protein interactions possess a similarly low sensitivity, but are considerably more laborious and expensive, the Y2H system is still the most commonly used technology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Braun1">[53]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study we have exploited a combined genome-wide screening approach to investigate HSV-1 replication and interaction with its host. This identified 358 functional HFs modulating HSV-1 replication, and 63 cellular interaction partners. In validation experiments, 57.8% of the interactions were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays in mammalian cells, and of the 358 functional HFs identified in the siRNA screen, the phenotype of 83.3% was confirmed in deconvoluted siRNA experiments. This, combined with qPCR data demonstrating a minimum gene depletion of 69%, suggests that the functional phenotypes on virus replication are genuine, and not due to ‘off-target’ effects. The confirmation of such a high proportion of selected validation candidates, in spite of the potential technical drawbacks, highlights the reliability of our primary screen datasets, and thus provides an invaluable resource for the herpesvirology research community.</p>
<p>One interesting outcome of this study was the surprisingly low overlap between hits identified using these different technologies. Of the 215 genes in common between the siRNA and cDNA libraries, only 10 (4.7%) were classified as a hit by both methods. This, however, is not unexpected, as even the overlap between studies using the same technology has been reported to be low. For example, the overlap between the three previously published HIV screens was only 7% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Bushman1">[19]</xref>. Furthermore, the degree of functional redundancy within the siRNA library, and cellular pathways in general, the potential situation-specificity of virus-host interactions, and the possibility of indirect interactions between viral and host proteins, suggest that these methodologies detecting functional outcomes or physical interactions are linked, but complementary rather than confirmatory.</p>
<p>The identified HFs were enriched for a range of cellular processes, such as transcription, gene expression, protein transport and cell cycle (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s004">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s005">S3</xref></bold>), and involved at different stages of viral infection. We investigated HFs involved in capsid transport and ubiquitination of antiviral intrinsic host defence factors in more detail. Incoming HSV-1 capsids are transported to nuclear pores via the microtubule-organizing centre (MTOC), mediated by capsid proteins VP26 (UL35) and UL46 binding to the dynein light chains DYNLT1 (Tctex1) and DYNLT3 (rp3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Douglas1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Gennerich1">[55]</xref>. Our Y2H screen confirmed the known interaction between the capsid protein VP26 and the dynein light chain DYNLT3 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s001">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s006">Figure S4</xref></bold>). Combined with the siRNA screen data, which found depletion of multiple light chain subunits had moderate anti-viral effects on HSV-1, these data confirm propositions of redundancy in the capsid transport process which ensures successful infection in the event of viral mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Dohner1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Radtke1">[39]</xref>, and provide further evidence that HSV-1 has evolved to be highly promiscuous in its exploitation of cellular pathways to its advantage.</p>
<p>To overcome the intrinsic host defence, HSV-1 induces a proteasome-dependent degradation of anti-viral promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (ND10 domains) by the RING-finger ubiquitin ligase ICP0 expressed during early infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Everett1">[56]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic>, ICP0 is a biochemically active E3 ubiquitin ligase in the presence of E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2s) [UBE2D1 (UbcH5a) and UBE2E1 (UbcH6)] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Boutell1">[57]</xref>, but which E2s are used during infection has remained unclear. We identified 20 cellular E2s that are able to influence HSV-1 replication (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s001">Text S1</xref> and</bold> <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s007">Figure S5</xref></bold>). Depletion of UBE2D1-4, UBE2E1-3 and UBE2N significantly increased the number of PML-positive cells post-infection, in an ICP0-dependent manner, indicating that ICP0 can use multiple E2s to degrade PML <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Boutell1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Gu1">[58]</xref>.</p>
<p>One of the multi-protein complexes affecting HSV-1 replication was the Mediator complex, a large (&gt;30 subunits) complex which links specific transcription factors to the RNA polymerase II transcription machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Casamassimi1">[40]</xref>. As the requirement of Mediator subunits in the replication of herpes and other viruses is already well-known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Brass1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Zhou1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Karlas1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Mittler1">[41]</xref>, it was striking that depletion of the Med23 subunit exerted the opposite phenotype and led to a strong increase in virus growth. The Mediator is composed of four distinct modules termed the head, middle, tail and kinase domains, which provide the Mediator with some degree of active control over transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Malik1">[59]</xref>. As individual subunits of this large complex interact with and exert functional effects via specific transcription factors, it is not unexpected that the observed anti-viral effects were specific to Med23 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Stevens1">[60]</xref>. Within the Mediator, Med23 forms a tight sub-complex with Med24 and Med16 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Stevens1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Ito1">[61]</xref>. The increase in virus replication observed upon depletion of Med24 may be caused by the destabilisation of the structure of this sub-complex (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003514.s008">Figure S6b</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Investigations into the mechanism of action revealed Med23 inhibits HSV-1 replication by preferentially inducing a type III interferon response (IFN-λ) at the mRNA and protein level. This induction was mediated via a direct interaction with the transcription factor IRF7, which resulted in a synergistic increase in IFN-λ expression. Med23 was unable, however, to further enhance IRF7-induced levels of IFN-β, suggesting an additional level of complexity to the regulation of interferon signalling. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of Med23 was specific to HSV-1, with replication of a range of other viruses including Vaccinia virus and Semliki Forest Virus being unaffected by Med23 depletion. As Vaccinia virus is resistant to IFN-λ anti-viral activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Bandi1">[62]</xref>, this observation further highlights the importance of IFN-λ, as opposed to IFN-β, in the anti-viral effect of Med23. The R617Q mutation in Med23 (R611Q in Med23 transcript variant 1, used here) was unable to enhance IRF7-induced IFN-λ expression. This mutation causes hereditary dementia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Hashimoto1">[63]</xref>, and the failure to induce IFN-λ and thereby control HSV-1 in the brain may be a potential cofactor for the development of dementia, similar to Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Porcellini1">[64]</xref>.</p>
<p>There is mounting evidence for a role of the IFN-λ family in the regulation of virus pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Ank1">[45]</xref>, particularly in the case of Hepatitis C infection where a polymorphism in the promoter region of IFN-λ3 (IL-28B; polymorphism rs12979860), which correlates with plasma levels of IFN-λ3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Langhans1">[50]</xref>, is associated with disease and treatment outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Ge1">[49]</xref>. Individuals with recurrent HSV-1 reactivation have been shown to be deficient in IFN-λ expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Pica1">[51]</xref>, and here we found the similar association between the IFN-λ3 promoter polymorphism and ethnically Italian patients suffering recurrent and severe reactivations of HSV-1-related oral herpes outbreaks, albeit with a small sample group (<italic>n</italic> = 58). Furthermore, sporadic mutations and genetic polymorphisms in innate immune receptor and signalling molecules that lead to the induction of type I and III IFNs have also been shown to be associated with Herpes Encephalitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-SanchoShimizu1">[65]</xref>, as well as oral and genital Herpes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Yang1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Bochud1">[67]</xref>.</p>
<p>HSV infection controlled by a complex, interconnected and highly regulated network of cytokines expressed by innate immune cells. Type I IFNs mainly produced by HSV-infected keratinocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Torseth1">[68]</xref> and pDCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Lund1">[69]</xref> inhibit the spread from neurons to epithelial cells and between epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Mikloska1">[70]</xref>, similar to IFN-γ. Type III IFNs are also able to directly inhibit HSV-1 infection in primary neurons, astrocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Li2">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Melchjorsen1">[72]</xref>. IFN-γ levels produced by peripheral blood CD4+ T-cells correlate with the frequency of HSV-1 reactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Cunningham1">[73]</xref>. IFN-λ is able to induce expression of both itself and the type I IFNs, and a similar effect has also been observed for type I IFNs which induce both type I and III IFNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Li2">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Melchjorsen1">[72]</xref>. Type III IFNs are mainly expressed by myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) and monocyte-derived macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Hillyer1">[74]</xref>, and signal through the heterodimeric IL10RB/IL28RA receptor complex whose expression is largely restricted to cells of epithelial origin and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), in contrast to the broadly expressed type I IFN receptor (IFN-αR1/2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Donnelly1">[75]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003514-Sommereyns1">[76]</xref>. Since primary HSV-1 infection and reactivation affects skin and mucosa in the majority of cases, IFN-λ may play a much greater role in the control of HSV-1 pathogenesis, likely in a complex network of coregulated type I and II IFNS, than previously thought. We hypothesize that HSV-infected DCs at the site of the lesion (such as skin Langerhans DCs whose role in IFN-λ production is currently unknown, or intruding myeloid DCs) in individuals with the rs12979860 T/T or C/T haplotype express reduced levels of type III IFNs, and, in consequence, of type I IFNs, which leads to a reduced inhibition of local HSV-1 replication and the occurrence of fresh skin lesions. However, the relative contribution of IFN-λ1 and λ2/3 to the interferon-mediated control of HSV-1 replication <italic>in vivo</italic>, and indeed the role of Med23 in this, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>In summary, this study provides a comprehensive and robust analysis of HFs that influence HSV-1 replication <italic>in vitro</italic>, which will benefit many future studies on HSV-1. The identification of Med23 as a crucial cellular component for IFN-λ expression, and evidence for the significant role of type III IFN in the innate immune control of HSV-1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, demonstrates the power of combined, genome-scale studies to identify physiologically important HFs for virus pathogenesis. Future studies will clarify the role of genetic variations in both Med23 and IFN-λ in HSV-1-related diseases, such as meningitis, keratitis and orolabial/genital reactivations.</p>

<p>siRNA SMARTpools (4 siRNAs per gene) at 0.3 µM were dispensed in 10 µl volumes using a Rapidplate384 liquid handler (Qiagen) into triplicate black 384-well plates (Corning), sealed with adhesive seals (ThermoFisher) and plastic lids. Plates were stored at −80°C until needed (minimum 24 h, maximum 48 h). On the day of transfection, assay plates were thawed at room temperature and 10 µl transfection reagent (Dharmafect 1, Dharmacon), diluted in Hank's buffered saline solution (HBSS, ThermoFisher) to give a final concentration of 0.1%, was added using a Multidrop 384 (ThermoFisher). Plates were incubated for 20 min at room temperature to allow formation of transfection complexes. During complex formation, low-passage (p20–22) Hela cells (ECACC) from ∼50% confluent flasks were washed in PBS and trypsinised in Trypsin-EDTA (Lonza) before diluting in phenol red-free, antibiotic-free transfection medium (DMEM/F-12 1∶1/5% FCS with 15 mM Hepes and L-glu; Gibco). Cells were counted and 3×10<sup>3</sup> cells in 40 µl were added to each well using the Multidrop 384. Plates were incubated for 48 h at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

<p><bold>Pathogen-host interactome analysis of RNAi and Y2H HFs.</bold> (a) Combined HSV-1-human interactomes with intraviral, virus-host and high-confidence host-host interactions. Green, viral proteins; Pink, direct (level 1) interactors (Y2H screen); Blue, level 1 interactors (Y2H/RNAi screens); Cyan, host protein-protein (level 2) interactors (Y2H screen); Yellow, Level 2 interactors (Y2H/RNAi screens). Due to the large size of the human network, and in order to discern viral proteins, only the first two levels were plotted (inset: all levels). Combined HSV-1-human interactome. Inset, all levels. (b) Intraviral and virus-host degree (# interactions) distribution of HSV-1 proteins. (c) Correlation between intraviral and virus-host degrees in HSV-1. (d) Degree comparison of cellular interactors versus all proteins in human networks, where the degree indicates the number of interactions a particular protein has. (e) Betweenness centrality comparison of cellular interactors versus all proteins in human networks, where betweenness indicates the number of shortest paths between a protein pair, passing through the protein of interest. Statistically significant differences between viral targets and remaining proteins are denoted by *. (f) Distribution of HFs in the virus-host interactomes. Level 1 proteins are direct interactors with HSV-1 proteins, level 2 their interactors and so on. (g) Validation of HSV-1-host Y2H interactors. A subset of protein interactions identified in the HSV-1-host Y2H screen were validated using the LUMIER pull-down assay in a mammalian cell system. Strength of interaction was determined by Z-score, where a score 1 to 2 represents a weak interaction and score &gt;2 represents a strong interaction. (h) Distribution of direct HSV-1 targets in the RNAi screen. The proteins directly targeted by HSV-1 were taken from the Y2H data set and from the literature curation. An enrichment of literature-derived targets could be observed in the top 5% most inhibiting knockdowns (2.4-fold enrichment; <italic>p</italic> = 0.008), but the same could not be observed for the Y2H-detected direct targets.</p>

<p><bold>Validation of HF identified by RNAi.</bold> HFs identified in the HSV-1 perturbation screen were validated with deconvoluted siRNAs and qPCR: (a) chromoboxes, (b) homeoboxes, (c) general transcription factors, (d) nuclear receptors, (e) proteasome family members, (f) topoisomerases, (g) mediator complex subunits, (h) proteins involved in vesicle transport, (i) integrins, (j) Y2H interactors, (k) ubiquitin E2 ligases, (l) vesicle transport – further candidates, (m) interferon-stimulated membrane proteins and (n) others. HSV replication is presented as normalized replication slope, and is the mean of six individual assay points. Error bars represent standard deviation of the six data points. Deconvoluted siRNAs which had a sequence different to that in the original screen are highlighted in red. Genes for which the primary screen phenotype was not confirmed in the deconvolution assay are shown in bold text.</p>

<p><bold>HSV-1 HFs are involved in diverse cellular pathways and at multiple stages of the HSV life cycle.</bold> Enrichment of protein functions among the HSV-1 HFs. The enrichment for gene ontology (GO) terms and KEGG, BIOCARTA or REACTOME pathway annotations among the HSV-1 HFs identified by (a) RNAi and (b) Y2H assay was performed using DAVID bioinformatics software. (c) Direct interactions between human and HSV-1 proteins. The protein-protein interactions (PPIs) depicted are from the high confidence Y2H data set and from literature curation. Circles and diamonds correspond to human and HSV-1 proteins, respectively. Human proteins detected in the Y2H screen are drawn with red borders. Human genes that showed the strongest effects in the RNAi screen are colored yellow (extreme 10%) and orange (extreme 5%). (d) Highly interconnected regions in the human interaction network composed of HFs. Highly interconnected regions in the human interaction network composed of HFs. We assembled a human interaction network using data from the major PPI databases. A subnetwork consisting of HFs was then defined by limiting the network to the HFs detected in the Y2H screen, the RNAi (extreme 5%) screen, and the literature curation. Highly interconnected regions in the subnetwork were sought out using the MCODE algorithm. The top six scoring regions are shown. Proteins displayed in red correspond to HFs that are known only from the literature, and those in green are those that were detected in either of the screens performed in this study. The three boolean values beside each gene symbol represent whether the HF is present in the Y2H screen, the RNAi screen (extreme 5%), or the literature curated set, in that order. Dominant functional categories could be observed in each of the regions, including transcription (e.g., Mediator complex, RNA polymerase II and associated genes), translation initiation, splicing, and intracellular transport.</p>

<p><bold>HFs involved in viral entry and capsid transport.</bold> (a) Diagrammatic summary of the role of dynein chains in HSV-1 infection. (b) Microtubule transport is required for HSV-1 infection. The role of dynein microtubule transport components in HSV-1 replication was analysed by comparing the replication slope of HSV-1-eGFP (C12)-infected cells depleted for a range of dynein chains from the primary siRNA perturbation screen. Error bars represent the mean of three independent experiments done in duplicate. (c) Depletion of dyneins inhibits virus particle release. The effect of dynein chain depletion on HSV-1 particle release was determined by quantifying virus titer in supernatants of Hela cells depleted of DYNC1H1 (heavy chain), DYNC1I2 (intermediate chain) and DYNC2LI1 (light intermediate chains) in a high multiplicity (MOI 5; HSV-1 KOS) growth assay. Titers were compared to control transfected cells (NT, non-targeting siRNA). (d) Depletion of dynein chains prevents immediate-early gene expression. Immediate-early (ICP0) and late (VP16) viral protein expression in cells depleted of DYNC1H1, DYNC1I2 or DYNC2LI1 was analysed and quantified by Western blot. Levels were compared to control transfected cells (NT, non-targeting siRNA). (e) Quantification of ICP0 and VP16 protein expression. Protein levels of ICP0 and VP16 in cells depleted of DYNC1H1, DYNC1I2 or DYNC2LI1 were quantified with an Odyssey Imager and normalized to protein levels in control transfected cells (Non-targeting siRNA).</p>

<p><bold>E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes in HSV-1 immune evasion.</bold> (a) Depletion of E2 ubiquitin ligases inhibits PML degradation following HSV-1 infection. Hela cells mounted on coverslips were depleted for a range of E2 ubiquitin ligases for 24 h before infecting with HSV-1 17+. Cells were fixed and stained for ICP0 (green) and PML (red), analysed by confocal microscopy and PML-positive cells were counted (5 fields of view per coverslip) and expressed as a mean percentage of PML-positive cells remaining (3 independent experiments). Error bars represent the standard deviation over 3 independent experiments. (b) Inhibition of PML degradation by E2s is ICP0-dependent. Hela cells were seeded on coverslips, transfected as above and infected with an ICP0 RING-finger deletion mutant (FXE). Remaining PML-positive cells were quantified as above. (c) Immunofluorescence staining for PML bodies in cells transfected with control siRNA not incorporated into the RISC complex (RSCF) or cells depleted of the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes E2D1 or E2L3.

Subunits not included are white; herpesvirus proteins reported to target Mediator subunits are violet; Mediator subunits detected in other viral RNAi screens are highlighted by coloured diamonds. (b) Mediator complex subunits influence HSV-1 replication. Individual subunits of the Mediator complex and associated proteins were depleted by siRNA knockdown and infected with HSV-1 C12 (MOI 0.5). Replication was monitored over multiple rounds and the slope of replication over the linear phase was calculated and normalized to controls (mock-transfected cells). Grey, no significant effect; red, strongly pro-viral; green, strongly anti-viral. Error bars represent the mean of six replicates. (c) Stable or transient overexpression of Med23. Med23 was stably (HEK) or transiently (Hela) overexpressed and Med23 mRNA levels quantified by RT-PCR. Expression was normalized to HPRT and calibrated to parental cells.
