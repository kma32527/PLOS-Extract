<p>The innate immune system is essential for controlling viral infections, but several viruses have evolved strategies to escape innate immunity. RIG-I is a cytoplasmic viral RNA sensor that triggers the signal to induce type I interferon production in response to viral infection. RIG-I activation is regulated by the K63-linked polyubiquitin chain mediated by Riplet and TRIM25 ubiquitin ligases. TRIM25 is required for RIG-I oligomerization and interaction with the IPS-1 adaptor molecule. A knockout study revealed that Riplet was essential for RIG-I activation. However the molecular mechanism underlying RIG-I activation by Riplet remains unclear, and the functional differences between Riplet and TRIM25 are also unknown. A genetic study and a pull-down assay indicated that Riplet was dispensable for RIG-I RNA binding activity but required for TRIM25 to activate RIG-I. Mutational analysis demonstrated that Lys-788 within the RIG-I repressor domain was critical for Riplet-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination and that Riplet was required for the release of RIG-I autorepression of its N-terminal CARDs, which leads to the association of RIG-I with TRIM25 ubiquitin ligase and TBK1 protein kinase. Our data indicate that Riplet is a prerequisite for TRIM25 to activate RIG-I signaling. We investigated the biological importance of this mechanism in human cells and found that hepatitis C virus (HCV) abrogated this mechanism. Interestingly, HCV NS3-4A proteases targeted the Riplet protein and abrogated endogenous RIG-I polyubiquitination and association with TRIM25 and TBK1, emphasizing the biological importance of this mechanism in human antiviral innate immunity. In conclusion, our results establish that Riplet-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination released RIG-I RD autorepression, which allowed the access of positive factors to the RIG-I protein.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The cytoplasmic viral RNA sensor RIG-I recognizes various types of pathogenic viruses and evokes innate immune responses, whereas several viruses have evolved strategies to escape the host innate immune responses. RIG-I triggers a signal to induce type I interferon and inflammatory cytokines. RIG-I activation is regulated by K63-linked polyubiquitin chains mediated by the ubiquitin ligases TRIM25 and Riplet; however, the functional difference between the two ubiquitin ligases remains unclear, and the molecular mechanism underlying Riplet-mediated RIG-I activation is unknown. We revealed sequential roles of the two ubiquitin ligases during RIG-I activation and found that Riplet-mediated polyubiquitination of the RIG-I repressor domain released RIG-I autorepression of its N-terminal CARDs responsible for triggering the signal, which resulted in an association with TRIM25 ubiquitin ligase and TBK1 protein kinase. Interestingly, we found that this mechanism was targeted by hepatitis C virus, which is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. This result emphasizes the vital role of Riplet-mediated release of RIG-I RD autorepression in antiviral responses. Our results establish that Riplet releases RIG-I RD autorepression and demonstrated the biological significance of this mechanism in human innate immune responses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The innate immune system is essential for controlling virus infections, and several viruses have evolved strategies to evade host innate immune responses. Cytoplasmic viral RNA is recognized by RIG-I-like receptors, including RIG-I and MDA5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Kato1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Yoneyama1">[2]</xref>. The RIG-I protein comprises N-terminal Caspase Activation and Recruitment Domains (CARDs), a central RNA helicase domain, and a C-terminal Repressor domain (RD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Saito1">[3]</xref>. RD consists of C-terminal RNA binding domain (CTD) and a bridging domain between CTD and helicase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Kowalinski1">[4]</xref>. RIG-I CARDs are essential for triggering the signal that induces type I interferon (IFN). In resting cells, RIG-I RD represses its CARDs signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Saito1">[3]</xref>. After viral infection, RIG-I RD recognizes 5′-triphosphate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which results in a conformational change in the RIG-I protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Saito1">[3]</xref>. This conformational change leads to the release of RD autorepression of CARDs, after which CARDs associate with an IPS-1 adaptor molecule (also called MAVS, Cardif, and VISA) localized at the outer membrane of mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Saito1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Xu1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Seth1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Meylan1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Kawai1">[8]</xref>. IPS-1 activates downstream factors such as TBK1, IKK-ε, and NEMO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Zhao1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-McWhirter1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Hemmi1">[11]</xref>. NEMO forms a complex with TBK1 and IKK-ε and has a polyubiquitin binding region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Lo1">[12]</xref>. These protein kinases are essential for activating transcription factors such as IRF-3 to induce type I IFN production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Fitzgerald1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Several ubiquitin ligases are involved in regulating the RIG-I-dependent pathway, and RIG-I itself is regulated by ubiquitin chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Oshiumi1">[14]</xref>. Gack MU and colleagues firstly reported that TRIM25 ubiquitin ligase mediates K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I N-terminal CARDs, which results in RIG-I activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Gack1">[15]</xref>. Other groups also detected a RIG-I-anchored polyubiquitin chain after ligand stimulation or viral infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Liu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Arnaud1">[17]</xref>. It was recently demonstrated that an unanchored polyubiquitin chain but not ubiquitination is essential for RIG-I activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Jiang1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Zeng1">[19]</xref>. However, RIG-I anchored K63-linked polyubiquitin chains are detected after viral infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Gack1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Friedman1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>Another E3 ubiquitin ligase, Riplet, binds RIG-I RD and mediates the K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I RD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Oshiumi2">[21]</xref>. In contrast, Chen DY and colleagues reported that Riplet (also called Reul) ubiquitinated RIG-I CARDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Gao1">[22]</xref>. A study that used Riplet knockout mice showed that mouse Riplet is essential for RIG-I-mediated type I IFN production in response to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Flu, and Sendai virus (SeV) infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Oshiumi3">[23]</xref>. However, the functional difference between Riplet and TRIM25 remains unclear, and the molecular mechanism of how Riplet-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination activates RIG-I signaling remains unresolved.</p>
<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. HCV RNA is primarily recognized by RIG-I <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Saito2">[24]</xref>. The HCV protease NS3-4A can suppress type I IFN production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Foy1">[25]</xref>. NS3-4A cleaves IPS-1 to suppress RIG-I-mediated innate immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Meylan1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Li1">[26]</xref>. Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells recognize HCV RNA through Toll-like receptor 3, and NS3-4A has the ability to cleave TICAM-1, which is a solo adaptor molecule of Toll-like receptor 3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Ebihara1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Li2">[28]</xref>. In this study, we found that Riplet was another target of NS3-4A. Here, we demonstrated the molecular mechanisms of how Riplet-mediated RIG-I polyubiquitination triggered the type I IFN production signal and showed that this mechanism was targeted by HCV.</p>

<title>Riplet and TRIM25 ubiquitin ligases play different roles in RIG-I activation</title>
<p>In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), TRIM25 is essential for type I IFN production in response to SeV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Gack1">[15]</xref>. As with TRIM25 knockout, Riplet knockout abolished IFN-α2 and IFN-β mRNA expressions in response to SeV infection in MEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>), which suggested that both ubiquitin ligases were essential for type I IFN expression in MEFs in response to SeV infection. Thus, we examined whether these two ubiquitin ligases played different roles in RIG-I activation.</p>

<p>(A, B) Wild-type and Riplet KO MEFs were infected with SeV at MOI = 0.2.

(E, F) The activation of IFN-β promoter was examined by reporter gene assay using a p125luc IFN-β reporter. Full-length RIG-I expression vectors were transfected into HEK293 cells together with a Riplet and/or TRIM25 expression vector as indicated. 24 hours after the transfection, the cells were stimulated with 50 ng of HCV 3′ UTR dsRNA by transfection or infected with VSV at MOI = 1 for 24 hours, and then reporter activation was determined. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). *p&lt;0.05. (G) HEK293FT cells were stimulated with 0.8 µg of HCV double-stranded RNA (HCV RNA) using lipofectamine 2000 in 6-well plate.

<p>We performed reporter gene assays with p125luc (IFN-β reporter) using either RIG-I CARDs fragment or full-length RIG-I expression vectors. It is known that ectopic expression of RIG-I CARDs fragment activates the signaling even in the absence of stimulation with RIG-I ligand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Yoneyama1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Saito1">[3]</xref> and that the auto-activation is observed when full-length RIG-I is ectopically expressed in HEK293 cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Oshiumi2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Arimoto1">[29]</xref>. As previously reported, TRIM25 ectopic expression efficiently increased RIG-I CARDs fragment-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). However, TRIM25 expression only mildly increased full-length RIG-I signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, Riplet ectopic expression efficiently increased the full-length RIG-I-mediated signaling, although Riplet failed to increase the RIG-I CARDs-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). Interestingly, when Riplet was co-expressed with TRIM25, ectopically expressed TRIM25 could increase the full-length RIG-I-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). We observed the same effects of TRIM25 and Riplet expressions on the reporter activation in the presence of stimulation with HCV 3′ UTR dsRNA (a RIG-I ligand) or VSV infection, which are recognized by RIG-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g001">Figure 1E and 1F</xref>). These different effects of Riplet and TRIM25 on the signaling suggested that Riplet and TRIM25 ubiquitin ligases played different roles in RIG-I activation.</p>
<p>We then investigated whether the two ubiquitin ligases associate with RIG-I after stimulation. First, we performed immunoprecipitation assay and found that endogenous Riplet and TRIM25 bound to endogenous RIG-I after stimulation with HCV dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). Second, we investigated subcellular localizations of the proteins by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. In resting cells, RIG-I was barely detectable, whereas RIG-I exhibited punctate staining in cytoplasm after VSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), and ectopically expressed Riplet was co-localized with RIG-I and TRIM25 in perinuclear region in VSV infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g002">Figure 2A–2C and 2E</xref>). This is consistent with a previous observation that RIG-I and TRIM25 co-localized extensively at cytoplasmic perinuclear bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Gack1">[15]</xref>. Pearson's correlation coefficient values also suggested the correlation of the colocalizations of those proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g002">Figure 2D and 2F</xref>). Recently, it was reported that RIG-I recognized short polyI:C in stress granules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Onomoto1">[30]</xref>. G3BP is a marker of the stress granule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Onomoto1">[30]</xref>. In resting cells, G3BP dispersed in cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Onomoto1">[30]</xref>, and thus barely detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g002">Figure 2G and 2H</xref>), whereas G3BP speckles were detected in cells stimulated with short polyI:C in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g002">Figure 2G and 2H</xref>). Riplet and TRIM25 localizations within G3BP speckles were detected in the stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g002">Figure 2G and 2H</xref>). Taken together, these data indicated that both Riplet and TRIM25 associated with RIG-I after stimulation.</p>

<p>(A, B) HeLa cells were transfected with Riplet-HA expression vector (A) or FLAG-Riplet and TRIM25-HA (B). 24 hours after transfection, the cells were infected with VSV at MOI = 1 for six hours.

<p>Next, we assessed the RIG-I regions that bind to the two ubiquitin ligases using RIG-I fragments. As previously reported, TRIM25 bound to RIG-I CARDs fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g002">Figure 2I</xref>). However, Riplet bound to RIG-I RD (735–925 aa), but not to CARDs fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g002">Figure 2J</xref>). Deleting the Riplet binding region (RIG-I-<italic>Δ</italic>CTD) abrogated Riplet effect on RIG-I signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g002">Figure 2K</xref>). This was contrast to TRIM25, which affects RIG-I CARDs. Taken together, our genetic and biochemical data indicated that the two ubiquitin ligases associated with RIG-I after stimulation but showed different effects on RIG-I activation. Thus, we next focused on Riplet specific role in RIG-I activation.</p>

<title>Riplet-mediated RIG-I polyubiquitination is dispensable for RIG-I RNA binding activity</title>
<p>RIG-I CARDs harbor K63-linked polyubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Gack1">[15]</xref>. As RIG-I CARDs, RIG-I RD harbored K63-linked polyubiquitination (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003533.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Riplet expression increased the polyubiquitination of RIG-I RD but not that of CARDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). RIG-I RD has two functions. One is RNA binding activity and the other is autorepression of its CARDs signaling. Firstly, we tested whether Riplet affects RIG-I RNA binding activity. In a pull-down assay using biotin-conjugated dsRNA and streptavidin beads, we found that both polyubiquitinated and non-ubiquitinated RIG-I were recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), which suggested that Riplet-mediated polyubiquitination was dispensable for RIG-I RNA binding activity. As RIG-I is known to form homo-oligomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Saito1">[3]</xref>, it is possible that non-ubiquitinated RIG-I was recovered through ubiquitinated RIG-I by the pull-down assay. To exclude this possibility, we used RIG-I mutants, RIG-I 5KR and RIG-I K788R, which were barely ubiquitinated by Riplet (described below). We compared the binding abilities of the RIG-I mutants to that of wild-type RIG-I by pull-down assay using cell lysate isolated from cells without stimulation with RIG-I ligand to avoid any ubiquitination. The results showed that the RIG-I 5KR and RIG-I K788R mutant proteins were recovered by pull down assay as wild-type RIG-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). This data also indicated that the polyubiquitination is dispensable for RIG-I RNA binding activity.</p>

<p>(A) Expression vectors encoding Riplet, FLAG-tagged RIG-I CARDs, and/or FLAG-tagged RIG-I RD were transfected into HEK293FT cells together with an HA-tagged ubiquitin expression vector. Cell lysate was prepared at 24 hours after transfection, followed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG (RIG-I) antibody. (B) HEK293FT cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding FLAG-tagged RIG-I, Riplet, and HA-tagged ubiquitin.

<title>Riplet releases RIG-I RD autorepression of CARDs signaling</title>
<p>Secondly, we investigated whether Riplet expression affects RIG-I RD autorepression of CARDs signaling. To test this possibility, we constructed RIG-I mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We previously showed that Lys to Ala amino acid substitutions at Lys-849, 851, 888, 907, and 909 of RIG-I (RIG-I 5KA) severely reduced RIG-I polyubiquitination and activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Oshiumi2">[21]</xref>. However, it is possible that the substitutions of Lys with Ala affect other function of RIG-I because the substitution abolishes positive charge of Lys residues. Thus, we constructed the RIG-I 5KR mutant protein, in which the five Lys residues were substituted with Arg, and examined the signal activation ability. The results showed that the 5KR mutation reduced RIG-I signaling, however residual activation of RIG-I 5KR was still detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g004">Figure 4B–4D</xref>). Thus, we assessed other Lys residues within RIG-I RD. Because Riplet is essential for RIG-I activation, it is expected that the Lys residues targeted by Riplet are conserved during evolution. Thus, we tested Lys residues within RIG-I RD conserved among vertebrate, and found that an RIG-I K788R mutation reduced RIG-I signaling at a level comparable to that by a K172R mutation, which abrogates TRIM25-mediated RIG-I activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Gack1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Zeng1">[19]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g004">Figure 4B–4D</xref>). Interestingly, the 5KR and K788R mutations reduced the RIG-I polyubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). RIG-I polyubiquitination in cells stimulated with HCV dsRNA was also reduced by the K788R mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Lys-788 is located within the 55-amino acid region (747–801 aa) of RIG-I essential for RD autorepression of CARDs signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Kageyama1">[31]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). It is possible that the reduction of RIG-I ubiquitination by the mutations was caused by the defect of RIG-I other functions, such as RNA binding activity. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g003">Figure 3C</xref> showed that the RIG-I 5KR and K788R mutant proteins efficiently bound to dsRNA as wild-type RIG-I.

<p>Using the RIG-I mutants, we investigated whether Riplet releases RIG-I RD autorepression. Because Riplet ectopic expression activated full-length RIG-I signaling even in the absence of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), we could assess whether Riplet can remove RIG-I RD autorepression by Riplet ectopic expression study. Due to autorepression, full-length RIG-I expression weakly activates the signaling compared with RIG-I CARDs expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Kageyama1">[31]</xref>.

<p>Expression of the RIG-I RD fragment is known to represses full-length RIG-I-mediated signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Saito1">[3]</xref>.

If Riplet ectopic expression released RIG-I RD autorepression, it is expected that RIG-I and Riplet co-expression will induce IFN-β promoter activity irrespective of viral infection. As expected, Riplet and RIG-I co-expression induced IFN-β promoter activity irrespective of SeV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Taken together, these genetic data indicated that Riplet released RIG-I RD autorepression.</p>
<p>If Riplet is essential for the release of RIG-I RD autorepression, it is expected that Riplet expression will increase the interaction between RIG-I and TRIM25, because TRIM25 efficiently activated RIG-I CARDs but not full-length RIG-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). To test this possibility, we examined the interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I in the presence or absence of Riplet ectopic expression and found that Riplet expression increased the interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g005">Figure 5D and 5E</xref>). Moreover, this interaction was abolished by the K788R mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). These data were also consistent with our model that Riplet affects RIG-I RD autorepression rather than RNA binding activity of RIG-I.</p>
<p>If Riplet is essential for the release of RIG-I RD autorepression leading to the interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I, it was expected that Riplet is essential for endogenous RIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination that is mediated by both Riplet and TRIM25. To test this possibility, we investigated endogenous RIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination in mouse spleen cells infected with SeV. Endogenous RIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination was increased after SeV infection in wild-type splenocyte, however knockout of Riplet abrogated the endogenous K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I after SeV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g005">Figure 5G</xref>).

N-terminal FLAG-tagged Riplet or C-terminal HA-tagged Riplet was expressed with or without NS3-4A, after which the Riplet protein levels were compared. NS3-4A expression severely reduced the FLAG-tagged and HA-tagged Riplet protein level but not that of FLAG-tagged RIG-I, whereas catalytically inactive NS3-4A* (S139A) failed to reduce the Riplet protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g007">Figure 7F, 7G</xref>, and S3A). This suggested that this protease's activity reduced the Riplet protein level.

NS3-4A cleaves the target just after C/T within this consensus sequence. Acidic amino acids before the C/T site are conserved among the NS3-4A cleavage site within HCV polypeptide. The acidic amino acids from 16 to 18 aa within the Riplet sequence were substituted with Ala, and a Riplet-3A mutant protein was constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g007">Figure 7J</xref>). The Riplet-3A mutant protein was resistant to NS3-4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g007">Figure 7I and 7K</xref>). Moreover, the Riplet-3A protein co-localized with NS3-4A in cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g007">Figure 7L</xref>).

<p>Although Riplet digestion products were not observed in HEK293 cell lysate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003533.s003">Figure S3E and S3F</xref>), it is known that the digestion products of TICAM-1 (TRIF) obtained by NS3-4A are not detectable because these products are unstable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Li2">[28]</xref>. Cys-21 of Riplet corresponds to the C/T site in the NS3-4A target consensus sequence.

A reporter gene assay showed that NS3-4A expression severely reduced IFN-β promoter activation induced by RIG-I and Riplet expression even in the presence of the IPS-1 C508A mutant protein in HEK293 cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g009">Figure 9A</xref>), and a catalytically inactive NS3-4A mutant failed to reduce this signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). These data were consistent with our observation that NS3-4A targeted the Riplet protein. There was endogenous IPS-1 in HEK293 cell, and thus the decrease of IFN-β promoter induction by NS3-4A in HEK293 cell could be due to the cleavage of endogenous IPS-1 by NS3-4A. To exclude this possibility, we next used IPS-1 KO mouse hepatocyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Aly1">[37]</xref>. The IPS-1 C508A mutant protein was expressed in IPS-1 KO hepatocyte. NS3-4A expression reduced the reporter activation induced by RIG-I/Riplet expression or by stimulation with HCV dsRNA even in the presence of IPS-1 C508A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g009">Figure 9C and 9D</xref>). These results indicated that NS3-4A targeted both IPS-1 and upstream factors of IPS-1 and were consistent with our observation that NS3-4A reduced the Riplet protein level. We could not test whether NS3-4A failed to impair IFN-β promoter activity in the presence of the Riplet-3A and Riplet C21A mutants because the mutant proteins were not functional and failed to activate RIG-I (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003533.s003">Figure S3H and S3I</xref>). Thus, we could not exclude the possibility that NS3-4A targeted another protein in addition to Riplet and IPS-1.</p>

<p>(A and B) The inhibition of IFN-β promoter activation by NS3-4A was assessed by reporter gene assays. IPS-1-C508A mutant protein harbors an amino acid substitution at Cys-508 with Ala. 100 ng of IPS-1, IPS-1-C508A, RIG-I, Riplet, NS3-4A, and/or NS3-4A* expression vectors were transfected into HEK293 cells in 24-well plates with p125luc reporter plasmid. The total amount of transfected DNA (800 ng/well) was kept constant by adding empty vector (pEF-BOS). 24 hours after the transfection, the reporter activities were measured. Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). *p&lt;0.05. (C and D) IPS-1 KO mouse hepatocyte was transfected with IPS-1 C508A, RIG-I, Riplet, and/or NS3-4A expression vectors together with p125luc and <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase plasmids. Transfected cells were stimulated with 50 ng of HCV dsRNA for 24 hours by transfection (D). Data are presented as mean SD (n = 3). *p&lt;0.05. (E and F) Intracellular localizations of endogenous TBK1 and RIG-I were determined by confocal microscopy. HepG2, HuH7, and HuH7.5 cells were stimulated with 100 ng of HCV dsRNA for six hours by transfection (E). Stimulated cells (E) and O cells with HCV replicons (F) were stained with anti-RIG-I, TBK1, and/or NS3 antibodies. (G and H) HuH7 (G) and HuH7.5 (H) cells were infected with HCV JFH1 strain. Seven days after the infection, the cells were stained with anti-RIG-I, IPS-1, and NS3 antibodies. (I) HuH7 cells were infected with SeV at MOI = 1 for 24 hours. Cell lysates were prepared from mock or SeV infected HuH7 or HuH7 cells with HCV replicons (O cell). Immunoprecipitation using high salt buffer was performed with anti-RIG-I (Alme-1) antibody. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Endogenous K63-linked polyubiquitin chain was detected using ubiquitin K63-linkage specific antibody. (J) HuH7 cells were infected with SeV at MOI = 1 for 24 hours. Cell lysates were prepared from mock or SeV infected HuH7 or HuH7 cells with HCV replicons (O cell). Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-RIG-I (Alme-1) antibody. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. (K) HuH7 cells were transfected with siRNA for mock or Riplet. 48 hours after the transfection, cells were infected with HCV JFH1 for 2 days. RT-qPCR was performed to determine HCV genome RNA, GAPDH, and Riplet expression.</p>

<title>Hepatitis C virus abrogates endogenous Riplet function</title>
<p>Endogenous RIG-I exhibited punctate staining in the human hepatocyte cell line HuH7 and HepG2 cells after simulation with HCV RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g009">Figure 9E</xref>) but not in HuH7.5 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g009">Figure 9E</xref>). In HuH7.5 cells, there is a T55I mutation within endogenous <italic>RIG-I</italic> gene that disrupts the interaction between RIG-I and TRIM25 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Gack3">[38]</xref>. We investigated whether Riplet is required for RIG-I to exhibit punctate staining, and found that knockdown of Riplet decreased RIG-I punctate staining induced by HCV RNA (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003533.s004">Figure S4</xref>). We next investigated whether HCV abrogated Riplet-dependent RIG-I punctate pattern in the cytoplasm. As expected, RIG-I failed to exhibit punctate staining in O cells with HCV replicons in NS3 positive cells and HuH7 cells infected with HCV JFH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g009">Figure 9F–9H</xref>). We confirmed that HCV disrupted IPS-1 in our experimental condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g009">Figure 9G and 9H</xref>).</p>
<p>To further assess whether HCV abrogates endogenous Riplet function, we observed endogenous K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I in cells with HCV replicons. Although SeV infection induced endogenous K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I in HuH7 cells, HCV replicons failed to increase the polyubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g009">Figure 9I</xref>). Next, we investigated the association of endogenous RIG-I with TRIM25 and TBK1, which is promoted by Riplet as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g006">6</xref>. SeV infection induced the association of endogenous RIG-I with TRIM25 and TBK1, whereas HCV replicons failed to induce the association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g009">Figure 9J</xref>). Taken together, these data indicated that HCV abrogated endogenous Riplet function.</p>
<p>Although NS3-4A cleaves IPS-1, a mutation within endogenous <italic>RIG-I</italic> gene increased the permissiveness to HCV infection in HuH7-derived cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Saito1">[3]</xref>, indicating that RIG-I is required for antiviral response to HCV infection before NS3-4A cleaves IPS-1. We used siRNA to knockdown endogenous Riplet in HuH7 cells, and then the cells were infected with HCV JFH1. Interestingly, Riplet knockdown increased the permissiveness to HCV JFH1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g009">Figure 9K</xref>), indicating that endogenous Riplet is required for antiviral response to HCV infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>RIG-I activation is regulated by two ubiquitin ligases Riplet and TRIM25 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Gack1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Oshiumi2">[21]</xref>. The two ubiquitin ligases are essential for RIG-I activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Gack1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Oshiumi3">[23]</xref>, however the functional difference had been unclear. It is known that TRIM25 is essential for RIG-I oligomerization and association with IPS-1 adaptor molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Gack1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Zeng1">[19]</xref>. Here, we demonstrated that Riplet was essential for the release of RIG-I RD autorepression of its CARDs, which resulted in the association with TRIM25. This functional difference explained the reason why RIG-I requires the two ubiquitin ligases for triggering the signal.</p>
<p>It has been reported that TRIM25 activates RIG-I signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Gack1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Zeng1">[19]</xref>. We confirmed that ectopic expression of TRIM25 increases RIG-I CARDs-mediated signaling. However, most previous studies used a RIG-I CARDs fragment but not full-length RIG-I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Gack1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Zeng1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Gack3">[38]</xref>. Unexpectedly, we found that the increase of full-length RIG-I-mediated signaling by TRIM25 expression was much less than that of the CARDs-mediated signaling. It is intriguing that Riplet helped TRIM25 to activate full-length RIG-I. Riplet expression promoted the interaction between TRIM25 and full-length RIG-I, and this interaction was abrogated by an RIG-I K788R mutation, which reduced Riplet-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. Thus, we propose that Riplet-mediated polyubiquitination of RIG-I RD is a prerequisite for TRIM25 to activate RIG-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g010">Figure 10</xref>).</p>

<title>Model for Riplet-mediated RIG-I activation.</title>
<p>In resting cell, RIG-I RD represses its CARDs-mediated signaling. When RIG-I CTD associates with viral RNA, Riplet mediates K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I RD, leading to the association with TRIM25 and TBK1. K63-linked polyubiquitin chain mediated by TRIM25 induces RIG-I oligomerization and association with IPS-1 adaptor. TBK1 associated with RIG-I is activated on mitochondria.</p>

<p>Ectopic expression of Riplet activated RIG-I without stimulation with RIG-I ligand. This is not surprising because ectopically expressed Riplet bound to RIG-I without stimulation with RIG-I ligand, whereas endogenous Riplet bound to endogenous RIG-I after stimulation with RIG-I ligand. RIG-I undergoes its conformational change after binding to a ligand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Saito1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Takahasi1">[39]</xref>. The conformational change would allow the access of endogenous Riplet to RIG-I, which resulted in Riplet-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination leading to the release of RD autorepression. This model is consistent with the observation that TRIM25 ectopic expression did not activate full-length RIG-I without Riplet expression, because TRIM25 hardly bound to full-length RIG-I without Riplet.</p>
<p>Previously, we reported that the five Lys residues within RIG-I RD were important for Riplet-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. We constructed the RIG-I 5KR mutant and indicated that the 5KR mutation reduced RIG-I ubiquitination and activation without loss of RNA binding activity. This is consistent with our previous conclusion. However, there is residual ubiquitination of RIG-I 5KR mutation, and we found that K788R mutation showed more sever phenotype. These data indicated that Riplet targeted the several Lys residues within RIG-I RD. This is not surprising, because TRIM25 targets not only Lys-172 but also other Lys residues within mouse RIG-I CARDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Rajsbaum1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>TBK1 and IKK-ε are downstream factors of IPS-1. We found that TBK1 and IKK-ε could bind RIG-I RD. It is possible that RIG-I associates with TBK1 through IPS-1. However, Hiscott J and colleagues demonstrated that IKK-ε could bind IPS-1 and that TBK1 did not bind IPS-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Paz1">[40]</xref>. Moreover, RIG-I RD did not bind IPS-1, and RIG-I and TBK1 co-localization was detected in the cytoplasmic region where there are no mitochondria. These observations weaken this possibility. Our results indicated that RIG-I RD bound to the NEMO ubiquitin binding region. IRF-3 activation requires the ubiquitin binding domain of NEMO, and an endogenous K63-linked polyubiquitin chain plays a key role in IRF3 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Zeng2">[41]</xref>. Thus, we prefer a model in which TBK1 associates with an RIG-I RD-anchored polyubiquitin chain through NEMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Although Riplet knockout reduced the binding of RIG-I to TBK1, residual binding was still detectable. Thus, there appears to be Riplet-dependent and independent associations between RIG-I and TBK1. TRAF3 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and is involved in the RIG-I-mediated type I IFN production pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Oganesyan1">[42]</xref>. Because there is residual activation of the type I IFN production pathway even in TRAF3 knockout cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Zeng2">[41]</xref>, it is possible that the RIG-I polyubiquitin chain may compensate for the TRAF3 defect in recruiting TBK1 to mitochondria. Further studies will be needed to determine the precise molecular mechanisms. Although TBK1 dispersed in the cytoplasm, p-TBK1 was exclusively localized on mitochondria. Considering that TBK1 is phosphorylated in its activation loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Soulat1">[33]</xref>, these results suggested that RIG-I RD associated with inactive TBK1 and that TBK1 was activated after loading on to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g010">Figure 10</xref>).</p>
<p>HCV is a major cause of HCC and has the ability to evade host innate immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Meylan1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Suzuki1">[43]</xref>. HCV RNA is primarily recognized by the cytoplasmic viral RNA sensor RIG-I. Previous studies showed that the protease NS3-4A cleaves IPS-1 to shut off RIG-I signaling. However, our results indicated that there was another target of NS3-4A in RIG-I signaling. First, RIG-I failed to exhibit punctate staining in cells infected with HCV. Second, NS3-4A reduced RIG-I signaling even in the presence of an IPS-1-C508A mutant, which is resistant to the cleavage by NS3-4A. Third, the endogenous Riplet protein level was severely reduced in cells with HCV replicons. Fourth, NS3-4A targeted Riplet and abrogated Riplet-dependent RIG-I ubiquitination and complex formation with TRIM25 and TBK1. These data support our model that NS3-4A targets not only IPS-1 but also Riplet to escape host innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003533-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Recently it was reported that NS1 proteins of Influenza A virus inhibited Riplet function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Rajsbaum1">[32]</xref>. These findings indicated biological importance of Riplet in RIG-I activation during viral infection.</p>
<p>In general, a ubiquitin ligase has several targets. We have performed yeast two-hybrid screening using Riplet as bait and found a candidate clone that encodes a tumor suppressor gene. Our pilot study showed that Riplet mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination of this tumor suppressor and suppressed retinoblastoma (Rb) activity. Thus, Riplet disruption by NS3-4A might be a cause of liver disease induced by HCV infection.</p>

<p>Splenocytes (1×10<sup>7</sup>) were infected with or without VSV at MOI = 10 for eight hours, after which cell extracts were prepared with lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 30 mM NaF, 5 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 20 mM iodoacetamide, and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Immunoprecipitation used an anti-RIG-I Rabbit monoclonal antibody (D14G6, Cell Signaling Technology). To detect endogenous K63-linked polyubiquitin chain that is ligated to RIG-I, 6×10<sup>7</sup> of mouse splenocyte were infected with SeV at MOI = 0.2 for 24 hours. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-RIG-I mAb (D14G6). Anti-K63-linkage specific polyubiquitin (D7A11) Rabbit mAb (Cell Signaling) was used for western blotting. HEK293FT cells were transfected with or without 0.8 µg of HCV dsRNA in a 6-well plate. HCV dsRNA (HCV 3′ UTR polyU/UC region) was synthesized using T7 and SP6 RNA polymerase as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Oshiumi5">[46]</xref>. Cell lysates were prepared at the indicated times. Immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti-RIG-I mouse monoclonal antibody (Alme-1). An anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was used for the immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged protein. An anti-TRIM25 rabbit polyclonal antibody (abcam), an anti-p-TBK1 rabbit mAb (Cell Signaling Technology), an anti-NAK (TBK1) rabbit mAb (EP611Y), and an anti-RNF135 (Riplet) pAb (SIGMA), were used for western blotting. For ubiquitination assay, immunoprecipitates were washed three times with high salt lysis buffer ((20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 30 mM NaF, 5 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 20 mM iodoacetamide, and 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to dissociate unanchored polyubiquitin chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003533-Oshiumi2">[21]</xref>, and then washed once with normal lysis buffer described above for SDS-PAG analysis. Band intensity was semi-quantified using Photoshop software.</p>

<title>In vitro NS3/4A cleavage assay</title>
<p>FLAG-tagged Riplet was expressed in HEK293FT cells, and cell lysate was prepared with the lysis buffer described above. The protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and protein G sepharose beads, and washed with Buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40). The samples were suspended in 50 µl of Buffer B, and incubated with 400 ng of recombinant NS3-4A (rNS3-4A) protein at 37°C for one hour, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The NS3-4A protein was purchased from AnaSpec Inc (CA). N-terminal GST-fused Riplet (1–210 aa) (rRiplet) was purchased from Abnova. 500 ng of rRiplet was incubated with or without 500 ng of rNS3-4A in 10 µl of reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (7.5), 4% Glycerol, 5 mM DTT, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% of Triton-X100, 0.9% polyvinyl alcohol) at 37°C for 30 min.</p>
