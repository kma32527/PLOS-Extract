<abstract>
<p>Enteric bacterial pathogens such as enterohemorrhagic <italic>E. coli</italic> (EHEC) and <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium target the intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) lining the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. Despite expressing innate Toll-like receptors (TLRs), IEC are innately hypo-responsive to most bacterial products. This is thought to prevent maladaptive inflammatory responses against commensal bacteria, but it also limits antimicrobial responses by IEC to invading bacterial pathogens, potentially increasing host susceptibility to infection. One reason for the innate hypo-responsiveness of IEC is their expression of Single Ig IL-1 Related Receptor (SIGIRR), a negative regulator of interleukin (IL)-1 and TLR signaling. To address whether SIGIRR expression and the innate hypo-responsiveness of IEC impacts on enteric host defense, <italic>Sigirr</italic> deficient (−/−) mice were infected with the EHEC related pathogen <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>. <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice responded with accelerated IEC proliferation and strong pro-inflammatory and antimicrobial responses but surprisingly, <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice proved dramatically more susceptible to infection than wildtype mice. Through haematopoietic transplantation studies, it was determined that SIGIRR expression by non-haematopoietic cells (putative IEC) regulated these responses. Moreover, the exaggerated responses were found to be primarily dependent on IL-1R signaling. Whilst exploring the basis for their susceptibility, <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice were found to be unusually susceptible to intestinal <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium colonization, developing enterocolitis without the typical requirement for antibiotic based removal of competing commensal microbes. Strikingly, the exaggerated antimicrobial responses seen in <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice were found to cause a rapid and dramatic loss of commensal microbes from the infected intestine. This depletion appears to reduce the ability of the microbiota to compete for space and nutrients (colonization resistance) with the invading pathogens, leaving the intestine highly susceptible to pathogen colonization. Thus, SIGIRR expression by IEC reflects a strategy that sacrifices maximal innate responsiveness by IEC in order to promote commensal microbe based colonization resistance against bacterial pathogens.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Despite being in close contact with billions of commensal bacteria, the epithelial cells that line the intestine develop very weak innate inflammatory responses to bacterial products. The goal of this study was to explore why these cells respond so poorly, and how increasing their innate responsiveness would impact on host defense against invading bacterial pathogens. We show that a negative regulator of innate signaling called SIGIRR, limits the inflammatory responses of the intestine to bacteria. Following infection by the bacterial pathogen <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>, the intestines of mice lacking SIGIRR showed exaggerated inflammatory, antimicrobial and proliferative responses. Through transplantation studies, we showed it was SIGIRR expression by intestinal epithelial cells that limits these responses, and that the exaggerated responses were driven by cytokine signaling through the interleukin-1 receptor. Despite their exaggerated responses, SIGIRR deficient mice proved extremely susceptible to infection by <italic>C. rodentium</italic> and other intestinal bacterial pathogens. We found the exaggerated inflammatory responses rapidly depleted intestinal commensal microbes, reducing their ability to outcompete invading pathogens for space and nutrients (colonization resistance). Our study thus clarifies that the hypo-responsiveness of epithelial cells plays an unexpected but critical role in host defense, by promoting commensal microbe based competition against enteric pathogens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> is a mouse-specific attaching/effacing (A/E) bacterial pathogen related to the clinically important enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic <italic>E. coli</italic> (EHEC). <italic>C. rodentium</italic> has been widely used to define the <italic>in vivo</italic> virulence strategies employed by A/E pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Mundy1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Bergstrom1">[2]</xref>. It has also proven a popular model to assess host immune responses against mucosal bacterial pathogens as well as explore how these pathogens compete with intestinal commensal microbes for colonization niches and nutrients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Kamada1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Lupp1">[4]</xref>. We have shown that Myeloid differentiation factor (MyD) 88 dependent innate receptors play a critical role in driving the host response to infection as well as controlling <italic>C. rodentium</italic> burdens carried by mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Gibson1">[5]</xref>. Moreover, we and others have shown that infected <italic>Myd88</italic> deficient (−/−) mice suffer severe intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) damage leading to widespread ulcers and necrosis of their colonic tissues. MyD88 signaling thus appears to limit tissue damage during infection by this pathogen, potentially by promoting increased IEC proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Gibson1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Lebeis1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>While the full array of receptors involved in the protective actions of MyD88 in this model is still unclear, TLR4 appears to drive the inflammatory response as well as promote IEC proliferation. We previously showed that infected <italic>Tlr4 −/−</italic> mice displayed only modest increases in colonic crypt heights and were attenuated in the induction of the chemokines MCP-1 and MIP2α, as well as the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to the infected colon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Khan1">[7]</xref>. Despite these defects in their inflammatory responses, <italic>Tlr4 −/−</italic> mice were still able to clear <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection. In contrast, TLR2 and interleukin (IL)-1R both protect IEC integrity and drive IEC repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Bergstrom1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Khan1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Lebeis2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Gibson2">[9]</xref>. Infected <italic>Tlr2 −/−</italic> mice suffer severe ulceration in their mid and distal colons. Surprisingly, their exaggerated pathology was not due to higher <italic>C. rodentium</italic> burdens, as colonization levels were similar to wildtype mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Gibson3">[10]</xref>, but instead involved impaired IEC barrier function and reduced production of the cytokine IL-6, leading to exaggerated IEC apoptosis during infection. Similarly, mice lacking the IL-1R were found to be more susceptible to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection, developing exaggerated mucosal damage following challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Lebeis2">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>Since many of the MyD88 dependent responses to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection involve changes in IEC function or proliferation, we asked whether they reflected MyD88 dependent signalling within the IEC themselves. While it is clear that MyD88 signalling can occur within IEC, in general IEC are hypo-responsive to most bacterial products and other aspects of inflammatory signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-RakoffNahoum1">[11]</xref>. Since IEC exist in close proximity to trillions of commensal bacteria, their hypo-responsiveness may be necessary to maintain a mutualistic relationship with the resident microbiota and prevent spontaneous intestinal inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Bergstrom1">[2]</xref>. The commensal microbiota, aside from providing nutrients to the host, are important contributors to host defense by promoting resistance to colonization by enteric pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Lawley1">[12]</xref>. Disruption of the commensal microbiota (through antibiotic treatment, for example) enhances enteric pathogen colonization and subsequent disease in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-vanderWaaij1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-VanderWaaij1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Kaiser1">[15]</xref>. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie commensal microbe based resistance to colonization in the mammalian intestine remain poorly defined.</p>
<p>Recent studies suggest that the innate hypo-responsiveness of IEC may in part reflect the actions of Single Ig IL-1 related receptor (SIGIRR) (also called TIR8), a negative regulator of IL-1R and TLR signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Garlanda1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Wald1">[17]</xref>. SIGIRR suppresses MyD88 dependent signaling by sequestering IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)1 and TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF) 6, both downstream targets of MyD88 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Wald1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Polentarutti1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Riva1">[19]</xref>. Our laboratory recently demonstrated that stable overexpression of SIGIRR within IEC lines diminished NF-κB–mediated IL-8 responses to TLR ligands and to IL-1β. In contrast, suppression of SIGIRR by small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) significantly enhanced Caco-2 and HT-29 cell line production of IL-8 in response to these ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Khan2">[20]</xref>. We have also shown that <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice suffer extensive mucosal damage and increased mortality during dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induced colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Xiao1">[21]</xref>. The protective role of SIGIRR in this model was shown to reflect the suppression of inflammatory signalling within IEC, such that in the absence of SIGIRR, IEC exhibited exaggerated inflammatory responses driven by the presence of the commensal microbiota. Despite these findings, the specific receptors regulated by SIGIRR were not defined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Xiao1">[21]</xref>. To address what impact increased innate responsiveness by IEC would have on intestinal host defense against pathogenic bacteria, we tested the effects of SIGIRR on the host response to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection.</p>
<p>As previously reported, the intestines of uninfected <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice were histologically similar to those of WT mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Xiao1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Garlanda2">[22]</xref> but following <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection, <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice developed exaggerated inflammatory and antimicrobial responses, along with increased mucosal damage and IEC proliferation. Bone marrow (BM) transplantation experiments confirmed that loss of SIGIRR in the non-BM compartment (putative IEC) controlled the exaggerated colitic and IEC responses. These responses appeared largely independent of TLR2 or TLR4 but were instead dependent on IL-1R signalling. Despite their exaggerated colitic and antimicrobial responses, <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice showed dramatically increased susceptibility to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection, in association with the rapid depletion of their intestinal commensal microbes. This loss of commensals reduced the host's resistance to colonization by <italic>C. rodentium</italic> as well as to other enteric bacterial pathogens. Thus SIGIRR plays an unexpected role in enteric host defense, promoting commensal microbe-based colonization resistance to pathogens at the expense of limiting antimicrobial, colitic and IEC homeostatic responses.</p>

<title>MyD88 signaling in IEC plays little role in the host response to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection</title>
<p>MyD88 signaling plays a critical role in the development of protective host responses to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection, controlling pathogen burdens, driving inflammation and promoting IEC integrity/proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Gibson1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Lebeis1">[6]</xref>. As a result, <italic>Myd88</italic> −/− mice are highly susceptible to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection, carrying heavy pathogen burdens and suffering severe mucosal damage and loss of IEC barrier function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003539-g001">Figure 1A–1D</xref>). Since many of these MyD88 dependent protective responses involve changes in IEC function, we tested whether they reflected MyD88 signaling within the IEC. Crossing <italic>Myd88</italic> flox mice with mice expressing the cre enzyme under the villin (IEC specific) promoter, we generated IEC-<italic>Myd88</italic> −/− mice that were then infected with <italic>C. rodentium</italic> along with control <italic>MyD88</italic> flox mice. Interestingly, MyD88 signaling within IEC had little impact on the host response to infection. Pathogen burdens in the IEC-<italic>Myd88</italic> −/− mice were similar to those in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003539-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), as were crypt heights and tissue integrity. Moreover, we noted no overt difference in IEC barrier function or inflammatory cell recruitment to the infected cecum between these two mouse strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003539-g001">Figure 1B–1D</xref>). These data indicate that MyD88 signaling within IEC plays little role in driving the innate host response to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection.</p>

To test the impact of SIGIRR <italic>in vivo</italic>, <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice were infected with <italic>C. rodentium</italic> under co-housing conditions (WT and <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice in same cage) or with WT and <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice housed in different cages, and similar results were obtained.

<p>Based on the observed pathology, as well as the fact that baseline SIGIRR gene transcript levels in WT mice were highest in the cecum (not shown), we focused our subsequent analysis on the cecum. At both D6 and D10 pi, <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice showed significantly higher cecal pathology scores compared to WT mice, reflecting increased crypt hyperplasia, edema, and greater inflammatory cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003539-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>, P&lt;0.05). Specifically, we noted increased macrophage and neutrophil infiltration into the cecal mucosa of <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice. Similarly, gene transcript levels for chemokines (MCP-1 and MIP-2α), antimicrobial factors (mCRAMP, β-defensin III, and Reg-3γ) and cytokines (IL-17A, TNF-α and IFN-γ) were all significantly elevated at D6 and D10 pi in <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003539.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Based on their exaggerated colitic responses, we expected <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice would show some level of protection against infection.

<title>The negative regulator SIGIRR suppresses the host response to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection</title>
<p>We next examined whether SIGIRR impacted on very early host responses to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> by employing the cecal ligation model of acute <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection, allowing us to inject equal pathogen numbers into the ceca of WT and <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice.

Cecal tissues were collected and qPCR was used to determine transcript levels for genes encoding several antimicrobial peptides and other IEC derived factors. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003539-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, infection of WT mice led to a modest increase in the transcription of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides (mCRAMP, Reg3γ, β-defensin III) and chemokines (MCP1 and MIP2α). In contrast, we observed strikingly elevated transcription of most genes in infected <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice (P&lt;0.05), despite the two mouse strains carrying similar pathogen burdens.

<p>SIGIRR thus plays a critical role in suppressing <italic>C. rodentium</italic> induced colitis, but the cellular source of SIGIRR is unclear.

To better define the cell type(s) regulated by SIGIRR during <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection, we generated haematopoietic chimeras by BM transplantation between <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice and WT mice expressing Ly5.1 on their BM-derived cells. Following infection by <italic>C. rodentium</italic>, <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− + WT BM chimeric mice developed severe colitis, similar to that seen in <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice. Moreover the ceca of infected WT + <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− BM mice were macroscopically similar to those of WT mice, although histologically, they displayed a greater increase in crypt lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003539-g004">Figure 4B–4D</xref>) than WT mice. Pathology scoring also revealed <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− + WT BM mice had exaggerated crypt hyperplasia, edema and immune cell infiltration when compared to WT + <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− BM mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003539-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, P&lt;0.05).

<p>Next, we sought to identify the specific TLRs responsible for the exaggerated colitis seen in <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice. Previous studies have shown that the host response to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection is largely dependent on TLR2 and TLR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Khan1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Gibson3">[10]</xref>. Therefore, we crossbred <italic>Tlr2 −/−</italic> mice and <italic>Tlr4</italic> −/− mice with <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice to generate <italic>Tlr2/Sigirr</italic> −/− mice and <italic>Tlr4/Sigirr</italic> −/− mice. Upon infecting these mice along with WT and <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice, and <italic>Tlr2 −/−</italic> and <italic>Tlr4 −/−</italic> mice, all mouse strains were found to survive the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003539-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003539.s003">Figure S3</xref>). As expected, all readouts were dramatically greater in the <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice, as compared to WT mice. Interestingly, <italic>Tlr2 −/−</italic> and <italic>Tlr4 −/−</italic> mice developed modestly elevated pathology compared to WT mice but much less than that suffered by <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003539.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Moreover, the responses in <italic>Tlr2/Sigirr</italic> −/− mice and <italic>Tlr4/Sigirr</italic> −/− mice were similar to those in the <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice including pathogen burdens and pathological damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003539-g005">Figure 5B and 5C</xref>). Hence, the data suggest that the exaggerated damage and increased pathogen burden observed in the <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice are largely independent of TLR2 and TLR4.</p>

<title>SIGIRR controls IEC proliferation and integrity largely independent of TLR2 and TLR4</title>
<p>In previous studies, we showed TLR2 and TLR4 play specific and critical roles in controlling IEC responses during <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Gibson2">[9]</xref>. TLR4 signaling drives IEC proliferation during infection, while TLR2 signaling promotes IEC integrity. In fact, infected <italic>Tlr2</italic> −/− mice suffer exaggerated IEC barrier permeability, and impaired phospho-STAT3 signaling within their IEC, with these defects leading to cecal and colonic ulcers and high mortality rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Gibson3">[10]</xref>. When we assessed IEC responses in the <italic>Tlr2/Sigirr</italic> −/− mice and <italic>Tlr4/Sigirr</italic> −/− mice, the <italic>Tlr2/Sigirr</italic> −/− mice exhibited similar proliferative responses (74±7%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003539-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) to <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice (75±7%) as demonstrated by Ki-67 staining. Interestingly, <italic>Tlr4/Sigirr</italic> −/− mice showed an intermediate level of IEC proliferation (58±3%), modestly but not significantly reduced compared to <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice, yet still significantly greater (P&lt;0.05) than WT mice (36±4%). This data suggests that signaling through other SIGIRR-regulated receptors drives IEC proliferation in <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice, even in the absence of TLR4.</p>
<p>We next tested IEC barrier function in these mice (and <italic>Tlr2</italic> −/− mice). At D6 pi, FD4 serum levels within <italic>Tlr2</italic> −/− mice were significantly elevated compared to WT mice, confirming their impaired barrier function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003539-g005">Figures 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003539.s003">S3</xref>, P&lt;0.05). Similar to WT mice and <italic>Tlr4 −/−</italic> mice, <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice showed no overt barrier dysfunction, but strikingly, the concurrent loss of SIGIRR (<italic>Tlr2/Sigirr</italic> −/− mice) compensated for the barrier dysfunction seen in <italic>Tlr2</italic> −/− mice. Furthermore, the impaired phospho STAT-3 staining seen in <italic>Tlr2</italic> −/− mice was restored in <italic>Tlr2/Sigirr −/−</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003539-g005">Figure 5E</xref>).

<p>Thus <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice show unusual susceptibility to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> colonization and infection.

<title><italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice undergo rapid commensal microbe depletion following infection</title>
<p>Previous studies by our group and others found that differences in the makeup of the intestinal microbiota can affect host susceptibility to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Ghosh1">[31]</xref>. Previous sequencing studies found no overt differences between the microbiota of <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice and WT mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Chan1">[32]</xref>, but considering the susceptibility of <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice to enteric pathogens, we speculated they might instead carry either fewer total commensal microbes, or harbour a different microbial composition than WT mice. We enumerated the microbiota in the feces of these mice by fluorescence microscopy under baseline conditions, but noted no significant differences in commensal numbers between WT mice and <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003539-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). Through qPCR analysis of fecal pellets, we found members of the phylum <italic>Bacteroides</italic> to be the dominant taxonomic group present within the stool of both <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> and WT mice (∼50–60%), with smaller numbers of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (∼20%), and other microbes making up minor components of the microbiota. We also looked at representative members of these phyla such as <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Clostridium</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Wlodarska1">[33]</xref> and did not note any large or overt differences between the WT and <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice (data not shown).</p>

<p>No significant differences were found between (A) the commensal microbiota found in WT and <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice as measured by (B) qPCR and (C) FISH staining.

<p>We also analyzed the above mentioned stool samples using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The FISH analysis relied on staining microbes with probes for Eubacteria as well as probes specific for <italic>γ-Proteobacteria</italic> or probes that recognize only three genera (<italic>Cytophaga</italic>, <italic>Flexibacter</italic> and <italic>Bacteroides</italic>) from the phylum <italic>Bacteroides</italic>. Microbes that stained with the Eubacteria probe, but did not stain with the other probes were placed in the “Other” category, with these microbes primarily encompassing the <italic>Firmicutes</italic> as well as minor components of the microbiota. While the makeup of the microbiota as determined by the FISH staining may be less accurate when compared to the more thorough qPCR approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003539-g009">Figure 9B and 9C</xref>), both techniques were consistent in showing no statistically significant differences between uninfected <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> and WT mice, confirming previous reports by Chan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Chan1">[32]</xref></p>
<p>Interestingly, Lupp et al. (2007), showed that <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection causes a dramatic shift in the makeup of the gut microbiota as well as a reduction in total commensal numbers. These commensal changes were host mediated and took approximately 6 days to occur, corresponding with the time taken for <italic>C. rodentium</italic> to heavily colonize its host. We, and others have speculated these changes in the microbiota may facilitate <italic>C. rodentium</italic> colonization, as antibiotic based removal of commensals accelerates the course of <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Ghosh1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Wlodarska1">[33]</xref>. We quantified commensal populations within the feces of infected WT mice, and confirmed it takes approximately 6 days for the aforementioned commensal depletion (80%) to occur. In contrast, total commensal numbers in the fecal samples collected from the <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice dropped dramatically by D1 pi, and this reduction remained evident until D6 pi and beyond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003539-g009">Figure 9D</xref>). The depletion of commensal microbes affected all relevant phyla to a roughly similar degree as measured by qPCR (data not shown). The corresponding <italic>C. rodentium</italic> burdens increased in concert (albeit slightly delayed) with the loss of commensals. Rapid depletion of total commensal microbe numbers was also detected in <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice following infection with LD <italic>C. rodentium</italic> (not shown). Similarly, we also observed rapid depletion of total commensal microbe numbers by D2 post-<italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infection (in the absence of antibiotics) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003539-g009">Figure 9E</xref>, *P&lt;0.05). In contrast, this reduction in commensals was not observed in <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infected WT mice. Interestingly, we did not observe commensal depletion when <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice were infected with an avirulent strain (<italic>ΔescN</italic>) of <italic>C. rodentium</italic> (not shown). These results suggest the impaired resistance to pathogen colonization we observed in <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice reflects the ability of <italic>C. rodentium</italic> and <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium to rapidly trigger commensal depletion in these mice, thereby opening niches within the intestine for rapid pathogen colonization.</p>

<title><italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> crypt epithelial cells show heightened antimicrobial activity</title>
<p>We next addressed the basis for the rapid depletion of commensal microbes seen in infected <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice. Notably, the massive commensal depletion occurs prior to overt intestinal inflammation. As outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003539-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, acute exposure to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> rapidly increased antimicrobial gene expression, likely reflecting responses by IEC. We thus examined whether the IEC of <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice harbored greater bactericidal activity than WT mice towards commensal bacteria, using commensal <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Lactobacilli caesi</italic> as examples. We isolated intestinal crypts under baseline condition from WT and <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice; collected their crypt supernatants and tested their bactericidal activity against the aforementioned commensal microbes. After a 1 hr incubation, isolates from <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice showed a killing activity of 29.9±3.5% against commensal <italic>E. coli</italic> while crypt isolates from WT mice showed only 10.6±9.9%. Similarly, isolates from <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice displayed greater killing activity than WT mice against <italic>Lactobacilli caesi</italic> (38.4±2.4% versus 23.4±5.4%) a gram-positive commensal microbe (P&lt;0.05). Therefore, crypt isolates from <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice possess significantly higher bactericidal activity than those from WT mice.</p>
<p>We next we sought to determine whether the bactericidal activity within the crypt isolates of <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice increased during infection, and whether the enteric pathogens <italic>C. rodentium</italic> and <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium were more resistant to this bactericidal activity compared to commensal microbes. We isolated intestinal crypts from WT and <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice after 24 hrs of <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection; collected their crypt supernatants and tested their bactericidal activity against both commensal microbes and pathogenic microbes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003539-g009">Figure 9F</xref>, while the killing of <italic>L. casei</italic> by <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> crypt isolates was relatively unchanged from baseline, the killing of the commensal <italic>E. coli</italic> strain significantly increased to 41.4±3.9% at day 1 pi (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, both <italic>C. rodentium</italic> and <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium were found to be significantly more resistant to the bactericidal activity of the crypt isolates from both WT and <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice compared to the commensal microbes (P&lt;0.05). Considering the rapid induction of antimicrobial genes seen in the cecal loop model, the heightened antimicrobial activity of <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice likely explains the rapid commensal depletion seen following their infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>MyD88 dependent signaling plays a critical protective role during <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection, promoting inflammatory and antimicrobial responses that control <italic>C. rodentium</italic> burdens, as well as homeostatic responses that protect IEC barrier function and limit/repair IEC injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Gibson1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Lebeis1">[6]</xref>. While many of these responses involve changes in IEC function, we clearly show that MyD88 signaling within IEC plays little role in driving these responses. Rather than IEC being unable to respond to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection, we instead show that the negative regulator SIGIRR suppresses their responsiveness. While <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice react strongly to pathogenic insults to the GI tract, <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice do not develop spontaneous colitis or other baseline pathologies, but instead show a modestly elevated inflammatory tone within their intestines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Xiao1">[21]</xref>. When we infected <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice, they developed exaggerated inflammatory and antimicrobial responses as well as increased IEC proliferation and repair. These responses began within the IEC layer, and through BM transplantation studies, we confirmed that it was SIGIRR expression by non-BM cells (putative IEC) that limits the host inflammatory and IEC responses to <italic>C. rodentium</italic>. This data thus expands our previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies that the innate responsiveness of IEC to A/E bacterial pathogens is dramatically elevated in the absence of SIGIRR.</p>
<p>We previously showed <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice develop exaggerated DSS colitis and IEC proliferation that depended on the presence of commensal microbes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Xiao1">[21]</xref>, but it was unclear which SIGIRR regulated receptors drove these responses. In the current study, we tested the role of MyD88, as well as individual receptors and as expected, loss of MyD88 left <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice suffering severe mucosal damage and rapidly succumbing to infection, much like <italic>Myd88 −/−</italic> mice that express SIGIRR. As previously mentioned, TLR4 signaling drives the majority of inflammation and IEC proliferation during <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection of SIGIRR expressing mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Gibson2">[9]</xref>. Similarly TLR2 signaling in these mice is required to protect and repair IEC barrier function during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Gibson2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Gibson3">[10]</xref>. Interestingly, neither TLR2 nor TLR4 were required for these roles in the absence of SIGIRR. In fact, SIGIRR deficiency led to increased IEC proliferation/barrier protection that was largely able to compensate for the defects caused by either TLR2 or TLR4 deficiency, suggesting another receptor was responsible for the protective IEC responses seen in <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice.</p>
<p>Our data indicate that IL-1R signaling drives the exaggerated IEC responses seen in <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice. While IL-1R signaling plays a protective role during <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection of SIGIRR expressing hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Lebeis2">[8]</xref>, it appears to be primarily responsible for the heightened IEC proliferation and barrier protection seen in <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice, as these exaggerated IEC responses were attenuated following anakinra treatment, and lost in <italic>Il-1r/Sigirr</italic> −/− mice. While the increased pathogen burdens and heightened inflammation seen in the <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice were not overtly IL-1R dependent, IL-1R signaling did prove crucial in limiting the severity of the resulting mucosal damage and ultimately for the survival of infected <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice. Interestingly, we found elevated levels of both IL-1α and IL-1β in the intestinal tissues of <italic>Sigirr</italic> −/− mice under both baseline and infected conditions. Both IL-1α and IL-1β have been shown to induce IEC proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as induce expression of chemokines and antimicrobial factors by IEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Dube1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Jobin1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Cunliffe1">[36]</xref>. At present it is unclear which cytokine (or perhaps both) drives the exaggerated IL-1R dependent epithelial proliferative and repair responses seen in the <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice.</p>
<p>Our data also indicates it is primarily SIGIRR expression by non-BM derived cells that limits the host response to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection. While several BM derived cell types (macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells) found in the intestine express SIGIRR, the only described non-BM derived cell type is the IEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Garlanda1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Wald1">[17]</xref>. It has been speculated that maintaining the innate hypo-responsiveness of IEC helps prevent spontaneous commensal microbe driven intestinal inflammation, as seen in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Pott1">[37]</xref>. While this may be the case in some situations, our data suggests that SIGIRR instead controls the threshold at which IEC respond to invading bacterial pathogens.</p>
<p>Notably, despite their innate hyper-responsiveness, <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice proved highly susceptible to infection, undergoing very rapid pathogen colonization and ultimately carrying significantly heavier <italic>C. rodentium</italic> burdens than WT mice. Unlike <italic>Myd88 −/−</italic> mice where their immunodeficiency not only led to increased intestinal pathogen burdens, but also lethally high <italic>C. rodentium</italic> burdens in the liver and spleen, the <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice only showed increased pathogen burdens in their ceca and colons. Heavy <italic>C. rodentium</italic> colonization of <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice was evident between D2 and 4 pi, compared to the 6 days typically required for WT mice. Interestingly, we previously found that such rapid <italic>C. rodentium</italic> colonization was only seen in mice pretreated with the antibiotic streptomycin to displace commensal microbes. Taken together with the susceptibility of <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice to <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium infection without the typical requirement for streptomycin pretreatment, we focused on potential defects in commensals as underlying the susceptibility of <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice to pathogen colonization of their intestines.</p>
<p>As outlined by Chan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Chan1">[32]</xref>, previous deep sequencing studies identified few differences between <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice and WT mice in their baseline intestinal microbiota. In accordance with their results, we also found they carried similar numbers of intestinal commensal microbes, and showed only modest differences in their baseline microbiota makeup, as compared to WT mice. We therefore compared how the intestinal microbiota of <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> and WT mice responded to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection. As shown by Lupp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Lupp1">[4]</xref>, infection of WT mice leads to a host mediated depletion of the intestinal microbiota by D6 pi, concomitant with <italic>C. rodentium</italic> expansion and spread through the intestines of WT mice. We confirmed this timing in WT mice, whereas overt commensal depletion was found to occur by D1 pi in <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice, and persisted thereafter. Though qPCR analysis, we found that the observed commensal depletion affected all commensal microbial phyla to a roughly similar degree. Interestingly, this rapid commensal depletion did not occur when <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice were gavaged with avirulent <italic>C. rodentium</italic>, but it did occur when the mice were challenged with <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium suggesting the commensal depletion results from a host response to active infection.</p>
<p>While infected <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice do not display overt colitis at the time of commensal depletion, we showed that acute exposure to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> dramatically elevated mRNA transcript levels for a number of antimicrobial genes within the ceca of <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice. This increased antimicrobial tone had a functional effect, as intestinal crypt IEC isolates from even uninfected <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice displayed significantly greater killing activity against commensal <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> bacteria than IEC from WT mice. We also demonstrated that the bactericidal activity of the <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> crypt IEC selectively but significantly increased by as early as D1 pi, and that compared to the commensals, the pathogens <italic>C. rodentium</italic> and <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium were comparatively resistant to killing by crypt IEC. Thus the rapid depletion of intestinal commensal microbes seen in infected <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice likely reflects the heightened antimicrobial activity of their IEC and provides much of the basis for their reduced colonization resistance against enteric pathogens.</p>
<p>Colonization resistance was initially described by van der Waaij et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-VanderWaaij1">[14]</xref> as the process whereby the intestinal microbiota protects itself as well as the host against incursion by new and often harmful microbes. While there is significant evidence for colonization resistance, such as the hyper-sensitivity of germfree mice to enteric infections, the exact mechanisms by which colonization resistance exerts its protective role are unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-vanderWaaij1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-VanderWaaij1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Stecher2">[38]</xref>. Moreover, while such commensal mediated resistance to enteric pathogens is undoubtedly beneficial to the host, it is unclear whether host factors play a role in promoting colonization resistance. Our data suggests that it is in fact the innate hypo-responsiveness of IEC that is critical in promoting colonization resistance. While it may seem counter-intuitive that limiting host antimicrobial and inflammatory responses in the GI tract would be protective, as our LD infection data shows, in most cases when the host is exposed to small numbers of enteric bacterial pathogens, the resident microbiota are able to prevent the pathogens from successfully infecting the host. It appears that SIGIRR helps maintain host-commensal mutualism (and colonization resistance) in the face of noxious threats, such as the incursion by a bacterial pathogen, potentially by controlling the threshold at which the IEC respond.</p>
<p>Our results are intriguing since the exaggerated inflammatory/antimicrobial responses in the intestines of <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice appeared to deplete only commensals and not <italic>C. rodentium</italic>. While our crypt killing assays suggest the responses elicited in <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice are poorly effective against <italic>C. rodentium</italic> and <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium, we believe the effects are more complex. It is well known that enteric bacterial pathogens utilize a number of strategies to subvert host defenses, including suppressing the inflammatory signaling of infected IEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Bergstrom1">[2]</xref>, as well as possessing greater inherent resistance to the effects of antimicrobial peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-LeSage1">[39]</xref>. Moreover, recent studies have shown that enteric bacterial pathogens can utilize nutrients and metabolites released within the inflamed intestine that are unusable to commensal species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Kamada1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003539-Winter1">[40]</xref>. Therefore the success of bacterial pathogens at replacing the microbiota in <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice may in fact also demonstrate their evolutionary success at withstanding host antimicrobial responses, and/or their ability to obtain nutrients within the intestinal lumen of the <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice, in comparison to commensal microbes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data demonstrate that <italic>Sigirr −/−</italic> mice develop exaggerated intestinal inflammatory, antimicrobial and IEC proliferative responses to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection. While IL-1R signaling is key to many of the changes in IEC function and proliferation seen in these mice, there are other aspects of their exaggerated colitis (inflammation, commensal depletion etc) that are at least partially IL-1R independent but are still MyD88 dependent (not shown). We speculate these responses may reflect the combined actions of several TLRs since we were unable to identify a specific TLR responsible for these phenotypes. Moreover, although SIGIRR suppresses host inflammatory, antimicrobial and IEC reparative responses, it actually plays a critical role in enteric host defense by promoting commensal based colonization resistance against enteric bacterial pathogens. Thus SIGIRR's role in limiting the innate responsiveness of IEC is evidence of a complex defense strategy within the GI tract. This strategy delays the development of protective host responses to infection, by relying on cell types other than IEC to drive protective host (MyD88) responses to infection. However SIGIRR's key role in promoting and protecting host mutualism with the gut microbiota has obvious advantages as well, preventing many enteric infections by supporting the ability of the microbiota to resist invading microbes. While promoting colonization resistance to enteric infections is of great benefit, ultimately we believe that modulating SIGIRR expression within the intestine could also offer therapeutic potential for GI diseases, such as IBD. Increasing SIGIRR expression could potentially reduce inflammation in IBD patients, whereas suppressing SIGIRR could potentially help promote mucosal repair.</p>

<p>At least 2 fecal pellets were collected from each animal at time points indicated. After homogenization, samples were placed in 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin to a final concentration of 3%. Samples were further diluted 1∶10 in PBS, vortexed briefly, and stored at 4°C. 2–5 µl of the 1∶10 diluted sample stored in PBS was diluted in 1 ml PBS and filtered onto Anodisc 25 filters (Whatman International Ltd) with a pore size of 0.2 µM and 2.5 cm diameter. The samples were allowed to thoroughly dry, and then were mounted on glass slides with ProLong Gold Antifade reagent containing DAPI (Molecular Probes) and viewed as above. The mean number of DAPI positive microbes counted in 3 to 6 randomly chosen fields per disc (1000×) was determined by two scorers. The total number of commensal microbes was calculated based on the mean numbers of all the counted fields and the dilution factor.
