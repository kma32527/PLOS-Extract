<abstract>
<p>Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection results in lifelong chronic infection of trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons, also referred to as neuronal HSV-1 latency, with periodic reactivation leading to recrudescent herpetic disease in some persons. HSV-1 proteins are expressed in a temporally coordinated fashion during lytic infection, but their expression pattern during latent infection is largely unknown. Selective retention of HSV-1 reactive T-cells in human TG suggests their role in controlling reactivation by recognizing locally expressed HSV-1 proteins. We characterized the HSV-1 proteins recognized by virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cells recovered from human HSV-1–infected TG. T-cell clusters, consisting of both CD4 and CD8 T-cells, surrounded neurons and expressed mRNAs and proteins consistent with <italic>in situ</italic> antigen recognition and antiviral function. HSV-1 proteome-wide scans revealed that intra-TG T-cell responses included both CD4 and CD8 T-cells directed to one to three HSV-1 proteins per person. HSV-1 protein ICP6 was targeted by CD8 T-cells in 4 of 8 HLA-discordant donors. <italic>In situ</italic> tetramer staining demonstrated HSV-1-specific CD8 T-cells juxtaposed to TG neurons. Intra-TG retention of virus-specific CD4 T-cells, validated to the HSV-1 peptide level, implies trafficking of viral proteins from neurons to HLA class II-expressing non-neuronal cells for antigen presentation. The diversity of viral proteins targeted by TG T-cells across all kinetic and functional classes of viral proteins suggests broad HSV-1 protein expression, and viral antigen processing and presentation, in latently infected human TG. Collectively, the human TG represents an immunocompetent environment for both CD4 and CD8 T-cell recognition of HSV-1 proteins expressed during latent infection. HSV-1 proteins recognized by TG-resident T-cells, particularly ICP6 and VP16, are potential HSV-1 vaccine candidates.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>HSV-1 is an endemic human herpesvirus worldwide that establishes a lifelong latent infection of neurons in the trigeminal ganglion (TG), allowing intermittent reactivation resulting in recurrent disease in some persons. Studies in HSV-1 models suggest a central role of TG-infiltrating virus-specific CD8 T-cells to control reactivation. In humans, however, the functional properties and fine specificity of intra-TG T-cell responses remain enigmatic. The current study used molecular, immunological and <italic>in situ</italic> analysis platforms on human cadaveric TG obtained within hours after death to characterize the local HSV-1 specific T-cell response in latently infected human TG in detail. We identified that CD4 and CD8 T-cells were juxtaposed to TG neurons and expressed host transcripts and proteins consistent with <italic>in situ</italic> antigen recognition and antiviral function. The intra-TG T-cell response, involving both CD4 and CD8 T-cells, was directed to a limited set of HSV-1 proteins per person, which was not limited to a specific kinetic or structural class of viral proteins. Collectively, the data indicate that the human TG is an immunocompetent environment for CD4 and CD8 T-cell recognition of diverse HSV-1 proteins expressed during latent infection and that the viral antigens identified herein are rational candidates for HSV-1 subunit vaccines.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The neurotropic human alphaherpesvirus herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is endemic worldwide. It is acquired during early childhood via the orofacial route resulting in a lifelong chronic infection of neurons, also referred to as neuronal HSV-1 latency, in the bilateral trigeminal ganglia (TG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Roizman1">[1]</xref>. During latency no infectious virus is produced, virus transcription is mainly directed to latency-associated transcripts (LATs) and microRNAs, and HSV-1 proteins are undetectable using standard methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Stevens1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Held1">[7]</xref>. Latent HSV-1 periodically reactivates, producing infectious virus that may lead to recrudescent lesions in some persons. Both primary and recurrent disease can result in clinical disorders of variable severity or even death, emphasizing the unmet need for preventive and therapeutic vaccines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Roizman1">[1]</xref>. The candidate HSV subunit vaccines, based on the HSV glycoproteins B (gB) and gD were tested in human phase III trials, but were not effective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Straus1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Belshe1">[10]</xref>. Vaccines induced antigen-specific antibodies and CD4 T-cells, but not CD8 T-cells, arguing for novel vaccine formulations that include specific HSV-1 antigens targeted by both antibodies as well as CD4 and CD8 T-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Ouwendijk1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Studies in humans and HSV-1 mouse models suggest a pivotal role for virus-specific CD8 T-cells in the control HSV-1 reactivation. Virus-specific CD8 T-cells, expressing an activated effector memory T-cell phenotype, are selectively retained in HSV-1–infected ganglia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Derfuss1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Khanna1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Verjans1">[15]</xref>. In the HSV-1 mouse model with a C57BL/6 background, the HSV-specific intra-TG CD8 T-cells inhibit HSV-1 reactivation by secreting interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and granzyme B (grB), and are mainly directed against an immunodominant HSV-1 gB epitope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Knickelbein1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Wallace1">[19]</xref>. In nature, however, HSV-1 only infects humans. Because HSV-1 infections in mice mimic but are not equivalent to human disease, it is important that findings from mouse models are confirmed and extended to humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Kinchington1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Johnston1">[22]</xref>. Moreover, the HSV-1 antigens recognized by human TG-infiltrating T-cells are rational candidates for HSV-1 subunit vaccines.</p>
<p>HSV-1 encodes at least 77 proteins that during lytic infection are sequentially expressed in a coordinated fashion as immediate early (α), early (β), leaky late (γ1) and true late proteins (γ2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Roizman1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Du1">[23]</xref>. Expression of γ2 proteins depends on viral DNA replication. While infectious virions eventually assemble in distal axonal structures after reactivation, the temporal expression and trafficking of HSV-1 proteins in human neurons during latency is largely unknown. We previously showed reactivity of human TG-derived CD4 and CD8 T-cells to whole HSV-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Verjans1">[15]</xref>, but not which proteins were susceptible to local immune recognition. The detection of transcripts encoding the HSV-1 α proteins infecting cell polypeptide 0 (ICP0) and ICP4 in human TG suggests that this kinetic class of proteins is expressed during latency or early after reactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Derfuss1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Held1">[7]</xref>. However, their accessibility to antigen processing and presentation within TG-resident cells for local T-cell surveillance is unclear. The aims of this study were to characterize the functional properties and HSV-1 antigens recognized by T-cells in HSV-1–infected human TG.</p>

<title>Transcripts Levels of T-Cell Cytolytic Effector Molecules and Cytokines Correlate with CD8β Transcript Levels and HSV-1 DNA Load in Human TG</title>
<p>In contrast to the HSV-1 mouse models, human TG are commonly co-infected with HSV-1 and the closely related neurotropic human alphaherpesvirus varicella-zoster virus (VZV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Theil1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Verjans1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Kinchington1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Pevenstein1">[24]</xref>. To gain insight into the functional properties of human TG-residing T-cells in relation to latent HSV-1 and VZV we determined the transcript levels of the T-cell cytolytic effector molecules perforin and grB, and the cytokines IFN-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in 26 TG of 16 donors by reverse transcriptase real-time PCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Remeijer1">[25]</xref>. We first determined the prevalence and viral load of latent HSV-1 and VZV by real-time PCR. HSV-1 and VZV DNA was detectable in 17 (65%) and 23 (89%) of the 26 TG analyzed, respectively. Sixteen TG contained DNA of both viruses, seven TG had only VZV, one TG had only HSV-1 and two TG had no detectable DNA of either virus. The presence of virus-specific DNA correlated with the donor's HSV-1 and VZV serostatus and was commonly detected in both TG of each individual (data not shown). Consistent with previous reports, the mean number ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of HSV-1 genome equivalent copies per 10<sup>5</sup> TG cells (1,850±427) was significantly higher compared to VZV (693±184) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.015) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003547-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Verjans1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Pevenstein1">[24]</xref>. The intra-TG HSV-1 and VZV DNA load did not correlate in paired analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003547-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Transcription of the CD8 T-cell–specific gene CD8β correlated weakly with the intra-TG HSV-1 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.005), but not the VZV DNA load (<italic>p</italic> = 0.19) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003547-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Next, the expression levels of the T cell transcripts perforin, grB, IFN-γ and TNF-α were compared to the intra-TG HSV-1 and VZV burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003547-g001">Fig. 1E and F</xref>). A weak correlation was observed between both perforin (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04) and grB (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004) mRNA levels and the intra-TG HSV-1 DNA load, but not with the latent VZV burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003547-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>). Furthermore, the perforin (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001), grB (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001), IFN-γ (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) and TNF-α mRNA levels (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003) correlated strongly with CD8β mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003547-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Derfuss1">[5]</xref>. The data suggest that the extent of CD8 T-cell infiltration in human TG is not only specifically correlated with the latent HSV-1 burden, but is also transcriptionally active to orchestrate an anti-viral function <italic>in situ</italic>. Finally, the mRNA levels of CD8β (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003), perforin (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04), grB (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01), IFN-γ (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) and TNF-α (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0005) correlated strongly between the paired left and right TG indicating that the intra-TG T-cell responses are symmetric intra-individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003547-g001">Figure 1G</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Verjans1">[15]</xref>.</p>

We first analyzed the presence of TG-infiltrating CD4 and CD8 T-cells by flow cytometry on single cell suspensions of 15 TG of 8 HSV-1 IgG seropositive donors. The data demonstrated infiltration of equivalent numbers of CD4 and CD8 T-cells, with a median ratio of CD4 and CD8 T-cells of 0.99 (range 0.01 to 9.32), which also correlated between the paired left and right TG (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0002). Analogous flow cytometric analysis of a TG of one HSV-1 seronegative donor demonstrated a CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio of 1.1, which resembled that of the HSV-1 seropositive donors. However, the limited number of HSV-1 seronegative donors subjected to <italic>ex vivo</italic> flow cytometry analyses withhold conclusions to be drawn on the virus-specific role of retention of either T-cell subtype in human alphaherpesvirus latently infected TG.</p>

<title>Human TG-Derived HSV-1-Specific CD8 T-Cells Are Directed to Viral Proteins across All Kinetic and Functional Classes of Viral Proteins</title>
<p>To identify the viral proteins recognized by human TG residing T-cells, T-cell lines (TCL) were generated by mitogenic stimulation of TG-derived T-cells from twelve HSV-1 IgG seropositive donors. The HSV-1–specific T-cells were phenotyped and enumerated by a flow cytometric intra-cellular IFN-γ (IFN-γ ICC) assay using mock– and HSV-1–infected autologous Epstein-Barr virus transformed B-cell lines (BLCL) as antigen-presenting cells (APC). The median percentage of HSV-1–specific CD8 T-cells in the TG-TCL was 10% (range 2 to 37%) and 4 of 12 TG-TCL also contained HSV-1-specific CD4 T-cells (range 0.3 to 10%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003547-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The HSV-1 proteins recognized by human TG-derived CD8 T-cells were determined using transfected Cos-7 cells as artificial APC that expressed one of the donor's HLA-A and –B alleles in combination with 74 separate HSV-1 open reading frames (ORFs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Jing1">[27]</xref>. First, we used a set of partially HLA–A or –B allele matched HSV-1-infected BLCL as APC to uncover both the diversity and identity of HSV-1 peptide-presenting HLA class I (HLA-I) alleles used by the CD8 T-cells. The data demonstrated that the virus-specific intra-TG CD8 T-cell response is mediated by 1 to 4 different HLA–A and –B alleles per person (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003547-t001">Table 1</xref>). Next, we used the implicated HLA-A and -B allele in HSV-1 ORFeome-wide screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Jing1">[27]</xref>. We observed definitive HSV-1 ORFeome screen hits only when the net proportion of CD8 T-cells reactive with HLA-matched HSV-1-infected BLCL was &gt;4% (data not shown). For some donors, we enriched and expanded the TG-TCL using CD137 selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Jing1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Jing2">[28]</xref>. For this, TG-TCL were incubated with HSV-1–infected autologous BLCL and CD137<sup>+</sup> CD8 T-cells were selected after 18 hours of incubation and expanded with a T-cell mitogen to generate a second generation TG-TCL. This led to an approximately 3-fold enrichment of HSV-1 reactive CD8 T-cells for donors TG1, TG4 and TG12. The TG-TCL of donors TG8, TG9 and TG11 yielded insufficient enrichment or ample T-cell numbers to perform HSV-1 ORFeome screens (data not shown).</p>
<p>In total, 8 of 12 HSV-1 reactive TG-TCL revealed reproducible specific HSV-1 CD8 T-cell antigen hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003547-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Thirteen different CD8 T-cell viral targets were identified with 1 to 3 viral proteins per TG-TCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003547-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Virion protein 16 (VP16) and particularly ICP6 were recognized by multiple TG-TCL in the context of diverse HLA-A and –B alleles. In case of ICP6, 4 of 8 TG-TCL were positive and the protein was recognized via HLA-A*3101 (donor TG7), –B*1501 (donor TG2) and in 3 different TG donors via HLA-B*4001 (donors TG5, TG7 and TG12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003547-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Finally, candidate CD8 T-cell epitopes within several HSV-1 screen hit proteins were predicted by <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Vita1">[29]</xref>.

<p>We recently studied antigenic targets of blood-derived HSV-1 specific CD8 T-cells in HSV-1 IgG seropositive healthy subjects using related methodologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Jing1">[27]</xref>.

To discern potential similarities between systemic and intra-TG HSV-1 peptide specific CD8 T-cell responses we tested TG-TCL of seven HLA-A and -B allele matched TG donors for responses to the HLA-appropriate HSV-1 peptides from our previous work on blood-derived T-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Jing1">[27]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003547.s006">Table S1</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The host-pathogen standoff in human latent HSV-1 infection permits periodic epithelial shedding of infectious virus, and potential transmission, without overt host damage. In contrast, HSV-1 mouse models are either acutely fatal or demonstrate tight neuronal latency in which neither spontaneous nor stress-induced ganglionic reactivation leads to peripheral release of infectious virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Liu1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Kinchington1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Feldman1">[32]</xref>. In the current study, we demonstrated that the human TG is an immunocompetent organ capable of presenting viral antigens to both CD4 and CD8 T-cells, presumably over long periods of time, to maintain local enrichment of HSV-1–specific T-cells. The data imply that the HSV-1 proteins expressed in latently infected human TG are not limited to a specific class of kinetic or structural viral proteins and that the viral antigens identified herein are rational candidates for HSV-1 subunit vaccines.</p>
<p>In contrast to viral DNA and transcripts, viral proteins have not been detected in HSV-1 latently infected human ganglia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Derfuss1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Held1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Theil1">[13]</xref>. Viral protein synthesis may be shutdown or occur at low levels or at low frequency. T-cells are activated by only a few MHC/peptide-complexes making them highly sensitive and specific biosensors to detect extremely low-level expression of their cognate antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Walker1">[33]</xref>. The recognition of diverse HSV-1 proteins by human TG infiltrating T-cells implies their cognate antigen expression <italic>in situ</italic>. Moreover, the HSV-1 targets identified did not group to a specific kinetic or functional class of viral proteins suggesting that HSV-1 protein synthesis is not limited to early viral proteins in latently infected human TG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Derfuss1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Held1">[7]</xref>. Alternatively, the T-cell response reported herein may be directed to local reactivating HSV-1, which has overcome cellular and viral control including HSV-1 micro RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Umbach1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Held1">[7]</xref>. In contrast to humans, HSV-1 mouse models are either fatal or have tight neuronal latency in which spontaneous reactivation does not lead to peripheral release of infectious virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Kinchington1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Verjans2">[21]</xref>. Nevertheless, latently infected TG of C57BL/6 mice contain neuron-interacting CD8 T-cells, directed to 11 viral proteins including late structural HSV-1 proteins like gC and gK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Khanna1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-StLeger1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Wallace1">[19]</xref>. These data imply that full HSV-1 reactivation is not a prerequisite to retain virus-specific T-cells in ganglia with diverse viral protein reactivity. The combined human and mouse data argue that this process involves recognition of the T-cells' cognate viral antigens produced locally in HSV-1 latently infected ganglia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Derfuss1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Verjans1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-StLeger1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Kinchington1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>Activation of HSV-1-specific CD8 T-cells in latently infected murine ganglia is dependent on local CD4 T-cells, MHC class II expression and recruited blood-derived APC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-vanLint1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Wakim1">[34]</xref>. The current study documents inclusion of CD4 T-cells in neuron-interacting T-cell clusters and proves peptide-level recognition of HSV-1 by TG-resident CD4 T-cells in the natural host. Intriguingly, VP16 was targeted by both CD8 and CD4 T-cells in the same TG specimen (i.e., TG3) indicating local expression and presentation of this viral protein by TG cells in the context of both HLA-I and HLA-II molecules. Although local human APC driving the HSV-1-specific CD4 T-cell responses could be blood-derived or ganglion-resident <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-vanLint1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Wakim1">[34]</xref>, it is unlikely that HLA class II negative neurons are directly involved. The data suggest of HSV-1 proteins or remnants thereof from neurons to secondary APC. We have recently shown that satellite glial cells (SGC), which tightly envelop neuronal cell bodies in ganglia, are most likely of myeloid origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-vanVelzen1">[35]</xref>. Human TG-resident SGC are related to macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells with regards to their phagocytic capacity and expression of CD45, co-stimulatory and HLA class II molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Du1">[23]</xref>. Given their localization and phenotype, SGC are candidate APC to create an immunocompetent but not overtly inflammatory environment to support HSV-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses within latently infected human TG.</p>
<p>An important and still unanswered question is the functional role of the HSV-specific T-cells documented in this report. In the absence of tools to selectively interrupt or bolster T-cells at specific anatomic sites in humans, this question is difficult to address. Surrogate data can be obtained by examining the phenotype and activation status of human TG-resident CD8 T-cells. Integrating human TG <italic>ex vivo</italic> flow cytometry and <italic>in situ</italic> data, it is evident that TG-resident CD8 T-cells express CD137 and grB, and low levels of CD27 and CD28, indicative of recent antigen encounter locally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Derfuss1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Khanna1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-vanLint1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Verjans1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Held2">[36]</xref>. Messenger RNA expression of the T-cell cytolytic molecules perforin and grB directly correlated with HSV-1 DNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003547-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) and grB and TIA-1 protein expression co-localized with neuron-surrounding CD8 T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003547-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The fact that human TG-resident HSV-1-specific CD8 T-cells can massively expand <italic>in vitro</italic> and then display brisk virus-specific IFN-γ responses argues against an exhausted phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Verjans1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Chentoufi1">[37]</xref>. Taken together with the remarkable localization of HSV-1-specific CD8 T-cells juxtaposed to TG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003547-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003547.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003547.s005">Movie S1</xref>), our data argue for a functional role for these cells in non-lytic control of HSV-1 infection in human TG in cooperation with local CD4 T-cells.</p>
<p>If this interpretation is correct, elicitation of T-cells with anti-viral activity in the latently infected TG is a rational goal for preventative and therapeutic HSV-1 vaccines. Our findings have several implications for HSV-1 vaccine design. First, ICP6 was recognized by 4 of 8 TG donors in diverse HLA-I contexts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003547-t002">Table 2</xref>). ICP6 is a ribonucleotide reductase subunit expressed prior to viral DNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Roizman1">[1]</xref>. Because ICP6 was also a dominant target for the systemic CD8 T-cell response in HSV-1 seropositive subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Jing1">[27]</xref>, this protein is an attractive vaccine candidate. Second, HSV-1 proteins of diverse kinetic and structural classes were recognized by TG CD8 T-cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003547-t002">Table 2</xref>). These range from nonstructural α (ICP0 and ICP4) and β proteins (ICP6 and thymidine kinase) to the late structural tegument (VP11/12 and VP13/14) and envelope glycoproteins (gB, gK and gL). Tegument protein VP16, recognized by both CD4 and CD8 TG-resident T-cells, is possibly a chameleon with both a hyper-early role in neuronal reactivation and a structural role in tegument assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Thompson1">[30]</xref>. The cell biology implication of this finding appears that diverse HSV-1 proteins are diverted from viral assembly and access the HLA class I pathway in neurons, or possibly surrounding APC after handover. Third, the apparent diversity of recognized HSV-1 antigens is lower in TG than in blood, where we detected a mean of 14 reactive HSV-1 ORFs per person using similar technology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Jing1">[27]</xref>. The restricted clonality of the human intra-TG T-cell response is consistent with T-cell receptor spectratyping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Derfuss1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Verjans1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003547-Held2">[36]</xref>. Surveys of more participants, ideally with parallel studies on blood-derived T-cells, are mandatory to determine if the breadth or fine specificity of the paired TG and systemic HSV-1 T-cell responses differ and to pick the best antigens for possible subunit approaches that target sensory ganglia as a site of viral control. Manipulation of T-cell priming or boosting to imprint a TG-homing program via vaccination, without imparting an overly aggressive phenotype, is an equally important and challenging task that must be overcome to target the TG as an immunocompetent site for the purpose of HSV-1 latency control.</p>

Note the limited number of infiltrating CD3<sup>+</sup> cells that, in contrast to a TG of a representative HSV-1 positive donor (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003547-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), did not form neuron-interacting T-cell clusters. Representative image from 5 HSV-1 negative TG donors analyzed. (B) Scatter plot showing the mean number of CD3<sup>+</sup> cells per neuronal cell body in TG of HSV-1 seropositive (n = 7) and seronegative (n = 3) individuals. (C) Scatter plot showing the mean relative CD8β transcript levels in human TG that are HSV-1 DNA positive (n = 17) or negative (n = 9). (B and C) The Mann-Whitney test was used for statistical analysis.</p>
