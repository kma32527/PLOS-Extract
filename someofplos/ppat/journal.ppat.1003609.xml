<abstract>
<p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a β-herpesvirus, has evolved many strategies to subvert both innate and adaptive host immunity in order to ensure its survival and propagation within the host. Induction of IL-8 is particularly important during HCMV infection as neutrophils, primarily attracted by IL-8, play a key role in virus dissemination. Moreover, IL-8 has a positive effect in the replication of HCMV. This work has identified an HCMV gene (UL76), with the relevant property of inducing IL-8 expression at both transcriptional and protein levels. Up-regulation of IL-8 by UL76 results from activation of the NF-kB pathway as inhibition of both IKK-β activity or degradation of Ikβα abolishes the IL-8 induction and, concomitantly, expression of UL76 is associated with the translocation of p65 to the nucleus where it binds to the IL-8 promoter. Furthermore, the UL76-mediated induction of IL-8 requires ATM and is correlated with the phosphorylation of NEMO on serine 85, indicating that UL76 activates NF-kB pathway by the DNA Damage response, similar to the impact of genotoxic drugs. More importantly, a UL76 deletion mutant virus was significantly less efficient in stimulating IL-8 production than the wild type virus. In addition, there was a significant reduction of IL-8 secretion when <italic>ATM -/-</italic> cells were infected with wild type HCMV, thus, indicating that ATM is also involved in the induction of IL-8 by HCMV.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that expression of UL76 gene induces IL-8 expression as a result of the DNA damage response and that both UL76 and ATM have a role in the mechanism of IL-8 induction during HCMV infection. Hence, this work characterizes a new role of the activation of DNA Damage response in the context of host-pathogen interactions.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The importance of herpesviruses is evident by their prevalence in the human population and the diverse range of diseases that they provoke. Their ability to establish latency provides a compelling example of how herpesviruses successfully evade the immune system and manipulate cellular biology. One promising approach for the development of novel anti-viral strategies is to study viral proteins involved in these host-pathogen interactions. One example is the induction of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IL-8 by HCMV which enhances viral replication and dissemination of the virus by neutrophils. Here, we have identified HCMV UL76 gene, conserved in all herpesviruses, as an inducer of IL-8, and thus with an important impact on HCMV pathogenesis. The induction of IL-8 by UL76 results from activation of the DNA Damage response, which may also explain why UL76 also induces cell cycle arrest. These findings are a clear example of how viruses manipulate intracellular signaling pathways with different outcomes that will be beneficial for viral infection. Finally, the fact that UL76 is a non-homologous gene substantiates the premise that many such pathogen genes without homology may indeed have evolved for host manipulation, and are a repository of potential useful tools for experimental manipulation in health and disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a β-herpesvirus that infects healthy individuals, usually asymptomatically, but can cause severe or fatal disease in immunocompromised individuals. Primary HCMV infection, as with other herpesviruses, is followed by establishment of lifelong latency with periodic reactivation and, in order to successfully establish itself in the host, the virus has evolved a broad range of host evasion strategies, modulating not only innate and adaptive immunity, but also host cell biology, for example, the cell cycle and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Mocarski1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>The induction of the interleukin-8 (IL-8) during HCMV infection is particularly important for viral replication and possibly contributes to the efficient dissemination of the virus by neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Murayama1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Craigen1">[3]</xref>. Interleukin-8 is a pro-inflammatory chemokine that attracts primarily neutrophils, and also monocytes and cytotoxic T cells, by interacting with the CXC chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Hoffmann1">[4]</xref>. Although expression of IL-8 is low or absent under normal conditions, it is highly inducible by a wide range of extracellular stimuli, such as the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1, the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Kasahara1">[5]</xref>, bacteria and viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Aihara1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Medin1">[7]</xref>. Besides its relevant role in inflammation, IL-8 is a key component in several viral infections, modulating viral dissemination and virus replication, in part due to inhibition of the impact of interferon-α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Khabar1">[8]</xref>. On the other hand, excessive amounts of locally produced IL-8 can have deleterious effects, and so IL-8 gene expression is tightly controlled at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Activation of IL-8 expression in the majority of cell types is critically controlled by the NF-kB transcription factor. The AP-1 and NF-IL-6 transcription factors may also contribute to optimal IL-8 activation, depending on the stimulus or the cell type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Hoffmann1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>The NF-kB canonical pathway involves the activation of the IKK complex, consisting of two catalytic kinase subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ/NEMO. In most unstimulated cells, NF-kB dimers (mostly p65/p50 dimers) are localized in the cytoplasm as a complex with the IkB proteins. Upon stimulation, IkB is phosphorylated by the IKK complex, ubiquitinated and targeted for degradation, thus releasing the NF-kB subunits that translocate to the nucleus and induce transcription of target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Perkins1">[9]</xref>. Although most of the physiological inducers of NF-kB involve the canonical pathway, alternative mechanisms leading to NF-kB nuclear localization and DNA binding have been identified. One of these pathways is induced by activation of the DNA damage response and, in contrast to inflammatory stimuli such as TNFα or IL-1β, the signal originates in the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Miyamoto1">[10]</xref>. Activation of NF-kB by genotoxic stress requires induction of two independent parallel pathways. The first one triggered upon DNA damage results in the phosphorylation and activation of ATM, a nuclear protein kinase which regulates cell cycle checkpoints in response to DNA double-strand breaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Abraham1">[11]</xref>. The second pathway leads to SUMOylation of NEMO through a mechanism dependent on PARP1, PIASy and Ubc9. Activation of both these pathways leads to phosphorylation and ubiquitination of sumoylated NEMO in an ATM-dependent way. Ubiquitinated NEMO associated with ATM is exported back to the cytoplasm, activating the IKK complex and subsequent NF-kB activation in a similar manner to the canonical pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Miyamoto1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>The HCMV UL76 protein is virion-associated and expressed with late kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Wang1">[12]</xref>. The corresponding gene belongs to the UL24 gene family, conserved in all herpesviruses and the only core gene without an assigned function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Davison1">[13]</xref>. Bioinformatic analysis identified UL24 gene family as a putative novel PD-(D/E)XK endonuclease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Knizewski1">[14]</xref>. This superfamily of restriction endonuclease-like fold proteins includes several restriction endonucleases (e.g. EcoRI, EcoRII, BamHI, BglI, Cfr10I, NaeI), DNA repair enzymes (MutH and Vsr), Holliday junction resolvases (Hjc and Hje) and other nucleotide-cleaving enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Murzin1">[15]</xref>. However, no endonuclease activity has been demonstrated experimentally for any of the UL24 homologues.</p>
<p>Global mutational analysis of the HCMV genome classified UL76 as an augmenting gene for viral replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Yu1">[16]</xref>, recently demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of the UL77 gene expression. Since UL77 is essential for viral replication, its regulation by UL76 may be important for efficient HCMV replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Isomura1">[17]</xref>. Expression of UL76 also induces cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase by inhibition of the mitotic Cdc2-cyclin B complex. Interestingly, this effect on the cell cycle is conserved in the UL24 human homologues representatives of the alpha, beta and gamma-subfamilies and the murine homologue from MHV-68 (ORF20) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Nascimento1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Nascimento2">[19]</xref>. The precise mechanism of cell cycle arrest induced by UL24 homologues remain to be clarified, but a recent report showed that HCMV UL76 induces chromosomal aberrations and DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Siew1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we identify a new function of UL76, the induction of IL-8 expression, mediated by the ATM kinase and activation of the NF-kB pathway. Thus, activation of NF-kB by UL76 results from induction of the DNA damage response, similar to genotoxic drugs. Importantly, induction of IL-8 by HCMV is significantly reduced in the absence of ATM or in normal fibroblasts infected with a HCMV UL76 deletion mutant. Thus, viral infection induces IL-8 in a similar manner to the UL76 gene alone and UL76 is essential for maximal activation of IL-8 by HCMV.</p>

<title>UL76 induces expression of IL-8</title>
<p>The effect of UL76 on the activation of IL-8 transcription was demonstrated using a luciferase reporter construct containing the IL-8 promoter sequence. Transfection of a UL76 expression plasmid significantly activated transcription of IL-8 promoter in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003609-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Furthermore, cells expressing UL76 were demonstrated to secrete significantly higher levels of IL-8 as compared to the control vector (<italic>p&lt;0.01</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003609-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In conclusion, UL76 induces IL-8 expression at both the level of transcriptional activation and protein secretion.</p>

<title>Induction of IL-8 by UL76 is NF-kB-dependent</title>
<p>Expression of IL-8 is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level. The sequence of nucleotides -1 to -131 in the proximal promoter region of IL-8 gene is essential for its transcription regulation and contains binding sites for NF-kB, AP-1 and NF-IL-6 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003609-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Hoffmann1">[4]</xref>. To determine the mechanism of induction of IL-8 by UL76, the luciferase activity of wild type IL-8 luciferase reporter was compared with its mutant derivatives containing a mutation in each of the three transcription factor binding sites. There was no significant difference in luciferase activity in response to co-transfection with UL76 when AP-1 or NF-IL-6 binding sites were mutated in the luciferase reporter construct, whereas IL-8 transcriptional activation was drastically reduced in the absence of the NF-kB binding site, indicating a critical role for the NF-kB pathway in the UL76-mediated induction of IL-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003609-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Consistent with the previous results, expression of UL76 significantly activated an NF-kB responsive promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003609-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>To further characterize the activation of the NF-kB pathway by UL76, we used a catalytically inactive mutant IKKβ and a mutant IkBα (IkBαS32/36A) in which the two critical serine residues were mutated to alanine, thus no longer permitting its phosphorylation and degradation. Both constructs function as dominant negatives, inhibiting the activity of cellular wild type IKKβ and IkBα, respectively. Co-transfection of each dominant negative with IL-8 luciferase reporter and UL76 expression plasmid or control vector resulted in a reduced induction of IL-8 in cells expressing UL76 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003609-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>A) Luciferase activity was determined in 293T cells co-transfected with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3HA-UL76, IL-8 luciferase reporter and either dominant negative IKKβ or IkBα (S32/36A) plasmids. Values of luciferase activity were normalized to β-Galactosidase activity. Data are expressed as means ± SD of triplicate wells from one of three similar experiments. Expression of UL76 and dominant negatives IKKβ or IkBα (S32/36A) was confirmed by western blot (below) using an anti-HA HRP-conjugated antibody. Detection of tubulin was used as loading control. B) Indirect immunofluorescence was performed on HFF cells transfected with pcDNA3HA-UL76 or control plasmid using an anti-p65 antibody and anti-mouse Texas Red conjugated secondary antibody. UL76 expression was detected using an anti-HA-FITC conjugated antibody and DAPI staining was used to define nuclei. Images were acquired with a 100× objective. C) Expression of p65 in HFF cells transfected with pcDNA3HA-UL76 or control plasmid was evaluated by western blot at the indicated time points. Detection of β-actin was used as loading control. As positive control cells were stimulated with TNFα. Levels of p65 relative to the levels of β-actin in the corresponding extracts were quantified by densitometry analysis and the fold levels relative to the control vector transfected cells are indicated below. D) 293T cells transfected with pcDNA3HA-UL76 or control plasmid were lysed for nuclear extraction at the indicated time points post-transfection. Nuclear extracts were immunoblotted with anti-p65, anti-β-actin and anti-nucleolin antibodies. Expression of UL76 was detected using an anti-HA antibody. Levels of p65 relative to the levels of nucleolin in the corresponding nuclear extracts were quantified by densitometry analysis. The fold levels relative to the control vector transfected cells are indicated below. E) Binding of NF-kB p65 subunit to the IL-8 promoter sequence (−121 to +61) or to a control region (−1042 to −826) in 293T cells expressing pcDNA3HA-UL76 or control plasmid was analyzed by ChIP assay at 30 h post-transfection using an anti-p65 antibody. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Data are expressed as fold enrichment relative to an unrelated IgG antibody used as control to nonspecific immunocomplexes.</p>

<p>After IkBα degradation by the proteosome, dimers of NF-kB subunits translocate to the nucleus where they bind to the target gene promoter region and activate transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Perkins1">[9]</xref>. Thus, we evaluated the effects of UL76 expression on the subcellular localization of the NF-kB p65 subunit by immunofluorescence. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003609-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, p65 was localized in the nucleus of the UL76-transfected HFF cells, in contrast to its cytoplasmic localization in control cells. This effect was not due to an increase in the expression of p65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003609-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Furthermore, similarly immunoblotting of 293T nuclear extracts with anti-p65 antibody revealed an accumulation of p65 in the nucleus of cells expressing UL76 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003609-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). This accumulation was specific, as can be seen from the constant levels of the nucleolin expression in the loading control. Consistent with these results, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis demonstrated that expression of UL76 leads to NF-kB p65 binding to the IL-8 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003609-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, IL-8 induction by UL76 requires a functional IKKβ and the degradation of IkBα to promote translocation of p65 subunit to the nucleus where it activates IL-8 transcription.</p>

<title>UL76 induces IL-8 expression through activation of the DNA Damage</title>
<p>Expression of UL76 results in an increased number of double stranded DNA breaks and phosphorylation of γH2AX, indicating activation of the DNA Damage response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Siew1">[20]</xref>. Consistent with these results, expression of UL76 results in activation of ATM and consequent phosphorylation of p53 and H2AX proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003609-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Recently, several studies have characterized an alternative pathway to NF-kB activation that results from DNA damage. Based on this, we hypothesized that the ability of UL76 to induce DNA damage would lead to activation of NF-kB pathway and result in the induction of IL-8 expression. A characteristic feature of NF-kB pathway activation by genotoxic stress is the accumulation of IKKγ/NEMO in the nucleus where a series of post-translational modifications occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Wu1">[21]</xref>. The nuclear post-translational modifications of NEMO that are critical for NF-κB activation following genotoxic stress include ATM-independent sumoylation and ATM-dependent phosphorylation at serine 85 followed by monoubiquitination. Consistent with this mechanism, immunostaining using an anti-NEMO antibody revealed increasing amounts of nuclear NEMO in cells expressing the UL76-HA tagged protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003609-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Furthermore, immunoblotting of similarly transfected cells with a specific antibody to NEMO(S85) phosphorylation demonstrated that expression of UL76 induces phosphorylation of NEMO as previously observed after genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003609-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>To evaluate the impact of the ATM kinase in IL-8 induction by UL76, we used two different approaches: a specific ATM inhibitor, KU55933, and a human fibroblast cell line deficient in ATM. The amount of IL-8 secreted by 293T cells expressing UL76, or the control plasmid, in the presence or absence of KU55933 was determined by ELISA. Inhibition of ATM by KU55933 blocked the UL76-induced IL-8 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003609-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Similarly, IL-8 concentration was determined in supernatants of <italic>ATM -/-</italic> cells expressing UL76 or the control plasmid. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003609-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, UL76 or etoposide, a genotoxic drug, are unable to induce IL-8 in the absence of ATM. Although UL76 expression leads to higher levels of IL-8 than etoposide stimulation, there is no increase in IL-8 secretion when compared to control vector, so this basal induction is possibly due to transfection. Moreover, this result is not due to the incapacity of the cell line to produce IL-8 since stimulation with TNFα, a membrane receptor-triggering NF-kB canonical pathway independent of ATM, is still capable of inducing IL-8 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003609-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). Expression of UL76 was not affected in the <italic>ATM -/-</italic> cell line or in 293T cells cultured in the presence of the ATM inhibitor as confirmed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003609-g004">Fig. 4D,E</xref>). In summary, these results indicate that activation of NF-kB pathway and consequent IL-8 induction by UL76 are ATM-dependent and result from activation of DNA damage.</p>

<title>Mutation of the putative UL76 endonuclease motifs reduces induction of IL-8</title>
<p>There is clear evidence that UL76 activates the DNA damage response, however, the mechanism employed by UL76 for this activation is still unknown. The prediction that the UL24 gene family encodes a novel PD-(D/E)XK endonuclease is a possible explanation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Knizewski1">[14]</xref>.

Equal infection by both viruses was confirmed by levels of the HCMV immediate-early 1 (IE1) protein. Thus, UL76 is essential for optimal induction of IL-8 by HCMV. There was, however, no difference in the phosphorylation of ATM, NEMO and IkB proteins in cells infected with HCMV wild type compared to UL76-deficient virus (data not shown).</p>

<title>ATM is required for induction of IL-8 by HCMV</title>
<p>A previous deletion mutant analysis of the IL-8 promoter in monocytic cells has shown that AP-1 and NF-kB transcription factors were required for optimal induction of IL-8 by HCMV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Murayama2">[22]</xref>. The precise mechanism used by HCMV to induce IL-8 expression, however, is still not clear.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The UL24 gene family is one of the approximately 40 core genes that are conserved in all three herpesviruses subfamilies and the only one which still has no assigned function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Davison1">[13]</xref>. Previously, functional assays demonstrated that all homologues of UL24 gene family induce cell cycle arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Nascimento1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Nascimento2">[19]</xref>. This work identifies another, and at first sight, apparently unrelated function of the UL24 homologue from HCMV (UL76), the induction of the expression of IL-8. Further exploration of the mechanism, however, suggests that both activities may result from viral activation of the DNA Damage response.</p>
<p>Deletion mutant analysis of the IL-8 promoter demonstrated that UL76 up-regulates IL-8 expression through activation of NF-kB pathway requiring a functional IKKβ and degradation of the IkB protein. Moreover, expression of UL76 resulted in the translocation of the NF-kB p65 subunit to the nucleus and its binding to the IL-8 promoter. These events, characteristic of the canonical NF-kB pathway, typically occur in the cytoplasm and are usually activated by membrane-receptor stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Perkins1">[9]</xref>. Thus, the exact mechanism of how UL76 activates the NF-kB pathway is an interesting paradox as UL76 is a nuclear protein.</p>
<p>In recent years an alternative mechanism of activation of NF-kB pathway triggered by genotoxic stress has been described. In contrast to inflammatory stimuli such as TNFα or IL-1β, the signal originates in the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Miyamoto1">[10]</xref>. Since it has been shown that UL76 is able to induce double strand breaks, and consequently activate DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Siew1">[20]</xref>, we hypothesized that UL76 might induce IL-8 expression as result of the DNA damage response. Indeed, and similar to the effect of genotoxic drugs such as etoposide, expression of UL76 resulted in an accumulation of nuclear NEMO and its activation (phosphorylation at serine 85). These findings suggest that the ATM kinase might play a role in the IL-8 induction by UL76 and thus, the predicted role of ATM was demonstrated by two strategies, one using a specific ATM inhibitor and the other employing an ATM knockout cell line. Abrogation of UL76-mediated induction of IL-8 occurred with both approaches. These observations indicate that induction of IL-8 by UL76 originates in the nucleus as a result of the DNA Damage response.</p>
<p>The exact mechanism of activation of the DNA Damage response induced by UL76 is still not clear. A promising clue that we pursued was the identification of conserved putative PD-(D/E)XK endonuclease motifs in the UL24 gene family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Knizewski1">[14]</xref>. Its conservation suggests a critical role in the function of this gene family, thus, the DNA damage activation by UL76 could be a direct effect of its endonuclease activity. Mutation of the three predicted endonuclease signature amino acids was, however, inconclusive as it resulted in a reduction rather than an abolition of IL-8 induction. It is possible that the observed reduction may be related with an unknown function of these conserved domains rather than loss of a putative endonuclease activity. In fact, the bioinformatically predicted endonuclease motif might not be related to a functional endonuclease activity, as no endonuclease activity has been demonstrated experimentally for any of the UL24 homologues.</p>
<p>Importantly, UL76 has a critical role in the up-regulation of IL-8 during HCMV infection as demonstrated by the significant reduction of secreted IL-8 in cells infected with an UL76 deletion mutant virus. This result is particularly important as IL-8 enhances HCMV replication and contributes to the efficient viral dissemination by neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Murayama1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Craigen1">[3]</xref>. The only HCMV gene that has been described as an activator of IL-8 is the Immediate Early 1 gene (IE1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Murayama2">[22]</xref>. Thus, the incomplete inhibition of IL-8 secretion by HCMV observed in the absence of UL76 may be due to the effect of IE1 gene. The existence of other gene(s) that may also contribute for HCMV-induced IL-8 expression, in addition to IE1 and UL76, is not excluded. Experiments to observe a similar impact of UL76 in the signaling pathway at the level of virus infected cells were negative, possibly due to alternative virus strategies activating these proteins. We emphasize, however, that the key observation is the diminished expression of IL-8 induced by the UL76 deficient virus, which clearly demonstrates a role for UL76 in the up-regulation of IL-8 in HCMV infected cells.</p>
<p>The relevance of IL-8 in HCMV life cycle is emphasized by the fact that the HCMV UL146 gene encodes a homologue to CXC chemokines such as IL-8 (vCXCL1), which functions as a selective agonist for CXCR2 and, with lower affinity, for CXCR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Penfold1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Lttichau1">[26]</xref>. The IL-8 production observed in cells infected with wild type HCMV or UL76 mutant virus, however, is independent of the presence of the viral CXCL1, as this gene is deleted from the HCMV AD169 strain used in this work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Yu1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>Induction of IL-8 expression by HCMV requires activation of the NF-kB pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Murayama2">[22]</xref>. Thus, one objective of this work was to elucidate the mechanism of NF-kB activation by HCMV that leads to IL-8 production. Here we demonstrate that ATM also has a critical role in the induction of IL-8 by HCMV as infection of <italic>ATM -/-</italic> cells with wild type HCMV resulted in considerably lower levels of secreted IL-8 compared to the similar infection of normal human fibroblasts. On the other hand, the incomplete inhibition of IL-8 expression in <italic>ATM-/-</italic> cells infected with HCMV suggests that other NF-kB pathways are involved. It is possible that these are not redundant effects, but activation of different NF-kB pathways, possibly through different viral proteins, may be necessary for the induction of optimal levels of IL-8 by infected cells that will be beneficial for HCMV replication as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Murayama1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>It may be significant that a major reduction in viral replication is observed when normal cells are infected with a UL76 deficient virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Yu1">[16]</xref> or when ATM deficient cells are infected with HCMV wild type virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-E1">[27]</xref>. It is possible that this defect in viral replication is associated with the reduced IL-8 levels observed in cells infected with UL76 deficient HCMV or in ATM deficient cell infected with wild type HCMV. Supporting this hypothesis is the fact that IL-8 enhances HCMV replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003609-Murayama1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>In summary, the non-homologous UL76 gene of HCMV has not only evolved for manipulation of the host cell cycle, but also activates expression of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IL-8. Both of these activities appear to depend on activation of pathways triggered as a result of the DNA Damage response and may favor propagation of the virus. The fact that, in recent years, several viruses have been demonstrated to activate the DNA Damage response raised new important questions. It is not known if this activation results from recognition of DNA damage or if it is due to the recruitment of DNA repair proteins observed during viral infections such as HCMV. Furthermore, it is not completely understood how the activation of DNA Damage pathway is beneficial for viral replication. Our present work establishes a new role of the induction of DNA Damage response in the context of viral infection that may help to elucidate some of these questions, as it demonstrates how viruses exploit the complex crosstalk that occur between different cell signaling pathways.</p>

Thirty hours post-transfection, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde (Calbiochem) for 10 minutes at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and chromatin was sheared by sonication. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4°C, using 2 µg of rabbit polyclonal anti-NF-kB p65 (A) or control IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubation with protein G magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Invitrogen) for one hour at 4°C, immunocomplexes were washed and eluted. The cross-linking was reversed by heating at 65°C for 4 h. Chromatin-associated proteins were digested with proteinase K and DNA was purified by QIAGEN PCR purification kit following manufacturer's protocol. Immunoprecipitated DNA was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR using SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and primer pair spanning the human IL-8 promoter region from −121 to +61: sense <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GGGCCATCAGTTGCAAATC -3′</named-content> and antisense <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TTCCTTCCGGTGGTTTCTTC-3′</named-content>. Primers targeting the genomic region from −1042 to −826 of the IL-8 gene were used as negative control region: sense <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-AACAGTGGCTGAACCAGAG-3′</named-content> and antisense <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-AGGAGGGCTTCAATAGAGG-3′</named-content>.</p>

<p><bold>UL77 has no effect in the expression of IL-8.</bold> IL-8 concentration in supernatants of 293T cells transfected with control plasmid or pcDNA3HA-UL77 was determined 48 h post-transfection by ELISA, before and after stimulation for 5 h with TNFα (10 ng/ml) or IL-1β (1 ng/ml). Data are expressed as means ± SD of duplicate wells from one of two similar experiments. Expression of HA-tagged UL77 protein was confirmed by western blot (below) using an anti-HA antibody and β-actin detection was used as loading control.</p>

<p><bold>Impact of ATM on the induction of IL-8 by HCMV.</bold> A) Primary fibroblasts <italic>ATM -/-</italic> cells (GM01588) were infected with HCMV wild type (wt) or UL76 mutant virus (TNUL76) at a MOI of 3. Supernatants were collected at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h post-infection and IL-8 concentration was determined by ELISA. Data are expressed as means ± SD of fold induction to mock-infected cells and are representative of three similar experiments. Cells were lysed at 72 h post-infection and viral infection was confirmed by western blot (below) using an anti-UL44 antibody for the CMV viral protein and detection of β-actin as loading control. B) HFF cells were transfected with ON-TARGETplus Human ATM siRNA or control siRNA (ctrl) (100 µM) 24 h prior to infection with HCMV (MOI 3). Supernatants were collected at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h post-infection and IL-8 concentration was determined by ELISA. Data are expressed as means ± SD and are representative of two similar experiments. Levels of ATM protein in cells transfected with ATM siRNA or control siRNA were determined by western blot using an anti-ATM antibody and detection of tubulin as loading control.</p>
