<abstract>
<p>Many pathogenic fungi are dimorphic and switch between yeast and filamentous states. This switch alters host-microbe interactions and is critical for pathogenicity. However, in zygomycetes, whether dimorphism contributes to virulence is a central unanswered question. The pathogenic zygomycete <italic>Mucor circinelloides</italic> exhibits hyphal growth in aerobic conditions but switches to multi-budded yeast growth under anaerobic/high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. We found that in the presence of the calcineurin inhibitor FK506, <italic>Mucor</italic> exhibits exclusively multi-budded yeast growth. We also found that <italic>M. circinelloides</italic> encodes three calcineurin catalytic A subunits (CnaA, CnaB, and CnaC) and one calcineurin regulatory B subunit (CnbR). Mutations in the latch region of CnbR and in the FKBP12-FK506 binding domain of CnaA result in hyphal growth of <italic>Mucor</italic> in the presence of FK506. Disruption of the <italic>cnbR</italic> gene encoding the sole calcineurin B subunit necessary for calcineurin activity yielded mutants locked in permanent yeast phase growth. These findings reveal that the calcineurin pathway plays key roles in the dimorphic transition from yeast to hyphae. The <italic>cnbR</italic> yeast-locked mutants are less virulent than the wild-type strain in a heterologous host system, providing evidence that hyphae or the yeast-hyphal transition are linked to virulence. Protein kinase A activity (PKA) is elevated during yeast growth under anaerobic conditions, in the presence of FK506, or in the yeast-locked <italic>cnbR</italic> mutants, suggesting a novel connection between PKA and calcineurin. <italic>cnaA</italic> mutants lacking the CnaA catalytic subunit are hypersensitive to calcineurin inhibitors, display a hyphal polarity defect, and produce a mixture of yeast and hyphae in aerobic culture. The <italic>cnaA</italic> mutants also produce spores that are larger than wild-type, and spore size is correlated with virulence potential. Our results demonstrate that the calcineurin pathway orchestrates the yeast-hyphal and spore size dimorphic transitions that contribute to virulence of this common zygomycete fungal pathogen.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Calcineurin is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent, serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase. In pathogenic fungi, calcineurin is involved in morphogenesis and virulence. Therefore, calcineurin is an attractive antifungal drug target. The roles of calcineurin in virulence have been established in both major human pathogenic fungi (<italic>Candida</italic> species, <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans/gattii</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>) and in plant pathogenic fungi (<italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, <italic>Ustilago maydis/hordei</italic>). However, the role of calcineurin is currently unknown in pathogenic zygomycetes. We found that the calcineurin inhibitors FK506 and cyclosporine A inhibit the growth of a prevalent zygomycete pathogen, <italic>Mucor</italic>. This fungus grows as multi-budded yeast under anaerobic conditions, and we have found that even in aerated culture (which without FK506 would result in abundant hyphal growth), <italic>Mucor</italic> exhibits yeast growth when exposed to FK506. <italic>Mucor cnbR</italic> mutants that lack the calcineurin regulatory subunit essential for calcineurin activity, are locked in perpetual yeast phase growth, indicating that calcineurin is required for hyphal growth. We further demonstrated that these yeast-locked mutants are attenuated for virulence, illustrating that hyphae or the yeast-hyphal transition are linked to virulence. These findings indicate that: 1) calcineurin governs the yeast/hyphae morphogenic transition; 2) a link exists between respiration and the calcineurin pathway; and 3) calcineurin inhibitors are attractive anti-mucormycosis drug candidates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Mucor circinelloides</italic> is one causal agent of mucormycosis, an uncommon but frequently lethal fungal infection of humans. Several other species belonging to the Mucorales order also cause mucormycosis, including some <italic>Rhizopus</italic> species, <italic>Absidia</italic>, <italic>Cunninghamella</italic>, <italic>Rhizomucor</italic>, <italic>Apophysomyces trapeziformis</italic>, and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Chayakulkeeree1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-NeblettFanfair1">[3]</xref>. Mucormycosis is an emerging fungal infection often afflicting immunocompromised and vulnerable populations including patients with diabetes, AIDS, hematologic malignancies, or trauma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-NeblettFanfair1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Ribes1">[8]</xref>. Susceptible hosts also include patients with solid organ transplants and those with high serum iron levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Roden1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Ribes1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Kontoyiannis2">[9]</xref>. Mucormycosis is the second most common fungal infection among patients with hematological malignancies and transplants. This infection is associated with high mortality rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Roden1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Ribes1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Lanternier1">[10]</xref>: ∼50% for all mucormycosis infections and &gt;90% for disseminated infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Roden1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Kontoyiannis1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Kontoyiannis2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-KwonChung1">[11]</xref>. Recently, a cluster of mucormycosis cases was reported among the tornado victims in Joplin, MO in the spring of 2011; 13 cases were reported with five fatalities. Based on 28S ribosomal DNA sequence the responsible species has been identified as <italic>A. trapeziformis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-NeblettFanfair1">[3]</xref>. Despite the increasing incidence of disease, high mortality rate, and unmet clinical needs for therapy, zygomycetes are understudied compared to other pathogenic fungi.</p>
<p><italic>Mucor</italic> species are dimorphic fungi and exhibit either hyphal or yeast growth depending upon the conditions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Orlowski1">[12]</xref>). Hyphal growth of <italic>Mucor</italic> was first thought to originate from species of <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> by transmutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-BartnickiGarcia1">[13]</xref> until Louis Pasteur discovered that <italic>Mucor</italic> grows as a multi-budded yeast under anaerobic/high CO<sub>2</sub> growth conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Pasteur1">[14]</xref>. Later, Bartnicki-Garcia and Nickerson rediscovered the induction of <italic>Mucor</italic> yeast growth by CO<sub>2</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-BartnickiGarcia2">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-BartnickiGarcia4">[17]</xref>. Although dimorphic <italic>Mucor</italic> species vary in their responses to the environment during morphogenic changes, common critical factors that induce yeast growth of <italic>Mucor</italic> species include oxygen concentration, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and carbon source (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Orlowski1">[12]</xref>). In addition, several chemicals that inhibit mitochondrial function [including potassium cyanide and antimycin A (which block electron transport) or oligomycin and phenyl alcohol (which inhibit oxidative phosphorylation)] induce yeast growth in <italic>Mucor</italic> spp., even in aerobic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Friedenthal1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Schulz1">[20]</xref>. Inhibition of the synthesis of cytochrome b and other mitochondrial components by chloramphenicol also results in <italic>Mucor</italic> yeast growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Zorzopulos1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-ClarkWalker1">[22]</xref>. Thus, respiration, anaerobic conditions, and high CO<sub>2</sub> environments all contribute to the yeast-hyphal transition. Cerulenin, a lipid metabolism inhibitor, and cycloleucine, an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthetase inhibitor, both block the yeast to hyphal growth transition under aerobic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Ito1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Garcia1">[24]</xref>. Notably, adding cyclic AMP (cAMP) to the culture medium induces yeast growth of <italic>Mucor</italic> spp. (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Orlowski1">[12]</xref> and references therein). cAMP activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), implicating a role for protein kinase A in the <italic>Mucor</italic> dimorphic transition, and this is supported by a series of recent studies, including genetic analyses in which genes encoding PKA regulatory subunits were disrupted by homologous recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Wolff1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Pereyra1">[31]</xref>. PKA also plays a key role in various morphogenesis processes including germination, branching, and polarized growth in <italic>Mucor</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Lubbehusen1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Argimon1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Roze1">[37]</xref></p>
<p>Dimorphism has evolved in multiple lineages in the fungal kingdom, including ascomycetes, basidiomycetes, and zygomycetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Bastidas1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Saville1">[40]</xref>. In many pathogenic fungi, the morphogenic transition is closely related to pathogenicity. A group of so-called “dimorphic fungi” grow as molds at lower environmental temperatures; however, in association with the host these fungi undergo a thermal dimorphic switch, resulting in yeast growth as virulent forms at 37°C (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Klein1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Lin1">[42]</xref>). The dimorphic fungal pathogens include <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic>, <italic>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</italic>, <italic>Coccidioides immitis</italic>/<italic>posadasii</italic>, <italic>Blastomyces dermatitidis</italic>, and <italic>Penicillium marneffei</italic>, among others. The most prevalent fungal commensal and pathogen, <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, exhibits yeast and hyphal growth, and the ability of this fungus to grow as both forms is necessary for virulence; yeast-locked or hyphal-locked mutants are both avirulent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Lo1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Saville1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Zheng1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Braun1">[44]</xref>. The basidiomycete human pathogen <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> changes its morphology; it grows mainly as yeast but during the sexual cycle the fungus forms hyphae and produces sexual spores that are readily disseminated as infectious propagules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Velagapudi1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Giles1">[47]</xref>. <italic>C. neoformans</italic> also exhibits pseudohyphal growth, which is advantageous for escape from amoebae, one of its natural predators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Magditch1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Lee1">[49]</xref>. In the plant pathogenic basidiomycete <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>, the yeast form is not virulent; however, the hyphae produced by mating cause disease on plant hosts and transform infected plant tissue into galls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Nadal1">[50]</xref>. Therefore, morphogenic transitions play major roles during host infection by pathogenic fungi. Dimorphism in zygomycetes, especially in <italic>Mucor</italic> spp. was studied decades ago; however, our knowledge of its contributions to pathogenesis is limited and the underlying genetics, beyond the involvement of anaerobic/high CO<sub>2</sub>, respiration, and PKA is not well established.</p>
<p>Our study reveals that calcineurin plays a crucial role during the yeast-hyphal growth transition of <italic>M. circinelloides</italic>. The calcineurin pathway is conserved throughout eukaryotes. Calcineurin is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine specific protein phosphatase that consists of two subunits: the catalytic A subunit, which has phosphatase activity, and the regulatory B subunit, which binds calcium and the A subunit to activate the enzyme complex. Both subunits are required for enzyme activity. The drugs tacrolimus (FK506) and cyclosporine A (CsA) form complexes with the immunophilins FKBP12 and cyclophilin A, respectively. The protein-drug complexes bind to the hydrophobic interface between the calcineurin A and B subunits to inhibit phosphatase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Liu1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Milan1">[52]</xref>. We found that FK506 inhibits hyphal growth and instead induces yeast growth in the pathogenic zygomycete <italic>Mucor</italic>. Gain of function mutations in the calcineurin regulatory B and catalytic A subunit genes were identified that confer resistance to FK506. Furthermore, disruption of the calcineurin regulatory B subunit required for calcineurin activity results in a yeast-locked phenotype, supporting our conclusion that calcineurin regulates the dimorphic transition. Notably, the <italic>cnbRΔ</italic> yeast phase locked mutants were less virulent, suggesting that either hyphae are more virulent than yeast or the morphogenic switch is central to pathogenicity of this fungus. In addition, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A activity was found to be elevated during yeast compared to hyphal growth, and also when calcineurin activity was inhibited by FK506 or mutation. We also show that calcineurin is involved in hyphal polarity and spore size dimorphism, which is linked to virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Li1">[53]</xref>.</p>
<p>Calcineurin is involved in the morphogenesis and virulence of multiple pathogenic fungi (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Kozubowski1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Chen1">[55]</xref>): in <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, calcineurin is required for growth at 37°C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Odom1">[56]</xref>; in <italic>Candida</italic> spp., calcineurin functions in antifungal drug resistance/tolerance, survival in serum, and virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Chen2">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Reedy1">[60]</xref>; calcineurin plays a role in morphogenesis in <italic>P. brasiliensis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Campos1">[61]</xref>; and in <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, calcineurin regulates morphogenesis and thereby pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Steinbach1">[62]</xref>. Therefore, calcineurin is a promising antifungal drug target and this study provides a novel foundation to develop approaches to control the emerging fungal infection mucormycosis.</p>

<title>The calcineurin inhibitor FK506 induces <italic>M. circinelloides</italic> to grow as yeast</title>
<p>We found that in <italic>Mucor</italic> the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 inhibits hyphal growth and drives multi-budded yeast growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s019">Videos S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s020">S2</xref>). Eight different <italic>M. circinelloides</italic> isolates (10<sup>3</sup> spores) were each inoculated aerobically on YPD agar media or YPD agar media containing FK506 (1 µg/mL). At 4 days post-inoculation, the colonies grown on YPD with FK506 were significantly smaller than those on YPD alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The smaller, compact colonies consisted entirely of yeast form <italic>Mucor</italic> (data not shown). In liquid culture, with vigorous shaking for aeration, the <italic>Mucor</italic> isolate CBS277.49 grew exclusively as a mold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g001">Figure 1B</xref>); however, this isolate exhibited only yeast growth when cultured in the same fashion but in the presence of FK506 (1 µg/mL). The multi-budded yeast phenotype imposed by FK506 phenocopies <italic>Mucor</italic> yeast growth under anaerobic/high CO<sub>2</sub> growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This observation indicates that there is a link between respiration/CO<sub>2</sub> sensing and the calcineurin pathway. On the other hand, another calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA) did not induce multi-budded yeast growth, and instead resulted in abnormal, stunted hyphal growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Higher concentrations of CsA did not produce yeast growth (data not shown). This result suggests that FK506-specific calcineurin inhibition plays a role in the hyphal-yeast switch. We note that although CsA does stunt hyphal growth, the efficacy may not be sufficient to enforce yeast growth compared to FK506 if levels of the cyclophilin A-CsA complex are insufficient to inhibit all calcineurin activity. This hypothesis is supported by findings that 1) in a sensitized background in which calcineurin activity has been reduced with a sub-inhibitory concentration of FK506, CsA is now fully able to block the dimorphic transition and impose yeast growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s002">Figures S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g002">2</xref>) in regulatory B subunit mutant <italic>CNBR-1</italic> (N125Y, note that the all gain-of-function mutations are designated with capital letters) mutants isolated as being resistant to FK506 (described below), CsA imposes a multi-budded yeast phenotype (See supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s005">figure S5</xref>).</p>

<title>Identification of calcineurin pathway components in the <italic>Mucor</italic> genome</title>
<p>We identified calcineurin pathway components in the <italic>M. circinelloides</italic> genome. Unusually high numbers of calmodulin and calmodulin (CAM) kinase orthologs (nine calmodulins) were identified in the genomes with six CAM kinases <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>Mucor</italic> genome encodes three calcineurin catalytic A subunits along with a single calcineurin regulatory B subunit, FKBP12, and cyclophilin A.</p>
<p>We further examined the three catalytic A subunit (<italic>cna</italic>) genes and found that the Cna ortholog proteins contain an N-terminal phosphatase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain containing the calcineurin B subunit binding domain, cyclophilin A-cyclosporine A complex binding domain, FKBP12-FK506 complex binding domain (the domains were determined based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Cardenas1">[63]</xref>), calmodulin binding domain, and auto-inhibitory domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g002">Figure 2</xref>), further demonstrating that the identified Cna proteins are <italic>bona fide</italic> calcineurin catalytic A subunits. The sequences of the Cna proteins are distinct, and there is 73% identity shared between CnaA and CnaB; 64% identity between CnaA and CnaC; and 62% identity between CnaB and CnaC. It is interesting to consider how multiple paralogs of the <italic>cna</italic> genes evolved in the zygomycetes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s003">Figure S3</xref>). In phylogenetic analyses, the three zygomycete species including <italic>M. circinelloides</italic>, <italic>Rhizopus delemar</italic>, and <italic>Phycomyces blakesleeanus</italic>, are conserved on a common branch, including McCnaA, PbCnaA, RdCnaA, and RdCnaB. This observation suggests that the calcineurin A subunit gene in this group may be the more ancestral (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>

<title>Gain-of-function mutations in the <italic>cnaA</italic> and <italic>cnbR</italic> genes result in hyphal growth in the presence of FK506</title>
<p>FKBP12 is an immunophilin family protein with <italic>cis-trans</italic> peptide prolyl isomerase activity that serves as the cellular receptor for FK506 and rapamycin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Siekierka1">[64]</xref>. When bound to FK506, FKBP12 binds to the interface between the calcineurin catalytic A and regulatory B subunits, inhibiting phosphatase activity by occluding substrate access to the active site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Liu1">[51]</xref>. FKBP12 also binds to rapamycin to inhibit the Tor pathway. Disruption of the gene encoding FKBP12 confers resistance to FK506 and rapamycin (in the absence of FKBP12, FK506 fails to bind calcineurin) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Bastidas2">[65]</xref>. Amino acid substitutions in the calcineurin regulatory B and catalytic A subunit surface that interact with the FKBP12-FK506 complex result in resistance to FK506 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Cardenas1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Fox1">[66]</xref>. Calcineurin FK506 resistant mutants expressing FKBP12 remain rapamycin sensitive. Sensitivity is defined as FK506 enforced yeast growth or rapamycin limiting hyphal growth of the fungus; resistance to FK506 is defined as strains forming hyphae instead of yeast in the presence of FK506, and resistance to rapamycin as strains growing as in non-drug media.</p>
<p>To test whether these molecular principles of FK506 sensitivity and resistance apply in <italic>M. circinelloides</italic>, we grew wild-type strains (10<sup>3</sup> spores) in solid YPD media containing 1 µg/ml FK506 until resistant mycelial growth emerged out of yeast colonies as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Bastidas2">[65]</xref>. Through this approach six FK506 resistant spontaneous mutants, MSL11, MSL12, MSL13, MSL14, MSL15, and MSL16 were generated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003625-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These FK506 resistant mutants were as rapamycin sensitive as the wild-type parental strain and in contrast to an <italic>fkbAΔ</italic> strain lacking FKBP12 that is FK506 and rapamycin resistant.

<title>Phenotype of the spontaneous mutants that are resistant to FK506 and sensitive to rapamycin and CsA.</title>
<p>(A and B) The four mutants MSL11 (<italic>CNBR-1</italic>), MSL12 (<italic>CNBR-2</italic>), MSL15 (<italic>CNBR-1</italic>), and MSL16 (<italic>CNBR-3</italic>) each have a mutation in the latch region of the <italic>cnbR</italic> gene (also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s004">Figure S4</xref>) and the mutants formed mycelia when the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 (1 µg/mL) is present in the media (The <italic>CNBR-3</italic> mutant is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s006">Figure S6</xref>). The <italic>CNBR-1</italic> and <italic>CNBR-2</italic>, and <italic>CNBR-3</italic> mutants are still sensitive to rapamycin. The <italic>CNBR-1</italic> and <italic>CNBR-2</italic> mutants remain sensitive to CsA, whereas <italic>CNBR-3</italic> was found to be CsA cross-resistant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s005">Figure S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s006">S6</xref>). The <italic>fkbAΔ</italic> mutant and L91P mutants, by contrast, are resistant to FK506 and rapamycin due to the absence or alteration of FKBP12, the target for both drugs, respectively.

<p>Four strains had mutations in only the <italic>cnbR</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s004">S4</xref>). The MSL11 and MSL15 mutants (<italic>CNBR-1</italic>) contained a point mutation, A496T, which results in an amino acid alteration, N125Y. It is interesting that two independent mutant strains contained an identical mutation in the <italic>cnbR</italic> gene and these strains displayed yeast growth in the presence of CsA (CsA hypersensitive) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s005">Figure S5</xref>). This mutation may both impair FKBP12-FK506 binding and compromise the stability of the calcineurin A–B complexes to result in CsA hypersensitivity. The MSL12 strain (<italic>CNBR-2</italic>) contained an insertion of three nucleotides ‘CCA’ at the 513<sup>th</sup> bp of the ORF (513_514insCCA), resulting in an insertion of histidine (H) after 129<sup>th</sup> aspragine, Asn129_Gln130insHis. The MSL16 mutant (<italic>CNBR-3</italic>) contained a point mutation, G487T, which results in the amino acid substitutions, V122F. Interestingly, all of these amino acid alterations are present in the latch region of the calcineurin B regulatory subunit that is known to interact with the FKBP12-FK506 complex and to be involved in phosphatase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Milan1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Fox1">[66]</xref>. It is likely that the N125Y, N129_Q130insH, and V122F changes alter the interaction between FKBP12-FK506 and the calcineurin B-calcineurin A complex, resulting in resistance to FK506. Interestingly, the V122F substitution may also alter the interaction between cyclophilin-CsA and the calcineurin B-calcineurin A complex as the MSL16 mutant (<italic>CNBR-3</italic>, V122F) was found to be cross-resistant to CsA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>
<p>The two other mutant strains had mutations in only the <italic>cnaA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s007">S7</xref>). The MSL13 mutant (<italic>CNAA-1</italic>) has a point mutation, G1514C in the ORF, resulting in an amino acid change S378T, which lies in the amino acid adjacent to a previously known FK506 resistant mutant in calcineurin A in <italic>S. serevisiae</italic> (W430C) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Cardenas1">[63]</xref>. The MSL14 mutant (<italic>CNAA-2</italic>) has a point mutation, A1489G in the ORF, resulting in the amino acid substitution, N370D. These mutations occurred in the binding domain for calcineurin B and for the FKBP12-FK506 complex and likely reduce the binding affinity of the FKBP12-FK506 complex to the interface between the calcineurin A and B subunits, resulting in a less efficient inhibition of calcineurin activity by FK506. The fact that two FK506 resistant alleles were isolated in one of the three calcineurin A catalytic subunit (CnaA) suggests that it alone is sufficient to promote hyphal growth when cells are exposed to FK506, as the remaining two calcineurin A catalytic subunits (CnaB and CnaC) in complex with the CnbR regulatory subunit should be inhibited by FKBP12-FK506 under these conditions. The isolation and analysis of these FK506 resistant mutants in calcineurin A and B subunits further support the conclusions that the calcineurin pathway is: 1) conserved, 2) responsible for the dimorphic transition, and 3) the target of FK506 action in <italic>M. circinelloides</italic>.</p>

<title>Disruption of the regulatory subunit gene <italic>cnbR</italic> results in a yeast-locked <italic>M. circinelloides</italic> mutant that is less virulent than wild-type</title>
<p>FK506 treatment results in yeast growth in <italic>Mucor</italic>; therefore, we hypothesized that calcineurin activity is essential to maintain hyphal growth. To test this hypothesis we disrupted the <italic>cnbR</italic> gene encoding the calcineurin B regulatory subunit as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. The <italic>cnbR</italic> gene in the wild-type strain MU402 (<italic>pyrG</italic><sup>−</sup>, <italic>leuA</italic><sup>−</sup>) was replaced with a <italic>cnbRΔ::pyrG</italic> allele, and the gene deletion was confirmed by 5′ and 3′ junction PCR as well as ORF spanning PCR, and further confirmed by Southern blot analysis to show precise homologous recombination and the absence of any ectopic integration events (Figures S8 and S9). We generated two independent <italic>cnbRΔ</italic> deletion mutants from separate transformations.</p>
<p>The wild-type and <italic>cnbRΔ</italic> mutants (10<sup>3</sup> cells) were inoculated in the center of solid YPD medium and the strains were grown for three days at 30°C under normal aerobic conditions. The wild-type formed a large colony consisting of complex mycelia, whereas the <italic>cnbRΔ</italic> mutants displayed a compact yeast colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In liquid YPD media, wild-type <italic>Mucor</italic> grew as a filamentous mold; however, the <italic>cnbRΔ</italic> mutants displayed only yeast growth, even in aerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). No impact of FK506 was observed on the <italic>cnbRΔ</italic> mutants consistent with a complete absence of the drug target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). This phenotype of the <italic>cnbRΔ</italic> mutants is essentially identical to that of wild-type <italic>Mucor</italic> grown in the presence of FK506 in aerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s020">Videos S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s021">S3</xref>).

<p>(A) On YPD solid media, the <italic>cnbRΔ</italic> mutants lacking all calcineurin activity (CnbR is the common subunit partner for the three catalytic subunits CnaA, CnaB, and CnaC) produce a small compact colony; however, wild-type forms a complex mycelial mat. (B) In liquid media with vigorous shaking for aeration, wild-type grows as a filamentous/hyphal fungus, whereas the <italic>cnbRΔ</italic> mutants only exhibit multi-budded yeast growth as observed in wild-type grown in the presence of FK506 or anaerobic/high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. (C) The two <italic>cnbRΔ</italic> mutants were serially diluted and spot-inoculated on YPD or YPD with FK506 (1 µg/L). FK506 treatment did not impact growth of the mutants. Scale = 20 µm.</p>

<p>To assess the virulence of yeast vs. hyphae and to test the role of the calcineurin pathway in virulence, the <italic>cnbRΔ</italic> yeast-locked mutants were compared to both wild-type spores and wild-type yeast cells in animal virulence models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The R7B (<italic>leuA<sup>−</sup></italic>) strain served as wild-type to exclude the possibility that leucine auxotrophy could generate a biased result, as the <italic>cnbRΔ</italic> mutants were generated in the MU402 (<italic>pyrG<sup>−</sup> leuA<sup>−</sup></italic>) strain background (<italic>pyrG<sup>−</sup> leuA<sup>−</sup> cnbR::pyrG</italic>). Wild-type spores, wild-type yeast, and <italic>cnbRΔ</italic> mutant yeast (two independent mutant isolates) were quantified and cohorts of 10 wax moth larvae (a heterologous host system) per strain were infected with an inoculum of 20,000 infectious units. Wild-type spores and wild-type yeast both showed 100% mortality by four days post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Wild-type yeast are able to switch into growth as hyphae; thus, it was anticipated that wild-type yeast would be as virulent as wild-type spores. On the other hand, the <italic>cnbRΔ</italic> yeast-locked mutants did not kill the larvae after 8 days and were indistinguishable from the PBS control. When 40,000 cells were inoculated, the yeast-locked <italic>cnbRΔ</italic> mutants showed a higher level of virulence (60 to 70% mortality by day 4 post-infection), but were still significantly less virulent than wild-type spores (WT vs. <italic>cnbRΔ1</italic>, p = 0.00059) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). These results indicate that: 1) morphogenesis contributes to virulence in this fungus; 2) the calcineurin pathway is involved in virulence, and 3) calcineurin inhibitors have promise as antifungal drugs for zygomycete infections.</p>

<title>Calcineurin catalytic A subunits are expressed differentially during hyphal and yeast growth</title>
<p>We tested whether the three catalytic A subunit genes (<italic>cnaA</italic>, <italic>cnaB</italic>, and <italic>cnaC</italic>) are differentially regulated during the dimorphic transition. Initial northern blots showed that the probes for each <italic>cna</italic> gene were cross-reactive due to sequence similarity (data not shown); therefore, we performed quantitative RT-PCR with gene specific primers to specifically examine expression of each individual gene. In RT-PCR analyses, we found that all three <italic>cna</italic> genes were expressed, indicating that none were pseudogenes (data not shown). The PCR products from cDNAs obtained for each gene were sequenced to re-annotate the genes. Based on the ORF sequences, we designed a pair of specific RT-PCR primers across two exons of each <italic>cna</italic> gene. The actin gene was used for normalization.</p>
<p>The expression levels of the <italic>cna</italic> genes were evaluated using ct values from RT-PCR with hyphal growth conditions as a control. We found that <italic>cnaC</italic> is expressed at higher levels during yeast growth under microaerobic conditions but at lower levels during hyphal growth. Interestingly, during yeast growth driven by FK506, <italic>cnaC</italic> is also overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The expression levels of <italic>cnaA</italic> and <italic>cnaB</italic> were moderately reduced during the dimorphic switch. These results suggest that CnaC plays a specific role during the yeast growth phase and could therefore be less sensitive to inhibition by FK506, possibly as the result of overexpression in molar excess above FKBP12 levels. In parallel studies, Drs. Praveen Juvvadi and William Steinbach at Duke University found that <italic>M. circinelloides cnaC</italic> partially complements the radial growth defect of the <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> calcineurin catalytic A subunit (<italic>cnaA</italic>) mutant and also that MuCnaC-GFP localizes to septa, as does AfCnaA (Juvvadi P. R. et al., manuscript in preparation). <italic>M. circinelloides</italic> hyphae are coenocytic (aseptate), but during yeast growth or pseudohyphal growth, septa are formed; thus, CnaC function may be associated with septum formation.</p>

<title>Disruption of the <italic>cnaA</italic> gene results in a hypersensitivity to calcineurin inhibitors and SDS, the production of larger spores, and a loss of hyphal polarity</title>
<p>Of the three <italic>cna</italic> genes found in <italic>Mucor</italic>, homologs for the <italic>cnaA</italic> gene were found in all three of the zygomycete genomes analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s003">Figure S3</xref>), indicating that the <italic>cnaA</italic> gene may be the more ancestral calcineurin catalytic A subunit gene. Therefore, we chose to disrupt the <italic>cnaA</italic> gene to further test the roles of calcineurin in <italic>Mucor</italic>. A disruption allele consisting of the <italic>pyrG</italic> gene flanked by ∼1 kb of the 5′ upstream and 3′ downstream untranslated regions of the <italic>cnaA</italic> gene were introduced as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. Gene replacement by recombination was confirmed by 5′ and 3′ junction PCR, ORF spanning PCR, and Southern blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s012">Figures S12</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s013">S13</xref>). Two independent <italic>cnaAΔ::pyrG</italic> mutants were obtained from separate transformations.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the <italic>cnaAΔ</italic> mutants exhibited much higher sensitivity to FK506 and CsA compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Sensitivity was assessed based on the ability of the drugs to inhibit growth of the strains tested; for example, on YPD medium supplemented with FK506 (0.025 to 1 µg/ml), the two <italic>cnaAΔ</italic> mutants displayed significantly reduced growth compared to wild-type. Both <italic>cnaAΔ</italic> mutants also exhibited hypersensitivity to CsA. In liquid YPD with vigorous aeration, more abundant yeast growth was observed in the <italic>cnaA</italic> mutants compared to wild-type. Notably, the <italic>cnaAΔ</italic> mutants exhibited only yeast growth in the presence of 0.1 µg/ml FK506 in the media, which is a concentration insufficient to inhibit hyphal growth and induce yeast growth in wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). We explain these observations as resulting from the absence of one catalytic A subunit out of the three expressed (the mutants still have intact <italic>cnaB</italic> and <italic>cnaC</italic> genes), leading to a relative decrease in calcineurin, similar to haplo-insufficiency in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Poor1">[69]</xref>.

<p>To test if the enlarged spore phenotype conferred by mutations in the <italic>cnaA</italic> gene might contribute to virulence, we infected wax moth larvae with 5,000 spores of wild-type or the <italic>cnaAΔ</italic> mutants. Ten larvae were used for each strain. At the given inoculum, wild-type showed a moderate level of virulence; however, the two <italic>cnaA</italic> mutants were significantly more virulent compared to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g009">Figure 9C</xref>). The <italic>cnaAΔ</italic> mutants also formed hyphae in hosts similar to wild-type. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s014">Figure S14</xref>). The experiments were performed independently three times with similar results. As observed in our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Li1">[53]</xref>, in the interaction with macrophages, the larger <italic>cnaAΔ</italic> mutant spores produced a germ tube inside of macrophages, whereas wild-type remained as spores without germ tube emergence at 3.5 hours of co-culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s015">Figure S15</xref>), indicating that the mutants possibly avoided the innate host immune system by sending out germ tubes earlier and more efficiently than the wild-type. This suggests that calcineurin is involved in spore size control as a negative regulator and may therefore also contribute to virulence, although other calcineurin-CnaA-dependent functions may also contribute.</p>
<p>The <italic>cnaAΔ</italic> mutations also confer abnormal hyphal polarity. To carefully examine hyphal growth of the <italic>cnaAΔ</italic> mutants, we applied a time course imaging technique with a microscope equipped with an automatic shutter system. Wild-type and <italic>cnaAΔ</italic> mutant spores were placed on YPD agar media, and images were captured every 30 seconds. When the <italic>cnaAΔ</italic> mutants germinated, the germ tubes exhibited a tip-splitting phenotype and abnormal branching, whereas wild-type germ tubes elongated in a single direction with no tip-splitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g010">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s022">Videos S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s023">S5</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Morphogenic transitions (for example, yeast to hyphae and vice versa) are common in fungi and evolved in multiple fungal lineages. Many well known fungal pathogens change their morphology in response to their environments and morphogenesis is linked to their virulence. Human fungal pathogens encompass ascomycetes, basidiomycetes, and zygomycetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Brown1">[72]</xref>. In ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, the relationships between dimorphism and pathogenicity are relatively well established. However, whether dimorphism is associated with virulence in zygomycetes was not known. Our study has revealed how the dimorphic transition is regulated and linked to virulence and how the calcineurin pathway directs this process in the human pathogenic zygomycete <italic>M. circinelloides</italic>.</p>
<p>Several zygomycete species, especially those belonging to the order Mucorales, are known to cause the lethal fungal infection mucormycosis. These species include <italic>Mucor</italic> spp., <italic>Rhizopus</italic> spp., <italic>Rhizomucor</italic> spp., <italic>Cunninghamella</italic> spp., and <italic>A. trapeziformis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Chayakulkeeree1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-NeblettFanfair1">[3]</xref>. Unlike ascomycetous and basidiomycetous fungal pathogens, the current status of research into zygomycete pathogens is in its infancy. A limited ability to conduct genetics studies is one of the barriers to advancement in our understanding of zygomycete pathogens. <italic>M. circinelloides</italic> is one of the best developed systems for genetics and molecular biology among zygomycete species. Therefore, <italic>Mucor</italic> provides a foundation from which to understand mucormycosis.</p>
<p><italic>Mucor</italic> is a dimorphic fungus and the morphogenic transition is known to occur in response to environmental conditions, especially low levels of oxygen and high levels of carbon dioxide. Several other studies have implicated protein kinase A in this response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Wolff1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Pereyra1">[31]</xref>. Other factors known to be involved predominantly alter mitochondrial functions. Our study revealed that the calcineurin pathway is a key regulator of this developmental process.</p>
<p>FK506 treatment imposes yeast growth in <italic>Mucor</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Previously, we found that FKBP12 mutants are resistant to FK506 (resistance is defined as strains forming hyphae instead of yeast in the presence of FK506) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Bastidas2">[65]</xref>. FKBP12 is a member of the immunophilin family of proteins, which have <italic>cis-trans</italic> peptidyl- prolyl isomerase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Siekierka1">[64]</xref>. When bound to FK506, FKBP12 binds to the interface between the calcineurin catalytic A and regulatory B subunits, inhibiting phosphatase activity by occluding substrate access to the active site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Liu1">[51]</xref>. FKBP12 also binds to rapamycin to inhibit the Tor pathway. In other fungi, disruption of the gene encoding FKBP12 confers resistance to FK506 and rapamycin (in the absence of FKBP12, FK506 fails to bind calcineurin). Similar results are observed in <italic>Mucor</italic>; a splice site mutant (adenine into guanine at the 316<sup>th</sup> nucleotide), Leu91Pro substitution mutant, and FKBP12Δ null mutants are all resistant to FK506 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Bastidas2">[65]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that the N125Y, N129_Q130insH, and V122F alterations in the latch region of the calcineurin B regulatory protein confer resistance to FK506 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s004">S4</xref>). A previous site-directed mutagenesis study documented that the latch region is essential for immunophilin-immunosuppressant complex docking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Milan1">[52]</xref>. These mutations in the CnbR subunit of <italic>Mucor</italic> may prevent or limit docking of FKBP12-FK506 onto the calcineurin complex to result in less inhibition of calcineurin. Similar results has been observed in <italic>C. neoformans</italic> where a two amino acid insertion in the latch area of calcineurin B similarly confers resistance to FK506 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Fox1">[66]</xref>. In addition, the N370D and S378T mutations in the calcineurin B and FKBP12-FK506 binding domain of the CnaA catalytic subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s007">S7</xref>) confer resistance to FK506 and lead to the conclusion that <italic>Mucor</italic> has a conserved calcineurin pathway. Furthermore, the calcineurin B regulatory subunit gene disruption mutants only exhibited yeast growth, even during vigorous aeration conditions and there was no impact of FK506 on these strains that lack calcineurin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These observations all support the conclusion that calcineurin is a key factor in the dimorphic yeast to hyphae transition in <italic>Mucor</italic>.</p>
<p>Calcineurin has been suggested as a candidate antifungal drug target in many other pathogenic fungi, including <italic>Candida</italic> spp., <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, and <italic>U. maydis</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Chen1">[55]</xref>). The observation that calcineurin inhibitors block hyphal growth in zygomycete pathogens parallels findings in other fungal pathogens. That transplant patients receiving FK506 treatment have a lower incidence of mucormycosis contributes to validate calcineurin as a potential antifungal drug target <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Singh1">[73]</xref>. FK506 displays synergistic effects when combined with other antifungal agents, including azoles and echinocandins in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Shapiro1">[74]</xref>). In addition, calcineurin inhibitors exhibit an <italic>in vitro</italic> synergistic inhibition on zygomycete growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Thakur1">[75]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Dannaoui1">[77]</xref>. A recent study suggests that combination therapy with posaconazole and FK506 is efficacious in both a <italic>Drosophila</italic> heterologous host model and a cutaneous mucormycosis murine model system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Lewis1">[78]</xref>. We found that yeast-locked <italic>cnbRΔ</italic> mutants are not as virulent as wild-type in a heterologous wax moth model system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g005">Figure 5</xref>). One possibility is that hyphae are a more virulent form of <italic>Mucor</italic> compared to yeast. However, although the wild-type existed as hyphae and the yeast-locked mutants existed as yeast inside hosts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s010">Figure S10</xref>), we cannot rule out the possibility that the ability to transition between yeast and hyphae is a major factor in virulence during host infections as observed in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Saville1">[40]</xref>. Currently there are no known hyphal-locked mutants in <italic>Mucor</italic> that could be used to test these hypotheses further. This observation overall supports two important conclusions: first, dimorphism is linked to virulence in this fungal species and second, calcineurin inhibitors may be an effective way to control mucormycosis.</p>
<p>However, because the calcineurin pathway is conserved throughout eukaryotes, including humans, calcineurin inhibitors have their own inherent risks as antifungal drugs, including for example host immune suppression. In humans, calcineurin dephosphorylates the cytoplasmic subunit of the transcription factor <underline>n</underline>uclear <underline>f</underline>actor of <underline>a</underline>ctivated <underline>T</underline>-cells (NFATc) and promotes its nuclear localization to induce interleukin 2 (IL-2) and stimulate T cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Crabtree1">[79]</xref>. Thus, calcineurin inhibitors are immunosuppressive drugs. It is possible that the effects of calcineurin inhibitors as immunosuppressants will overpower their antifungal activities. This situation was also observed in our murine host experiments, in which FK506 treatment detrimentally affected mice infected with <italic>Mucor</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s016">Figure S16</xref>). Therefore ideal calcineurin inhibitors would be FK506 analogs that are less immunosuppressive to the host but which remain active against fungal calcineurins.</p>
<p><italic>Mucor</italic> encodes three calcineurin catalytic A subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s003">S3</xref>). The presence of the triplicated <italic>cna</italic> genes might have been derived from individual gene duplication events, which is supported by phylogenetic analyses and the presence of repetitive sequences linked to the <italic>cna</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s002">Figures S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s017">S17</xref>). However, in <italic>Mucor</italic>, synteny around the three <italic>cna</italic> genes was not conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s017">Figure S17</xref>), indicating that the duplication of the <italic>cna</italic> genes may have resulted from individual gene duplication events or segmental gene duplications that occurred earlier and that flanking synteny has decayed with evolutionary time. The presence of the same repetitive elements up- and downstream of the <italic>cna</italic> genes supports the hypothesis that individual gene duplication events may have produced the three versions of the <italic>cna</italic> genes in <italic>Mucor</italic>. However, in <italic>R. delemar</italic>, the triplicated copies of the <italic>cna</italic> genes arose via a different trajectory, involving a recent whole genome duplication and then a segmental gene duplication. Interestingly, the non-pathogenic Mucorales species <italic>Phycomyces</italic> has only a single <italic>cna</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s003">Figure S3</xref>). These observations indicate that different evolutionary trajectories gave rise to genes linked to virulence during speciation in the Mucorales order.</p>
<p>The <italic>cnaA</italic> gene is conserved in the three Mucorales species, and this gene might therefore have a conserved ancestral role in this fungal lineage. The <italic>Mucor cnaAΔ</italic> mutants display several interesting phenotypes: an abnormal polarity during hyphal growth, larger spore production, hypersensitivity to calcineurin inhibitors, and cell wall defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g008">Figures 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g009">9</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g010">10</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s021">Videos S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s022">S4</xref>). The abnormal polarity phenotypes include tip-splitting and atypical branching patterns. In several other fungal species, calcineurin is involved in hyphal polarity in accord with our observations in <italic>Mucor</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Steinbach1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Prokisch1">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Harren1">[80]</xref>. A remarkable phenotype of the <italic>cnaAΔ</italic> mutants is the production of larger spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g009">Figure 9</xref>). In a previous study, we showed that larger spore size is linked to higher virulence in <italic>Mucor</italic>. Accordingly, the larger spores of the <italic>cnaAΔ</italic> mutants were also found to be more virulent in the heterologous host model and macrophage model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g009">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s015">S15</xref>), further supporting the hypothesis that fungal cell gigantism is involved in virulence as observed in titan/giant cells of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and multinucleate spherules of <italic>Coccidioides immitis</italic>/<italic>posadasii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Li1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Okagaki1">[81]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Huppert1">[84]</xref>. This observation is at one level paradoxical because we suggest calcineurin as a target of antifungal drugs. However, we found that the growth of the <italic>cnaAΔ</italic> mutants was more sensitive to FK506 and CsA, and that the <italic>cnaAΔ</italic> mutants also exhibit cell wall defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Taken together with the finding that <italic>cnbRΔ</italic> mutants that should lack all calcineurin activity are attenuated in virulence, these results indicate that calcineurin inhibitors remain attractive antifungal drug candidates.</p>
<p>Calcineurin regulates many cellular processes in eukaryotes, including T-cell activation, polarized growth of neurites, long-term memory transitions, signaling in cardiac hypertrophy in humans as well as morphogenesis and virulence in fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Chen1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Crabtree1">[79]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Molkentin1">[85]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Ferreira1">[87]</xref>; however, to our knowledge, a connection between respiration and calcineurin has not been previously described. Our finding that calcineurin negatively regulates protein kinase A (PKA) activity is also novel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003625.s011">S11</xref>). An antagonistic relationship between calcineurin and PKA has been observed in <italic>U. maydis</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Egan1">[88]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-Kafadar1">[89]</xref>. Our study verifies that calcineurin activity is required for hyphal growth and PKA activity is correlated with yeast growth. Further, calcineurin activity might attenuate PKA activity in <italic>Mucor</italic>. Similar results were observed in two other pathogenic fungi, <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and <italic>R. delemar</italic>; thus, this antagonistic interconnection between calcineurin and PKA may be a conserved functional circuit in several fungal species. It is not clear if calcineurin directly acts to dephosphorylate PKA to control its activity or indirectly regulates PKA activity, for example, by regulation at the transcriptional level or via other proteins. Alternatively, calcineurin and PKA may share common targets (e.g. Crz1) for dephosphorylation and phosphorylation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003625-g011">Figure 11</xref>). Future investigation of this signaling network will be a promising venture.</p>

<title>Illustration of roles of calcineurin in dimorphism and virulence of <italic>Mucor</italic>.</title>
<p>Calcineurin is necessary for hyphal growth and negatively regulates spore size. Calcineurin is also involved in cell wall integrity. Calcineurin activity is inhibited by two immunophilin-drug complexes, FKBP12-FK506 and CypA-CsA, resulting in yeast growth or abnormal hyphal growth, respectively. On the other hand, during yeast growth, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activity is increased. I) Inhibition of calcineurin activity by FK506 or mutation of the regulatory B subunit results in elevated PKA activity, indicating that calcineurin negatively regulates PKA activity, either via direct inhibition of PKA or indirectly through other factor(s). II) Alternatively, PKA and calcineurin may share common target proteins and function. FKBP12: FK506 binding protein 12, CypA: cyclophilin A.</p>

<p>In conclusion, our finding that calcineurin orchestrates the dimorphic transition in <italic>Mucor</italic> is a significant advance since the first finding that CO<sub>2</sub>/low oxygen was the key factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-BartnickiGarcia2">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003625-BartnickiGarcia4">[17]</xref>.

<p>Conserved calcineurin components in three zygomycetes and evolutionary trajectory of the catalytic A subunit in the Mucorales fungi. (A) High numbers of calmodulin and calmodulin (CAM) kinase orthologs were identified in the three zygomycete genomes. <italic>M. circinelloides</italic> and <italic>R. delemar</italic> each have nine calmodulins while <italic>P. blakesleeanus</italic> has six, and <italic>M. circinelloides</italic> and <italic>P. blakesleeanus</italic> each have six CAM kinases while <italic>R. delemar</italic> has eight. Interestingly, two pathogenic zygomycetes, <italic>M. circinelloides</italic> and <italic>R. delemar</italic>, each encode three calcineurin catalytic A subunits, whereas the non-pathogenic species <italic>P. blakesleeanus</italic> only encodes one. <italic>M. circinelloides</italic> and <italic>P. blakesleeanus</italic> have a single calcineurin regulatory B subunit and cyclophilin A gene, whereas <italic>R. delemar</italic> encodes two paralogs of each gene, which may be the result of a whole genome duplication event unique to this lineage. All three species have one FKBP12 gene. (B) Phylogenetic analyses revealed that a common branch, including McCnaA, PbCnaA, RdCnaA, and RdCnaB, is conserved in the three zygomycete species. This result indicates that the calcineurin A subunit gene in this group may be the ancestral one and a duplication event might have generated additional <italic>cna</italic> genes in the <italic>Mucor</italic> and <italic>Rhizopus</italic> lineages (solid red arrow). Another independent duplication may have produced the third <italic>cna</italic> gene in the <italic>Mucor</italic> lineage (open red arrow). The RdCnaA and RdCnaB duplicated subunits in the <italic>Rhizopus</italic> lineage likely resulted from a recent whole genome duplication event; this hypothesis is supported by the short branch length and conserved flanking genes around the <italic>cna</italic> genes.
