<abstract>
<p>Hendra virus (HeV) is a recently emerged severe human pathogen that belongs to the <italic>Henipavirus</italic> genus within the <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family. The HeV genome is encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N) within a helical nucleocapsid. Recruitment of the viral polymerase onto the nucleocapsid template relies on the interaction between the C-terminal domain, N<sub>TAIL</sub>, of N and the C-terminal X domain, XD, of the polymerase co-factor phosphoprotein (P). Here, we provide an atomic resolution description of the intrinsically disordered N<sub>TAIL</sub> domain in its isolated state and in intact nucleocapsids using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Using electron microscopy, we show that HeV nucleocapsids form herringbone-like structures typical of paramyxoviruses. We also report the crystal structure of XD of P that consists of a three-helix bundle. We study the interaction between N<sub>TAIL</sub> and XD using NMR titration experiments and provide a detailed mapping of the reciprocal binding sites. We show that the interaction is accompanied by α-helical folding of the molecular recognition element of N<sub>TAIL</sub> upon binding to a hydrophobic patch on the surface of XD. Finally, using solution NMR, we investigate the interaction between intact nucleocapsids and XD. Our results indicate that monomeric XD binds to N<sub>TAIL</sub> without triggering an additional unwinding of the nucleocapsid template. The present results provide a structural description at the atomic level of the protein-protein interactions required for transcription and replication of HeV, and the first direct observation of the interaction between the X domain of P and intact nucleocapsids in <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The polymerase of negative strand RNA viruses reads the viral RNA that is associated with the nucleoprotein N forming a helical nucleocapsid. The interaction between N and the cofactor of the polymerase, the phosphoprotein P, is essential for transcription and replication of the viral genome. The mechanism by which the polymerase dislodges the RNA from the nucleoprotein for its polymerising activity remains unknown, although it has been proposed that binding to P causes a conformational change in the nucleocapsid. Here, we use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to develop an atomic resolution description of the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain, N<sub>TAIL</sub>, of N of Hendra virus, an emerging paramyxovirus, and X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of the X domain (XD) of P. Characterization of the interaction between XD and N<sub>TAIL</sub> provides evidence for folding of N<sub>TAIL</sub> upon binding to P. Crucially, we were also able to study, for the first time, the interaction between XD and recombinant paramyxoviral nucleocapsids. NMR spectra of N<sub>TAIL</sub> in its isolated form and in the context of nucleocapsids demonstrate that binding of XD does not change the dynamics of N<sub>TAIL</sub> and that the nucleocapsid does not undergo any major rearrangements or unwinding upon interaction with P.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) viruses are recently emerged, severe human pathogens within the <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Eaton1">[1]</xref>. A few distinctive properties set them aside from other paramyxoviruses and led to their classification within the <italic>Henipavirus</italic> genus of the <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family that also contains the newly identified Cedar virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Wang1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Marsh1">[3]</xref>. The genome of Henipaviruses is encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N) within a helical nucleocapsid. This helical N∶RNA complex, rather than the naked RNA, serves as substrate for both transcription and replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Rockx1">[4]</xref>. By analogy with other paramyxoviruses, the viral polymerase complex is thought to consist of the L protein and the phosphoprotein P.

The functional significance of the N-P interaction for genome transcription and replication makes it a promising target for antiviral drug design <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Messling1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>So far, high-resolution structural data are limited to <italic>Henipavirus</italic> surface proteins, where crystallographic studies led to the determination of the three-dimensional structure of the fusion (F) and the attachment (G) proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Lou1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Bowden1">[14]</xref>. A more complete picture of the molecular mechanisms governing transcription and replication of the virus awaits an atomic resolution characterization of the three key players N, P and L. The only available molecular data on <italic>Henipavirus</italic> N and P proteins come from our previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Habchi1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Blocquel1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Habchi2">[15]</xref> showing that the N and P proteins possess a modular organization consisting of both ordered and intrinsically disordered regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Habchi2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Habchi3">[16]</xref>. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are ubiquitous, functional proteins that lack significant amounts of secondary and tertiary structure under physiological conditions and are, therefore, not amenable to characterization by X-ray crystallography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Tompa1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Chouard1">[21]</xref>. IDPs populate a vast conformational space and ensemble descriptions have emerged as the preferred tool for representing their highly dynamic nature. In this context, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, in combination with ensemble selection techniques, has contributed immensely to our understanding of the conformational behaviour of IDPs providing a detailed mapping of their inherent potential energy landscape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Bernad1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Jensen2">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>The HeV nucleoprotein (N) consists of two domains: a folded domain (referred to as N<sub>CORE</sub>, residues 1–400) that is responsible for the interaction with the viral RNA and for maintaining the nucleocapsid structure, and an intrinsically disordered domain (referred to as N<sub>TAIL</sub>, residues 401–532) that is responsible for the interaction with the P protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Habchi1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Chan1">[10]</xref>. The atomic resolution structure of N<sub>CORE</sub> remains unknown, although, the crystal structure of the decameric ring-like N∶RNA complex of a related paramyxovirus, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), has been solved recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Tawar1">[30]</xref>.

<p>The HeV phosphoprotein (P) consists of a large intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (residues 1–469), a central domain (PMD, residues 470–578) that is thought to be responsible for the oligomerization of P through a coiled-coil arrangement by analogy with the related Sendai (SeV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Tarbouriech1">[32]</xref> and Measles viruses (MeV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Communie1">[33]</xref>, and a flexible linker of 80 amino acids connecting the globular C-terminal X domain (XD, residues 657–707) to PMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Habchi2">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we provide an atomic resolution description of the structure and dynamics of both N<sub>TAIL</sub> and XD using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The complex between N<sub>TAIL</sub> and XD is characterised using NMR revealing a characteristic folding of the molecular recognition element (MoRE) of N<sub>TAIL</sub> upon binding to XD. In addition, we determine the conformational behaviour of N<sub>TAIL</sub> in the context of intact nucleocapsids revealing that N<sub>TAIL</sub> remains flexible, as in the case of MeV nucleocapsids, and exhibits differential flexibility along its primary sequence. While previous solution NMR studies investigated the residual structure and dynamics of N<sub>TAIL</sub> in the context of intact MeV nucleocapsids, we here describe the first study of the interaction between a paramyxoviral nucleocapsid and the X domain of the phosphoprotein. The present results reveal that HeV XD can be accommodated on N<sub>TAIL</sub> without triggering additional unwinding of the helical nucleocapsid template. Our results provide an atomic resolution description of the protein-protein interactions that play an essential role in transcription and replication of HeV.</p>

<title>Residual structure and dynamics of HeV N<sub>TAIL</sub></title>
<p>In order to characterize the residual structure and dynamics of N<sub>TAIL</sub>, we carried out the spectral assignment of the backbone and Cβ nuclei using standard triple resonance experiments (Figure S1, Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003631.s001">Text S1</xref>). Carbon chemical shifts are exquisitely sensitive to the presence of secondary structure allowing us to directly probe the nature and level of residual secondary structure within N<sub>TAIL</sub>. The secondary structure propensity (SSP) of N<sub>TAIL</sub> was calculated on the basis of the experimental Cα and Cβ chemical shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Marsh2">[34]</xref>. Positive and negative SSP scores indicate propensity to form α-helical and β-extended conformations, respectively. The SSP shows that, although N<sub>TAIL</sub> is devoid of significant secondary structure, the protein adopts an α-helical conformation in the region encompassing residues 470–490. The helical propensity reaches approximately 50% for the central residues and decreases progressively towards the extremities. This region of the protein has previously been shown to constitute the binding site of the P protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Habchi1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Blocquel1">[9]</xref>.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup>N <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> relaxation rates and {<sup>1</sup>H}-<sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear Overhauser effects (nOe) report on dynamics occurring on the pico- to nanosecond time scale and were used to probe the backbone dynamics of N<sub>TAIL</sub>. They display a profile characteristic of an IDP revealing, however, more elevated values in the region 470–490 due to a reduced level of chain flexibility arising from the residual helical structure present in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g002">Figure 2B,C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-KleinSeetharaman1">[35]</xref>.

<title>Three-dimensional structure of HeV XD</title>
<p>The three-dimensional crystal structure of HeV XD was determined from X-ray diffraction data. The protein crystallized in a P2<sub>1</sub> space group with two molecules within the asymmetric unit of the crystal. Crystallographic phases were determined by single wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) using synchrotron data collected from crystals of the selenomethionine-substituted protein, and the structure was refined at 1.65 Å resolution (Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003631.s001">Text S1</xref>). The electron density was well defined throughout the structure, except for a few side chains on the surface, and the model of chain B includes four additional residues encoded by the expression vector (LEHH). The structure is composed of three α-helices, forming an anti-parallel three-helix bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The two copies in the asymmetric unit are equivalent (RMSD = 0.65 Å) and interact through a molecular surface (900 Å<sup>2</sup>) created by helices α1 and α3.</p>

<p>To investigate whether the structure of XD in solution is identical to the one determined by crystallography, as well as to study the interaction of XD with N<sub>TAIL</sub>, we carried out the NMR backbone assignment of XD on the basis of a set of standard triple resonance experiments (Figure S2, Table S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003631.s001">Text S1</xref>). The location of secondary structure elements obtained from the experimental Cα and Cβ chemical shifts are consistent with a three-helix bundle arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We also measured NMR residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) by weakly aligning the protein molecule in the magnetic field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Tolman1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Blackledge1">[38]</xref>. RDCs report on bond vector orientations with respect to a global alignment tensor that describes the preferential orientation of the molecule in the magnetic field. Four types of RDCs measured in a concentrated suspension of filamentous phages agree well with those back-calculated from the structure determined by X-ray crystallography (Table S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003631.s001">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The RDCs, therefore, confirm that the structure adopted by XD in solution is very similar to that observed in the crystal.</p>

<title>Atomic level structural insights into the interaction between HeV N<sub>TAIL</sub> and XD</title>
<p>To map the reciprocal N<sub>TAIL</sub> and XD interaction sites, as well as to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling the binding reaction, NMR chemical shift titration experiments were performed. The addition of an increasing amount of unlabeled XD to <sup>15</sup>N labeled N<sub>TAIL</sub> results in severe line broadening of the NMR resonances for residues 470–490 even at sub-stoichiometric amounts of XD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). This behaviour is a manifestation of contributions to the transverse relaxation rates arising from exchange occurring on the micro- to millisecond time scale between free and bound conformations of N<sub>TAIL</sub>. This confirms that the residues 470–490 are the primary interaction site of N<sub>TAIL</sub> with XD. The largest chemical shift perturbations in N<sub>TAIL</sub> are also observed in the region of residues 470–490 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, Figure S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003631.s001">Text S1</xref>). The affinity of the interaction between N<sub>TAIL</sub> and XD could not be derived from the chemical shift titrations as the resonances of the residues of N<sub>TAIL</sub> that are involved in the interaction disappear when more than 30% (molar fraction) of XD is added to N<sub>TAIL</sub>. The effective dissociation constant was previously measured by isothermal titration calorimetry to be 8.7 µM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Habchi1">[7]</xref>.</p>

<p>To obtain further mechanistic details of the interaction between N<sub>TAIL</sub> and XD, we monitored the decrease in signal intensities in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra of N<sub>TAIL</sub> at each XD titration point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g006">Figure 6B, C, D</xref>).

This differential broadening suggests that N<sub>TAIL</sub> binds to XD via a short, central helix, which is subsequently extended via helical folding of the adjacent residues.

<p>The crystal structure of XD provides additional information about the mechanism of interaction between N<sub>TAIL</sub> and XD. The distribution of hydrophobic and charged residues on the surface of XD reveals a hydrophobic groove between helix α2 and α3 surrounded by numerous negatively charged residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g007">Figure 7D</xref>).

In addition, four positively charged residues (R480, R482, K486 and K489) flank the four leucines and the alanine providing charge complementarity with respect to the negatively charged residues on the surface of XD. Note that this orientation of the MoRE at the XD surface is consistent with previous electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) data showing that the extent to which the N<sub>TAIL</sub> side chains are constrained within the N<sub>TAIL</sub>-XD complex follows the order A487&gt;S481&gt;S475 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Martinho1">[8]</xref>.</p>

<title>Characterization of N<sub>TAIL</sub> in the context of intact HeV nucleocapsids</title>
<p>In order to study the conformational behaviour of N<sub>TAIL</sub> in the context of the full-length nucleoprotein, we expressed and purified <sup>15</sup>N labeled, C-terminally His-tagged N (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Expression of full-length N results in the formation of nucleocapsid-like particles containing bacterial RNA (the nucleocapsid-like particles are simply denoted nucleocapsids in the following). In order to image the structures formed by HeV N, we performed negative staining transmission electron microscopy studies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, the sample contains flexible nucleocapsids with the typical herringbone appearance previously reported for other paramyxoviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Heggeness1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Schoehn1">[50]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g008">Figure 8B</xref> shows the nucleocapsid length statistics as inferred from analysis of 170 different particles. The analysis shows that the nucleocapsids have lengths between 20 and 200 nm with more than 75% of the nucleocapsids in the range between 30 and 90 nm. Assuming a mean pitch of 5.7 nm as determined previously for MeV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Desfosses1">[51]</xref>, the majority of the nucleocapsids contain 5 to 15 turns. The large size of the nucleocapsids (where 5–15 turns with 12 protomers per turn yields a mass in the order of 2.5 to 24 MDa) would normally preclude the detection of solution NMR signals due to the absence of fast rotational tumbling. However, the spectrum of the intact HeV nucleocapsids displays a large number of resonances and superimposes well on that of the isolated N<sub>TAIL</sub> domain with only minor chemical shift changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). This shows that N<sub>TAIL</sub> retains significant conformational flexibility <italic>in situ</italic> and allows the resonance assignment of the isolated N<sub>TAIL</sub> domain to be transferred to the nucleocapsid spectrum. Only the five C-terminal residues (528–532) of N<sub>TAIL</sub> could not be easily identified in the nucleocapsid spectrum due to the different location of the His-tag in the two proteins.</p>

<p>The intensity profile of the nucleocapsid spectrum (normalized with respect to the spectrum of the isolated N<sub>TAIL</sub> domain) reveals that N<sub>TAIL</sub> has differential flexibility along its primary sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). The resonances of residues 401–454 of N<sub>TAIL</sub> are absent or have very low signal intensities indicating that N<sub>TAIL</sub> is too rigid in this part of the sequence to give rise to solution NMR signals. This observation closely mimics measurements made previously on recombinant nucleocapsids of MeV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Jensen3">[52]</xref> and indicates that the N<sub>TAIL</sub> domain of HeV also requires approximately 50 residues to exfiltrate from the spindle to the exterior of the nucleocapsid helix. By assuming that each turn of the helical nucleocapsid contains 12 nucleoproteins and a pitch of 5.7 nm as determined previously for MeV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Desfosses1">[51]</xref>, we estimate on the basis of our length distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g008">Figure 8B</xref>) that 9% of the N<sub>TAIL</sub> domains detected by NMR are located at the edge of the nucleocapsids. This percentage is very close to the experimental intensity ratio observed for residues 420–450, suggesting that the residual intensities in this region are nucleocapsid-edge effects that arise from N<sub>TAIL</sub> domains that are not positioned between two helical turns of the nucleocapsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). These intensities can therefore be considered as an artefact of the purification of recombinant nucleocapsids.</p>
<p>The NMR signal intensities of the region encompassing residues 455–490 of N<sub>TAIL</sub> increase to an approximately constant level, while the C-terminal residues 491–527 gain even further in signal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). The plateau observed in the signal intensities in the region 455–490 indicates some restriction of motion compared to residues in the C-terminal part of the protein. This restriction of motion could be induced by a transient contact between the MoRE of N<sub>TAIL</sub> and the surface of the nucleocapsids or by an increased local correlation time of the partially folded MoRE due to a “drag” effect induced by the presence of the nucleocapsid core domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Bae1">[53]</xref>.</p>

<title>Interaction of intact HeV nucleocapsids with XD</title>
<p>The observed NMR signals of N<sub>TAIL</sub> within the nucleocapsids provide a unique probe of nucleocapsid morphology. Our next goal was thus to directly monitor the interaction between the nucleocapsids and XD in order to observe whether any changes in the local conformational behaviour of N<sub>TAIL</sub> or in the overall morphology of the nucleocapsids occur upon XD binding. The interaction between XD and full-length nucleocapsids of paramyxoviruses had previously not been amenable to structural studies, in particular, MeV nucleocapsids were found to precipitate upon addition of XD <italic>in vitro</italic> (data not shown). In the case of HeV, however, no such behaviour was observed, and we were able to record well-resolved spectra of nucleocapsids complexed with XD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). HSQC spectra of intact nucleocapsids in the absence and presence of a saturating amount of XD superimpose well and show that XD interacts only locally with the MoRE of N<sub>TAIL</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). The intensity profile of the nucleocapsids in the presence of XD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g010">Figure 10B</xref>) closely resembles that of the nucleocapsids alone except that the resonances of the MoRE have disappeared, as is the case in the titration of the isolated N<sub>TAIL</sub> domain with XD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Importantly, the intensities outside the MoRE (residues 420–468 and residues 500–527) are not modulated by the presence of XD and no additional peaks are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g010">Figure 10B</xref>). The fact that we see the same intensities and chemical shifts, and therefore the same conformational signature, for these residues upon interaction with the X domain of the phosphoprotein provides evidence that the environment of N<sub>TAIL</sub> is effectively identical in the free and XD-bound form of the nucleocapsids. Any major rearrangement or unwinding of the nucleocapsids upon interaction with XD would be expected to change the conformational signature of N<sub>TAIL</sub>. In particular, those N<sub>TAIL</sub> residues whose motion is evidently strongly restricted within intact nucleocapsids (i.e. residues 401–450) should gain in NMR signal intensity if the nucleocapsids were unwound, which is not observed. The fact that the small residual signals from residues 420–450, interpreted as nucleocapsid edge effects, are preserved indicates additionally that the length distribution of the nucleocapsids remains unchanged. Taken together, our results thus strongly suggest that the helical nucleocapsid remains intact upon interaction with XD.</p>

<title>Differential flexibility and transient order in HeV N<sub>TAIL</sub></title>
<p>In this study, we have characterized the X domain of the polymerase-associated phosphoprotein and the N<sub>TAIL</sub> domain of the nucleoprotein whose interaction is essential for the replication and transcription process. We have provided an atomic resolution structural and dynamic characterization of HeV N<sub>TAIL</sub> using NMR spectroscopy. From experimental chemical shifts and nuclear relaxation data, we have shown that N<sub>TAIL</sub> adopts conformations close to a random coil, except for the interaction site with the phosphoprotein that populates up to 50% α-helical conformations in broad agreement with previous global spectroscopic analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Blocquel1">[9]</xref>. A similar structural architecture was also observed for N<sub>TAIL</sub> of two closely related viruses, namely SeV and MeV, whose MoREs adopt a dynamic equilibrium between a completely unfolded state and several specific helical conformations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Jensen3">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Houben1">[54]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Jensen5">[57]</xref>.</p>
<p>To further extend the structural characterization of N<sub>TAIL</sub> to a physiologically relevant environment, we studied the conformational behaviour and flexibility of N<sub>TAIL</sub> within intact nucleocapsids. To this end, we expressed and purified intact nucleoprotein that assembles on cellular RNA in <italic>E. coli</italic>, to form helical nucleocapsids. Using solution NMR, N<sub>TAIL</sub> was found to remain flexible <italic>in situ</italic> supporting a functional role for structural disorder in orchestrating the replicative machinery of <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>. The flexibility of N<sub>TAIL</sub> in the context of the nucleocapsids was found to deviate from that observed for the isolated domain, with a gain of rigidity in the first 50 residues of N<sub>TAIL</sub>. The NMR intensity profile of N<sub>TAIL</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g009">Figure 9B</xref>) bears some resemblance to the profile measured from the homologous N<sub>TAIL</sub> domain within intact MeV nucleocapsids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Jensen3">[52]</xref>. In the previous study of MeV, a combination of NMR, electron microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering was used to propose a model whereby MeV N<sub>TAIL</sub> exfiltrates from the inside to the outside of the helical nucleocapsids via the interstitial space between folded N<sub>CORE</sub> domains. Indeed, the first 50 amino acids of MeV N<sub>TAIL</sub> could not be detected by solution NMR due to restricted conformational flexibility as the disordered chain escapes from the inside to the outside of the nucleocapsids. The results obtained here are in agreement with a similar model for the location of N<sub>TAIL</sub> in HeV nucleocapsids.</p>
<p>Despite the overall similarity in the conformational behaviour of N<sub>TAIL</sub> within the nucleocapsids of HeV and MeV, the intensity profiles are however strikingly different within their MoREs. In MeV, the MoRE of N<sub>TAIL</sub> appears to be co-localized on the surface of the nucleocapsids up to 95% of the time, resulting in heavily attenuated signals in the MoRE. We have previously proposed that this co-localization may have functional implications, providing a mechanism by which N<sub>TAIL</sub> can position the viral polymerase complex close to the viral RNA. In HeV, this co-localization appears weaker, as evidenced by appreciable intensities of the solution NMR signals in the MoRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). This different location of the MoRE might provide a basis for a different mechanism of recognition by the polymerase complex in the two viruses.</p>

<title>Insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the HeV N<sub>TAIL</sub>-XD interaction</title>
<p>Chemical shift titrations suggest that upon interaction with the C-terminal X domain of the phosphoprotein, the MoRE of N<sub>TAIL</sub> undergoes α-helical folding. This observation is supported by previous studies of this interaction using circular dichroism (CD) and EPR spectroscopy that showed that XD triggers α-helical folding of N<sub>TAIL</sub> upon binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Habchi1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Martinho1">[8]</xref>. On the basis of the changes in the NMR signal intensities of N<sub>TAIL</sub> upon addition of an increasing amount of XD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g006">Figure 6B, C, D</xref>), we suggest that the formation of the N<sub>TAIL</sub>-XD complex relies on a combination of conformational selection and induced folding, where complex formation proceeds via an initial binding of a short helix in the centre of the MoRE that is subsequently extended by α-helical folding of the adjacent residues. The complex between N<sub>TAIL</sub> and XD appears to be dynamic, as the resonances of the MoRE of N<sub>TAIL</sub> do not reappear even for large saturating amounts of XD, suggesting helical fraying of the MoRE of N<sub>TAIL</sub> on the surface of XD.</p>
<p>To obtain further insight into the structural basis of transcription and replication of HeV, we determined the crystal structure of XD. The structure consists of a three-helix bundle arrangement in agreement with previous studies showing that the <italic>Henipavirus</italic> X domains form autonomously folding units adopting an α-helical conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Habchi1">[7]</xref>. NMR chemical shifts and RDCs of XD measured in solution confirmed the triple-helix structure. The structure of HeV XD is very similar to the structure of the XD domains of MeV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Johansson1">[58]</xref>, SeV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Blanchard1">[59]</xref> and mumps virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Kingston1">[60]</xref> P proteins with backbone RMSD values of 1.22, 1.34 and 0.88 Å, respectively. Although a comparison of the primary sequences of the X domains of SeV, MeV and HeV shows significant divergence, the hydrophobic residues buried within the XD structure are conserved among the three viruses (Figure S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003631.s001">Text S1</xref>). The reproduction of an essentially identical hydrophobic core in all three viruses implies that this particular triple-helix arrangement has a strong functional relevance in paramyxoviruses.</p>
<p>Our results show that the two helices α2 and α3 of XD constitute the binding site for the MoRE of N<sub>TAIL</sub>, as also observed in the corresponding N<sub>TAIL</sub>-XD pairs in both MeV and SeV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Houben1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Kingston2">[61]</xref>. The interaction between XD and N<sub>TAIL</sub> in HeV appears to be controlled by a combination of long-range electrostatic forces that correctly orient N<sub>TAIL</sub> prior to accommodation in the narrow hydrophobic pocket on the surface of XD. The extent to which these long-range electrostatic interactions play a role in complex formation remains however to be established, since previous studies showed that salt concentrations as high as 1 M do not affect the N<sub>TAIL</sub>-XD binding affinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Habchi1">[7]</xref>. A comparison of the distribution of hydrophobic and charged residues on the surface of the X domains of SeV, MeV and HeV shows that they all display a hydrophobic pocket of varying size at the interface between helices α2 and α3 (Figure S5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003631.s001">Text S1</xref>). In contrast to the hydrophobic core that is reproduced in all three viruses and provides the stabilizing scaffold for XD, the charge distribution on and around the interaction surface with N<sub>TAIL</sub> varies significantly over X domains. These differences presumably play a role in the selectivity of the N<sub>TAIL</sub>-XD interactions in SeV, MeV and HeV.</p>
<p>Although high resolution NMR spectroscopy, as well as previous biochemical data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Habchi1">[7]</xref>, suggest that HeV N<sub>TAIL</sub>-XD forms a so-called ‘fuzzy’ complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Tompa3">[62]</xref>, which is characterized by mobility within the complex, we have nevertheless attempted to model the structure of the complex in terms of a single conformation using chemical shift mapping of the two interacting interfaces. The results (Figure S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003631.s001">Text S1</xref>) reveal that neither chemical shifts, nor electrostatic interactions, are able to distinguish between the directionality of the N<sub>TAIL</sub> helix on the surface of XD. The experimental data do not distinguish rotational symmetry about the axis of the N<sub>TAIL</sub> helix, although two conformations are most probable, both having the hydrophobic face of the MoRE of N<sub>TAIL</sub> identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g007">Figure 7</xref> in contact with the hydrophobic interface of XD. In both conformations the two arginines flanking the hydrophobic face on N<sub>TAIL</sub> interact with acidic patches on the surface of XD. Notably, irrespective of the direction of the MoRE, its optimal position with respect to the observed chemical shift perturbations on the surface of XD is very similar to that observed in the chimeric crystal structure of MeV N<sub>TAIL</sub>-XD (Figure S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003631.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Binding of XD to intact nucleocapsids and functional implications for transcription and replication</title>
<p>In paramyxoviruses, genome transcription and replication rely on the N-P interaction that is critical for the recruitment of the polymerase. This interaction is thought to make the viral RNA accessible to the polymerase L through a structural reorganisation of the nucleocapsid. The molecular mechanisms of this critical step remain, however, poorly understood and to the best of our knowledge no such nucleocapsid conformational change induced by a polymerase complex has been observed so far in any <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> member. As a step towards a better understanding of the structural and molecular basis of transcription and replication, we have performed the first investigation of XD binding to N<sub>TAIL</sub> in the context of intact nucleocapsids. Our results show that XD interacts only locally with the MoRE of N<sub>TAIL</sub> and that no additional residues in N<sub>TAIL</sub> are involved in the interaction. Importantly, the NMR signal intensities outside the MoRE are not perturbed by the presence of XD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003631-g010">Figure 10B</xref>). The similarity of the high-resolution NMR spectroscopic parameters measured in the presence and absence of the partner, which together represent the signature that the N-terminal part of N<sub>TAIL</sub> remains sterically hindered between turns of the nucleocapsid, indicates that there is no major reorganization of the nucleocapsid upon interaction. Any further opening of the interstitial space between turns of the nucleocapsid helix would be expected to give rise to enhanced flexibility and therefore increased signal intensity, both within the first 50 amino acids and in the 10–15 amino acids immediately following this region. In addition, RNAse digestion experiments did not reveal any hyperchromic effect at 260 nm upon addition of XD (data not shown), indicating that XD does not render the encapsidated RNA more accessible to the solvent.</p>
<p>In combination, these observations provide the first experimental evidence that XD can be accommodated on N<sub>TAIL</sub> without triggering a nucleocapsid rearrangement that could increase the accessibility of the polymerase complex to the viral genome. We can speculate that the presence of the full-length, tetrameric P protein, the polymerase L and/or additional host factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Delpeut1">[63]</xref>, are necessary to trigger any conformational transition that may occur prior to replication of the viral RNA by the polymerase machinery. Notably, the major inducible heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) was shown to enhance both transcription and replication in MeV and in the closely related canine distemper virus (CDV), with this effect relying on an interaction between hsp70 and N <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Oglesbee1">[64]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Carsillo1">[70]</xref>. Taking into account the fact that hsp70 has been suggested to trigger conformational changes within CDV nucleocapsids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Oglesbee3">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003631-Oglesbee4">[72]</xref>, it is tempting to speculate that unwinding of the nucleocapsid may require hsp70 also in the case of HeV.</p>
