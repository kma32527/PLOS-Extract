<p>Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is a lethal neurological disease resulting from infection with Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1). Loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>UNC93B1</italic>, <italic>TLR3</italic>, <italic>TRIF</italic>, <italic>TRAF3</italic>, and <italic>TBK1</italic> genes have been associated with a human genetic predisposition to HSE, demonstrating the UNC93B-TLR3-type I IFN pathway as critical in protective immunity to HSV-1. However, the <italic>TLR3</italic>, <italic>UNC93B1</italic>, and <italic>TRIF</italic> mutations exhibit incomplete penetrance and represent only a minority of HSE cases, perhaps reflecting the effects of additional host genetic factors. In order to identify new host genes, proteins and signaling pathways involved in HSV-1 and HSE susceptibility, we have implemented the first genome-wide mutagenesis screen in an <italic>in vivo</italic> HSV-1 infectious model. One pedigree (named <italic>P43</italic>) segregated a susceptible trait with a fully penetrant phenotype. Genetic mapping and whole exome sequencing led to the identification of the causative nonsense mutation L3X in the <italic>Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase C</italic> gene (<italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic>), which encodes for the tyrosine phosphatase CD45. Expression of <italic>MCP1</italic>, <italic>IL-6</italic>, <italic>MMP3</italic>, <italic>MMP8</italic>, and the <italic>ICP4</italic> viral gene were significantly increased in the brain stems of infected <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice accounting for hyper-inflammation and pathological damages caused by viral replication. <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mutation drastically affects the early stages of thymocytes development but also the final stage of B cell maturation. Transfer of total splenocytes from heterozygous littermates into <italic>Ptprc</italic><sup>L3X</sup> mice resulted in a complete HSV-1 protective effect. Furthermore, T cells were the only cell population to fully restore resistance to HSV-1 in the mutants, an effect that required both the CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and could be attributed to function of CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper 1 (Th1) cells in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell recruitment to the site of infection. Altogether, these results revealed the CD45-mediated T cell function as potentially critical for infection and viral spread to the brain, and also for subsequent HSE development.</p>

<p>Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is a lethal neurological disease resulting from infection with Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1). Previous studies have demonstrated a human genetic predisposition to HSE. However, the gene mutations that have been suggested as critical in protective immunity to HSV-1, exhibit incomplete penetrance and represent only a minority of HSE cases, perhaps reflecting the effects of additional host genetics factors. In order to identify new host genes involved in HSV-1 and HSE susceptibility, we have implemented the first genome-wide mutagenesis screen in an <italic>in vivo</italic> HSV-1 infectious model. Using this large-scale approach, we have identified a loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase C</italic> (<italic>Ptprc</italic>) gene. Mice carrying this mutation were characterized by defects in thymic and B cell development. Following infection, these mutant mice exhibited hyper-inflammation in their brains stems caused by viral replication. Transfer of total lymphocytes from resistant into mutant mice resulted in a complete HSV-1 protective effect. Furthermore, T lymphocytes were the only cell population to fully restore resistance to HSV-1 in the mutants. These findings revealed the T cell function as potentially critical for infection and viral spread to the brain, as well as to subsequent HSE development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a large, enveloped virus of the <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> family. Its 152 kilobase (kb), double-stranded DNA genome encodes more than 80 polypeptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-McGeoch1">[1]</xref>. HSV-1 is among the most prevalent and successful human pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Xu1">[2]</xref> and is typically transmitted through intimate contact and exchange of bodily fluids, such as saliva. This virus causes a life long infection, which consists of two distinct phases: an initial lytic stage, followed by a shift to latency once it reaches sensory neurons. Periodically, reactivation from latency occurs and is associated with numerous diseases, ranging from the common cold sore to ocular herpetic stromal keratitis, a leading cause of infectious blindness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Pepose1">[3]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Kaye1">[4]</xref>. Reactivation events as well as primary infections are also associated with herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), a rare but life threatening consequence of infection of the central nervous system (CNS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Whitley1">[5]</xref>. In most of cases, the virus reactivates in the olfactory bulb or trigeminal ganglia, enters the brain via a retrograde axonal transport, replicates into the CNS, causing acute inflammation and significant pathological damages (review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Conrady1">[6]</xref>). HSE is caused by direct lytic effects of the virus on neurons and glial cells, but mostly, by collateral damage, such as the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), due to the accompanying inflammatory reaction and leukocytes homing to the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Lokensgard1">[7]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Sellner1">[8]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Sobel1">[9]</xref>. If left untreated, HSE is lethal in nearly 70% of cases; despite treatment, debilitating sequelae frequently develop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Whitley1">[5]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Kimberlin1">[10]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Whitley2">[11]</xref>. In developed countries, it remains among the most common causes of viral encephalitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Tyler1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Since HSE was discovered in 1941, it has remained unclear why only a small proportion of otherwise healthy individuals exposed to HSV-1 develop the disease. In 2003, an autosomal recessive mutation in the <italic>STAT1</italic> gene was the first genetic etiology to HSE reported in HSV-1 seropositive patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Dupuis1">[13]</xref>. More recently, loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>UNC93B1</italic>, <italic>TLR3</italic>, <italic>TRIF</italic>, <italic>TRAF3</italic>, and <italic>TBK1</italic> genes have also been associated with HSE in otherwise healthy children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Casrouge1">[14]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Zhang1">[15]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-SanchoShimizu1">[16]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-PerezdeDiego1">[17]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Guo1">[18]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Herman1">[19]</xref>, demonstrating the critical role of the UNC93B-TLR3-type I IFN pathway in the outcome of childhood HSE. Indeed, the fibroblasts of these patients displayed an impaired production of IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-λ following TLR3 stimulation. These fibroblasts are also highly susceptible to infection with HSV-1 and this phenotype has recently been shown to recapitulate the impairment of TLR3-dependent HSV-1 control in UNC-93B deficient neurons and oligodendrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Lafaille1">[20]</xref>. However, the <italic>TLR3</italic>, <italic>UNC93B1</italic>, and <italic>TRIF</italic> mutations exhibit incomplete clinical penetrance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-SanchoShimizu2">[21]</xref>, perhaps reflecting the effects of additional environmental or host genetics factors. Furthermore, these mutations affect only a small proportion of children with HSE. Altogether, these observations suggest that predisposition to HSE may result from a set of diverse single gene defects and indicate the likely existence of other anti-HSE pathways.</p>
<p>Mouse models have also provided an efficient way to identify host factors that contribute to susceptibility or resistance to HSE. In 1975, Lopez and colleagues were the first to demonstrate the contribution of host genetics to HSE pathogenesis using different inbred strains of mice with varying resistance to HSV-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Lopez1">[22]</xref>. Subsequently, HSE mouse models have employed several viral and mouse strains, knock-out mice, as well as various routes of infections. It has been demonstrated that <italic>STAT1</italic> knock-out mice (<italic>STAT1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) are susceptible to HSE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Halford1">[23]</xref> with an increased HSV-driven immune pathology in the cornea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Pasieka1">[24]</xref> and also in the brain stems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Pasieka2">[25]</xref>. <italic>Unc93b1</italic>-deficient mice have also been associated with HSE susceptibility despite their ability to control viral replication in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Wang1">[26]</xref>. Altogether, these studies are consistent with the genetic etiologies of HSE reported in humans. Mice deleted for <italic>Myd88</italic>, which encodes for the adaptor protein of TLR7 and 9, were also highly susceptible to HSE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Mansur1">[27]</xref>. In contrast to this finding, Honda et al. showed no increased susceptibility to HSE for <italic>Myd88<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, whereas <italic>Irf7<sup>−/−</sup></italic> had significantly increased mortality, correlating with reduced IFN-α level in the sera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Honda1">[28]</xref>. Like <italic>Myd88</italic>, <italic>TLR9<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice have been shown to be either more susceptible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Lima1">[29]</xref> or resistant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Wang1">[26]</xref> to HSE. The discrepancy in these studies may be due to different routes of infection or differences in viral strains. Nevertheless, these reports clearly demonstrate the key role of antiviral IFNs in mouse models of HSE. Several knock-out mice have also been used to study the immune control of HSE by NK, T or B cells. B cell-deficient mice were more susceptible to HSE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Beland1">[30]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Deshpande1">[31]</xref> whereas the role of T cells, in particular the role of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, is still controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Manickan1">[32]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Holterman1">[33]</xref>. For example, athymic nude mice lacking T cells have been shown to be resistant to HSE similar to wild-type (WT) mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Zawatzky1">[34]</xref> while Metcalf et al. found them more susceptible to HSE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Metcalf1">[35]</xref>. Similar to that of T cells, the contribution of NK cells in HSE has been unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Vollstedt1">[36]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Adler1">[37]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Habu1">[38]</xref>. Hence, the role of each of these immune cell populations remains elusive, as susceptibility to HSV-1 depends on both viral (viral strain, route of infection, and viral dose) and host factors (strain and age of the animal). These investigations have nonetheless paved the way for the study of the genetic etiology of HSE. However, no gene associated with HSE has thus far been identified by positional cloning in mice and host factors that contribute to susceptibility or resistance to this pathology also remain largely unknown.</p>
<p>N-Ethyl-N-Nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis constitutes an inherently unbiased, functional genomic strategy for the identification of genes, including those without known functions or biological precedents, regardless of their chromosomal location and expression pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Justice1">[39]</xref>. Treatment with this chemical mutagen introduces random point mutations in the mouse genome, with an average substitution rate of one nucleotide per megabase (Mb). In high throughput phenotypic screens, such mutations may lead to the identification of genes responsible for specific immune response defects and/or genes associated with diseases. Furthermore, positional cloning of mutant genes is now facilitated by recent progress in the field of genomics, such as exome sequencing and the availability of the mouse genome sequence. Thus, ENU mutagenesis has been used to successfully identify genes, proteins, and signaling pathways involved in a wide range of biological processes, including susceptibility to infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Sauer1">[40]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Bongfen1">[41]</xref>, obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Hong1">[42]</xref>, muscle development and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Miller1">[43]</xref>, cardiomyopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Fernandez1">[44]</xref>, thrombocytopenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Chan1">[45]</xref> and immunodeficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Tabeta1">[46]</xref>. This last report, describing a single-nucleotide mutation in the <italic>Unc93b1</italic> gene that abrogates signaling via TLR3, 7 and 9, has largely contributed in the discovery of the human UNC93B1 mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Casrouge1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we took advantage of the large scale mouse ENU mutagenesis platform developed in our laboratory to systematically search for novel host genes that directly impact infection by HSV-1 and the development of HSE. This led the identification of the <italic>Ptprc</italic> gene as a novel host factor associated with HSV-1 susceptibility.</p>

<title>Description of the ENU-screening approach and identification of a HSV-1 susceptible mutant</title>
<p>To identify novel host genes and fundamental pathways that directly impact HSV-1 infection and HSE pathology, ENU-mutagenized mice were screened for their susceptibility to HSV-1. Generation 0 (G0) C57BL/6J (B6) male mice were first treated with the mutagen ENU and then mated with C57BL/10J (B10, to facilitate subsequent genetic mapping) mice to produce G1 males, the founders of the colony which are heterozygous for ENU-induced mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The G1 males were then backcrossed to B10 mice, to produce G2 animals. Two randomly chosen G2 daughters were backcrossed to their G1 father to produce G3 pedigrees, where homozygous ENU-mutations are expected to segregate in about 25% of animals. These G3 pedigrees were then infected i.p. with 1×10<sup>4</sup> pfu of HSV-1 strain 17. This dose led to lethal encephalitis in susceptible A/J mice, whereas B6 mice remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003637.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Following infection, the ENU-mutagenized mice were monitored for two weeks; the pheno-deviant offspring that exhibited clinical signs or succumbed to the infection were considered susceptible. Over 1,000 G3 mice, corresponding to sixty-nine G1 males, were screened for their susceptibility to HSV-1 infection. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g001">figure 1B</xref>, most A/J and BALB/c mice succumb uniformly between five and eight days post-infection (p.i.). In contrast, WT B6 and B10 mice, as well as ENU-mutagenized G3 mice, are susceptible in less than 10% of cases, which is largely under the expected frequency of susceptibility in pedigrees segregating a recessive mutation (25%). Sixty-nine G1 pedigrees were screened for their susceptibility to HSV-1 infection. Of these, a pedigree called <italic>P43</italic> appeared promising. Indeed, mating the G1 male with either of the two G2 daughters (G2a and G2b in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) produced HSV-1 susceptible G3 offspring with over 20% of mortality upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These susceptible animals generally succumbed later than in A/J and BALB/c mice, between day 11 and 13 p.i. Moreover, no difference was observed between male and female offspring (data not shown).</p>

<p>To map the locus responsible for the HSV-1 susceptibility we carried out a genome-wide scan on 45 G3 mice, including 11 susceptible and 34 resistant animals. Linkage analysis identified a significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) signal on chromosome 1 (position 118.6 to 144.9 Mb) with a logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 6.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The critical interval was associated with homozygous B6-derived alleles from the original mutated G0 male, except in the case of one animal that survived the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, see G3.45). In contrast, homozygosity for B10 alleles and B6/B10 heterozygosity correlated perfectly with resistance. These findings suggested that HSV-1 susceptibility in the <italic>P43</italic> pedigree is due to a recessive mutation located between 118.6 and 144.9 Mb on chromosome 1.</p>

<p>This 26 Mb interval on chromosome 1 contains more than 250 genes. Thus, to identify the ENU induced mutation involved in our HSV-1 susceptibility phenotype, whole exome sequencing, which consists of selectively capture and sequencing the coding regions of the genome, was performed on genomic DNA from two <italic>P43</italic>-derived G3 mutants. The generated sequences were then compared to the WT B6 reference sequence, filtered against public and in house databases, and only genetic variations supported by a minimum coverage of 10 sequence reads were considered (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003637-t001">Table 1</xref>). This represented a total of 116 mutations, of which 88 were homozygous and 13 were common to both sequenced <italic>P43</italic> mutant mice. Two mutations were localized in the distal region of chromosome 1 (118.6–144.9 Mb) previously identified by linkage analysis. One of these two mutations was a non-synonymous mutation I543F in the <italic>Kcnt2</italic> gene, which encodes for a protein belonging to the voltage-gated potassium channel complex. The structure of Kcnt2 is probably not affected by the ENU-induced mutation since I and F residues are both hydrophobic, neutral and non-polar amino acid. However, the other mutation is likely to have a significant impact at the protein level: a unique A to T transversion in exon 1 (chromosome 1∶140,071,651) of the <italic>Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase C</italic> (<italic>Ptprc</italic>) gene, which generates the premature stop codon L3X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The <italic>Ptprc</italic> gene is expressed on all nucleated hematopoietic cells and encodes for the multiple forms of the tyrosine phosphatase receptor CD45, including the isoform B220 present on B cells. CD45, when analyzed with the Gene Ontology (GO) database, is statistically enriched for “response defense to virus” and thus represents the best candidate gene to explain the HSV-1 susceptibility observed in this pedigree. First, the L3X mutation in <italic>Ptprc</italic> was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of all affected (n = 11) and unaffected individuals (n = 34) of the <italic>P43</italic> pedigree. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, the susceptibility to HSV-1 infection was associated with <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> genotype in more than 90% of cases (11/12), whereas HSV-1 resistance segregated with <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Ptprc<sup>+/+</sup></italic> littermates. Furthermore, previously described <italic>Ptprc</italic> null mice, that lacked expression of all endogenous CD45 isoforms due to a targeted deletion on exon 9 (<italic>Ptprc<sup>ex9−/−</sup></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Byth1">[47]</xref>, were susceptible as homozygous <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Most notably, <italic>Ptprc<sup>ex9−/−</sup></italic> mice succumbed within the same time-frame than our ENU-induced mutant mice, providing independent evidence that <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mutation determines the vulnerability to HSV-1 observed in pedigree <italic>P43</italic>. FACS analysis demonstrated that about 70% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from <italic>Ptprc<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice were stained with antibody against B220, whereas no signal was observed in PBMCs from mutant <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). A similar absence of B220<sup>+</sup> cell compartment was also observed in the spleen of <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice (data not shown). These results indicated that <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> is a null allele resulting in complete absence of protein. In the following sections, <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> were used as controls since these heterozygous littermates phenocopy <italic>Ptprc<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice in their response against HSV-1.</p>

<title><italic>Ptprc</italic> L3X mutation determines susceptibility to HSV1, independent of the infectious route and viral strain</title>
<p>To determine a possible impact of the infection route on the survival phenotype, <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice and heterozygous littermates were infected intranasally (i.n.) with 5×10<sup>3</sup> pfu of HSV-1 strain 17. This dose led to lethal encephalitis in susceptible A/J mice by day 6–7 post-infection, whereas all B6 mice survived (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003637.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In this infectious model, more than 60% of <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice succumbed around the same time (by day 11–13 p.i.) as those infected i.p., while heterozygous littermates survived in more than 85% of cases (p-value = 0.003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, i.p. infection with the McIntyre or F strains of HSV-1 also resulted in an increased susceptibility in <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>, respectively), despite the fact that, relative to strain 17, the McIntyre and F strains appear less virulent in our experimental model (compare survival curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g003">3C and 3D</xref>).

<title>HSV-1 susceptibility is associated with profound CNS inflammation</title>
<p>To better characterize the pathogenesis in our mouse model, we followed the kinetics of viral replication in the brain and periphery (spleen and liver) following i.p. infection. At days 3, 6, and 10 p.i., the spleen and liver from both <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice had undetectable levels of virus (data not shown). In contrast, the brain tissue from two out of five <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice showed significant viral titers at day 10 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), which is consistent with results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, where a large number of these mice succumb at days 11–13 p.i. Otherwise, the brains from all <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> mice had undetectable viral titers, correlating with their survival. To confirm this result, we carried a second set of experiments where mice were weighed twice daily and their brain stems were harvested if the mice lost at least 15% of their pre-infection weight. The brain stems were chosen instead of whole brains because <italic>STAT1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, which are also susceptible to HSV-1, have been shown to exhibit a high viral titer and upregulate a large number of inflammatory markers in their brain stems following HSV-1 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Pasieka2">[25]</xref>. As a measure of virus load, we determined the expression of the <italic>ICP4</italic> viral gene in the brain stems collected from <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice using real time quantitative PCR (qPCR). In these conditions, <italic>ICP4</italic> expression in the brain stems from seven out of nine <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice was increased by more than 20-fold relative to those from <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The same samples were used to determine the transcript level of MCP1, IL-6 and two matrix metalloproteases (MMP-3 and -8) that are highly expressed during HSE and can also cause the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Marques1">[48]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Stamatovic1">[49]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Klinman1">[50]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-LeBlanc1">[51]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Paul1">[52]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Takeda1">[53]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Spindler1">[54]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Pasieka2">[25]</xref>.

<title><italic>Ptprc</italic> L3X mutation is associated with absence of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, which is due to defects in early stages of thymocyte development</title>
<p>We have shown that HSV-1 susceptibility is associated with the presence of virus and profound inflammation in the CNS. This suggests that the immune response of susceptible mice could be affected, limiting their ability to control viral spread from the periphery into the CNS. To this end, the blood and spleen from <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> and heterozygous littermates were collected and specific cell populations were examined by FACS. Of note, there was no significant difference in the total number of cells between <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> and heterozygous littermates for these tissues (data not shown). Thus, FACS data are represented as a percentage of total cells.

<p>To gain insight into the absence of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells in the periphery, thymuses from <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> and heterozygous littermates were collected and thymocytes were first stained for CD4 and CD8. As above, thymocytes from both <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> and heterozygous littermates were present in equal numbers (data not shown). Consistent with results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g005">Figures 5A</xref>, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> single positive (SP) thymocytes were not present in <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). However, CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup> double negative cells (or DN) from <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice were 4-fold higher relative to heterozygous littermates, suggesting a block at the DN stage. Then, the DN thymocytes were analyzed on the expression profiles of CD25 and CD44, two receptors expressed during T cell development. Thymocytes from <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice displayed an accumulation of immature CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup> DN3 cells (CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>−</sup>) and a reduced number of DN4 (CD25<sup>−</sup>CD44<sup>−</sup>) cells relative to heterozygous littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g005">Figure 5F</xref>); these last results revealed a partial block at the β selection step of TCR-β rearrangement.

<title>Both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are required for complete protection against HSV-1</title>
<p>We have shown that the L3X mutation in <italic>Ptprc</italic> leads to a lack of the CD3<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment and affects B cell maturation. However, CD45 encoded by <italic>Ptprc</italic> has also been shown to play an important role in NK cell function, even if the phenotypic and functional consequences of CD45 deficiency are less severe than that of T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Hermiston1">[56]</xref>. Thus, through <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, we attempted to establish which of the affected immune cell populations might be involved in the susceptibility to HSV-1 observed in <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice. First, <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> and heterozygous littermates were infected with HSV-1 before total splenocytes were harvested at day 7 p.i. This step is needed to prime the immune response. These splenocytes were then transferred into either <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> or heterozygous littermates, before these mice were themselves infected with HSV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). As expected, the transfer of total splenocytes from <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> into <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice did not rescue these mutant mice from lethal HSV-1 infection, while <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> mice receiving splenocytes from either <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> or <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice survived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). On the other hand, the same cell transfer from <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> into <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice resulted in a complete HSV-1 protective effect. These results show that transfer of total spleen cells from <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> mice to <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice provide full protection against HSV1 infection. Next, we aimed to establish more precisely which immune cell population(s) is critical for the control of HSV-1 infection. In order to determine the possible role of NK cells in this protection, <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> mice were treated with anti-asialo GM1 antibody, which is known to completely deplete NK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Kasai1">[57]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003637.s004">Figure S4</xref>), and then infected with HSV-1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, the treatment with anti-asialo GM1 antibody had no impact on the survival of <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> mice, suggesting that NK cells do not play a protective role against HSV-1. To distinguish the involvement of B cells from that of T cells in the protection against HSV-1, cells from <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> mice were magnetically sorted and the individual sub-populations transferred into <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice. While the transfer of B cells failed to rescue <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice from lethal infection, the transfer of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells led to total protection against HSV-1 in all <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). To distinguish the relative contribution of CD8<sup>+</sup> from that of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the HSV-1 protective effect, we carried a third set of transfer experiments where <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice were either injected with CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The transfer of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells rescued about 50% of <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice from lethal infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). In contrast to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, the transfer of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells led to a total protection against HSV-1 in almost all (9/10) <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that both the CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are involved in the HSV-1 protective effect, even if the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells appear to be more important than CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, it should be noted that a small proportion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (∼5%) were usually still present after the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell enrichment (data not shown). Thus, to demonstrate the strict dependence of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the CD4-mediated protection against HSV-1, we performed further transfer experiments where CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were purified from <italic>B6.H2-D<sup>b</sup>K<sup>b</sup></italic> knock-out mice, whose <italic>H2-D<sup>b</sup>K<sup>b</sup></italic> make them depleted in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In this condition, transfer of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells failed to rescue <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice from lethal infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). This last result demonstrates that CD4<sup>+</sup>, without CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, are incapable of establishing an efficient immune response against HSV-1. Moreover, <italic>B6.H2-D<sup>b</sup>K<sup>b</sup></italic> knock-out mice were susceptible to lethal HSV-1 i.p. infection (p-value = 0.003) and succumbed around the same time (by day 11–13 p.i.) as <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice infected i.p. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003637.s005">Figure S5</xref>), thus confirming the crucial role of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in protective immunity to HSV-1.</p>

<title>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-secreted IFN-γ mediates CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell entry into the primary site of infection</title>
<p>To better characterize the contribution of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function, we performed additional FACS experiments. <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice were again transferred with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells purified from <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> mice (same proportion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, as mentioned above, were still present after MACS separation, data not shown), and were then infected i.p. with HSV-1. Peritoneal cells, which in this infectious model are the first targets of HSV-1, were collected at days 2 and 7 p.i., gated on CD45.2<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup>, and then analyzed for their CD4 and CD8 expressions. Here, we took advantage of the fact that <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice do not express any CD45 receptors, including the isoform CD45.2 expressed by all leukocytes, to distinguish endogenous from transferred cells in the context of <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> infected mice (PBS injected, positive control) showed about 35.5% of CD45.2<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup> cells in the peritoneal zone at day 2 and 32.7% at day 7 p.i., whereas <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> infected mice (transferred with WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) exhibited 8.21% of CD45.2<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup> at day 2 and 6.6% at day 7 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, left panel). In contrast, <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> infected mice (PBS injected, negative control) as well as those transferred with WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, but non-infected, did not show any T cells, suggesting that the recruitment of T cells to the peritoneal zone is infection-dependent. At day 2 p.i., we observed a high proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (&gt;95% of total CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells) in both <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> (PBS injected) and <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> (transferred with WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) infected mice. At day 7 p.i., however, the frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells raised to 50% in equal proportions to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, indicating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell recruitment to the site of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, right panel). Furthermore, this increased CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proportion perfectly correlated with the viral clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, right panel). Altogether, these results suggest that CD4<sup>+</sup> help in mobilizing effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to the site of infection, which contributes to proper control of the dissemination of HSV-1 into the CNS. Recently, Nakanishi et al. demonstrated the role of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, through their secretion of IFN-γ, in mobilizing effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to local HSV-2 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Nakanishi1">[58]</xref>. Thus, we asked whether CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells could mediate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell recruitment by the action of IFN-γ. To this end, IFN-γ knock-out mice (<italic>IFN-γ<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) were infected, their peritoneal cells were collected at day 7 p.i. and the proportion of CD8<sup>+</sup> relative to the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was compared to infected <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g007">Figure 7C</xref>, <italic>IFN-γ<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice were significantly affected in their CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell recruitment relative to the <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> mice (p-value = 0.01 between <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> and <italic>IFN-γ<sup>−/−</sup></italic> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells). Furthermore, the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell transfer from infected <italic>IFN-γ<sup>−/−</sup></italic> to <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice did not rescue all of these mutant mice from lethal HSV-1 infection, suggesting that IFN-γ production by the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is important, however, not indispensable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003637-g007">Figure 7D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>HSE is a lethal neurological disease resulting from infection with HSV-1. Previous studies have demonstrated a human genetic predisposition to HSE, involving the UNC93B-TLR3-type I IFN pathway in protective immunity to HSV-1. However, these gene mutations exhibit incomplete penetrance and represent only a minority of HSE cases, perhaps reflecting the effects of additional host genetics factors. Therefore, several groups have used mouse forward genetics to identify loci associated with susceptibility/resistance to HSE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-SanchoShimizu2">[21]</xref>. For example, Resistance to Herpes Simplex virus type 1 (Rhs1), a NK complex-linked locus present on chromosome 6, has been shown to be essential for the control of both acute and latent HSV-1 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Pereira1">[59]</xref>. Another locus on the same chromosome, Herpes Resistance Locus (Hrl), has also been identified as a factor influencing HSV-1 infection and HSE pathology in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Lundberg1">[60]</xref>. More recently, a genome-wide linkage study has been performed in rats leading to the identification of the calcitonin receptor as a candidate gene for regulation of susceptibility to HSV-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Abdelmagid1">[61]</xref>. Thus, such <italic>in vivo</italic> approaches have illuminated natural variation in host components that contribute to CNS pathology in response to HSV-1 infection, notably by identifying loci associated with susceptibility/resistance to HSE; but no gene controlling resistance, however, has yet been identified by forward genetics.</p>
<p>In order to identify new genetic and cellular mechanisms involved in HSV-1 and HSE susceptibility, we have implemented the first genome-wide mutagenesis screen in an <italic>in vivo</italic> HSV-1 infectious model. Our high throughput approach allowed for the characterization of sixty-nine mouse pedigrees screened for their susceptibility to HSV-1, leading to the identification of our first susceptible mutant. Whole exome sequencing revealed two mutations, which are localized in the distal region of chromosome 1 (118.6–144.9 Mb) previously identified by linkage analysis. One of these two mutations is a non-synonymous mutation I543F in the <italic>Kcnt2</italic> gene, which encodes for a protein belonging to the voltage-gated potassium channel complex. Based on its high expression in the brain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biogps.gnf.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://biogps.gnf.org/</ext-link>), <italic>Kcnt2</italic> appeared promising, notably in the context of the CNS and viral encephalitis. Moreover, a gain-of-function mutation in the <italic>Kcnt1</italic> gene, a gene whose function is closely related to that of Kcnt2, has been recently associated with a childhood epileptic syndrome called malignant migrating partial seizures in infancy (MMPSI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Barcia1">[62]</xref>. However, and in contrast to the <italic>Ptprc</italic> L3X mutation, the <italic>Kcnt2</italic> I543F mutation is predicted to be benign when analyzed with the PolyPhen-2 database. Nevertheless, additional functional assays would be required to determine if <italic>Kcnt2<sup>I543F</sup></italic> has any role in the infectious process. Indubitably, the large number of immunological mechanisms associated with <italic>Ptprc</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://amigo.geneontology.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://amigo.geneontology.org/</ext-link>) as well as the HSV-1 susceptibility phenotype of <italic>Ptprc<sup>ex9−/−</sup></italic> mice provide strong evidence that <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> is causative of HSV-1 susceptibility observed in the <italic>P43</italic> pedigree.</p>
<p><italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> presents distinctive features compared to other reported mutations within the <italic>Ptprc</italic> gene. First, the <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> null mutation arose on a pure B6 chromosome. Other null mutations have been introduced in ES cells of 129 origin using a neomycine cassette targeting either exon 9 (<italic>Ptprc<sup>ex9−/−</sup></italic>) or exon 12 (<italic>Ptprc<sup>ex12−/−</sup></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Byth1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Mee1">[63]</xref>. Therefore, <italic>ptrpc</italic> mutations in mice <italic>Ptprc<sup>ex9−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Ptprc<sup>ex12−/−</sup></italic> remain surrounded by 129-derived genetic material even after extensive backcrossing to B6. <italic>Ptprc</italic> is embedded in a polymorphic gene-rich chromosomal region that could influence immune, infectious or developmental phenotypes in knock-out mice. In comparable experiments, <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> presents defects very similar to knock-out mice, including severely reduced numbers of T cells due to a defect in the transition from stage of development DN3 to DN4. <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> is a null mutation and represents an excellent complement to two additional ENU-induced alleles, which were previously hypomorphic. <italic>Ptprc<sup>Loc</sup></italic> and <italic>Ptprc<sup>Light</sup></italic> were found in flow cytometric screens for recessive blood cell abnormalities. <italic>Ptprc<sup>Loc</sup></italic> truncates the cytoplasmic domain of most CD45 isoforms but retains about 4% of wild-type CD45 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Wu1">[64]</xref>. <italic>Ptprc<sup>Light</sup></italic> retains 15% of CD45 wild-type expression despite an F503S substitution in the transmembrane domain of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Zikherman1">[65]</xref>. These allelic series in combination with <italic>Ptprc<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice has been used to demonstrate that the level of CD45 expression determines the dual role of CD45 in TCR signaling or T cell maturation. Now, the availability of <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mutant mice should allow a more accurate analysis of the full spectrum of CD45 functions.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that the HSV-1 susceptibility observed in our pedigree was independent of the infection route and was not viral strain-specific, two factors that are the leading causes of disparities observed in different mouse studies for HSV-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-SanchoShimizu2">[21]</xref>. We also report that this phenotype is associated with HSE pathogenesis characterized by a significant viral replication and a dramatic increase in the expression of proinflammatory mediators (MCP1 and IL-6) and enzymes (MMP3 and MMP8) in the brain stems. MCP1 and IL-6 have known implications in leukocyte recruitment and viral clearance in the brain. However, the modulation in their production is crucial to properly control the dissemination of viruses in the CNS without sustaining inflammation, which could result in significant neurological damage including the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is a physical barrier between the peripheral circulation and the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Abbott1">[66]</xref> which contributes to prevent the exacerbation of leukocytes homing into the brain. In experimental mouse models of HSE and human cases, early findings demonstrate that this pathology leads to vascular alterations with disruption of the BBB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-ArsenioNunes1">[67]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-FarkasBargeton1">[68]</xref>. Other viral pathogens, such as human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), human T-cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), West Nile virus (WNV), rabies virus and mouse adenovirus type 1 (MAV-1), are also known to cause BBB disruption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Spindler1">[54]</xref>. In most cases, the BBB damage is caused by indirect effects of viral replication in the CNS with the exception of HIV-1, where Tat, gp120 and Nef viral proteins have been directly involved. When highly expressed, MCP1 alters the actin cytoskeleton and localization of tight junction proteins in the brain endothelium, disrupting the BBB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Stamatovic2">[69]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Stamatovic1">[49]</xref>. Thus, MCP1 has been suggested to be a major determinant of brain damage after infection in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Lundberg2">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Sergerie1">[71]</xref> and its high expression has been also correlated with HSE development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Marques1">[48]</xref>. Likewise, MMP3 and MMP8 are keys mediators of tight junction protein alterations, which degrade extracellular matrix proteins at the BBB leading to its disruption. Although IL-6 is protective against lethal HSV-1 ocular infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-LeBlanc1">[51]</xref>, elevated levels may be neurotoxic and also increase the permeability of the BBB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-LeBlanc1">[51]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Klinman1">[50]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Paul1">[52]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Takeda1">[53]</xref>. The high expression of <italic>MCP1</italic>, <italic>IL-6</italic>, <italic>MMP3</italic> and <italic>MMP8</italic> observed in the brain stems of <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice are comparable to those reported by several studies evaluating the BBB integrity. While further investigations are still required to evaluate neurological damages, in particular the disruption of the BBB, in the brains of <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice, these gene signatures nevertheless highlight the CNS inflammation during HSV-1 infection. Moreover, this demonstrates that our infectious experimental conditions represent a robust model for the identification of host factors that contribute to susceptibility or resistance to HSE. We were also able to establish a significant correlation between the presence of HSV-1 in the brain stems of mutant mice and the expression of <italic>MCP1</italic>, <italic>IL-6</italic>, <italic>MMP3</italic>, and <italic>MMP8</italic>. These last findings suggest that the post-HSV-1 infection mortality observed in this pedigree can be explained by a profound CNS inflammation caused by viral replication in the brain stem.</p>
<p>The first role demonstrated for CD45 was the regulation of T and B cell antigen receptor signaling via dephosphorylation of the Src family kinases (SFKs) Lck and Lyn, respectively (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Hermiston1">[56]</xref>). In this study, we showed that the <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mutation drastically affects not only the early stages of thymocyte development but also the final stage of B cell maturation, consistent with previous studies that have used CD45 knock-out mice (for T cells, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Byth1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Mee1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Kishihara1">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Pingel1">[73]</xref>; for B cells, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Hermiston2">[74]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Benatar1">[76]</xref>). SFKs have been identified as its primary target, but CD45 is now known to also modulate the Janus kinases (Jaks) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-IrieSasaki1">[77]</xref>, as well as TLR signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Cross1">[78]</xref> and NK receptor function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Hesslein1">[79]</xref>. CD45 functions have also been shown in mast cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, as well as in leukocyte adhesion and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Hermiston1">[56]</xref>. While further experiments are still required to fully characterize our mutant in the several immune functions known for CD45, we have strong evidence that deficient T cell function largely contributes to HSV-1 susceptibility in mice. Indeed, we showed that the transfer of total splenocytes from <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X/+</sup></italic> into <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice resulted in a complete HSV-1 protective effect; T cells were the only cell population to fully restore resistance to HSV-1 in the mutants, an effect that requires both the CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>
<p>We also demonstrate that the presence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is a prerequisite for the CD8-mediated full protection against HSV-1. How CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells provide help to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells – during priming, memory and/or mobilizing to the site of infection – remains a pending question, which will require further analysis. The critical role of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cells in the activation of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during the primary response to HSV-1, particularly in cytotoxic T lymphocyte priming, has been already demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Jennings1">[80]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Smith1">[81]</xref>. In this study, we showed that the absence of IFN-γ leads to a partial but not absolute block in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells recruitment to the site of infection, consistent with the survival curve obtained from the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell transfer from <italic>IFN-γ<sup>−/−</sup></italic> to <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice. It should also be noted that the susceptibility of <italic>IFN-γ<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice to HSV-1 is still very controversial, as attested by different reports showing either susceptibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Yu1">[82]</xref> or resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Holterman1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Cantin1">[83]</xref>. Using our infectious experimental conditions, <italic>IFN-γ<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice are resistant to HSV-1 as WT littermates (data not shown). Nevertheless, this finding is not necessarily in contradiction with our current data, but suggest that the only absence of IFN-γ is not sufficient to render resistant mice susceptible to lethal HSV-1 infection. Our findings also correlate with a study demonstrating the critical role of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells after genital HSV-2 infection by timely recruitment of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to the site of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Nakanishi1">[58]</xref>. In this last publication, however, the critical role of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell mobilization to the site of infection for host survival was not established. Collectively, these results could also explain why the CD8<sup>+</sup>, without CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, only protected 50% of infected <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice. Further investigations are needed to determine if other CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset(s) (T regulatory cells, Th2, Th17…), and also which of the Tc1, Tc2 and Tc17 CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subset(s), contribute to rescue of <italic>Ptprc<sup>L3X</sup></italic> mice from lethal HSV-1 infection. While we demonstrate here the critical role of both CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in protective immunity to HSV-1 using an unnatural inoculation route, we can reasonably propose that this adaptive immune mechanism also helps to control HSV-1 and maintain its latency in the CNS, as already been suggested by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Khanna1">[84]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Knickelbein1">[85]</xref>. Thus, future studies to understand the key players in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses and their dependence on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell help should allow the generation of new prophylactic treatments against HSV-1 infection.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, CD45 plays a critical role in NK cell function and is required for protection from cytomegalovirus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Hesslein1">[79]</xref>. In contrast, CD45 deficiency protects mice from the lethal cardiomyopathy caused by Coxsackievirus B3 infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-IrieSasaki1">[77]</xref>. Likewise, others have demonstrated that intermediate levels, but not complete knock-out, of CD45 reduced apoptosis and protected mice from Ebola and <italic>B. anthracis</italic> infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Panchal1">[86]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Panchal2">[87]</xref>. Altogether, while it is known that pathogens elicit divergent immune responses in mammals, our data are consistent with previous reports using phylogenetically distant pathogens whose control converges at CD45-mediated process. However, it remains to be determined if the varied effects of CD45 in the different infectious models reflect the multiple roles of CD45 in the establishment of an efficient immune response against pathogens, as it acts at different levels of both innate and adaptive immunity.</p>
<p>Since the main role of CD45 in lymphocytes is to promote cell activation, genetic alterations may lead to either lymphocyte hyper- or hypo-responsiveness. Thus, most studies performed in humans have focused on polymorphic variants that alter CD45 isoform expression, which are often associated with disease susceptibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Hermiston1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Tchilian1">[88]</xref>. Absence of CD45 is routinely associated with severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). To this day, no mutation in <italic>Ptprc</italic> has been reported in a cohort of patients who suffer from HSE. Nevertheless, our findings do not necessary contradict current human data. One possibility is that <italic>Ptprc</italic> is not subject to specific genetic variation in human HSE, but remains mechanistically important for virus-host interactions. Alternatively, other alterations affecting T cell function could be associated with future human cases of HSE. For example, a strong correlation between decreasing CD4 count and increasing rates of HSV reactivation has been shown in individuals co-infected with HIV and HSV-2, suggesting that reactivation is linked to immunosuppression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Celum1">[89]</xref>. As mentioned in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">introduction</xref> section, an autosomal recessive mutation (called 1757–1758delAG) in the <italic>STAT1</italic> gene was the first genetic etiology for HSE reported in HSV-1 seropositive patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Dupuis1">[13]</xref>. This mutation has been associated with combined deficiencies in IFN-α/β, -λ and -γ signaling pathways since they rely on either STAT1/2 heterodimers (IFN-α/β and -λ) or STAT1 homodimers (IFN-γ). While the cellular phenotype of impaired STAT1 activation by IFN-α/β has been related to HSE susceptibility, we cannot exclude the possibility that an impaired response to IFN-γ in the infants also contributed to this disease, as documented for other viral susceptibilities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Dorman1">[90]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003637-Camcioglu1">[91]</xref>.</p>
<p>In sum, our screen for HSE identified a new CD45 null-allele causing susceptibility to HSV-1 infection. ENU mutagenesis is thus an effective tool for identifying potential causes of HSE. Characterization of susceptibility mutations in additional pedigrees should provide important information to rationalize alternative therapeutic strategies for a devastating, yet potentially preventable, disease.</p>

Efficiently mutagenized G0 males transiently lost and then regained fertility after 13 weeks. They were then out-crossed with B10 female mice to produce G1 offspring: these mice were F1 hybrids carrying one full set of mutagenized chromosomes and one full set of WT chromosomes. Individual G1 males were bred again to B10 females to generate G2 animals. Each G2 daughter inherits 50% of the B6 sequence variants in the G1.
