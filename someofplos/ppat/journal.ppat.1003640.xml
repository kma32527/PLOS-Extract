<abstract>
<p>Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) establishes a lifelong latent infection and causes several malignancies in humans. Murine herpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) is a related γ<sub>2</sub>-herpesvirus frequently used as a model to study the biology of γ-herpesviruses <italic>in vivo</italic>. The KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen (kLANA) and the MHV68 mLANA (orf73) protein are required for latent viral replication and persistence. Latent episomal KSHV genomes and kLANA form nuclear microdomains, termed ‘LANA speckles’, which also contain cellular chromatin proteins, including BRD2 and BRD4, members of the BRD/BET family of chromatin modulators. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of the C-terminal DNA binding domains (CTD) of kLANA and MHV-68 mLANA. While these structures share the overall fold with the EBNA1 protein of Epstein-Barr virus, they differ substantially in their surface characteristics. Opposite to the DNA binding site, both kLANA and mLANA CTD contain a characteristic lysine-rich positively charged surface patch, which appears to be a unique feature of γ<sub>2</sub>-herpesviral LANA proteins. Importantly, kLANA and mLANA CTD dimers undergo higher order oligomerization. Using NMR spectroscopy we identified a specific binding site for the ET domains of BRD2/4 on kLANA. Functional studies employing multiple kLANA mutants indicate that the oligomerization of native kLANA CTD dimers, the characteristic basic patch and the ET binding site on the kLANA surface are required for the formation of kLANA ‘nuclear speckles’ and latent replication. Similarly, the basic patch on mLANA contributes to the establishment of MHV-68 latency in spleen cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. In summary, our data provide a structural basis for the formation of higher order LANA oligomers, which is required for nuclear speckle formation, latent replication and viral persistence.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes Kaposi Sarcoma, Primary Effusion lymphoma and the plasma cell variant of Multicentric Castleman's Disease. Its oncogenic effect is linked to its ability to persist in a latent form for the life time of infected individuals. During latency viral genomes are replicated and passed to daughter cells in synchrony with the infected cell without the formation of new virions. A key viral protein in this process is the latency-associated nuclear antigen, LANA. In latently infected cells, viral genomes and LANA form characteristic nuclear microdomains, termed ‘LANA speckles’, which also contain cellular chromatin components. We have solved the crystal structure of the c-terminal, DNA-binding, domain (CTD) of KSHV LANA (kLANA) and its homologue mLANA of a related murine γ<sub>2</sub>-herpesvirus, which is frequently used as a model to study latent persistence <italic>in vivo</italic>. We also identified the binding site for two chromatin proteins, BRD2/4, by NMR spectroscopy. We demonstrate the functional importance of these structural features, and their contribution to latent replication and ‘LANA speckle’ formation, in cell culture and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. Our results provide a structural basis for the assembly of LANA-containing nuclear structures that are required for latent viral replication and persistence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, also HHV8), the cause of Kaposi Sarcoma and two lymphoid neoplasms, can persist in a latent form in infected endothelial and B-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Schulz1">[1]</xref>. The key player in the regulation of KSHV latency is the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), which is detected in all KSHV infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Dupin1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Rainbow1">[3]</xref> and is required for the latent episomal replication of this virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Garber1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Hu1">[5]</xref>. The terminal repeat (TR) region of KSHV contains 20–40 TR elements, which constitute the latent origin of replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Hu1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Lim1">[6]</xref>. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of LANA forms dimers, which bind two adjacent DNA sequences, the LANA binding sites (LBS1 &amp; LBS2) in a single TR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Garber1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Komatsu1">[7]</xref>. Thus, with respect to DNA binding, LANA resembles other viral origin binding proteins including EBNA-1 of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Rawlins1">[8]</xref> and E2 of human papillomavirus (HPV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Chiang1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Remm1">[10]</xref>. LANA also recruits components of the cellular replication machinery to the KSHV latent origin of replication, thereby allowing the virus to replicate its latent episome in the S phase of the cell cycle along with the cellular chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Ye1">[11]</xref>. It also regulates transcription of both viral <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Garber2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Krithivas1">[13]</xref> and cellular genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-An1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Friborg1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Radkov1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Renne1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Verma1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>In latently infected cells LANA and the viral episomes are concentrated in characteristic nuclear speckles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Rainbow1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Ballestas1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Kedes1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Szekely1">[21]</xref>. To ensure the partitioning of newly synthesized genomes to daughter cells during mitosis LANA tethers KSHV genomes to host mitotic chromosomes by attaching its N-terminal domain to histones H2A/B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Barbera1">[22]</xref>. In addition, the LANA CTD also binds to mitotic chromosomes and interacts with chromatin-associated proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Barbera1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-KelleyClarke1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-KelleyClarke2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Krithivas2">[25]</xref> including members of the BET (Bromodomain and ET domain) family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Ottinger1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Platt1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-You1">[28]</xref>. Increasing evidence points to an important role of BET family members in the life cycle of several DNA tumor virus families. BRD4 has been shown to be involved in the tethering of bovine papillomavirus E2 protein and associated episomal viral DNA to host mitotic chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-You2">[29]</xref>. Moreover the human papillomavirus (HPV) E2 proteins act as transcriptional regulators, and this function also involves BRD4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Lee1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-McPhillips1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Schweiger1">[32]</xref>. In addition, BRD4 has also been implicated in the latent replication of Merkel cell polyoma virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Wang1">[33]</xref>. For LANA, there is evidence that BRD4 contributes to the recruitment of this protein to chromatin and to its transcriptional properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Ottinger1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-You1">[28]</xref> while BRD2 may also affect the role of LANA as a transcriptional activator and is able to phosphorylate the LANA CTD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Platt1">[27]</xref>. Thus, BET proteins play a pivotal role in the life cycles of multiple dsDNA viruses that cause latent infections in the host.</p>
<p>Murine herpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) is a γ2-herpesvirus, which provides an <italic>in vivo</italic> model for the study of KSHV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Simas1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Speck1">[35]</xref>. The open reading frame 73 (orf73) of MHV-68 encodes mLANA, which is distantly related to KSHV LANA (in the following referred to as kLANA). Similarly to kLANA, mLANA binds to specific sites within the TR region of the MHV-68 genome, is required for the latent replication and for establishment of latency in splenic B-cells <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Fowler1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Habison1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Moorman1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Paden1">[39]</xref>. The ability of mLANA to act as a transcriptional activator may be linked to its recruitment of BRD2 or BRD4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Ottinger2">[40]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we report the crystal structures of both kLANA and mLANA CTDs. Both structures display unexpected features. We show that LANA dimers form oligomers and that chromatin associated BET proteins bind two sites on kLANA. Both LANA oligomerization and BET binding contribute to latent replication, nuclear speckle formation and persistence of γ2-herpesvirses, <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>The 3D Structures of KSHV and MHV-68 LANA C-Terminal Domains</title>
<p>The structure of the kLANA fragment comprising residues 1013–1149 was solved by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 2.60 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref>), where electron density was observed for residues 1014–1147. kLANA(1013–1149) forms dimers that are stabilized by an eight-stranded antiparallel intermolecular β-barrel to which each monomer contributes four β-strands (β1–β4). In addition to the stabilization by the hydrogen bonding network of the β-barrel, hydrophobic amino acid side chains project into the core and form a tightly packed hydrophobic cluster. The total dimer interface area is 2080 Å<sup>2</sup> indicating that LANA is an obligate dimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Ponstingl1">[41]</xref>. Strand β2 contains a β-bulge, which lies directly above a cluster of six water molecules that are observed in the electron density map (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). These form a hydrogen bonding network with the amino acid side chains Y1103 and Y1105 that are also part of the dimer interface. The β-barrel is flanked by two α helices, α2 and α3. The N-terminal helix, α1, is packed against the two other helices and is not in direct contact with the central β-barrel.</p>

<p>We also solved the crystal structure of a C-terminal fragment of MHV-68 LANA, mLANA(124–260), at a resolution of 2.14 Å, where a detailed structure was obtained for residues 130–260 (Figures S1B,C). It also is a native dimer, and the fold is very well conserved with kLANA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, the two LANA structures share the same fold with the 3D structures of the dimeric DNA binding domains of Epstein-Barr virus' EBNA-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Bochkarev1">[42]</xref> and papillomavirus E2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Hegde1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Hegde2">[44]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g001">Figures 1D,E</xref>), even though the corresponding sequence identities are only 16% and 10%, respectively (Figures S1D,E). However, the structured CTDs of kLANA and mLANA share 28% sequence identity and the root-mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of the peptide backbone is only 2.2 Å. The r.m.s.d. between the CTDs of kLANA and EBNA-1 of 3.1 Å is significantly larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Between the two LANAs, the regions of highest structural conservation contain the entire β-barrel and the helices α2 and α3.</p>
<p>Several amino acid residues of kLANA have previously been identified to be crucial for specific viral DNA binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-KelleyClarke2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Han1">[45]</xref>. These are all located on the bottom part of the LANA CTDs as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g001">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s001">S1C</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s004">Figure S4C</xref>). For example, the peptide segment PYG at position 1065–1067 of kLANA forms a solvent accessible epitope at the beginning of helix α2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). As shown previously, substitution of these three residues to alanines abolishes binding of LANA to the LBS sites in the KSHV TR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-KelleyClarke2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Han1">[45]</xref>. We confirmed this finding by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using a dsDNA oligonucleotide probe containing LBS1 and LBS2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s001">Figure S1F</xref>). We additionally tested the single point mutants S1086A and S1086E which remove a single OH group, or add a single negative charge in the center of the expected DNA binding site, respectively. As expected, S1086E strongly reduced specific DNA binding and therefore also impaired latent replication, whereas S1086A had no effect on either of these functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s001">Figure S1F</xref>,G). Thus, consistent with the previously reported EBNA-1:DNA complex structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Bochkarev1">[42]</xref>, our findings demonstrate that the ‘bottom’ face of the kLANA CTD mediates the specific binding to LBS1/2 in the TR region of the KSHV genome.</p>

<p>During our crystallization trials, we obtained three different crystal forms of the kLANA CTD, all of which contained higher order oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s005">Table S1</xref>). The monoclinic and orthorhombic crystals of the kLANA CTD contained pentameric rings of dimers, whereas the cubic crystals contained tetrameric rings of dimers. Also mLANA CTD was observed to self-associate laterally where the dimers were arranged as linear chains. In all structures the oligomerization interfaces are formed by helices α1 and α3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), and the interface comprises an area of approx. 500 Å<sup>2</sup>. In kLANA, the interface is mostly hydrophobic, whereas it has a more hydrophilic character in mLANA. While it was previously suggested that LANA might form native higher order oligomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Komatsu1">[7]</xref>, no equivalent intermolecular contacts were observed in any of the previously described crystal structures of EBNA-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Bochkarev1">[42]</xref>. We thus explored if the observed LANA oligomerization interfaces are functionally important and also mediate LANA self-association <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<p>We first determined the oligomerization state of recombinant kLANA(1013–1149) and mLANA(124–260) in solution. Separation of LANA CTD species by asymmetric field flow fractionation and multi-angle static light scattering showed that the purified CTDs exist mostly as dimers of 31–32 kDa in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). No monomers were observed. In order to investigate the potential existence of oligomers of LANA dimers under more physiological conditions, recombinant, immobilized GST-fused kLANA(934–1162) was incubated with extracts of eukaryotic cells containing transfected full-length (FL) kLANA(1–1162). The interaction of the two LANA proteins, indicative of self-association, could readily be detected for wt kLANA. The substitution M1117D reduced and the substitution A1121E abolished kLANA oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). While LBS binding was comparable to wt kLANA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), all lateral association mutants proved to be defective in their ability to replicate a plasmid containing four TR elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Notably, the lateral self-association of kLANA dimers appears to be independent of specific DNA binding, since kLANA CTD mutants defective in DNA binding are capable of self-association (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s001">Figure S1H</xref>). Thus, self-association of kLANA dimers <italic>via</italic> intermolecular side chain contacts between helices α1 and α3 is a prerequisite for the latent replication.</p>

<title>Specific Interaction between LANA and ET Domains</title>
<p>We and others have previously shown that the ET domains of BRD2 and of BRD4 interact with kLANA and mLANA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Ottinger1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Platt1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-You1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Ottinger2">[40]</xref>. In order to determine the specific interaction sites in the kLANA CTD and the ET domains of BRD2 and BRD4, we performed chemical shift perturbation experiments by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. [<sup>2</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N]-labeled kLANA(1013–1149) yielded a well dispersed [<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N]-TROSY spectrum that is characteristic of a folded globular protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). When we added unlabeled BRD4 ET(600–680) to [<sup>2</sup>H,<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N]-labeled kLANA(1013–1149), only some of the kLANA resonances shifted significantly in an ET domain concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The detailed quantification of the chemical shift perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) revealed the kLANA peptide segment 1125–1129 at the C-terminal end of helix α3 to be most affected, and there were no significant alternative epitopes identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, right). Thus, BRD4 ET(600–680) binds to a single site on the kLANA CTD surface.</p>

<p>In order to identify the binding site for the kLANA CTD on the ET domains of BRD2/4, we performed the complementary experiment. [<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N]-TROSY spectra of either [<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N]-labeled BRD2 ET(632–713) or BRD4 ET(600–680) were recorded in the absence and in the presence of unlabeled kLANA(996–1153) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g003">Figures 3D,E</xref>). The ET:kLANA interaction strongly depends on charge, which is evident from the ionic strength dependent chemical shift perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). The NMR line-broadening follows the same trend for all observed peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), which suggests an overall increasing particle size upon strong ET:kLANA association. The most affected backbone amide groups in the BRD4 ET domain comprise R616, S619 and E653–E657 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, top). The interaction with BRD2 ET(632–713) was observed to be virtually identical and to affect the corresponding amino acids R648, S651 and E685–E689 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, bottom). When mapped onto the surface of the globular ET domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Lin1">[46]</xref>, all of these affected amino acids are contiguous and form a single epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, left). Thus, the kLANA CTD binds at a single site on surfaces of BRD2/4 ET domains.</p>
<p>In order to confirm the binding site for kLANA on the ET domain we generated mutations in the ET domain of FL GFP-BRD2 and tested them in co-immunoprecipitation experiments with FL wt kLANA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The alanine substitution of any one of the negatively charged amino acids contained in the peptide segment BRD2-ET(682–687) resulted in the complete loss of kLANA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistent with our NMR data showing ionic strength-dependence of kLANA:ET binding, this result confirms the importance of electrostatic forces in this interaction. The F688Y substitution also abolished binding to kLANA. The substitution of S651 to any larger amino acid severely reduced the interaction with kLANA presumably by steric effects that appear to dominate there. Only the R648A and E689A substitutions appeared not to affect kLANA binding. Thus, most amino acid substitutions in the vicinity of the kLANA binding epitope of BRD2 ET reduced or abolished binding, confirming the interaction site as identified by NMR.</p>

<p>We also generated a panel of mutants of FL kLANA and tested them in a co-immunoprecipitation assay with GFP-tagged BRD2 and BRD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The kLANA R1119M substitution impaired binding of the ET domains of both BET proteins. R1119 forms a positive charge at the bottom of a cleft, which is occupied by anions in the kLANA crystals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). The substitution at this position might thus abolish anion binding, rearrange the adjacent peptide segment 1125–1129 and reduce ET binding. The substitutions P1127R had no significant effect on ET binding, while the mutations H1126E and to a lesser degree L1128D, enhanced BET protein binding. The results were similar for BRD2 and BRD4 suggesting that the mode of interaction is virtually identical for both proteins. We next compared the binding of these kLANA mutants to FL BRD2, the BRD2 ET domain alone (ET: aa640-719) or the entire C-terminal domain of BRD2 (CT: aa640-801). We found that the binding of the BRD2-ET to LANA was much more susceptible to the LANA substitutions H1126E, L1128D, R1119M then binding of the FL BRD2 or the BRD2-CT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). This result indicates that, while the ET domain binds to the kLANA region defined by aa 1125–1129, an additional contact point may exist in the BRD2 C-terminal domain or FL BRD2 (see also below).</p>
<p>To further delineate regions in kLANA that contribute to its interaction with BET proteins, four double-point charge inversion substitutions were selected in a reasonable radius around the peptide segment 1125–1129 of the kLANA CTD. The mutants were tested for their ability to induce specific chemical shift perturbations in <sup>15</sup>N-labeled BRD4-ET(600–680) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). The substitutions KK(1113–1114)EE and KK(1140–1141)EE did not disrupt binding, but the substitutions KAR(1030–1032)EAE and KK(1069–1070)EE, located at the ‘bottom’ of the LANA structure that mediates the specific binding to viral DNA (see above) led to significant impairment. Based on these data we performed <italic>in silico</italic> docking of the globular ET domain to kLANA using ‘Rosetta Dock’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Lyskov1">[47]</xref>. Two global orientations of BRD2 ET(632-713) relative to kLANA(1013–1149) displayed comparably low energy scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). In both models, F688 of BRD2 ET was placed near the N-terminus of helix α2 of kLANA. In model I, the acidic peptide segment of residues 682–689 in BRD2 ET is placed in the basic cleft of kLANA right underneath the peptide segment 1125–1129. In model II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s002">S2D</xref>), BRD2 ET is rotated by 180° relative to model I. Notably, in our NMR study we initially observed particularly strong chemical shift perturbations only at low salt concentrations in the segment 643–647 of BRD4 ET(600–680), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). This structural element of ET forms a surface exposed loop between helix α2 and the major LANA binding epitope of ET. Since LANA is a dimer, two ET domains can bind to it. However this only occurs to a significant degree at low salt concentrations, when electrostatic interaction is strong. In model II this would lead to cooperative self-interactions at the above-mentioned segment of ET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s002">S2D</xref>). Thus, only the second model is supported by the observed salt-dependent NMR chemical shift perturbations and is also in better overall agreement with the corresponding mutagenesis data.</p>
<p>We next investigated how the ET binding site in the kLANA CTD contributes to kLANA's functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g004">Figure 4E, F</xref>). All mutants in the ET binding site, except for P1127R, were incapable of replicating a plasmid carrying 4 TR elements in transiently transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). With the exception of K1070E all mutants were still able to bind LBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). The ability of kLANA ET binding site mutants to oligomerize was comparable to wt kLANA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s002">Figure S2E</xref>). Thus, several of the kLANA residues whose NMR resonances shift in response to ET domain binding are required for successful latent episomal replication without affecting the binding to the viral latent origin of replication or kLANA oligomerization.</p>

<title>The ‘Basic Top’ in LANA Function</title>
<p>Although the fold of the two γ2-herpesviral LANA CTDs is closely similar to that of the γ1-herpesviral EBNA-1, their surface charge at the face opposing the specific DNA binding site is inverted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The conservation of the basic, lysine-rich patch in the top surfaces of both kLANA and mLANA may indicate an important, conserved function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s004">Figure S4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s001">S1D</xref>). Indeed, the alanine substitution of two single lysine side chains K1109 and K1138 severely reduced both BRD2 and BRD4 binding, while the double substitution K1109A/K1138A completely abolished it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). While the substitutions K1055A and K1113A did not significantly affect BRD4 binding, they abolished BRD2 binding by kLANA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). As we already mapped a specific ET domain interaction to the 1125–1129 epitope in kLANA, this result suggested that a second significant interaction site between LANA CTD and BET proteins exists.</p>

<p>An amino acid sequence alignment of the BRD2/4 ET domains including their C-terminally adjacent sequence elements pointed to an acidic, serine-rich stretch as a candidate for this interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). In order to test this hypothesis, a range of N- and C-terminally truncated fragments of BRD2(640–801) was generated and assayed for their capability to interact with FL kLANA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). Binding of BRD2(640–801) was very strong, while the fragment BRD2(720–801), which lacks the globular ET domain, did not bind kLANA. Likewise, the fragment BRD2(640–773), which only lacks the serine-rich sequence element, was severely impaired in kLANA binding. Using NMR spectroscopy, we observed that the <sup>15</sup>N-labeled BRD4(600–722), which contains the ET domain and the C-terminal serine-rich peptide, behaves closely similar to <sup>15</sup>N-BRD4-ET(600–680) in solution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s003">Figure S3D</xref>). However, when kLANA(996–1153) was added, resonances broadened substantially and the spectrum of BRD4(600–722) nearly disappeared, indicating a substantially increased particle size and strong binding. This effect was considerably milder when kLANA(996–1153) was added to <sup>15</sup>N-labeled ET fragments lacking the serine stretch. Thus, two independent experimental approaches show that the serine-rich acidic sequence of BRD2/4 strongly enhances kLANA interactions with BRD2/4.</p>
<p>In order to further understand the role of the kLANA ‘basic top’, we tested mutants of this area with respect to other LANA functions. The pull down of full-length LANA with a GST-fused LANA CTD was impaired by lysine to alanine substitutions in this region. In particular, K1109A/K1138A severely reduced kLANA oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). None of these lysine to alanine replacements affected binding to LBS DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). However, in the transient replication assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) the double mutant (K1109A/K1138A) showed a consistently reduced ability to replicate latent viral DNA, while the corresponding single substitutions had no significant effect.</p>
<p>We have previously shown that residues 228–231 (KKLK), which are located on the basic surface of mLANA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g005">Figure 5E</xref>), influence the interactions with BRD2 and BRD4, and affect mLANA-mediated transcriptional activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Ottinger2">[40]</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). In order to assess the functional role of this basic surface element <italic>in vivo</italic>, we inserted this mLANA mutant into a recombinant MHV-68 genome cloned into a bacterial artificial chromosome. Mutant and revertant viruses were then used to infect mice intranasally and compared to a previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Fowler1">[36]</xref> mLANA deletion mutant (‘73-STOP’) and its revertant. The 228–231 4A mutant replicated normally in tissue culture (not shown). On day 6 after intranasal infection, this mutant replicated to wt levels in the lungs of infected mice (not shown). However, on day 17 after infection, when MHV-68 latency had been established, the 4A mutant showed a pronounced reduction of viral genome copy numbers in spleen cells approaching the phenotype seen with the mLANA deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). In a reactivation assay with latently infected splenocytes plated on a susceptible cell line, even high numbers of splenocytes failed to yield reactivatable virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). Based on these data, we conclude that the ‘basic top’, common to kLANA and mLANA proteins, plays an important role in the interaction with the BET proteins and contributes to latent replication/persistence.</p>

<title>The Contribution of LANA CTD Surfaces to Nuclear ‘Speckle’ Formation</title>
<p>One of the characteristic features of kLANA is the formation of nuclear micro-domains (‘speckles’) in latently infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Rainbow1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Kedes2">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Simpson1">[49]</xref>. The viral genomes colocalize with LANA in these speckles, and the presence of the KSHV TR region, which contains the LBS sites, is required for their assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Ballestas1">[19]</xref>. We tested a selection of the kLANA mutants described above for their ability to form nuclear speckles in the presence of a TR containing plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The FL wt kLANA protein formed many distinct speckles in most of the transfected cells, while the LBS binding deficient PYG(1065–1067)AAA mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s001">Figure S1F</xref>), showed a diffuse nuclear localization, indicating that specific viral DNA binding is a prerequisite for kLANA speckle assembly. Also the kLANA mutant A1121E, defective in self-association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g002">Figure 2</xref>), did not form nuclear speckles suggesting a crucial role of inter-dimer interactions between helices α1 and α3 in this process. Individual substitutions of lysine residues on the ‘basic top’ of kLANA did not result in a loss of speckles, while the double mutant K1109A/K1138A showed an impairment of speckle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>). This indicates that also the ‘basic top’ contributes to higher order oligomerization of LANA <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, mutants K1070E, R1119M and H1126E localized near the ET binding site were compromised in speckle formation, while the surface exposed residues P1127 and L1128 did not significantly affect this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Overall, the sites for viral DNA binding, self-association of kLANA dimers, and residues near a binding site for chromatin-associated BRD2/4 proteins are required for formation of the characteristic kLANA nuclear speckles.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we solved the 3D structures of kLANA CTD and mLANA CTD. They share the overall fold with the origin binding proteins of Epstein-Barr virus, EBNA-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Bochkarev1">[42]</xref> and of human papillomavirus, E2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Hegde1">[43]</xref>. However, their surface characteristics are substantially distinct from EBNA-1 and E2, which provided the basis for a specific functional annotation of three faces in the CTDs of kLANA and mLANA (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s006">Table S2</xref>).</p>
<p>The self-association of LANA CTDs observed in both kLANA and mLANA crystals represents a key characteristic feature of these proteins. In all crystals, the inter-dimer interactions were mediated by helices α1 and α3. The angles between two neighboring LANA dimers range from 0° for mLANA, 72° for the kLANA pentameric rings to 90° for the kLANA tetrameric ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Moreover, both pentameric ring structures of kLANA dimers display ring puckering, where the interface between two dimers is oriented out of the ring plane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). This provides direct crystallographic evidence that the interface between LANA dimers is generally compatible with a range of relative LANA dimer orientations. Due to the hinge-like character of the inter-dimer interface, <italic>in vivo</italic> native LANA oligomers might differ in shape from the closed ring structures or the linear chain observed in the respective crystals.</p>
<p>EBNA-1 dimers physically link target viral DNA sites <italic>via</italic> their linking domains that are distinct from the DNA binding domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-AvolioHunter1">[50]</xref>. The ability of EBNA-1 to self-associate through disparate domains was shown to be important for its function in viral replication and transcriptional control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Mackey1">[51]</xref>. In contrast to EBNA-1, self-association of LANA appears to be mediated by its C-terminal DNA binding domain.</p>
<p>kLANA binds cooperatively to LBS1 and LBS2 within the KSHV TR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Garber1">[4]</xref>. DNA bending has been proposed to be a prerequisite for the initiation of DNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Koepsel1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Stenzel1">[53]</xref> and a LBS1/2 containing probe was previously shown to be bent by ∼110° when both sites were occupied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Wong1">[54]</xref>. Two adjacent kLANA dimers in our monoclinic crystals are perfectly oriented to bind and bend LBS1/2 to this extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g002">Figures 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s004">S4A</xref>). While our oligomerization mutants of kLANA (M1117D and A1121E) could still bind DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) they were not able to promote KSHV episome replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Consequently, kLANA inter-dimer interactions may contribute to KSHV latent replication through their impact on DNA bending.</p>
<p>On the other hand, self-association of kLANA dimers appears to be functionally important beyond the bending of viral DNA, because mutations that disrupt the inter-dimer interface also abolish the formation of the characteristic nuclear kLANA speckles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found that also the positively charged ‘top’ of the kLANA CTD contributes to speckle formation. In particular the double mutant K1109A/K1138A, which removes four positive charges per kLANA dimer, shows reduced oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) and speckle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Although this mutant was not impaired in LBS binding, it showed a reduced capacity to replicate a TR containing plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g005">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Likewise, the mLANA 4A mutant was incapable of establishing latency in the spleens of infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g005">Figures 5G,H</xref>). Thus, interaction partners other than LBS1/2 appear to significantly enhance LANA speckle formation <italic>via</italic> the ‘basic top’, which appears to be generally required for latent replication/persistence.</p>
<p>We found that the binding of BET proteins to kLANA occurs <italic>via</italic> two distinct sequence elements of BRD2/4. In addition to the interaction of the serine-rich stretch of BET proteins with the ‘basic top’ of LANA CTD, their globular ET domain binds near residues 1125–1129 of kLANA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s004">S4C</xref>). Both interactions are required for strong LANA:BET binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). The serine-rich tails of BET proteins might interact with neighboring LANA dimers, which would stabilize LANA oligomers. This interaction may therefore promote the oligomerization of LANA CTDs and consequently the formation of nuclear speckles.</p>
<p>In solution, the kLANA and mLANA CTDs exist as isolated dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) suggesting that other interaction partners of LANA might be required to shift the equilibrium towards higher order LANA oligomers in order to promote speckle formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, for sterical reasons pairs of LBS1/2-bound kLANA dimers could not oligomerize directly, but would require at least one more bridging dimer between them. Interaction of such LBS-free LANA dimers with LBS-bound dimers could be enhanced by other binding partners like the BET proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g007">Figure 7</xref>). While the present data do not allow final conclusions, we are tempted to speculate that LANA speckles contain LANA oligomers that are stabilized by interactions with (i) LBS DNA, (ii) BET proteins, and potentially (iii) other interaction partners of FL LANA. Such a scenario is consistent with our observations, and it would allow tethering many TR-repeats into a single nuclear speckle.</p>

<p>Our NMR data place the ET domain binding site and the viral episome binding site in very close proximity on the kLANA surface, which makes the simultaneous binding of LBS and ET on the same kLANA dimer unlikely due to sterical hindrance. However, it is well established that viral episomes and BET proteins colocalize with the LANA speckles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-You1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Mattsson1">[55]</xref>. This can be reconciled in a model that envisages viral DNA and BET proteins interacting with distinct kLANA molecules that are present in the same oligomeric aggregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g007">Figure 7</xref>). It appears possible that in addition to the acidic serine-rich sequence element of the BET proteins, also other acidic factors might stabilize kLANA oligomers by interactions with its ‘basic top’. Candidates would also include kLANA's own acidic internal repeat region or the phosphate backbone of DNA molecules. kLANA has been shown to interact also with other host chromatin proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Ye1">[11]</xref> and thus it is conceivable that further contributors to kLANA oligomerization exist. Overall, kLANA CTD oligomerization could allow the alternative occupation of overlapping binding sites on different LANA molecules in the nuclear speckles.</p>
<p>The N-terminal residues 5–13 of kLANA are required for chromatin association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Barbera1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Krithivas2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Piolot1">[56]</xref> and latent replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Lim2">[57]</xref>. A chromatin binding domain has also been identified in the kLANA CTD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-KelleyClarke1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-KelleyClarke2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-ViejoBorbolla1">[58]</xref>. Previous studies found that multiple alanine substitutions near residues 1125–1129 of the kLANA CTD abolish its association with the mitotic chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-KelleyClarke1">[23]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003640.s004">Figure S4C</xref>). We found that BET proteins, known to associate with mitotic chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-GarciaGutierrez1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Kanno1">[60]</xref>, interact with this part of kLANA CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g003">Figure 3A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g004">4B</xref>) and could therefore contribute to interactions between the kLANA CTD and host chromosomes. Most of our kLANA mutants targeting the ET domain binding site were impaired in latent replication/persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) and kLANA speckle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003640-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, in addition to LBS DNA binding and kLANA oligomerization, kLANA chromatin association through BET proteins could be a third essential factor for KSHV persistence.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our structural and functional data revealed kLANA oligomerization <italic>via</italic> its CTD as an Achilles' heel of this γ2-herpesvirus. A single point mutation at the critical kLANA interface has the potential to abolish KSHV persistence and thus provides a possible antiviral target. In addition, the promotion of kLANA oligomerization by host protein contributors may provide further points of interference to compromise latent viral replication, and thereby prevent human diseases that are caused by persistent KSHV infections.</p>

The initial model was then completed through iterative steps of manual building in Coot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Emsley1">[63]</xref> and refinement against a high-resolution native dataset of monoclinic KSHV LANA(1013-1149) that had been corrected for anisotropic diffraction using the anisotropy correction server <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Strong1">[64]</xref>. The datasets of orthorhombic and cubic KSHV LANA fragments as well as MHV-68 LANA(124-260) were phased by molecular replacement (MR) with Phenix.auto_mr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Adams1">[62]</xref> using a monomer of monoclinic KSHV LANA(1013-1149) as search model. The search model for MHV-68 LANA(124-260) was modified prior to MR by pruning non-conserved residues to account for structural differences arising from its low sequence identity with KSHV LANA. For orthorhombic and cubic KSHV LANA fragments, placed models instantly resulted good electron density maps and could be pursued with refinement. For MHV-68 LANA(124-260), however, the placed model had first to be improved by alternate rebuilding and relaxation with phenix.mr_rosetta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-DiMaio1">[65]</xref>. Refinement was carried out for all structures in Phenix.refine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003640-Adams1">[62]</xref> with restraints on bond lengths, bond angles, planarities, and chirality. Atomic B-factors were treated as being isotropic while the presence of anisotropic domain motion was acknowledged by performing TLS refinement.

The extracts were sonicated 3×10 s, cell debris was pelleted and the lysates were pre-cleared with Protein A/G beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4°C on a rolling platform. Protein A (for anti-GFP IP) or Protein G (for anti-HA IP) beads were incubated with rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Clontech) or rat anti-HA antibody (Roche) respectively, the incubation was performed overnight at 4°C on a rolling platform. Subsequently, the antibody conjugated beads were washed 3 times with 500 µl of respective lysis buffer. 20 µg (for anti-GFP) and 200 µg (for anti-HA) antibody was bound to 80 µl of Protein A beads (anti-GFP) or 100 µl of Protein G beads (anti-HA). Antibody conjugated beads were aliquoted, 15 µl per IP and 250 µl of cell extract was added per sample and incubated overnight at 4°C on a rolling platform.

GST-LANA CTD (wt and mutant) beads were prepared ahead of time. 2 ml overnight bacterial culture were diluted 1∶10 and grown until the OD600 = 1.5 was reached, at which point GST-LANA CTD fusion protein expression was induced by adding IPTG (1 mM final concentration) and incubating the cultures for 4 h at 30°C. Subsequently, the cultures were spun down, resuspended in PBS with 0.5% NP40 and protease inhibitors and sonicated 3×30 sec on ice. The spin was repeated and 100 µl of 50% glutathione sepharose bead slurry, previously washed three times with wash buffer (PBS, 0.5% NP40, protease inhibitors and 5% glycerol), were added per sample and incubated overnight, while rolling at 4°C. Next, the GST fusion protein coupled beads were washed three times with wash buffer. The amount of each protein bound to 10 µl beads was estimated based on a Coomassie stain of an SDS PAGE gel and was then adjusted accordingly. After cell lysates were added to GST fusion protein coupled beads the binding reactions were incubated 3 h at 4°C on a rolling platform and subsequently washed six times with wash buffer. After adding 5 µl of loading buffer, beads were boiled and the supernatants were loaded on to a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (8%) separated and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane.

Alternatively, pTR1 and pBluescript were transfected as the replicon and the non-replicating control respectively. 72 h later cells were harvested in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 0.6% SDS). The chromosomal DNA was precipitated overnight with 0.85M NaCl and pelleted. The episomal DNA was purified using phenol-chlorophorm extraction and the Gel lock columns (5PRIME), precipitated with ethanol and the pellet was dissolved in 20 µl of water. 90% of DNA was digested for 72 h with 60 U of MfeI HF (or KpnI) (NEB) and 60 U DpnI (NEB) and the remaining 10% with 40 U MfeI HF (or KpnI) only. The MfeI (KpnI) enzyme linearizes the pGTR4 (pTR1) as well as pEGFP-C1 (pBluescript) vectors. The MfeI (KpnI)/DpnI digestion reveals the efficiency of replication, while the single MfeI (KpnI) digestion is used to estimate the amount of input DNA. Digested DNA was loaded and separated on a 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by Southern blotting. A sequence coding for GFP (for the pGTR4 and pEGFP) or fragment of pBluescript vector sequence (for the TR1 and pBluescript), labeled with alkaline phosphatase was used as a probe to detect the bands of interest.

Clumped nuclei were distinguished based on the shape. Next the GFP positive cells (transfected with pGTR4, which expresses GFP) were identified using the Otsu Global thresholding method distinguishing clumped cells based on intensity. Nuclei were masked with the identified GFP positive cells. Subsequently, LANA signal was masked with the nuclei of the GFP positive cells, allowing further analysis only on LANA signal from the GFP positive (and therefore also TR positive) nuclei. LANA speckles were then identified using Robust Background per object thresholding method. Clumped objects were distinguished based on intensity. Using the “Relate Objects” function we established a parent-child relationship between the LANA speckles (“children”) and the nuclei (“parents”) in order to determine the speckle number per nucleus.

Acidic residues are red and basic residues are blue, serines are in boldface. <bold>C</bold>: kLANA was co-immunoprecipitated with GFP tagged BRD2 full length (FL), a C-terminal BRD2 fragment (CT), and deletion mutants thereof (a–g). Panel I: Immunoblot of co-IP samples with αLANA antibody showing the interaction. Panel II: Expression of the GFP tagged BRD2 proteins. Panel III: Expression of LANA. The analysis demonstrates that the globular ET domain is required and sufficient for specific binding to LANA (fragment ‘a’). The acidic serine-rich stretch increases binding affinity significantly (compare fragment CT with fragments ‘e’, ‘f’, ‘g’), but does not specifically bind to LANA when isolated from a functional ET domain (fragments ‘b’ and ‘c’). Fragment ‘d’ likely suffers from stability problems since helix α3 is truncated. <bold>D</bold>: Top: BRD4 ET domain fragments used in this study for NMR spectroscopy. Below: [<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N]-HSQC spectra of each 0.25 mM BRD4 fragments in the absence (black) and presence (orange) of 0.25 mM unlabeled kLANA CTD at 100 mM NaCl. BRD4(600-722) includes the acidic serine-rich stretch (top), whereas BRD4(608-680) does not (below). For the latter, moderate peak broadening and chemical shift perturbations are indicative of binding. However, when the acidic serine-stretch is included, massive peak broadening leads to loss of all resonances of the globular ET domain (top). Only resonances of flexible residues remain. This indicates formation of a large stable complex.</p>
