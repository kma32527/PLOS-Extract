<abstract>
<p>Infection of host tissues by <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> requires an unusual family of staphylococcal adhesive proteins that contain long stretches of serine-aspartate dipeptide-repeats (SDR). The prototype member of this family is clumping factor A (ClfA), a key virulence factor that mediates adhesion to host tissues by binding to extracellular matrix proteins such as fibrinogen. However, the biological siginificance of the SDR-domain and its implication for pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we identified two novel bacterial glycosyltransferases, SdgA and SdgB, which modify all SDR-proteins in these two bacterial species. Genetic and biochemical data demonstrated that these two glycosyltransferases directly bind and covalently link N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties to the SDR-domain in a step-wise manner, with SdgB appending the sugar residues proximal to the target Ser-Asp repeats, followed by additional modification by SdgA. GlcNAc-modification of SDR-proteins by SdgB creates an immunodominant epitope for highly opsonic human antibodies, which represent up to 1% of total human IgG. Deletion of these glycosyltransferases renders SDR-proteins vulnerable to proteolysis by human neutrophil-derived cathepsin G. Thus, SdgA and SdgB glycosylate staphylococcal SDR-proteins, which protects them against host proteolytic activity, and yet generates major eptopes for the human anti-staphylococcal antibody response, which may represent an ongoing competition between host and pathogen.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> are major bacterial pathogens that can cause life-threatening human diseases. Following entry into the circulation, <italic>S.aureus</italic> can infect virtually any organ. However, it must first counter antibacterial mechanisms of the innate immune system, including those involving macrophages and neutrophils. Important for staphylococcal adhesion to and successful colonization of host tissues, is a family of bacterial surface proteins containing multiple repeats of serine-aspartate repeats (SDR) adjacent to an adhesive A-domain. The biological functions of the SDR-domain of these SDR proteins remain elusive. We found that the SDR-domain of all staphylococcal SDR proteins is heavily glycosylated. We identified two novel glycosylases, SdgA and SdgB, which are responsible for glycosylation in two steps, and found that this glycosylation protects the adhesive SDR proteins against proteolytic attack by human neutrophil cathepin G. Since pathogen binding to human tissues, including the extracellular matrix protein fibrinogen, depends on SDR proteins, this glycosylation may be important for successful colonization of the human host. We also show that the SdgB-mediated glycosylation creates an immunodominant epitope for highly opsonic antibodies in humans. These antibodies account for a significant proportion of the total anti-staphylococcal IgG response.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> are successful human commensals that primarily colonize the nares and skin. <italic>S. aureus</italic> can also invade a variety of tissues, leading to life-threatening infections. Recently emerged strains of <italic>S. aureus</italic> show increased virulence and enhanced ability to cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals. In addition, the recent development of resistance to antibiotics, in particular methicillin, have made <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections more difficult to treat. Currently, the most prevalent and most virulent clinical strain of methicillin resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) is USA300, which has the capacity to produce a large number of virulence factors and cause mortality in infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Chambers1">[1]</xref>. <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, which is closely related to <italic>S. aureus</italic>, is often associated with hospital-acquired infections, and represents the most common source of infections on indwelling medical devices.</p>
<p>The factors mediating colonization of human tissues by <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> are complex and not yet fully elucidated, but have been studied in many animal models of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. Tissue colonization involves interactions of several <italic>S. aureus</italic> surface proteins with host cells and extracellular matrix. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> models, several <italic>S. aureus</italic> surface proteins, including clumping factor (Clf)A and ClfB, are important for adherence to mammalian cell lines and purified extracellular matrix proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Foster1">[2]</xref>. In addition, it is believed that ClfA is a key factor in triggering sepsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-McAdow1">[3]</xref>. ClfA and ClfB are members of a family of cell wall proteins, characterized by a large stretch of serine-aspartate dipeptide (SDR) repeats, that is present in staphylococci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Foster2">[4]</xref>. In addition to ClfA and ClfB, <italic>S. aureus</italic> also expresses three SDR-proteins, SdrC, SdrD and SdrE, which are organized in tandem in the genome. These proteins are also thought to be involved in tissue colonization, and elimination of any of them decreases bacterial virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Cheng1">[5]</xref>. Three additional members of this family, SrdF, SdrG and SdrH, are present in most <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-McCrea1">[6]</xref>. In each of these proteins, the SDR-region, which contains between 25 and 275 SD-dipeptide repeats, is located between the N-terminal ligand-binding A-domain and a C-terminal LPXTG-motif, which mediates anchoring to the cell wall by the transpeptidase sortase A. The function of the SDR-domain remains unknown, although it has been proposed to act as a cell wall spanning domain allowing exposure of the N terminal ligand binding sites of these proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Hartford1">[7]</xref>. Serine rich glycoproteins have been identified in several other pathogenic bacteria, with demonstrated roles in bacterial adhesion. As yet, it remains unknown if <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> SDR-proteins are sugar modified and whether the SDR-domain contributes to virulence of staphylococci.</p>
<p>In the present study, we have discovered that SDR-domains of all SDR-proteins of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> are heavily glycosylated by two novel glycosyltransferases, SdgA and SdgB. These glycosylation events prevent degradation of these proteins by host proteases, thereby preserving bacterial host tissue interactions. These sugar modifications also represent a dominant antibody epitope.</p>

<title>Characterization of a highly opsonic monoclonal antibody (rF1) isolated from an MRSA infected donor</title>
<p>We isolated several <italic>S. aureus-</italic>reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAb) from memory B cells from peripheral blood of MRSA-infected donors. When characterizing these antibodies, we identified one IgG1 mAb (hereafter referred to as rF1) with broad reactivity to a panel of <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains that induced robust opsonophagocytic killing (OPK) by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). Maximum binding of mAb rF1 to bacteria from clinical MRSA strain USA300 was approximately 10 fold higher than that of an isotype-matched anti-ClfA mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with increased binding, opsonization with rF1 resulted in increased uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) of USA300 by PMN. In contrast, preopsonization with human anti-ClfA had no effect on bacterial viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The rF1 antibody did not affect viability of USA300 in the absence of PMN (not shown). Thus, rF1 is a mAb with the capacity to bind MRSA and induce potent killing of MRSA by PMN.</p>

<p>Flow cytometry (FCM) analysis showed potent binding activity of rF1 to all 15 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003653.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These strains were broadly distributed across the <italic>S. aureus</italic> phylogeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Cooper1">[8]</xref>. As expression levels of bacterial cell surface antigens might differ between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> growth, we also tested the ability of rF1 to recognize USA300 isolated from various mouse tissues after systemic infection. The rF1 mAb strongly bound to USA300 derived from infected mouse kidneys, livers and lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The binding rF1 to USA300 from mouse kidneys was sustained until at least 8 days after infection (not shown), suggesting robust long-term expression of the rF1 epitope during infection. In addition, rF1 strongly bound to MRSA COL bacteria from heart vegetations in a rabbit model of infectious endocarditis. Treatment with vancomycin did not affect the reactivity of rF1 with MRSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, the antigen recognized by rF1 is conserved across various strains and stably expressed in various growth and infection conditions.</p>
<p>Given the ubiquitous nature of rF1-reactivity across all <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains, we further queried if such reactivity is extended to other gram-positive bacteria. Notably, rF1 binding was detectable only for the coagulase-negative human pathogen <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). The rF1 mAb did not bind to any other staphylococcal species tested, including <italic>S. saprophyticus</italic>, <italic>S. lugdunensis</italic>, <italic>S. simulans</italic> and <italic>S. carnosus</italic>, or other Gram-positive species such as <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis</italic>, <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, rF1 is a human antibody that binds to stably-expressed surface antigen(s) on human-adapted staphylococcal pathogens and promotes bacterial killing by human PMNs.</p>

<title>mAb rF1 binds to the SDR region of staphylococcal SDR proteins</title>
<p>We next sought to identify the <italic>S. aureus</italic> antigen(s) responsible for rF1 reactivity. Immunoblotting of cell wall preparations (CWPs) with rF1 revealed that the mAb binds to a group of high molecular weight entities. Treatment of CWP with proteinase K completely eliminated rF1 reactivity, suggesting that the rF1 antigens are cell wall-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, rF1 reactivity was not altered in CWPs derived from MRSA strains lacking some of the most abundant surface-expressed carbohydrate antigens, such as wall teichoic acids (Δ<italic>tagO</italic> mutant) and poly-N-acetyl glucosamine (Δ<italic>icaA</italic> mutant) (not shown).</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) rF1-reactivity with USA300 CWP is sensitive to proteinase-K (PK) treatment. Lysostapahin-derived CWP from WT (USA300-Δ<italic>spa</italic>) bacteria was left untreated (lane 1) or treated with 10 µg/mL PK for 1 hour (lane 2), and immunoblotted with rF1. (<bold>B</bold>) rF1-reacitivty is dependent on the presence of SDR-proteins.

The lower molecular weight bands (∼50 kDa) were due to non-specific IgG binding to protein A. (<bold>C</bold>) rF1 also binds to additional SDR-proteins from <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>. Cell lysates from <italic>S. epidemidis</italic> were immunoprecipitated with rF1 (lane 1) or an isotype-control mAb (lane 2) and immunoblotted with rF1 mAb. Identities of rF1-reactive bands were revealed by mass-spectrometry of the same lysates (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003653.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

We also probed the identity of rF1-reactive proteins in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, by immunoprecipitation of <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> lysates with rF1 followed by immunoblotting. Three unique rF1-reactive bands were present in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> lysates, and mass spectrometry analysis of these bands identified peptides corresponding to SdrF, SdrG and SdrH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g002">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003653.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

<p>To determine which specific region of SDR-proteins is recognized by rF1, we designed three different recombinant maltose binding protein (MBP)-tagged constructs based on the sequence of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> ClfA protein as a model antigen. These constructs contained either the N-terminal A-domain of ClfA, or the first 58 amino acids (SDR<sub>560-618</sub>) or the entire length of 150 amino acids (SDR<sub>560-709</sub>) of the SDR-domain of ClfA all under <italic>tet</italic>-inducible promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).

<p>Next, we investigated whether all five <italic>S. aureus</italic> SDR-proteins, ie. CflA, CflB, SdrC, SdrD and SdrE, are subjected to the same post-translational modification.

Only fraction 16 showed significant enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, bottom panel), and this fraction was subjected to mass spectrometry analysis to identify the enzyme(s) responsible. Four glycosyltransferases (Gtfs) were enriched only within this fraction, three of which belong to the Group 1 family: TarM (SAUSA300_0939) and two novel Gtfs (SAUSA300_0549 and SAUSA300_0550); and one from the Group 2 family, TarS (SAUSA300_0252) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Brown1">[13]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003653.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

<p>TarM and TarS have been shown to function as glycosyltransferases appending N-acetylglucosamines (GlcNAcs) to the phospho-polyribitol backbone of wall teichoic acids in alpha- and beta- enantiomeric configurations, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Brown1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Xia1">[14]</xref>.

<p>Complementation of Δ<italic>sdgB</italic> mutant with exogenous SdgB restored rF1 binding, and led to a concomitant loss of reactivity with the antibody against unmodified SD-repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Overexpression of SdgB in the Δ<italic>sdgB</italic> mutant resulted in SDR-proteins migrating slower than those made by WT cells, presumably due to exaggerated sugar modification on these proteins by the transgene. Moreover, deletion of SdgB, abolished both binding of rF1 to whole bacteria, and rF1-induced bacterial killing by human PMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g004">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Together, these data suggest that SdgB is the main protein that modifies SDR-proteins to enable recognition by rF1.</p>
<p>The apparent molecular weights of the SDR-proteins obtained from Δ<italic>sdgA</italic> were smaller compared to wild-type bacteria, and those from <italic>ΔsdgB</italic> were smaller than from Δ<italic>sdgA</italic> bacteria, as judged by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>, top and middle panels). These differences likely reflect changes in relative molecular mass (M<sub>r</sub>) caused by sugar modifications. If the sugar modifications of SdgA and SdgB occured independent of each other, one expectation would be that SDR-proteins from Δ<italic>sdgAΔsdgB</italic> bacteria would run faster than from Δ<italic>sdgB</italic> bacteria. However, ClfA from Δ<italic>sdgB</italic> and <italic>ΔsdgAΔsdgB</italic> mutants showed a similar M<sub>r</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>, middle panels), suggesting that the sugar modification appended by SdgA depends on SdgB activity.</p>
<p>Next, we tested the hypothesis that SdgA acts after SdgB, by immunoblotting whole cell lysates from wild-type, Δ<italic>sdgA, ΔsdgB</italic>, or <italic>ΔsdgAΔsdgB</italic> strain that expressed MBP-SDR-His under the control of a <italic>tet</italic>-inducible promoter. In both the Δ<italic>sdgB</italic> and <italic>ΔsdgAΔsdgB</italic> mutants, we observed reactivity with antibodies to unmodified SD-repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, bottom panel), but not with rF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, upper panel). The MBP-SDR-His proteins expressed in Δ<italic>sdgB</italic> and <italic>ΔsdgAΔsdgB</italic> mutants had a similar M<sub>r</sub>, as shown by both anti-SDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, bottom panel) and anti-His antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, middle panel). This supports the notion that no carbohydrate modification of the SDR-domains occurs in the absence of SdgB. In the Δ<italic>sdgA</italic> mutant, rF1 reactivity was unaffected; however, the SDR protein had a lower M<sub>r</sub> than in wild-type cells. Together, these data suggest that SdgB and SdgA add sugar modifcations onto SDR-domains in a sequential manner, with SdgB appending the sugar residues proximal to the target Ser-Asp repeats, followed by additional modification by SdgA (see model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g004">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>

<p>When recombinant MBP-SDR-His fusion protein, purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>, was incubated with purified SdgA or SdgB, in the presence or absence of UDP-GlcNAc, the MBP-SDR-His substrate gained rF1-reactivity only in the presence of SdgB and UDP-GlcNAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Alternative sugar resources such as UDP-Glucose and GDP-mannose did not confer rF1-reactivity (data not shown). As was shown in <italic>E. coli</italic>, SdgA alone had no effect on rF1 immunoreactivity or on the M<sub>r</sub> of the recombinant substrate, but the combination of SdgB and SdgA resulted in more protein modifications than SdgB alone, as suggested by the higher M<sub>r</sub> of SDR-substrate in rF1 and anti-His immunoblots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Since this effect occurred when UDP-GlcNAc was the only sugar source, it is likely that SdgA as well as SdgB can append GlcNAc residues to SDR proteins, but SdgA does so only after SdgB modification has occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the extent and complexity of SdgA and SdgB-mediated GlcNAc modification, enzyme-modified MDP-SDR substrates from the cell-free glycosylation reconstitution system were enriched by liquid phase chromatography and subjected to mass-spectrometric analysis (LC-MS). Compared to the unmodified MDP-SDR-recombinant substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, top panel), MDP-SDR-recombinant substrate that was modified by SdgB showed several peaks, with each peak separated from the others by mass of one additional GlcNAc residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, middle panel). Here, the largest mass observed (70708 Da), represents the addition of 59 GlcNAc residues. In the MDP-SDR-recombinant substrate there are a total of 60 “Asp-Ser-Asp” (DSD) motifs. These data suggest that under these conditions, almost all the serines in the SDR-domain were modified with a GlcNAc residue. When the MDP-SDR-recombinant substrate was incubated with both SdgB and SdgA, up to an additional 47 GlcNAc residues were added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, bottom panel).

Given that the total IgG concentration in human serum fluctuates around 12 mg/mL, this indicates that the proportion of Sdg-dependent IgG can represent up to approximately 1% of total human serum IgG.

The reduction in reactivity observed for CWP from Δ<italic>sdgB</italic> (red bars) as compared to wild-type CWP (black bars) reflects IgG specific for SdgB-dependent epitopes. Asterisks indicate significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) from WT CWP. (<bold>B</bold>) CWP from WT, Δ<italic>sdgA</italic>, or Δ<italic>sdgB</italic>, Δ<italic>sdgAΔsdgB</italic> USA300 were immunoblotted with rF1 and three additional human mAbs (SD2, SD3, and SD4) from different patients. All four mAbs showed similar epitope specificity.</p>

<p>Secondly, we were able to isolate three additional IgG mAb clones from three different <italic>S. aureus</italic> infected patients, which showed the same pattern of antigen recognition with wild-type or Δ<italic>sdgA</italic> USA300 CWP as mAb rF1, and which also showed absence of reactivity using Δ<italic>sdgB</italic> CWP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, we have found four independent IgG clones from four different patient donors, showing the same SdgB-dependent epitope specificity. Together, these data suggest that the SdgB-dependent glycosylation on SDR proteins reflects an immunodominant epitope for human anti-staphylococcal antibody responses.</p>

<title>Glycosylation protects SDR proteins against proteolysis by human neutrophil-derived cathepsin G</title>
<p>For successful colonization and invasion of host tissues, <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacteria must evade attack by a variety of host immune mechanisms, including proteolytic enzymes derived from neutrophils. In this context, we analyzed the physiological roles of the GlcNAc modification of SDR proteins during interaction of the bacteria with neutrophil lysosomal enzymes. A large cleaved fragment of ClfA was released when intact Δ<italic>sdgB</italic> bacteria was incubated with a human neutrophil lysosomal extract, but this fragment was not cleaved from WT USA300 or from Δ<italic>sdgB</italic> bacteria complemented with exogenous SdgB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Similar results were observed using lysosomal extracts derived from the human monocytic cell line THP1, but not from mouse monocytic cell line RAW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that lysosomal extracts from both human neutrophils and human THP-1 cells were highly enriched for cathepsin G. In contrast, mouse RAW cells showed abundant expression of other cathepsin family members, but not cathepsin G (not shown). Thus, these data suggested that SdgB-mediated glycosylation protects ClfA against proteolytic activity of the human neutrophil lysosomal enzyme cathepsin G.</p>

<p>To determine which protease(s) is responsible for cleaving unglycosylated ClfA, we incubated WT or Δ<italic>sdgB</italic> cells with each of the four main human neutrophil-derived serine proteases, ie. neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, proteinase-3 and neutrophil serine protease-4. Of these four proteases, only cathepsin G was able to induce cleavage of unglycosylated ClfA from Δ<italic>sdgB</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). In addition, none of the serum serine proteases α-thrombin, plasmin, kallikrein, factor Xa, or factor X1a, were able to induce cleavage of unglycosylated ClfA (not shown). A biochemical inhibitor of cathepsin G abrogated cleavage of unglycosylated ClfA by neutrophil lysosomal extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), confirming that cathepsin G is the predominant enzyme mediating this effect. <italic>S. aureus</italic> expressing SdgB but lacking SdgA treated with cathepsin G showed less ClfA cleavage than Δ<italic>sdgB</italic> bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g007">Figure 7E</xref>), indicating that GlcNAc disaccharides may provide more protection from proteolysis than GlcNAc monosaccharide modifications.</p>
<p>Next, we analyzed the extent of reduction in the amount of cell surface-associated ClfA resulting from cathepsin G-mediated cleavage in the absence of glycosylation. The release of cleaved ClfA into the supernatant of Δ<italic>sdgB</italic> cells correlated with an almost complete loss of cell-associated ClfA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g007">Figure 7F</xref>, upper two panels). We also observed that this effect is not limited to ClfA, since SdrD, another member of the SDR family, was similarly sensitive to cathepsin G-induced cleavage and release from Δ<italic>sdgB</italic>, but not WT <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g007">Figure 7F</xref>, middle two panels). However, this cathepsin G-mediated cleavage appeared restricted to the Sdr-family proteins, since IsdA, another sortase-A anchored cell surface protein, was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g007">Figure 7F</xref>, bottom two panels). Together, these data demonstrate that cell surface-bound SDR proteins are sensitive to proteolysis by human cathepsin G, and that glycosyl modification, primarily by SdgB, protects against this activity.</p>
<p>Finally, we hypothesized that the observed cathepsin G-mediated disappearance of unglycosylated SDR proteins from the bacterial surface would have biological consequences, such as the capacity of the bacteria to adhere to host tissues. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effects of cathepsin G on the adherence of SDR glycosylation-competetent or -deficient bacteria to human fibrinogen, a well-known host ligand for SDR proteins including ClfA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Foster1">[2]</xref>. Treatment with cathepsin G inhibited the adherence of Δ<italic>sdgB</italic>, but not WT bacteria to human fibrinogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g007">Figure 7G</xref>). Thus, SdgB-mediated glycosylation of SDR proteins likely represents a bacterial mechanism of protection against host innate immune responses to safeguard successful tissue colonization.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The data presented in this study highlight three novel findings: (1) the identification and characterization of two novel glycosyltransferases, designated SdgA and SdgB, which glycosylate serines in the Ser-Asp motifs of all SDR-proteins in <italic>S. aureus</italic> by appending GlcNAc moieties; (2) the elucidation of a protective role for these glycosylation events against proteolysis of SDR-proteins by human neutrophil cathepsin G; and (3) the discovery of highly opsonic human antibodies that are directed against these GlcNAc-modifications.</p>
<p>The glycosyltransferases SdgA and SdgB identified here function sequentially to append GlcNAc moieties onto SDR-proteins. Based on reactivity of the patient-derived, glycosylation-specific monoclonal antibody rF1 with Δ<italic>sdgA</italic>, Δ<italic>sdgB</italic> and Δ<italic>sdgAΔsdgB</italic> mutant bacteria, we propose a step-wise model, in which SdgB first appends GlcNAc on serine residues within the SD-repeats of SDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003653-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). The first SdgB-dependent GlcNAc modification forms the minimal epitope recognized by rF1. This was confirmed in a cell-free glycosylation reconsititution assay using UDP-GlcNAc as the sole sugar donor; the nature of the modified substrate was confirmed by LC-MS analysis. The SdgB-dependent modification is followed by the addition of GlcNAc to the glycoproteins by the second enzyme, SdgA, yielding disaccharide GlcNAc moieties on SDR proteins. This is consistent with our observation that SDR-proteins bind succinylated wheat germ agglutinin (sWGA) lectin, which is known to require divalent GlcNAcs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Schwefel1">[16]</xref>, only when both SdgB and SdgA are expressed (data not shown). Among all the identified glycosyltransferases (Gtfs), SdgB and SdgA are the most homologous to each other (43% identity; 63% similarity). TarM is another glycosyltransferase that appends GlcNAcs to wall teichoic acids; interestingly, TarM is the second most homologous protein to both SdgB (23% identity; 46% similarity) and SdgA (24% identity; 46% similarity).</p>
<p>In <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the genes for SdgA and SdgB are located adjacent to the SdrC/D/E locus. Some <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains, which lack some of the individual Sdr genes (SdrC or SdrD) or all three of them, still contain SdgA and SdgB. In addition to appending GlcNAcs to SdrC, D and E proteins, SdgA and SdgB append similar modifications to ClfA and ClfB, and these two genes are independent of each other and away from the SdrC/D/E locus. <italic>sdgA</italic> and <italic>sdgB</italic> genes are intact in all sequenced <italic>S. aureus</italic>; all 15 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> strains that we have analyzed express rF1 antigen, suggesting that these genes are expressed and that this is a highly conserved property of these bacteria. Interestingly, as in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the <italic>sdgA</italic> and <italic>sdgB</italic> homologs in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> are usually adjacent to genes encoding SDR-proteins. The Sdg orthologue that is encoded adjacent to <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> SdrG, is most homologous to <italic>S. aureus</italic> SdgB (56% identity), which further explains why rF1 antibody reacts to modifications that are tailored by very similar Gtfs in both species. In some <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> strains, a <italic>sgdA</italic> homolog appears to be absent, suggesting that the second glycosylation step may be less conserved in <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, perhaps consistent with its decreased invasiveness and consequent decreased need to evade neutrophil proteases. rF1 reactivity is only found in <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, but not other staphylococci or gram-positive or -negative strains, and homologs of SdgA and SdgB are absent from all staphylococcal strains that were negative for rF1 binding. These lines of evidence support the notion that the sugar modifications of SDR-proteins may be specific for human-adapted staphylococci.</p>
<p>Cells of the innate immune system such as neutrophils and macrophages play a vital role in immediate defense against invasive staphlylococal infections. For successful establishment of mucosal colonization and for deeper infection <italic>S. aureus</italic> must be able to survive attack by a variety of potent antimicrobial substances, including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, lysozyme, defensins and cathepsins. While <italic>S. aureus</italic> has mechanisms for evasion of each of these phagocyte host defenses, the work in this paper describes a novel one, since glycosylation of SDR proteins is also important in this regard. The glycosylation mediated by SdgA and SdgB protects SDR-proteins from proteolytic cleavage by cathepsin G produced by neutrophils and macrophages. SDR-proteins belong to a family of bacterial proteins collectively reffered to as MSCRAMMs (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) which mediate bacterial adherence to host extracellular matrix components including fibrinogen, fibrinectin and collagen. Cleavage of SDR-proteins from the bacterial cell surface in this environment is likely to compromise successful establishment of <italic>S. aureus</italic> colonization of and proliferation in its exclusively human niche.</p>
<p>Glycosylation of adhesins of gram positive and gram negative pathogens is an emerging theme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Zhou1">[17]</xref>. Glycosylation is necessary for the maturation and function of the SraP-like glycoproteins of gram-positive pathogens, and of the <italic>E. coli</italic> adhesins TibA and adhesin involved in diffuse adherence (AIDA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Zhou1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Charbonneau1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Lindenthal1">[19]</xref>. Similar to <italic>S. aureus</italic> SdgB and SdgA, the <italic>E. coli</italic> glycosyltransferase genes are found directly adjacent to the genes encoding their specific target proteins. The <italic>S. aureus</italic> SDR-proteins are distinct from several other glycosylated serine-rich adhesins of gram-positive bacteria, such as fimbriae-associated protein Fap1 of <italic>Streptococcus parasanguinis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Wu1">[20]</xref>, SrpA of <italic>Strep. sanguinis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Plummer1">[21]</xref>, GspB of <italic>Strep. gordonii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Bensing1">[22]</xref> and SraP of <italic>S. aureus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Siboo1">[23]</xref>. Unlike these serine-rich proteins, the SDR-proteins have only one single serine repeat region, almost always with aspartate as the alternate amino acid, and they do not cluster with the accessory Sec apparatus. SgdA and SgdB do not have signal sequences or transmembrane domains, suggesting that they function in the cytoplasm, prior to the export of glycosylated SDR-proteins to the cell surface by an as yet unknown mechanism. In some of these bacterial species, glycosylation of serine-rich repeats, for example in <italic>S. parasanguinis</italic> Fap1 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Zhou2">[24]</xref> or in the pneumococcal protein PsrP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Sanchez1">[25]</xref>, has been associated with biofilm formation. In <italic>S. aureus</italic>, ClfB has recently been implicated in biofilm formation as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Abraham1">[26]</xref>. However, we have not observed attenuation in <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilm formation by the Δ<italic>sdgAΔsdgB S. aureus</italic> strain (not shown), which may be explained by functional redundancy with other glycosyl transferases appending similar sugar moieties on other cell wall associated molecules. Examples of this include TarM and TarS that append similar GlcNAcs on WTA molecules. However, glycolsyation events may also protect other bacterial functions. For instance, SdrE has been shown to bind complement factor H as an immune evasion mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Sharp1">[27]</xref>, which may well be preserved by glycosylation-mediated protection of SdrE.</p>
<p>The precise roles of SDR glycosylation during infection remain to be defined. Since cathepsin G-mediated degradation of unglycolsylated SDR proteins results in the release of a proteolytic fragment containing the adhesive A-domain of SDR-proteins, we proposed that this cleavage could compromise the capacity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to colonize host tissues. Supporting this hypothesis, we demonstrated that in the absence of glycosylation of SDR-proteins, human cathepsin G inhibits bacterial adhesion to human fibrinogen. Thus, we propose that Sdg-mediated glycosylation of SDR proteins is a bacterial mechanism of protection against host innate immunity, to safeguard efficient host tissue colonization. In a systemic mouse infection model, we have observed a minor, though non-significant, reduction in bacterial burden in kidneys for USA300 deletion strains lacking SdgA and SdgB (not shown). However, the significance of these glycosyl modifications may be underappreciated in mouse models. We showed that unglycosylated SDR-proteins in SdgA- or SdgB-deficient bacteria are susceptible to degradation by purified human cathepsin G, or by lysosomal extracts from human neutrophils or from a human monocytic cell line, but not from a mouse monocytic cell line. Thus, the lack of a strong phenotype of SdgA/B deficient <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacteria in mouse infection may be explained by the possibility that mouse cathepsin G is either less effective in degrading unglycosylated SDR proteins or present at lower levels than in human phagocytes. This is in agreement with previous studies showing divergence of human and mouse cathepsin G with respect to their substrate specificities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Raymond1">[28]</xref>, and normal infection of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in cathepsin G-deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Mandlik1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>Since <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> are typical human pathogens, it is thus conceivable that the functions of these glycosylation events are important for infection in humans but not in mice. This is reminiscent of recent studies showing essential <italic>S. aureus</italic> virulence mechanisms, mediating specific interactions between <italic>S. aureus</italic> and host factors, to be specific for human and not occur in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Pishchany1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Spaan1">[31]</xref>. A definite analysis of our hypothesis of a role for glycosylation in tissue colonization is technically difficult, due to the lack of appropriate <italic>in vitro</italic> models for <italic>S. aureus</italic> colonization of relevant human tissues, such as nasal or skin epithelium. We have observed that the purified bacterial protease Asp-N, a metallo-endoprotease from either <italic>Pseudomonas fragi</italic> or <italic>Flavobacterium menigosepticum</italic>, that hydrolizes the N-terminal side of aspartic acids shows enhanced cleavage of A-domains of SDR proteins from Δ<italic>sdgB</italic> mutants, compared to the wildtype S. aureus (data not shown). In this example, the track of “naked” Ser-Asp repeat residues on Δ<italic>sdgB</italic> mutants is a clear target for these proteases. This suggests that, in addition to interfering with host proteases, the glycosylation may protect S. aureus from proteases secreted by other bacteria competing for the same ecologic niche.</p>
<p>We demonstrated that the SdgB-mediated GlcNAc modification generates an epitope on SDR proteins that is specifically recognized by a patient-derived mAb rF1. This antibody induced robust opsonophagocytic killing by human neutrophils, much more potent than another human mAb that recognizes the A-domain of ClfA. The superior capacity of rF1 to induce killing can likely be explained by a higher abundance of glycosyl groups on the SDR-proteins. We also found that the SdgB-dependent GlcNAc-containing epitope on SDR-proteins is recognized by a significant proportion of the total amount of anti-staphylococcal IgG in humans, and that multiple patients are able to recognize this epitope. Thus, the SdgB-dependent GlcNAc modification of SDR-proteins represents an immunodominant epitope during human anti-staphylococcal immune responses. The SDR-glycosylation may be used by the host immune system as an important recognition factor to detect <italic>S. aureus</italic> in infected tissues. However, the potential importance of glycosylation of SDR proteins in protecting against host proteases and successful tissue colonization may outweigh the need of the bacteria to go undetected from the host antibody response, thus representing a balance between host and pathogen.</p>

<title>Generation of antibodies</title>
<p>For generation of mAb rF1, CD19<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>−</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>−</sup>IgA<sup>−</sup> memory B cells were isolated from peripheral blood of an MRSA-infected donor using a FACSAria cell sorter (BD, San Jose, CA). Before viral transduction with B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-xL and Bcl-6 genes, the memory cells were activated on CD40L-expressing mouse L fibroblasts in the presence of interleukin-21, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Kwakkenbos1">[33]</xref>. Transduced B cells were maintained in the same culture system. The use of donor blood was approved by the institutional committee. rF1 was selected from culture supernatants by reactivity with lysates of MSSA strain Newman by ELISA; positive wells were subcloned and re-tested by ELISA twice. Recombinant rF1 was generated by cloning the heavy and light chain variable regions with human IgG1 kappa constant regions using pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and transfection into 293T cells (ATCC). Purified IgG was obtained from culture supernatants using protein A-coupled sepharose (Invitrogen).</p>
<p>The human IgG antibodies 4675, SD2, SD3 and SD4 were cloned from peripheral B cells from patients post <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection using a monoclonal antibody discovery technology which conserves the cognate pairing of antibody heavy and light chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Meijer1">[34]</xref>. Both plasma and memory B-cells were used as genetic source for the recombinant full length IgG repertoires (manuscript in preparation). Individual antibody clones were expressed by transfection of mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003653-Meijer2">[35]</xref>. Supernatants containing full length IgG1 antibodies were harvested after seven days and used to screen for antigen binding by ELISA. Antibodies 4675, SD2, SD3 and SD4 were positive for binding to cell wall preparations from USA300 or Newman <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains. Antibodies were subsequently produced in 200-ml transient transfections and purified with Protein A chromatography (MabSelect SuRe, GE Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) for further testing. Isolation and usage of these antibodies were approved by the regional ethical review board.</p>
<p>Mouse mAb against ClfA (9E10), ClfB, (10D2), SdrD (17H4), IsdA (2D3) and non-modified SDR proteins (9G4) were generated by immunizing mice with the respective recombinant proteins, which were purified after expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>, using standard protocols; hybridoma supernatants were purified by protein A affinity chromotography. Rabbit mAb 28.9.9 was generated by immunizing rabbits with peptidoglycan (PGN)-derived peptide CKKGGG-(L-Ala)-(D-gamma-Glu)-(L-Lys)-(D-Ala)-D-Ala) followed by cloning of the IgG.</p>

<title>Bacterial cell wall preparations (CWP), immunoblotting, and ELISA</title>
<p>CWP were generated by incubating 40 mg of pelleted <italic>S. aureus</italic> or <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> per mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) supplemented with 30% raffinose, 100 µg/ml of lysostaphin (Cell Sciences, Canton, MA), and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Pleasanton, CA), for 30 min at 37°C. The lysates were centrifuged at 11,600 x g for 5 min, and the supernatants containing cell wall components were collected. For immunoprecipitation, CWP were diluted 4 times in NP-40 buffer (120 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1% NP-40, complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 2 mM dithiothreitol) containing 1 µg/mL of indicated primary antibodies and incubated for 2 h at 4°C, followed by a 1 h incubation with Protein A/G agarose (Thermo, Waltham, MA). Whole cell lysates (WCL) were generated by a 30 min incubation at 37°C in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 100 µg/ml of lysostaphin, 1% Triton-X100 (Thermo) and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail. For immunoblot analysis, proteins were separated on a 4-12% Tris-glycine gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), followed by blotting with indicated primary antibodies (1 µg/mL). Antibodies used are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003653-t001">Table 1</xref>. Lectin studies were performed by immunoprecipitating filtered (0.2 micron) overnight culture supernatants with concanavalin A (ConA)- or sWGA-agarose beads (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) supplemented with 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.01 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>ELISA experiments were performed using standard protocols. Briefly, plates which were pre-coated with CWP were reacted with human IgG preparations, ie. purified human IgG (Sigma), intravenous immunoglobulin Gammagard Liquid (Baxter, Westlake Village, CA), pooled serum from healthy donors or from MRSA patients (both generated in-house). The concentrations of anti-staphylococcal IgG present in the serum or purified IgG were calculated by using a calibration curve that was generated with known concentrations of mAb 28.9.9 against peptidoglycan.</p>

First, Δ<italic>panSDR</italic> mutant <italic>S. aureus</italic> from a log-phase culture were lysed by incubation in PBS containing 200 ug/ml lysostaphin and 250 U/ml of benozase nuclease (Novagen, Madison, WI) for 30 min at 37°C, followed by centrifugation at 18,000 x g to remove debris. Next, <italic>in vitro</italic> glycosyl modification of resin-bound <italic>E. coli</italic> SDR-proteins was induced by addition of Δ<italic>panSDR</italic> mutant <italic>S. aureus</italic> lysates and incubation for 1 h at 37°C, followed by 3 washes with a buffer containing 50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole (pH 8.0).</p>
<p>For <italic>in vitro</italic> glycosylation by purified glycosyltransferases, the full lengths of the indicated <italic>S. aureus</italic> glycosyltransferase genes were PCR amplified and ligated in frame with an N-terminal 6x His-tag into the pET15b <italic>E. coli</italic> expression vector, and transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic>, followed by protein expression and purification. MBP-SDR709 fusion protein was cloned into pMal.c5x, and expressed and purified as described above. Purified MBP-SDR709 fusion protein was incubated with amylose agarose (New England Biolabs) for 1.5 h at 4°C. To provide necessary building sugar blocks, a <italic>B. subtilis</italic> lysate was prepared by resuspension of a logarithmic culture of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> in PBS with protease inhibitors (Roche) and mechanical disruption using a Mini-Beadbeater, followed by removal of debris by centrifugation. To induce glycosylation, the amylose captured MBP-SDR709 fusion protein was incubated with the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> lysate in the presence of 10 µg/ml of purified glycosyltransferase for 1 h at 37°C, followed by 3 washes in 1% NP-40 buffer. Binding of glycosyltransferases to MBP-SDR709 fusion protein was assessed as follows. Two µg of purified MBP-SDR709 protein was incubated with 10 µg of a purified His-tagged glycosyltransferase in 1% NP-40 buffer and protease inhibitors for 2 h at 4°C. This was followed by incubation with amylose agarose for 1 h at 4°C, and 3 washes with 1% NP-40 buffer.</p>
<p>For co-expression of SDR protein with Sdg enzymes in <italic>E. coli</italic>, a NT-His tag fused to the full length of either SdgA or SdgB was cloned into the arabinose inducible expression vector pBad33 (ATCC), and transformed into the <italic>E.coli</italic> strain harboring the inducible MBP-SDR709 fusion protein (expressed in the pMal.c5x expression vector; see above). Expression of both SDR protein and Sdg enzyme was induced by addition of 0.2% L-(+)arabinose (Sigma) and 0.3 mM IPTG. Whole cell lysates were prepared by incubation in 100 mM Tris (pH 7.5) with 4% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, and 100 mM DTT for 5 min at 100°C.</p>
<p>For cell-free reconstitution of SDR-protein glycosylation, 100 µg of purified MBP-SDR709 protein, purified after expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>, was mixed with 30 µg of UDP-GlcNAc (Sigma) and 4 µg of purified SdgA and/or SdgB enzyme in 100 mM Tris. This mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37°C for 1 h, and subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting or mass spec. All <italic>in vitro</italic> glycosylated SDR-proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above.</p>

<title>Treatment of bacteria with human neutrophil proteases or lysosomal extracts from human neutrophils and cultured cells</title>
<p>Lysosomal extracts were isolated from human neutrophils, THP-1 cells, and RAW cells, using a Lysosome Enrichment kit (Thermo). A total of 5×10<sup>7</sup> cells was used to obtain 300 to 500 microgram of total proteins in the lysosomes. Protease inhibitors were omitted from all steps to maintain protease activity in the lysosomes. The plasma membranes of the cells were disrupted by 30 strokes using a dounce homogenizer (Wheaton, Millville, NJ). The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 min to obtain postnuclear supernatant, which was loaded onto the top of a gradient of 8%, 20%, 23%, 27% and 30% (from top to bottom) of iodixanol. After ultracentrifugation at 145,000 x g for 2 h at 4°C, we obtained the lysosomes layered between 8% and 20% iodixanol. This lysosomal fraction was diluted into PBS and pelleted by centrifugation at 18,000 x g for 30 min at 4°C. The lysosomal pellets were washed with PBS and lysed in 2% CHAPS with Tris-buffered saline to obtain lysosomal extracts.</p>
<p>To analyze the cleavage of SDR proteins by host proteases, <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacteria were treated with 50 nM of purified human neutrophil serine proteases or 0.1 mg/ml of neutrophil lysosomal extracts in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) with 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>; or with 0.1 mg/ml of RAW or THP-1 lysosomal extracts in 50 mM NaCitrate with 100 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT (pH 5.5). Cathepsin G inhibitor (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA) was added at 100 µg/ml. These mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes when using purified proteases or for 1 h when using lysosomal lysates, and centrifuged to pellet bacteria. The supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting to detect cleavage products. In some experiments, cell wall preparations were obtained from the remaining bacterial pellets and also analyzed by immunoblotting.</p>
