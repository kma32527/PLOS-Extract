<abstract>
<p>The contribution of different host cell transport systems in the intercellular movement of turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) was investigated. To discriminate between primary infections and secondary infections associated with the virus intercellular movement, a gene cassette expressing GFP-HDEL was inserted adjacent to a TuMV infectious cassette expressing 6K<sub>2</sub>:mCherry, both within the T-DNA borders of the binary vector pCambia. In this system, both gene cassettes were delivered to the same cell by a single binary vector and primary infection foci emitted green and red fluorescence while secondarily infected cells emitted only red fluorescence. Intercellular movement was measured at 72 hours post infiltration and was estimated to proceed at an average rate of one cell being infected every three hours over an observation period of 17 hours. To determine if the secretory pathway were important for TuMV intercellular movement, chemical and protein inhibitors that blocked both early and late secretory pathways were used. Treatment with Brefeldin A or Concanamycin A or expression of ARF1 or RAB-E1d dominant negative mutants, all of which inhibit pre- or post-Golgi transport, reduced intercellular movement by the virus. These treatments, however, did not inhibit virus replication in primary infected cells. Pharmacological interference assays using Tyrphostin A23 or Wortmannin showed that endocytosis was not important for TuMV intercellular movement. Lack of co-localization by endocytosed FM4-64 and Ara7 (AtRabF2b) with TuMV-induced 6K<sub>2</sub>-tagged vesicles further supported this conclusion. Microfilament depolymerizing drugs and silencing expression of myosin XI-2 gene, but not myosin VIII genes, also inhibited TuMV intercellular movement. Expression of dominant negative myosin mutants confirmed the role played by myosin XI-2 as well as by myosin XI-K in TuMV intercellular movement. Using this dual gene cassette expression system and transport inhibitors, components of the secretory and actomyosin machinery were shown to be important for TuMV intercellular spread.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Plant viruses move from the initially infected cell to neighboring cells during local movement and then over long distances through vascular tissue to establish a systemic infection in the plant. Virus intercellular transport requires viral and host factors to move viral RNA-protein complexes through plasmodesmata (PDs). Virus intercellular movement is normally assessed by assays that cannot always differentiate between reduced viral RNA replication and intercellular movement. By using a dual cassette of genes encoding fluorescent proteins that can differentiate between primary infected cells and cells infected after intercellular transport, we provide evidence that turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) needs a functional secretory pathway where pre- and post-Golgi trafficking and the actomyosin network are important for its movement. Interestingly, disruption of these host transport machineries had no impact on TuMV accumulation in initially infected cells. These results support the idea that virus replication activities can be influenced separately from those involved in other virus activities such as movement, although aspects of both are likely coordinated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plant viruses move from the initially infected cell to neighboring cells during local spread and then over long distances through vascular tissues to establish a systemic infection in the plant. Transport of viruses between cells first involves the intracellular movement of the viral RNA from the site of replication to plasmodesmata (PDs) and then its delivery into neighboring cells through PDs. PDs are tunnels in the cell wall that connect the cytoplasm, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane between adjoining cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Maule1">[1]</xref>). The size exclusion limit (SEL) of PD is normally too small to allow passive transport of large molecular complexes, but plant viruses encode movement proteins (MPs) that increase the SEL of PDs to allow passage of the viral RNA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Niehl1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-BenitezAlfonso1">[3]</xref>). Intracellular movement likely involves a membrane-associated viral RNA-host and viral protein complex, but the exact configuration of the viral entity that enters the neighboring cells has not yet been determined (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Niehl1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Schoelz1">[4]</xref>). In the case of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the viral RNA appears to spread between cells as membrane MP-associated viral replication complexes (VRCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Kawakami1">[5]</xref>. For members of the comovirus and caulimovirus genera, viral particles transit through MP-induced tubules that go through PDs for their delivery into non-infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Amari1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Kasteel1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although MPs and other viral protein components are important for viral RNA intra- and intercellular movement, it is clear that host factors also are required for these activities. The cytoskeleton is an essential component of organelle trafficking in plant cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Wada1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Brandizzi1">[12]</xref>) and it has been shown to be involved in vertebrate virus intracellular movement (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Taylor1">[13]</xref>). In the case of TMV, several studies have shown that microtubules and microfilaments are necessary to anchor and release, or aid the movement of the VRC or MP granules often associated with ER (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Niehl1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Schoelz1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Pena1">[14]</xref>). Microfilaments influence the intracellular or intercellular transport of other MPs or viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Xu1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Laporte1">[20]</xref>. Myosin motors are also required for MP or viral trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Amari1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Yuan1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Wei1">[24]</xref>. The secretory pathway is further involved in intra- and intercellular trafficking by several viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Genoves1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Cui1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Laporte1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Yuan1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Vogel1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Andika1">[26]</xref>. Finally, recent studies suggest that the endocytic transport pathway may be involved in viral movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Haupt1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Lewis1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>However, not all viruses or their components use the cytoskeleton or the secretory pathway for movement. For example, PD targeting of the tubule-forming MP of cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) is not affected by either the disruption of ER-Golgi transport or by cytoskeleton disruption <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Pouwels2">[29]</xref>. Similarly, the targeting of the triple gene block protein 3 (TGBp3) of poa semilatent virus to PD does not require a functional cytoskeleton or the secretory pathway for its intracellular transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Schepetilnikov1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>The genome of potyviruses is a single ∼10 kb RNA molecule that codes for a polyprotein, which is processed into ten mature proteins. In addition to polyprotein-derived polypeptides, an ∼7 kDa protein termed PIPO is produced in infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Chung1">[31]</xref> and is also found as a trans-frame protein consisting of the amino-terminal half of P3 fused to PIPO (P3N-PIPO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Vijayapalani1">[32]</xref>. Potyviruses have no designated MP but many viral proteins have been reported to have MP-related functions. For instance, HCPro and the coat protein (CP) can increase PD SEL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Rojas1">[33]</xref>. In addition, CP and cylindrical inclusion (CI) protein are required for virus intercellular movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Dolja1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Carrington1">[36]</xref> and are associated with PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-RodriguezCerezo1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Roberts1">[38]</xref>. Recently, the targeting of CI to PD was shown to be mediated by P3N-PIPO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Wei2">[39]</xref>, which itself is targeted to the plasma membrane through an interaction with the host protein PCaP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Vijayapalani1">[32]</xref>. One last protein involved in viral movement is the 6 kDa membrane-associated 6K<sub>2</sub> protein. It induces the production of motile vesicles that contain viral RNA and have been proposed to be the vehicle for intracellular trafficking of potyviral RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Cotton1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Wei3">[41]</xref>. These findings, while providing a partial understanding of the mechanism of TuMV intracellular and intercellular movement, do not sufficiently explain the involvement of the host secretory pathway or the cytoskeleton in potyvirus movement.</p>
<p>In this study, we used a novel dual gene cassette construct that differentiated primary infected cells from cells infected after virus intercellular movement to show that the early as well as the late secretory pathway, but not endocytosis, was important for TuMV transport. We also determined that myosin XI-2 and XI-K, but not myosin XI-F and VIIIs, influenced TuMV intercellular movement. Although these cellular components were required for intercellular movement of TuMV, they did not appear to be involved in the virus protein production in primary infected cells.</p>

<title>An <italic>in vivo</italic> quantitative assay for TuMV intercellular movement</title>
<p>A recombinant tobacco etch virus (TEV) (genus <italic>Potyvirus</italic>) engineered to express the reporter protein β-glucuronidase (GUS) allowed direct observation of virus spread in leaves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Dolja1">[34]</xref>. Virus spread is influenced by the rates of virus RNA replication and virus intercellular movement. Hence, the use of the above TEV-GUS construct to fully interpret results from virus spread studies is limited since virus replication in live tissue cannot be quantitated through GUS staining. In order to discriminate initially infected cells from later infected cells in live tissue, we introduced within the T-DNA borders of a binary vector a gene cassette expressing the ER-localized GFP-HDEL adjacent to a TuMV infectious genome cassette expressing 6K<sub>2</sub>:mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Since both gene cassettes are delivered to the same cells and GFP-HDEL does not move between cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Lewis1">[28]</xref>, primary infected cells should display concomitant green and red fluorescence while secondary infected cells should display red-only fluorescence. This system also allows differentiation between virus RNA replication and virus intercellular movement.</p>

<p>A single infiltration with an <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> suspension containing the above plasmid was performed on leaves of three-week old <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants, resulting in an agroinfiltrated area of 5–10 mm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Fluorescence emitted by GFP-HDEL was generally observed at approximately 36 hrs post infiltration (hpinf) and mCherry fluorescence resulting from TuMV replication was detected at approximately 60 hpinf. Systemic TuMV infection was observed at 4–5 days post infiltration (dpinf) in leaves above the infiltrated one by Western blot analysis using a rabbit serum against the CP of TuMV (data not shown). A similar systemic movement was obtained when more dilute agrobacterium suspensions (e.g. 0.01–0.001) were infiltrated, indicating the bacterial load did not elicit a plant defense response that might have affected virus infection rate. <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> cells displayed the expected green polygonal ER pattern and virus-induced 6K<sub>2</sub>-tagged red vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Virus intercellular movement was assayed by observing red and green fluorescence at the perimeter of the infiltrated area. At 72 hpinf, a majority of cells in the infiltrated area emitted both green and red fluorescence and just a few red-only cells were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>), indicating that viral movement was just starting. Viral movement was followed in the same agroinfiltrated region at 4, 5, and 6 dpinf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g001">Fig. 1E–G</xref>). At the end of the observation period, the surface area of green fluorescence did not changed, indicating that GFP-HDEL did not moved into neighboring cells.</p>
<p>Intercellular movement of fluorescent signal was also followed by observing spread of green and red fluorescence for 17 consecutive hours starting at 72 hpinf in order to evaluate the rate of cell-to-cell movement. This was achieved by securing an infiltrated leaf still attached to the plant on the confocal microscope stage for observation. When the perimeter of the agroinfiltrated area was initially imaged, intercellular movement have already begun as indicated by the presence of red-only fluorescent patches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003683.s004">Movie S1</xref>). To calculate the rate of cell-to-cell movement in cells/hour, we first measured the number of leaf epidermal cells for every linear 1 mm in three-week-old <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants and we calculated that 1 mm corresponded to 17.6 cells (n = 20). We then measured the distance from the agroinfiltrated front to the limit of expansion of the red fluorescence at the end of the observation period. In this experiment, the red-only fluorescence, indicative of TuMV secondary infection, had spread an average distance of 311 µm (n = 20) in the xy plane in 17 h. This expansion corresponded to a rate of one new infected cell every 3 hours. We repeated this experiment five times and we observed the same rate of cell-to-cell movement. This rate of intercellular movement was similar to that observed for TEV expressing GUS and for TMV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Kawakami1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Dolja1">[34]</xref>. The increase in red fluorescence surface area was not due to the diffusion of 6K<sub>2</sub>:mCherry from agroinfected cells in the absence of virus spread because replacement of the TuMV cassette with a cassette expressing only 6K<sub>2</sub>-mCherry did not produce red-only fluorescent foci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003683.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). These findings validated the use of the double cassette, GFP-HDEL and TuMV 6K<sub>2</sub>:mCherry to follow intercellular movement by TuMV.</p>

<title>Intercellular movement of TuMV requires both the early and late secretory pathways</title>
<p>Chemical and protein inhibitors were used to evaluate the role of the early and late secretory pathways in the intercellular movement of TuMV using the dual gene cassette system. The plant secretory pathway consists of the ER, the Golgi apparatus, various post-Golgi intermediate compartments (e.g. trans-Golgi network, endosomes), the vacuoles/lysosomes and the small vesicular transport carriers that shuttle between these compartments. The early secretory pathway embraces the ER–Golgi interface while the Golgi apparatus and the various post-Golgi organelles that control plasma membrane or vacuolar sorting is categorized as the late secretory pathway (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Patarroyo1">[42]</xref>).</p>
<p>Brefeldin A (BFA) is an inhibitor that interferes with protein transport between the ER-Golgi interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Tse1">[43]</xref>. Concanamycin A (CMA) inhibits protein transport at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Gendre1">[44]</xref> by inhibiting the function of TGN-localized proton-ATPases, which leads to the acidification of the TGN lumen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Dettmer1">[45]</xref>. To evaluate the influence of these secretory inhibitors on TuMV intercellular movement, <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves were treated with DMSO, 10 µg/mL BFA or 0.5 µM CMA 4 h before pCambiaTuMV/6K<sub>2</sub>:mCherry//GFP-HDEL agroinfiltration. BFA at this concentration effectively blocked the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003683.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). At 4 dpinf, DMSO alone had no inhibitory effect on TuMV movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). On the other hand, BFA and CMA treatment reduced cell-to-cell movement of TuMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g002">Fig. 2B–C</xref>). The surface area for mCherry-only expressing foci for each treatment was measured and the statistical analysis confirmed the inhibitory effect of BFA and CMA on TuMV intercellular movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). This experiment was repeated two more times and the statistical data are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003683.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>. To assess whether or not BFA or CMA inhibited TuMV replication, we quantified mCherry fluorescence intensity over GFP fluorescence intensity in primary infection foci for all treatments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g002">Fig. 2E</xref> shows that that there was no significant difference in the ratio of red over green fluorescence during BFA and CMA treatments compared with the no inhibitor treatment (TuMV alone) at 4 dpinf, indicating that viral protein production in the primary infected cells was not affected by the drug treatments. Green fluorescence levels were also similar between DMSO- and BFA- or CMA-treated primary cells indicating that steady state level of GFP, which was not associated with virus replication, was not affected by the treatments (data not shown).</p>

<p>Protein inhibitors were used to further support the role of the secretory pathway in TuMV intercellular transport. The ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) is a small GTPase regulating the recruitment of COPI coatomer proteins. A dominant negative mutant of ARF1 [ARF1(NI)] impaired in GTP/GDP binding inhibits the transport of soluble markers from the ER to Golgi, and causes a re-absorbance of Golgi membrane proteins into the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Stefano1">[46]</xref>. RAB-E1d is a small Rab GTPase acting at a post-Golgi trafficking pathway and the dominant negative mutant RAB-E1d(NI) inhibits trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Zheng1">[47]</xref>. These two dominant-negative mutants were co-infiltrated with pCambiaTuMV/6K<sub>2</sub>:mCherry//GFP-HDEL. Four days post-agroinfiltration, red-only foci were reduced in the tissue co-infiltrated with the two mutant protein cassettes compared with those not infiltrated with these constructs, indicating reduced intercellular movement of TuMV in the presence of these secretory pathway inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g003">Fig. 3B–C</xref>). Surface area measurements for mCherry-only expressing patches confirmed the inhibitory effect of both ARF1(NI) and RAB-E1d(NI) on TuMV intercellular movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). This experiment was repeated two more times and the statistical data are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003683.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>. Expression of these two mutant proteins did not hamper virus protein production in primary infected cells as measured by red over green fluorescence ratios in the dual expressing regions of the infected leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g003">Fig. 3E</xref>). We therefore concluded that inhibition of both early and late secretory pathways inhibited TuMV intercellular movement but did not affect virus replication in primary infected cells. The last assertion is in line with the prior observation that BFA treatment did not affect the production of TuMV-induced 6K<sub>2</sub>-tagged perinuclear structures and peripheral vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Grangeon1">[48]</xref>.</p>

<title>Intercellular movement of TuMV does not depend on the endocytic pathway</title>
<p>We examined if endocytosis was involved in TuMV intercellular movement. To this end, we first used a pharmacological interference assay with Tyrphostin A23, Tyrphostin A51 and Wortmannin. In mammalian cells, Tyrphostin A23 inhibits the recruitment of endocytic cargo into clathrin-coated vesicles formed at the plasma membrane by preventing the interaction between the clathrin-binding AP-2 adaptor complex μ2 subunit and the sorting motif within the cytoplasmic domain of plasma membrane proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Banbury1">[49]</xref>. Tyrphostin A51 is a structural analog of Tyrphostin A23 but has no inhibitory effect and is routinely used as negative control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Banbury1">[49]</xref>.

<p>It was previously shown that overexpression of the myosin XI-K tail, a dominant negative mutant of this myosin species, inhibited the intracellular trafficking of TuMV 6K<sub>2</sub> vesicles and reduced TuMV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Wei3">[41]</xref>, indicating the involvement of this myosin in virus movement. We were also interested to see if other myosins could be involved. Tobacco rattle virus-mediated virus-induced silencing (TRV-VIGS) was adopted to determine the role of myosins on intercellular movement of TMV, potato virus X (PVX), tomato bushy stunt virus, and turnip vein-clearing virus (TVCV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Harries2">[22]</xref>. We thus used TRV-VIGS to silence individual myosin genes prior to TuMV infection. <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves were first infected with TRV constructs and 15 days later upper leaves were infiltrated with agrobacterium strain containing pCambiaTuMV/6K<sub>2</sub>:mCherry//GFP-HDEL. TuMV intercellular movement was quantified at 4 dpinf. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that the transcriptional level of the target myosin genes was decreased in plants infected by the TRV silencing construct containing the corresponding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). We then monitored TuMV intercellular movement by measuring areas of foci expressing mCherry-only. Quantification indicated that there was no significant difference in TuMV intercellular movement in mock- and TRV-infected plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g007">Fig. 7B and 7D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Studies on intercellular movement have shown that plant viruses may use different trafficking pathways to move from one cell to another (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Niehl1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Schoelz1">[4]</xref>). In this study, by discriminating infiltrated and primary-infected cells from cells infected following intercellular virus movement, we were able to evaluate the contribution of the secretory pathway and the cytoskeleton for TuMV intercellular movement.</p>
<p>Using our dual gene cassette construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), we first observed the green fluorescence at 48 hpinf, and mCherry fluorescence at 60 hpinf. This is the time frame normally observed when virus infection is initiated through agroinfiltration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Eskelin1">[64]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Lindbo1">[66]</xref>. TuMV intercellular movement was observed between 60 and 72 hpinf and progressed at a rate of one new infected cell per ∼3 hours and systemic infection of the plant occurred at 4–5 dpinf. The intercellular rate of spread of TuMV was very close to that observed for TMV and TEV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Kawakami1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Dolja1">[34]</xref>. Infections caused by mechanical inoculation with virus suspensions as opposed to agroinfiltration often result in measurable virus replication at 24 hpinf and systemic infection 2 days later <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Dolja1">[34]</xref>. The delay in observable infection in our agroinfiltration system may be explained by several factors. The first factor is that a T-DNA copy of the viral RNA genome is delivered in the cell. This T-DNA molecule must be transported to the nucleus and transcribed into RNA, which is then transported back in the cytoplasm. In the case of potyviruses, there may be an additional delay because the RNA transcribed from the T-DNA is not linked to VPg. There is consequently a first round of translation that needs to take place before <italic>bona fide</italic> infection begins. Lastly, monitoring fluorescence as opposed to viral RNA through an amplification system (e.g. RT-PCR) is likely less sensitive and requires maturation of the fluorescent marker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Shaner1">[67]</xref>. Importantly, however, after the initial delay in infection, TuMV intercellular movement and systemic infection proceeded at the same rate as infections using purified viral particles. This indicates that the infiltrated agrobacterium did not cause an additional defense response by the plant that significantly impeded spread of TuMV beyond what is normally observed during virus infections. This latter finding further supports the use of our dual cassette construct as a valid tool to study virus intercellular movement.</p>
<p>It was previously shown that intracellular motility of individual potyviral proteins was dependent on the early secretory pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Cui1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Wei2">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Wei3">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Wei4">[57]</xref>. In addition to ER, COPI, and COPII coatomers, the Golgi apparatus can be recruited into virus factories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Genoves1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Grangeon1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Tilsner1">[68]</xref> but the role of late secretory pathway in plant viral movement was not investigated. Although ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) proteins, which have a major role in the sorting of cargo proteins, are recruited for tomato bushy stunt virus replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Barajas1">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Barajas2">[70]</xref>, it is not known if they have any involvement in virus movement. In the present study, we determined that in addition to the early secretory pathway, post-Golgi transport components were also required for TuMV intercellular movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g002">Fig. 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g003">3</xref>). Likely, this late secretory pathway is required for sorting the membrane-associated viral RNA-protein complex to PDs.</p>
<p>Intercellular movement of TuMV also depended on microfilaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g006">Fig. 6</xref>) and myosin motor proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g007">Fig. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003683-g008">8</xref>). In plant cells, myosins are classified into class VIII or class XI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Peremyslov1">[71]</xref>. Among the myosins tested in this study, myosin XI-2 and XI-K were required for TuMV intercellular movement, but not myosin XI-F, VIII-1 or VIII-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Wei2">[39]</xref>. Class XI myosins are also required for normal sustained movement of TMV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Harries2">[22]</xref> and GFLV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Amari1">[6]</xref>. In the case of GFLV, it may be that myosin is required to transport a host factor to the PD that then supports GFLV movement. For TMV, it has been suggested that the influence of myosin XI-2 on its sustained intercellular spread may be through metabolism of virus products after virus movement, since the related tobamovirus TVCV does not require actomyosin for intercellular spread and TMV spreads normally for 24 h post treatment with a microfilament antagonist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Harries2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Hofmann1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Liu2">[72]</xref>. Previously, myosin XI-K was shown to be involved in the intracellular movement of TuMV 6K<sub>2</sub> vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Wei3">[41]</xref>. Myosin XI-K and myosin XI-2, but not other myosins, have been shown to be major facilitators for cellular motility between actin filaments and the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Ueda1">[73]</xref>. It has also been shown that myosin XI-K localizes to the motile endomembrane vesicles associated with F-actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Peremyslov1">[71]</xref>. We suggest that there may be more than one myosin-dependent activity necessary for a single virus and its expressed proteins to spread in plants and that XI-2, together with XI-K, may be important for the movement of TuMV RNA complexes.</p>
<p>Disruption of the secretory pathway had no impact on TuMV accumulation in the initially infected cells. We showed previously that BFA treatment had no effect on the formation of TuMV-induced 6K<sub>2</sub>-tagged structures, although motile 6K<sub>2</sub> vesicles showed a higher incidence of localization with the COPII marker Sec24 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Grangeon1">[48]</xref>. Similarly, disruption of the early secretory trafficking by BFA inhibited intercellular virus movement of melon necrotic spot virus but did not modify its accumulation in infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Genoves1">[16]</xref>. Coronavirus-induced remodeling of the ER and viral replication equally took place in the presence of BFA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Knoops1">[74]</xref>. Breakdown of actin filaments also did not affect the formation of TuMV 6K<sub>2</sub>-tagged vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Cotton1">[40]</xref>. These results suggest that replication activities, despite their requirement for membranes, are influenced separately from those involved in movement, although aspects of both are likely coordinated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Tilsner2">[75]</xref>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we show in this study that the secretory pathway and the actomyosin system are both important for the intercellular movement of TuMV. These host components are likely required by the virus to aid its movement out of the initially infected cell. Further work is necessary to identify host proteins within the secretory pathway and the actomyosin network that interact with the virus proteins and influence virus movement.</p>

<title>VIGS and quantitative RT-PCR</title>
<p>pTRV2 with myosin fragments was as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003683-Harries2">[22]</xref>.

To confirm silencing of specific myosin transcripts, RNA was isolated from 20 day-old TRV-infected systemic leaves (two plants/construct) using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen). DNase-treated RNA (4 µg) was used to generate cDNA with iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). After a 15-fold dilution of the cDNA, 2 µL of solution was used for quantitative RT-PCR through a Rotor Gene 3000 real-time DNA detection system (Corbett Research).

<title>Confocal microscopy</title>
<p>Agroinfiltrated leaf sections were mounted on a depression microscope slide, aligning the leaf tissue in the well. Cells were observed using a 10× objective, 20×, 40× and 63× oil immersion objective on a LSM 510 Metaconfocal microscope (Zeiss) or on a LSM 780 Metaconfocal microscope (Zeiss). For LSM 510 Metaconfocal microscope experiments, argon and HeNe lasers were used to excite fluorescent proteins and for a LSM 780 Metaconfocal multiline argon and DPSS 561 were used. Data from both green and red channels were collected at the same time.</p>
