<abstract>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is a hard-to-eradicate intracellular pathogen that infects one-third of the global population. It can live within macrophages owning to its ability to arrest phagolysosome biogenesis. Autophagy has recently been identified as an effective way to control the intracellular mycobacteria by enhancing phagosome maturation. In the present study, we demonstrate a novel role of miR-155 in regulating the autophagy-mediated anti-mycobacterial response. Both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showed that miR-155 expression was significantly enhanced after mycobacterial infection. Forced expression of miR-155 accelerated the autophagic response in macrophages, thus promoting the maturation of mycobacterial phagosomes and decreasing the survival rate of intracellular mycobacteria, while transfection with miR-155 inhibitor increased mycobacterial survival. However, macrophage-mediated mycobacterial phagocytosis was not affected after miR-155 overexpression or inhibition. Furthermore, blocking autophagy with specific inhibitor 3-methyladenine or silencing of autophagy related gene 7 (Atg7) reduced the ability of miR-155 to promote autophagy and mycobacterial elimination. More importantly, our study demonstrated that miR-155 bound to the 3′-untranslated region of Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb), a negative regulator of autophagy, accelerated the process of autophagy and sequential killing of intracellular mycobacteria by suppressing Rheb expression. Our results reveal a novel role of miR-155 in regulating autophagy-mediated mycobacterial elimination by targeting Rheb, and provide potential targets for clinical treatment.</p>

<p>microRNA-155 (miR-155) plays an essential role in regulating the host immune response by post-transcriptionally repressing the expression of target genes. However, little is known regarding its activity in modulating autophagy, an important host defense mechanism against intracellular bacterial infection. <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is a hard-to-eradicate intracellular pathogen that infects approximately one-third of the global population, and causes 1.5 million deaths annually. The present study explores a novel role of miR-155 in the host response against mycobacterial infection. Our data demonstrates that mycobacterial infection triggers the expression of miR-155, and the induction of miR-155 in turn activates autophagy by targeting Rheb, a negative regulator of autophagy. miR-155-promoted autophagy accelerates the maturation of the mycobacterial phagosome, thus decreasing the survival of intracellular mycobacteria in macrophages. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the host defense mechanisms against mycobacterial infection, providing useful information for development of potential therapeutic interventions against tuberculosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>) is a hard-to-eradicate intracellular pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Russell1">[1]</xref> that infects approximately one-third of the global population, and causes 1.5 million deaths annually <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Korbel1">[2]</xref>. However, only 10% of latent infections lead to active tuberculosis, indicating the importance of host immune defense against mycobacterial infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Korbel1">[2]</xref>. The anti-mycobacterial immune system is mainly dependent on cellular immunity mediated by macrophages and T lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Korbel1">[2]</xref>. Macrophages belong to the first line of anti-mycobacterial immune defense and recognize the invading mycobacteria by virtue of various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Quesniaux1">[3]</xref>. Macrophages also function to secrete inflammatory cytokines and to present bacterial peptide to T lymphocytes, thus leading to a rapid activation of the adaptive immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Quesniaux1">[3]</xref>. Although a host can deploy a multitude of immune defense mechanisms against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, the bacteria is capable of surviving and persisting within host macrophages because of its repertoire of evading the host immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-HernandezPando1">[4]</xref>. For instance, <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> can limit the acidification and maturation of mycobacterial phagosomes to escape degradation by lysosomal hydrolases, preventing subsequent antigen presentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Bhatt1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Baena1">[6]</xref>. In turn, the host also evolves unique ways to combat intracellular pathogens, such as initiating autophagy to reverse the mycobacteria-induced inhibition of phagosome maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Gutierrez1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Deretic1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process which is involved in maintaining cytoplasmic homeostasis by degrading damaged organelles or misfolded proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Levine1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Mizushima1">[10]</xref>. The autophagic cascade is initiated by the engulfment of cytoplasmic cargoes by an autophagosome, which then fuses with a late endosome to form the autolysosome, exposing the inner compartment to lysosomal hydrolases for degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Levine2">[11]</xref>. Several markers of autophagy are well characterized, such as autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7) and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3). Atg7 acts as an E1-activating enzyme taking part in membrane elongation, while LC3 undergoes conversion of LC3-I into its lipidated form LC3-II and is specifically located on the autophagosome until being degraded during autolysosome maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Delgado1">[12]</xref>. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that autophagy is a crucial defense mechanism against a variety of intracellular pathogens, including <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Ogawa1">[13]</xref>, <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Birmingham1">[14]</xref>, <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Rich1">[15]</xref> and <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Gutierrez1">[7]</xref>. Induction of autophagy overcomes the trafficking block imposed by <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, thus increasing the acidification and maturation of mycobacterial phagosomes, and inhibiting mycobacterial survival in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Gutierrez1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that autophagy can be activated by physiological signals (e.g., starvation), pharmacological agonists (e.g., rapamycin), or immunological stimuli, such as TLR ligands and cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ and TNF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Delgado1">[12]</xref>. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a key role in inhibiting autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Levine3">[16]</xref>, and its activity is enhanced by Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Sanjuan1">[17]</xref>. Activation of autophagy is essential for initiating a protective response and adapting cells to metabolic stresses and immunological challenges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Deretic2">[18]</xref>. However, excessive autophagic activation, derailed autophagic trafficking or imbalanced degradation may produce pathogenic conditions, leading to cellular toxicity and death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Levine4">[19]</xref>. Therefore, autophagy must be tightly regulated. Although signaling pathways governing autophagy remain to be fully delineated, recent evidence suggests that several microRNAs (miRNAs) may participate in modulating autophagy by directly targeting autophagy-related genes, such as Beclin1 and Atg4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Fu1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>As a class of small non-coding RNAs, miRNAs are highly conserved between different eukaryotic species and function as key regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by targeting mRNAs for translational repression or degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Taganov1">[21]</xref>. It is reported that several miRNAs fine-tune the innate and adaptive immune responses to mycobacterial infection. For example, miR-125b decreases TNF production by directly targeting its 3′UTR, whereas miR-155 enhances TNF production by increasing TNF mRNA half-life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Rajaram1">[22]</xref>. miR-144* expression is elevated in active TB patients and functions to inhibit TNF and IFN-γ production and T cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Liu1">[23]</xref>. miR-29 suppresses IFN-γ production in natural killer cells, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by directly targeting IFN-γ mRNA, thus contributing to the host susceptibility to mycobacterial infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Ma1">[24]</xref>. However, the role of miRNAs in autophagy-mediated intracellular bacterial elimination remains unclear.</p>
<p>In the present study, we investigated the potential role of miR-155 in modulating autophagy and bacterial clearance in macrophages. Our study demonstrated that miR-155 expression was significantly induced after mycobacterial infection <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Overexpression of miR-155 promoted autophagy and the maturation of mycobacterial phagosomes in macrophages, thus facilitating the elimination of intracellular mycobacteria. More importantly, we identified Rheb as a novel functional target of miR-155 in eliminating intracellular mycobacteria. These findings provide a better understanding of host defense mechanisms in mycobacterial infection.</p>

<title>miR-155 expression is significantly increased <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> after mycobacterial infection</title>
<p>To determine the expression level of miR-155 <italic>in vivo</italic> in response to mycobacterial infection, miR-155 expression was tested in the lungs of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv (H37Rv) infected-BALB/c mice. miR-155 expression in the lungs of H37Rv-infected mice was approximately 2.5-fold higher than in normal uninfected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, p&lt;0.001).

<title>miR-155 decreases the survival of intracellular mycobacteria by promoting the maturation of mycobacterial phagosomes</title>
<p>To determine the role of miR-155 during mycobacterial infection, we next examined its effects on mycobacterial survival by colony-forming unit (CFU) assay. RAW264.7 cells were transiently transfected with miR-155 mimic or inhibitor, and then challenged with BCG, H37Ra or H37Rv at an MOI of 10. Our results showed that miR-155 significantly reduced the survival of intracellular BCG in RAW264.7 cells at 1 h, 6 h, 1 d, 2 d and 3 d postinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, all p&lt;0.05). Moreover, the survival of intracellular H37Ra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) and H37Rv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) in RAW264.7 cells transfected with miR-155 mimic were also decreased at the indicated timepoints postinfection (H37Ra: p&lt;0.01 at 3 d postinfection, and p&lt;0.05 at other timepoints; H37Rv: p&lt;0.05 at 1 h postinfection, and p&lt;0.01 at other timepoints).</p>

<p>(A–C) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with control or miR-155 mimic for 24 h followed by BCG (A), H37Ra (B) or H37Rv (C) infection at an MOI of 10 for 1 h, and intracellular mycobacterial viability was determined by CFU assay at the indicated timepoints. (D–F) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with control or miR-155 inhibitor for 24 h followed by BCG (D), H37Ra (E) or H37Rv (F) infection at an MOI of 10 for 1 h, and intracellular mycobacterial viability was determined by CFU assay at the indicated timepoints. (G and H) RAW264.7 cells were transfected with miR-155 mimic (G) or inhibitor (H) for 24 h followed by Texas Red-labeled BCG infection at an MOI of 10 for 1 h. Phagocytosis of mycobacteria was determined by flow cytometry. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. *, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01.</p>

<p>Additionally, transfection with miR-155 inhibitor increased bacterial survival of BCG in RAW264.7 cells at 1 h, 6 h, 1 d, 2 d and 3 d postinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, p&lt;0.05 at 1 h and 2 d postinfection, and p&lt;0.01 at other timepoints). Similarly, the survival rate of H37Ra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>) and H37Rv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>) also was enhanced in miR-155 inhibitor-treated RAW264.7 cells at the above indicated timepoints postinfection (H37Ra: p&lt;0.01 at 3 d postinfection, and p&lt;0.05 at other timepoints; H37Rv: p&lt;0.05 at 1 d postinfection, and p&lt;0.01 at other timepoints). To test whether miR-155 affects mycobacterial phagocytosis in macrophages, we transfected RAW264.7 cells with miR-155 mimic or inhibitor, and then challenged with fluorescein Texas red-labeled BCG at an MOI of 10 for 1 h. Flow cytometry was performed to measure mycobacterial phagocytosis in macrophages. Our results showed that neither overexpression nor inhibition of miR-155 had an effect on macrophage-mediated mycobacterial phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g002">Fig. 2, G and H</xref>).</p>
<p>We next explored the mechanisms by which miR-155 promotes the intracellular mycobacterial elimination in macrophages. To this end, we examined the role of miR-155 on the maturation of mycobacterial phagosomes, which is often blocked by mycobacteria to allow their escape from lysosomal bactericidal mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Top1">[25]</xref>. RAW264.7 cells were challenged with fluorescein Texas red-labeled BCG, and lysosomes were monitored by using immunostaining for lysosomal marker CD63 or staining with DQ Green BSA (DQ-Green, a fluorogenic substrate for proteases). Our results showed that miR-155 enhanced the fusion of BCG phagosomes and lysosomes by nearly two fold, as calculated by the percentage of co-localization of BCG with CD63- or DQ-Green-positive lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g003">Fig. 3, A–D</xref>, both p&lt;0.01). Rapamycin, an inducer of autophagy, was used as a positive control, and treatment increased the percentage of co-localization of BCG with lysosomes by approximately two fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g003">Fig. 3, A–D</xref>, both p&lt;0.01). Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-155 inhibits the survival of intracellular mycobacteria by promoting the maturation of mycobacterial phagosomes.</p>

<title>miR-155 induces autophagy in macrophages</title>
<p>It has been reported that the induction of autophagy promotes the maturation of mycobacterial phagosomes and the elimination of mycobacteria within infected macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Gutierrez1">[7]</xref>. To test the hypothesis that miR-155 induces autophagy in macrophages to enhance the maturation of mycobacterial phagosomes, we evaluated the autophagic activity in RAW264.7 cells using Western-blot and fluorescence microscopy to test the processing of LC3 (conversion from LC3-I to LC3-II) and the number of LC3 puncta, respectively. Real-time PCR data showed that transfection with miR-155 mimic significantly increased the expression level of miR-155 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), whereas transfection with miR-155 inhibitor markedly decreased miR-155 expression in RAW264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), and with or without BCG challenge. Western-blot results showed that transient transfection with miR-155 mimic activated autophagy in normal uninfected and BCG-infected RAW264.7 cells, as suggested by the increased the amount of LC3-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), while transfection with miR-155 inhibitor reduced the amount of LC3-II in RAW264.7 cells before and after BCG challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>

<p>The dynamics of LC3-II accumulation during the process of autophagy depends on both the conversion rate of from LC3-I to LC3-II, and the degradation rate of LC3-II by autolysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Delgado1">[12]</xref>. To further confirm the role of miR-155 on macrophage autophagy activity, we employed bafilomycin A1, an antagonist of vacuolar H<sup>+</sup> ATPase, to prevent luminal acidification and autophagosomal cargo degradation. Our results showed that in the presence of bafilomycin A1, transfection with miR-155 mimic in RAW264.7 cells increased the amount of LC3-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>), while inhibition of miR-155 decreased the amount of LC3-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>). Furthermore, autophagic activity was examined in RAW264.7 cells stably expressing GFP-LC3, in which the punctate form (type II) of the autophagy marker LC3 can be directly viewed by confocal microscopy. Overexpression of miR-155 led to the redistribution of GFP-LC3 from diffuse to punctate pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g005">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>, p&lt;0.01). Additionally, the effect of miR-155 on the distribution of endogeneous LC3 was detected by immunofluorescent staining. Results showed that miR-155 promoted the formation of LC3 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g005">Fig. 5, C and D</xref>, p&lt;0.01), which supports our Western-blot data. In addition, we confirmed the modulation of autophagy by miR-155 in normal uninfected macrophages by using an autophagic organelle-specific fluorescent dye monodansylcadaverine (MDC). The results of confocal microscopy indicated that the number of MDC-positive autophagic vacuoles was significantly increased in RAW264.7 cells after transient transfection with miR-155 mimic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g005">Fig. 5, E and F</xref>, p&lt;0.01). As a potent autophagy inducer, rapamycin markedly augmented the number of LC3 puncta and MDC-positive autophagic vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g005">Fig. 5, A–F</xref>). These data together demonstrate that miR-155 elevates the autophagic response in macrophages.</p>

<p>Next, we analyzed the formation of autophagosomes containing BCG in macrophages using confocal microscopy.

<p>To determine whether miR-155 enhances the elimination of intracellular mycobacteria via autophagy, we blocked autophagy by using 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Transfection with miR-155 mimic significantly enhanced autophagy and reduced the viability of BCG in RAW264.7 cells, and these effects were partly reversed by treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA, as indicated by Western-blot and CFU data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g007">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>). RAW264.7 cells also were transfected with specific siRNAs against Atg7, to block the autophagic response. Transfection with Atg7 siRNA dramatically decreased protein expression levels of Atg7 and the amount of LC3-II, indicating the efficacy of Atg7 knockdown and autophagy inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). More importantly, the miR-155-induced autophagy was markedly inhibited in the RAW264.7 cells co-transfected with Atg7- vs control-siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g007">Fig. 7C</xref>). And silencing of Atg7 attenuated the miR-155-mediated mycobactericidal activity, when compared to the control treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>).

<title>miR-155 post-transcriptionally suppresses Rheb by interacting with its 3′ UTR</title>
<p>To identify the specific target of miR-155 that modulates autophagy, bioinformatics analysis was performed with TargetScan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.targetscan.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.targetscan.org/</ext-link>).

<title>miR-155 induces autophagy and promotes the elimination of intracellular mycobacteria by targeting Rheb</title>
<p>The next series of experiments were designed to explore whether miR-155 promotes autophagy-induced bacterial elimination by targeting Rheb.

Transient transfection with a plasmid expressing Rheb effectively increased protein levels of Rheb and downregulated the amount of LC3-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g009">Fig. 9A</xref>). Furthermore, blocking autophagy flux with bafilomycin A1 effectively inhibited the degradation of LC3-II, and in the presence of bafilomycin A1, overexpression of Rheb also decreased the amount of LC3-II, when compared with treatment with control plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g009">Fig. 9A</xref>), indicating that Rheb overexpression dramatically inhibits autophagy in macrophages.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Autophagy has been demonstrated to play an essential role in the host immune response against mycobacterial infection. Nonetheless, the molecular basis involved in autophagy-mediated mycobacterial clearance remains largely unclear. Here we report a novel role of miR-155 in regulating autophagy and mycobacterial elimination in macrophages by targeting Rheb, which may provide a better understanding of the host anti-mycobacterial response.</p>
<p>Emerging evidence has shown that miR-155 is mainly expressed in activated macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-OConnell1">[26]</xref>, dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Ceppi1">[27]</xref>, B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Eis1">[28]</xref> and T lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Haasch1">[29]</xref>. miR-155 expression is up-regulated by a variety of inflammatory mediators and pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-OConnell1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Xiao1">[30]</xref>. Our study shows that miR-155 expression is enhanced both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> after mycobacterial infection, which is consistent with previous study showing the miR-155 induction in response to avirulent <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Rajaram1">[22]</xref> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Ghorpade1">[31]</xref>. Recent studies have revealed that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> purified protein derivative (PPD) induces a high expression of miR-155 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from active TB patients vs healthy donors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Wu1">[32]</xref>. These data implicate a potential correlation of miR-155 with mycobacterial infection.</p>
<p>Studies have revealed that miR-155 participates in various biological processes including oncogenicity, haemotopoiesis and inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Faraoni1">[33]</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies using miR-155 deficient mice have demonstrated that miR-155 is required for normal immune function of T and B lymphocytes as well as dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Rodriguez1">[34]</xref>. It is also reported that miR-155 promotes the development of T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cell subsets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-OConnell2">[35]</xref>, and attenuates the Th2 cell response by targeting c-Maf, a potent transactivator of the IL-4 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Suzuki1">[36]</xref>. Moreover, miR-155 contributes to the classical activation (M1 polarization) of macrophages and iNOS expression by targeting CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (CEBPβ), a hallmark of alternatively activated (M2) macrophage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Arranz1">[37]</xref>. These studies together implicate a potent role of miR-155 in the cellular immune response, which has been demonstrated as the major arm of host anti-mycobacterial defense.</p>
<p>As one of the most important cell types in the anti-mycobacterial immunity, macrophages function as the predominant responder cell against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection. The cells uptake and kill mycobacteria and by initiating an inflammatory response, but also provide a preferred hiding and replication site for mycobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Liu2">[38]</xref>. Therefore, precisely modulating of macrophage activity is crucial in the protective immunity against mycobacterial infection.</p>
<p>The exact role of miR-155 in macrophages during mycobacterial infection has yet to be elucidated. Studies have demonstrated that miR-155 enhances TNF production in human macrophages in response to mycobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Rajaram1">[22]</xref>, and TNF in turn elevates macrophage activity to eliminate intracellular mycobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Bermudez1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Flynn1">[40]</xref>, indicating that miR-155 might be required in the macrophage-mediated immune defense against infection. In the present study, RAW264.7 cells were infected with mycobacteria at an MOI of 10 for 1 h, and then incubated for another 1 h, 6 h, 1 d, 2 d, and 3 d, after removing the extracellular bacteria. Our results demonstrate that miR-155 promoted the maturation of mycobacterial phagosome and decreased the survival of intracellular BCG at all tested timepoints, indicating that miR-155 promoted macrophage-mediated bacterial elimination. However, it is reported that in some cases, miR-155 may display a different role in modulating mycobacterial survival. For example, Ghorpade et al. reported that overexpression of miR-155 in RAW264.7 cells promoted apoptosis and increased intracellular bacterial load at 96 h postinfection (including a 24 h infection at an MOI of 10 plus a 72 h postinfection incubation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Ghorpade1">[31]</xref>. Ghorpade's observation is inconsistent with others showing that induction of apoptosis in infected host cells reduces the viability of intracellular mycobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Fratazzi1">[41]</xref>, but could be explained by Lee's findings showing that high numbers of intracellular mycobacteria trigger macrophage necrosis that could promote mycobacterial survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Lee1">[42]</xref>. In Ghorpade's study, the percentage of viable cells was markedly decreased to 10% after transfection with miR-155 overexpressing plasmid plus BCG infection, thus greatly increasing the actual MOI during infection.</p>
<p>Autophagy has been proved to be a crucial element of the innate immune response against intracellular pathogens, including mycobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Levine5">[43]</xref>. In the present study, we demonstrate that miR-155 induces the processing of LC3 and the accumulation of LC3 puncta in both BCG-challenged and unchallenged RAW264.7 cells, which indicates that miR-155 accelerates the autophagic response in macrophages and reduces intracellular bacterial load. Moreover, we observed that inhibition of autophagy with 3-MA or silencing Atg7 reduced miR-155-mediated autophagy and bacterial killing. In addition, we found that in control mimic treated RAW264.7 cells, treatment with 3-MA dramatically increased the survival of BCG at 6 h, though the reduction of the level of LC3-II is modest. This may be explained by other reports showing that 3-MA promotes the survival of mycobacteria by suppressing nitric oxide production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Herbst1">[44]</xref>.</p>
<p>Autophagy not only elevates the delivery of mycobacterial phagosomes for mycobacterial killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Gutierrez1">[7]</xref>, but also enhances the presentation of mycobacterial antigens (e.g., Ag85B) to induce a protective CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Jagannath1">[45]</xref>. Both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that induction of autophagy effectively increases the intracellular killing of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Kim1">[46]</xref>, suggesting that targeting autophagy may be a potential therapeutic strategy for TB treatment. Interestingly, our results showed that inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA or Atg7 siRNA attenuated, but not fully blocked the miR-155-mediated mycobactericidal activity at 6 h postinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003697-g007">Fig. 7, B and D</xref>), indicating that in addition to autophagy, other alternative mechanisms may be involved in the miR-155-mediated bacterial elimination. Studies have demonstrated that macrophages also employ an oxygen-dependent system to control intracellular pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-ThomaUszynski1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-ViladelSol1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Dharmaraja1">[49]</xref>. Our unpublished data showed that overexpression of miR-155 did not influence iNOS expression or nitric oxide production, but slightly enhanced the production of reactive oxygen species in BCG-infected RAW264.7 cells (data not shown), suggesting that miR-155 may exert antimycobacterial function partially through enhancing ROS production.</p>
<p>Studies have demonstrated that miR-155 implements different functions in various physical, pathological and experimental conditions by repressing distinct targets, including, but not limited to, TGF-β activated kinase 1/MAP3K7 binding protein 2 (TAB2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Ceppi1">[27]</xref>, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Wang1">[50]</xref>, PU.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Vigorito1">[51]</xref>, CEBPβ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-OConnell3">[52]</xref>, Src homology-2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-OConnell4">[53]</xref>, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Tang1">[54]</xref>, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) p85 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Huang1">[55]</xref>. Most of these miR-155 targets are involved in modulating inflammatory response. Among these targets of miR-155, PI3K p85 plays an important role in regulating autophagy. However, our unpublished data from luciferase assay and Western blot demonstrated that miR-155 did not bind to the 3′UTR of p85, and had no influence on p85 expression in RAW264.7 cells (data not shown), which differs from other reports showing that miR-155 targets p85 in human B-cell lymphoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Huang1">[55]</xref>. Studies have demonstrated that different targets may be involved in different systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Faraoni1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Sun1">[56]</xref>. For example, miR-125b is reported to promote hepatocellular carcinoma cell apoptosis by targeting Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Zhao1">[57]</xref>, while miR-125b inhibits apoptosis of Hela cells and human immortalized myelogenous leukemia K562 cells by targeting pro-apoptotic proteins, Bak1, Mcl1 and p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Zeng1">[58]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the present study, we identified that Rheb is a novel target for miR-155. Rheb functions as a negative regulator of autophagy, by directly interacting with mTOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Sanjuan1">[17]</xref> and increasing the mTOR activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Garami1">[59]</xref>. Rheb activity is regulated by upstream kinases, such as Akt, AMP-activated protein kinase, and glycogen synthase kinase-3β, while little is known regarding the mechanism involved in modulating Rheb expression. It is reported that Rheb expression is increased in hepatocytes after Hepatitis C virus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Bose1">[60]</xref>, but reduced in RAW264.7 cells after treatment with hydrogen peroxide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Seo1">[61]</xref>. Our study indicates that miR-155 post-transcriptionally down-regulates the expression level of Rheb, thus activating autophagy in macrophages. Moreover, CFU results suggest that overexpression of Rheb reduces the ability of miR-155 to induce intracellular bacterial clearance, indicating that Rheb is the major target of miR-155 in modulating the autophagic response and mycobacterial elimination in macrophages.</p>
<p>A recent study showed that <italic>Shigella</italic> infection results in sustained amino acid starvation and mTOR inhibition, thereby triggering the autophagy response in host cells for innate host defense, whereas <italic>Salmonella</italic> only induces a transcient amino acid starvation, favoring mTOR reactivation and leading to autophagy escape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Tattoli1">[62]</xref>. These findings reflect the intimate link between host metabolism and autophagic response against invading pathogens. Our study demonstrates that mycobacteria-induced miR-155 targets Rheb, a positive regulator of mTOR signaling, which is crucial in sensing and responding to cellular nutrients and stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003697-Liao1">[63]</xref>, suggesting that miR-155 may have a potential role in modulating the metabolic signaling in host cells.</p>
<p>Collectively, the present study demonstrates that the miR-155 is induced by mycobacterial infection, and promotes autophagy in macrophages by targeting Rheb, conferring protection against infection with intracellular mycobacteria. Our study unravels an important role of miR-155 in autophagy regulation and mycobacterial elimination, which may provide useful information for developing potential therapeutic interventions against tuberculosis.</p>
