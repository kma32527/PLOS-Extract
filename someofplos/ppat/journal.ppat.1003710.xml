<p>Understanding African Trypanosomiasis (AT) host-pathogen interaction is the key to an “anti-disease vaccine”, a novel strategy to control AT. Here we provide a better insight into this poorly described interaction by characterizing the activation of a panel of endothelial cells by bloodstream forms of four African trypanosome species, known to interact with host endothelium. <italic>T. congolense</italic>, <italic>T. vivax</italic>, and <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> activated the endothelial NF-κB pathway, but interestingly, not <italic>T. b. brucei</italic>. The parasitic TS (trans-sialidases) mediated this NF-κB activation, remarkably <italic>via</italic> their lectin-like domain and induced production of pro-inflammatory molecules not only <italic>in vitro</italic> but also <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting a considerable impact on pathogenesis. For the first time, TS activity was identified in <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> BSF which distinguishes it from the subspecies <italic>T. b. brucei.</italic> The corresponding TS were characterized and shown to activate endothelial cells, suggesting that TS represent a common mediator of endothelium activation among trypanosome species with divergent physiopathologies.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>African trypanosomiasis remains by far the most devastating parasitic disease in Africa affecting both humans and livestock. The current control strategies are not efficient because of the increasing resistance to trypanocidal drugs, and the antigenic variation that impedes vaccine development. An alternative strategy aiming to neutralize the pathological effects of the parasite rather than eliminate it was proposed. Therefore, it is essential to understand the development of pathogenesis and characterize the pathogenic factors. In this context, we wanted to elucidate the host-pathogen interaction between the African trypanosomes and the mammalian host endothelium. For the first time, we clearly demonstrated that animal African trypanosomes activate the endothelial cells via the NF-κB pathway and cause a pro-inflammatory response <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> via their TS. By comparing four different trypanosomes species, we showed that they displayed distinct capacities for activation. For the first time, we identified sialidase activity in the human parasite <italic>T. brucei gambiense</italic> and showed that sialidases are the mediators of this endothelial activation, in both human and animal trypanosomes. Interestingly, the lectin-like domain of this enzyme was responsible for the activation rather than the catalytic site. This study brings considerable insights into the host-pathogen relationship and designates the sialidases as a perfect target for an anti-disease strategy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT) is a severe disease affecting livestock in sub-Saharan Africa throughout an area of approximately 10 million km<sup>2</sup>, and causing annual economic losses of several billion dollars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-VandenBossche1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Malvy1">[2]</xref>. The disease is characterized by severe anaemia, weight loss and immunosupression, leading to the death of the animal if not treated. It is caused by the parasites <italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic>, <italic>Trypanosoma vivax</italic> and to a lesser extent, <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>. Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness, affects mostly poor populations living in rural areas of Africa with ∼10 000 new cases reported per year according to World Health Organization reports. Patients suffer from progressive neurological dysfunction that culminates in death. Almost 90% of the reported HAT cases are caused by <italic>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</italic>.</p>
<p>During the course of infection, African trypanosomes remain exclusively extracellular and are found intermittently in the blood of the mammalian host as bloodstream forms (BSF). Therefore, these parasites are necessarily in contact, either directly or indirectly, with the endothelial cells. At a certain stage of infection, <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> and <italic>T. vivax</italic> invade internal organs, including the central nervous system, which requires direct contact with the endothelial cells of blood brain barrier (BBB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Masocha1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Grab1">[4]</xref>. On the contrary, <italic>T. congolense</italic> remains exclusively intravascular, but binds to the walls of capillaries of infected cattle and to bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAE) <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Banks1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Hemphill1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>The vascular endothelium is not only a permeability barrier but also a multifunctional “organ” that, among other functions, plays a critical role in regulating the immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Sumpio1">[7]</xref>. Endothelial cell activation is a central pathophysiological process allowing the endothelium to participate in an inflammatory response by triggering activation pathways of the cell leading to a rapid up-regulation of gene transcription. Furthermore, endothelial cells from different locations present a phenotypic variation and can generate different responses to the same stimulus.</p>
<p>NF-κB is an essential and well characterized family of transcription factors, conserved from human to <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and known to be a central mediator for numerous cell functions including the immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Caamano1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Liang1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Rahman1">[10]</xref>. Under normal conditions, NF-κB is bound to IκB (NF-κB inhibitor) and retained in the cytoplasm. In an infection context, a cascade of kinases is activated by the pathogen, leading to IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB translocation to the nucleus, where it induces the expression of NF-κB-responsive genes. Most products of these genes are crucial for the immune system and specifically for the establishment of an inflammatory response, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide synthase and leukocyte adhesion molecules. The NF-κB pathway plays a prominent role in regulating the immune response to parasite infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Mason1">[11]</xref>. NF-κB-dependent response of endothelial cells has been described for <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, contributing to cell invasion and inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Huang1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Dias1">[13]</xref>, which are important components in the development of congestive heart failure observed during Chagas' disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Rossi1">[14]</xref>. Likewise, the host's inflammatory response is a major pathophysiological factor in disease progression during African trypanosomiasis, hence the outcomes of this activation on the host pathogen relationship could be considerable. However, to our knowledge, no studies have yet examined the activation of endothelium by African trypanosomes, with the exception of one study on endothelial activation by <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Girard1">[15]</xref>, which was limited to a single endothelial cell model with no detailed characterization and did not further investigate the molecular mediators of activation. Such studies are of major interest as they contribute to the understanding of the host-pathogen relationship, which is the key to the “anti-disease strategy” to fight African trypanosomiasis based on neutralizing the pathological effects rather than eliminating the parasites. This concept was proposed as an alternative to control trypanosomiasis after the failure of classical chemotherapy and vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Authie1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>Sialidases (SA) and trans-sialidases (TS) are proposed as pathogenic factors in AAT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-AntoineMoussiaux1">[17]</xref> and their involvement in virulence has been extensively described in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Frasch1">[18]</xref>. In African trypanosomes, their role has been well established in the insect stages, where they mediate a trans-sialylation process (transfer of carbohydrate-linked sialic acids to an acceptor sugar on the parasite surface) of their major glycoproteins to form a protective coat that is essential for parasite survival in the fly gut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Nagamune1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-PontesdeCarvalho1">[20]</xref>. However, expression of TS and SA active enzymes was not clearly demonstrated in BSF of <italic>T. vivax</italic> and <italic>T. congolense</italic> and their role in mammalian hosts was not elucidated until recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Coustou1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Guegan1">[22]</xref>. In fact, SA/TS activities result from active secretion with a correlation with parasite load in the blood but also from passive release after immune-mediated lysis of the parasite, and fluctuate throughout the course of infection in the mammalian hosts. During this stage, SA and TS play a crucial role in the infection process, most critically in anaemia, via erythrocyte desialylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Guegan1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Nok1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Buratai1">[24]</xref>. Moreover, TS were shown to induce endothelial cell and B lymphocyte activation by <italic>T. cruzi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Dias1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Bermejo1">[25]</xref>, and given its prominent role as virulence factor in AAT, the newly identified TS of African trypanosomes BSF seemed to be appropriate candidates to mediate endothelial cell activation. However, the literature agrees on the absence of TS and SA activities in BSF of <italic>T. b. brucei</italic>, and to our knowledge no studies regarding SA and TS activities have been performed on <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> BSF.</p>
<p>Here we compared the capacity for endothelial activation of four different species of African trypanosomes, using primary cultures of BAE and both human and murine endothelial cell lines. These African trypanosome species, known to cause different physiopathologies, had distinct activation capacities, interestingly in correlation with the presence of SA/TS activity. Specifically, <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> BSF did not activate the endothelial cells, whereas <italic>T. vivax</italic>, <italic>T. congolense</italic> and <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> BSF were capable of endothelial cell activation <italic>via</italic> the NF-κB pathway. The different endothelial cell models we used allowed identification of organ and species specificities while characterizing the endothelial cell activation process. Kinetic patterns of activation and clear quantification of activated cells were established for the first time regarding an African trypanosomes/endothelial cell interaction study. We clearly demonstrated the presence of enzymatic TS and SA activity in <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> BSF and showed involvement of TS, most likely through their lectin-like domain, in endothelial cell activation, and subsequently in inflammation. Most importantly, our findings pointed towards the TS as a common mediator of activation among different species of African trypanosomes. These data reinforced the role of these enzymes as virulence factors involved, not only in anaemia, <italic>via</italic> their catalytic properties but also in inflammation development <italic>via</italic> their lectin domain. Moreover, these findings render TS a potential vaccine target, and given the established role of TS in the interaction of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> with its host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Fontanella1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Machado1">[27]</xref>, this vaccine could ideally serve against both American and African trypanosomes. Lastly, this study offered new insights into the host-pathogen interaction in African trypanosomiasis, which is essential for any attempt to control this disease.</p>

<title>Endothelial cells are activated by <italic>T. congolense</italic>, <italic>T. vivax</italic>, <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> but not <italic>T. b. brucei</italic></title>
<p>To determine whether African trypanosomes can activate endothelial cells, primary cultures of BAE were first cocultivated with four species of African trypanosomes: BSF of <italic>T. congolense</italic> (two isolates IL3000 and STIB910), <italic>T. vivax</italic> (Y486), <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> (1135 and LiTat) and <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> (AnTat 1.1 and 427). BAE were previously cultivated for 24 h in culture medium without serum to avoid the interference of serum components with activation of NF-κB. NF-κB translocation to the nucleus was studied by indirect immunofluorescence as an indicator of cell activation. For BAE in culture medium alone (control cells), NF-κB staining was mainly limited to the cytoplasm (data not shown). In the presence of <italic>T. congolense</italic>, <italic>T. vivax</italic> and <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic>, the nucleus of the majority of BAE became stained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003710-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Interestingly, staining was limited to the cytoplasm in the presence of <italic>T. b. brucei</italic>.</p>

<p>The percentage of activated cells (with stained nuclei) was determined by counting approximately 500 cells for each condition and at various time points, in order to establish the activation kinetics. Data was then normalized to the control by retrieving the percentage of cells activated in culture medium alone (control) representing the background activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003710-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). 78±2.96% of BAE were activated in the presence of LPS (positive control). Activation by both <italic>T. congolense</italic> and <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> started after 6 h of coculture, with 45±3.2% and 48.5±10.9% of cells activated respectively, whereas <italic>T. vivax</italic> activated BAE only after 16 h of coculture, with 35.9±3.5% of BAE activated. However, the number of parasites used in <italic>T. vivax</italic> activation assays was 10 times lower than for the other species, due to experimental limitations, which could explain the delay observed in activation kinetics. Finally, <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> did not activate BAE at all. Note that after 24 h of coculture, an increased rate of activation by serum components was observed in control cells and used to normalize the quantification, therefore results at this particular time point are probably underestimated.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Heterogeneity of endothelial cells reflects on NF-κB activation by African trypanosomes</title>
<p>Since heterogeneity of endothelial cells from different organs and species is well known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Garlanda1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Lim1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Janczyk1">[30]</xref>, it was imperative to analyse a large panel of endothelial cells. Here, a primary culture of BAE was studied as a preferred model, since cattle are a natural host for animal African trypanosomes. In addition, we tested 13 different organ-specific endothelial cell lines, from either human (H) or murine (M) origins: they are microvascular endothelial cells, with the exception of HUVEC and H and M Peripheral Lymph Nodes (PLN). H and M PLN also represent the high endothelial cells (HEC) phenotype. These cells have conserved endothelial cells properties, more specifically morphological characteristics (microscope observation), endothelial cell markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Kieda1">[31]</xref>, and a functional TNFα-induced NF-κB cell signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003710.s001">Fig. S1A and B</xref>). <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> showed that <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> did not activate the tested endothelial cells, regardless of their origin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003710.s001">Fig. S1C and D</xref>), whereas <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003710-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), thus confirming the results seen with the BAE. Interestingly, <italic>T. congolense</italic> activated murine but not human endothelial cells, with the exception of H PLN, which could be explained by its HEC phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003710-g002">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003710.s002">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003710.s007">Table S1</xref>). This suggests that activation by <italic>T. congolense</italic> is species-specific. Furthermore, <italic>T. congolense</italic> seemed to activate murine cells with preference for some tissues: M Brain, M Lung and M bone marrow (BM) were the most activated, 51%, 49.8%, and 40% of cells activated respectively, while M PLN, M Spleen and M Thymus were less activated, 25%, 29%, 24.6% of cells activated, respectively. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> with <italic>T. vivax</italic> also showed organ specificity: all endothelial cell lines were activated but neither M Thymus nor H Skin cell lines.</p>

<p>Murine (M) (A, B, and C) and human (H) (D, E, and F) endothelial cells from brain, lung, BM (bone marrow), spleen, PLN (peripheral lymph node), thymus, appendix, umbilical vein (HUVEC), intestine and skin were cultivated for 2, 6, 16 and 24 h with BSF <italic>T. congolense</italic> IL3000 (A and D), <italic>T. vivax</italic> Y486 (B and E) and <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> 1135 (C and F). <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> were similar with <italic>T. congolense</italic> STIB910 strain, <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> LiTat strain, and <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> 427 strain. Percentage of activated endothelial cells at each time point is represented as mean value±SD of at least three independent experiments. See also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003710.s001">Fig. S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003710.s002">S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003710.s007">Table S1</xref>.</p>

<p>The kinetics of activation showed an additional scale of variability between the 13 endothelial cell lines used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003710-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). For example, while 2 h of coculture were sufficient for <italic>T. congolense</italic> to activate M Brain, M Lung and M BM; M PLN and M Spleen required 24 h for activation. Not only did the minimum coculture time for activation vary between these endothelial cells, but also the peak of activation, which occurred at different time points depending on cell origin. For instance, M Lung were most activated after 24 h of coculture with <italic>T. congolense</italic>, while M BM were most activated after 16 h of coculture.</p>
<p>To summarize, our results showed that the African trypanosomes <italic>T. congolense</italic>, <italic>T. vivax</italic> and <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> did activate endothelial cells and, interestingly, <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> did not. Activation of endothelial cells by African trypanosomes was not uniform: specificity for species and for organs was observed, and a proper activation profile for each endothelial cell line was defined according to the activation kinetics.</p>

<title>NF-κB activation induces a pro inflammatory response in endothelial cells</title>
<p>In order to determine the consequences of NF-κB activation on the endothelial cell, three different markers, potentially regulated by the NF-κB factor, were studied: i) production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6; ii) modification of the expression pattern of adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1; iii) and nitric oxide production by NO synthase. These assays were performed on M BM and Lung, the two cell lines most activated by <italic>T. congolense</italic> and for which commercial antibodies are extensively developed.</p>
<p>IL-1β and IL-6 produced in the coculture media were measured at different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003710-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). As controls, endothelial cell lines were stimulated by 5 ng/ml of TNFα for 4 h (data not shown), or unstimulated to determine basal level of IL-1β and IL-6 (data not shown). In the presence of <italic>T. congolense</italic>, significant amounts of IL 1β were detected after 6 h whereas for IL-6, longer incubation periods were required: 24 h for M Lung and 48 h for M BM. This seemed to reflect the known autocrine effect of IL-1 β on the production of IL-6. M Lung activated with <italic>T. congolense</italic> produced high amounts of IL-1β and IL-6 that reached 52.9±4.56 pg/ml after 6 h of coculture and 102±8.3 pg/ml after 24 h of coculture, respectively.

<p>The expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on M Lung and M BM was examined by flow cytometry at 6 h, 16 h and 24 h of coculture with <italic>T. congolense</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003710-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). The modification in the expression pattern is evaluated by the ratio of median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of cells in the presence of <italic>T. congolense</italic>, over MFI of unstimulated cells. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> showed that in presence of <italic>T. congolense</italic> ICAM-1 expression in M Lung increased 1.79±0.26 fold at 6 h, and reached 2.42±0.32 fold at 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003710-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). The down regulation of ICAM-1 observed at 16 h is in harmony with the NF-κB activation kinetics of M lung and could be due to ICAM-1 shedding from membrane surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Melis1">[32]</xref>. <italic>T. congolense</italic> had no influence on VCAM-1 expression in M Lung, which is consistent with previous results showing that VCAM-1 is not inducible in this endothelial cell type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Lim1">[29]</xref>.

<p>Intracellular production of nitric oxide (NO) was measured by fluorometric assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003710-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).

Addition of Nω-Nitro-L-arginine, a specific inhibitor of NO synthase reduced it to 4.5±1.8%, 5.4±4.8% and 4±3.4% respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003710-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). This indicates that the observed increase of NO production was a direct result of L-arginine-dependent NO synthase activity.</p>
<p>Lastly, and as expected, <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> that did not activate the endothelial NF-κB pathway was unable to stimulate a pro-inflammatory response by neither M BM nor M Lung as shown by the lack of production of IL-1β and IL-6 and by a nearly absent up-regulation of ICAM-1/VCAM-1 on both endothelial cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003710.s003">Fig. S3A and B</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, activation of NF-κB induced the production of pro-inflammatory molecules by the endothelial cells, marked by the production of the cytokines IL-1β and IL-6, nitric oxide and expression of adhesion molecules.</p>

<title>Endothelial cells are activated via the classical NF-κB pathway</title>
<p>To determine which NF-κB pathway (classical or alternative) is responsible for the observed activation and subsequent pro-inflammation, we i) performed all assays regarding the pro-inflammatory response using JSH-23, a specific inhibitor of p65 subunit of NF-κB, ii) examined the phosphorylation of IκB, the inhibitor of NF-κB.</p>
<p>In presence of JSH-23 the increase of NO, cytokine production, and ICAM-1/VCAM-1 up-regulation were inhibited, indicating that this observed response was a specific consequence of NF-κB activation, and most importantly, <italic>via</italic> the classical pathway. Briefly, in the presence of JSH-23, cytokine secretion by both M BM and M lung cocultivated with <italic>T. congolense</italic> did not exceed 10 pg for IL-1β and 20 pg for IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003710-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>).

<title>Trypanosome TS are highly involved in endothelial cell activation</title>
<p>In order to determine if this activation was mediated by soluble factors released by the trypanosomes, we incubated BAE with i) <italic>T. congolense</italic> or <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> culture supernatant, ii) <italic>T. congolense</italic> cultured in a transwell: this permeable support insert prevents the physical contact between the two cell types, yet allows the passage of the secreted soluble molecules through a permeable membrane. <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref> showed that trypanosomes culture supernatant was sufficient to activate BAE (data not shown), and that physical contact was not essential for activation since BAE separated from <italic>T. congolense</italic> by a transwell were still activated (data not shown), which suggests that soluble factors were involved in cell activation.

<p>Moreover, silencing or knock out of TS genes impaired activation capacity of <italic>T. congolense</italic>. Four previously obtained mutant cell lines of <italic>T. congolense</italic> BSF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Coustou1">[21]</xref> were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003710-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). These mutants were less virulent in mice and the induced anaemia is lower <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Coustou1">[21]</xref>. The ΔA1-C cell line contained RNAi constructs designed to be relatively specific to only one subfamily of TS. The ΔA2-C and ΔB2-C cell lines contained constructs with highly conserved sequences shared by all <italic>TcoTS</italic> genes intending to silence active SA and TS. Finally, the knock-out KOL2 cell line was specifically designed to silence <italic>TcoTS-Like2</italic> encoding for an enzymatically inactive TS with a supposedly functional lectin domain. Although activity was not eliminated, an expected decrease in SA activity was observed in the mutant cell lines. The KOL2 cell line displayed 100% SA activity as expected since L2 is an inactive TS. Residual activity in mutant cell lines was expressed as a percentage of total SA activity displayed in the ΔGFP control cell line. Compared to ΔGFP, ΔA1-C, ΔA2-C and ΔB2-C mutant cell lines retained only 40±6.2%, 38±3.3% and 21.5±14.5% of their activation capacity respectively which is consistent with their residual SA activity: 45%, 35% and 25% respectively. Interestingly, the KOL2 cell line also displayed an impaired activation capacity (only 45.9±9.6% of activation capacity retained) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003710-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). This result suggests that catalytic activity may not be required for the activation process.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since no SA nor TS activity was detected in BSF of <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Coustou1">[21]</xref>, we overexpressed heterologous TS of <italic>T. congolense</italic> (TcoTS-A1) or <italic>T. vivax</italic> (TvTS2) in <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> BSF to determine the effect of this expression on the activation by this species. Expression of the heterologous TS after induction by tetracycline was confirmed by measuring SA activity in the modified cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003710.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). Tetracycline induced <italic>T. b. brucei TcoTS-A1</italic> and <italic>T. b. brucei TvTS2</italic> cell lines activated 56.8±13.9% and 79±11.9% of BAE respectively, compared with 1% of BAE activated by non-transfected <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003710-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>

<p>To further investigate involvement of the lectin domain of TS family members in NFκB activation, we produced a recombinant catalytically inactive mutant of TcoTS-A1 bearing a Tyr<sup>438</sup>: His<sup>438</sup> substitution with an intact lectin domain, based on the construction of a mutant TS of <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Dias1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Cremona1">[38]</xref>. Absence of SA and TS activities of the recombinant mutant TS was verified by fluorometric assay (data not shown).

<p>BAE cells were also incubated with different lectins. WGA, Mal, and SNA, which recognize sialic acid residues, were able to activate BAE, whereas ConA and succinylated WGA, which have no binding specificity for sialic acid, were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003710-g008">Fig. 8B and C</xref>).</p>

Pre-incubation with myricetin abrogated the effect of TcoTS-A1 as a competitor to Mal binding suggesting that myricetin could impair the lectin activity of TcoTS-A1. Myricetin alone had almost no effect on Mal or SNA binding, indicating that its inhibition of TcoTS-A1 lectin binding and subsequently activation of endothelial cells is indirect, possibly due to a steric hindrance after binding to the catalytic domain.</p>
<p>These results indicated that the process of endothelial cell activation involves the lectin domain of trypanosomal TS and most likely α-2,3 linked sialic acid on endothelial cell surface.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Host-pathogen interaction in AAT and HAT is poorly understood. As parasite strains resistant to chemotherapy arise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-AntoineMoussiaux1">[17]</xref>, the needs for accurate knowledge of this interaction are increasing, mainly to move forward to an anti-disease strategy, a promising method of controlling trypanosomiasis. During infection by African trypanosomes, an intimate interaction with the host endothelium occurs, and exploring it can provide considerable insights on the host-pathogen interaction.</p>
<p>Using indirect immunofluorescence, we showed that <italic>T. congolense</italic>, <italic>T. vivax</italic> and <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> were capable of activating endothelial cells through the NF-κB pathway, and more specifically the classical NF-κB pathway. In fact, immunofluorescent studies were conducted using anti-p65 antibodies, and inhibition assays using JSH-23 specific inhibitor of p65 subunit of NF-κB, a subunit implicated in the classical NF-κB pathway only. We also established that the Ser 32/36 of IκBα is phosphorylated, which is another characteristic of the classical NF-κB activation pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Liang1">[9]</xref>, and further implies an involvement of IKKβ, a kinase known to play a critical role in this specific phosphorylation.</p>
<p>Endothelial cell activation by the African trypanosomes was species and tissue specific, and each endothelial cell line displayed a specific pattern of activation kinetics. These findings are consistent with the well-known phenotypic variation between endothelial cells from different species and, moreover, from different locations within the same species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Sumpio1">[7]</xref>. Interestingly, the tissue specificity observed with <italic>T. congolense</italic> activation is consistent with the tropism to lung, bone marrow and peripheral lymph nodes observed <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Banks1">[5]</xref>. Nevertheless, the observed species-specific activation of endothelial cells by <italic>T. congolense</italic> remains to be elucidated. It may possibly be linked to a TS binding specificity given that endothelial glycocalyx presents vast differences among microvascular endothelial cells of different species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Janczyk1">[30]</xref>. On the other hand, some cell lines were activated by the parasites but not the recombinant TS nor lectins. This can be explained by a default of enzyme's accessibility to substrate, compared to a parasite that releases numerous molecules, such as proteases, which can expose specific substrates, making them more accessible.</p>
<p>Using species and organ specific endothelial cell lines seemed an effective strategy to avoid overlooking specific features of the trypanosome/endothelial cell interaction due to this phenotypic variation. This should be taken into consideration when selecting endothelial cell lines adapted for trypanosomiasis studies.</p>
<p>Several arguments supported a potential role of TS in endothelial cell activation, in addition to their key role in infection and anaemia in AAT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Coustou1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Guegan1">[22]</xref>. The fact that <italic>T. congolense</italic> and <italic>T. vivax</italic> BSF release these enzymes into the blood <italic>in vivo</italic> and into the culture media <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Nok1">[23]</xref>, makes TS potential soluble mediators of the interaction process. We consequently demonstrated this role by showing that recombinant trypanosomal TS activated the BAE, and that inhibition of expression of TS impaired the activation capacity of <italic>T. congolense</italic> mutant cell lines.</p>
<p>Significantly, trypanosome species that activated the endothelial cells possess SA activity in their BSF whereas <italic>T. b. brucei</italic>, which is incapable of endothelial activation, do not. Furthermore, over-expression of heterologous TS of <italic>T. congolense</italic> and <italic>T. vivax</italic> enabled <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> BSF to activate BAE. The controversial finding that <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> did not activate any of the endothelial cell lines, even though the closely related subspecies <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> did, could be explained by the fact that only <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> BSF expressed active TS. Here we detected SA and TS activities in <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> BSF and used mass spectrometry to identify peptides corresponding to orthologs of TbTS like-D1, TbSA B2 and TbSA B. However we cannot entirely exclude the possibility of presence of TbTS ortholog in <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> even though no corresponding peptides were found. Note that this protein was detected by the same technique in the procyclic forms of the parasite, as expected. Surprisingly, peptides corresponding to these same three enzymes were identified in <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> BSF. Even though expressed in both species, these SA seem to be enzymatically active only in <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic>. Only four amino acids differ between TbSA B2 and TbgSA B2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003710.s004">Fig. S4</xref>), and three between TbTS-like D1 and its ortholog whereas there are significantly more differences between TbSA B and TbgSA B. These substitutions are mostly in the lectin domain which could, therefore, affect sugar binding, and subsequently impair the SA/TS enzymatic activity and the activation capacity of <italic>T. b. brucei</italic>. This is consistent with previous studies describing punctual substitutions with major impact on TS activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Cremona1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Montagna1">[39]</xref>. This raises the question about the suitability of <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> as a model for the study of <italic>T. b. gambiense-</italic> caused HAT.</p>
<p>These results strongly confirm the involvement of TS in endothelial cell activation, but above all, they suggest that TS represent a common mediator of endothelial cell activation among trypanosome species that induce divergent physiopathologies.</p>
<p>More specifically, the lectin-like domain of the TS appeared to be predominantly responsible for the endothelial cell activation. Firstly, the knockout of <italic>TcoTS-Like2</italic> impaired the activation of BAE by <italic>T. congolense</italic> and secondly the loss of TS enzymatic activity by inactivating the catalytic site had no effect on the BAE activation. Additionally, commercial lectins recognizing sialic acid residues on the endothelial cell surface activated the BAE, which not only reinforces our results on lectin domain involvement but also, and together with the finding that desialylation of BAE surface inhibits their activation, points towards an implication of sialic acid in this trypanosome/endothelial cell interaction. TcoTS-A1 selectively inhibited the binding of MAL on BAE indicating that α-2,3 sialylated molecules act as potential receptors of TS on the endothelial cell surface.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the endothelial cell activation is apparently mediated by α-2,3 sialylated receptors on the endothelial cell surface, and TS of the trypanosome, most likely through their lectin domain. This result is similar in <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-mediated endothelial cells activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Dias1">[13]</xref> but as in <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, molecules bearing such sialic acids residues have not been yet identified.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this would be the first report showing a direct evidence of NFκB activation by lectins. NFκB activation by neuraminidase through sialidase activity is well known. It is mostly described for endogenous mammalian SA such as Neu1 desialylation of TLR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Amith1">[40]</xref>. It was also demonstrated with pathogen SA such as NanA of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Chang1">[41]</xref>. However activation by pathogen lectins is very poorly described. Only one study has suggested that streptococci stimulation of endothelial cells and subsequent release of cytokines involved lectin interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Vernier1">[42]</xref>. Interestingly, our evidence correlates with the role of inactive TS of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> in endothelial cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Dias1">[13]</xref>, which could suggest lectin involvement, thus promoting a novel role of lectin binding domains of trypanosomal TS in host/pathogen interactions.</p>
<p>NF-κB activation is known to impact on host/pathogen relationship in parasitic infections, in particular by regulating immunity and inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Mason1">[11]</xref>. Knowing that SA/TS silencing correlates with impairment of virulence in experimental infection with <italic>T. congolense</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Coustou1">[21]</xref>, and that recombinant SA/TS directly contribute to anaemia by erythrocyte desialylation and subsequent erythrophagocytosis, it was crucial to elucidate their role in inflammation. Here, we showed that NF-κB activation of endothelial cells induced a pro-inflammatory response <italic>in vitro</italic> shown by the production of nitric oxide via the NO synthase, of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6, and the expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, known to intervene in leukocyte recruitment during infections. Most importantly, our results demonstrate that TS alone can induce a pro-inflammatory response in mice.</p>
<p>This production of pro-inflammatory molecules could have significant consequences because it participates in the cascade of events leading to inflammation, a phenomenon that is closely related to AAT clinical symptoms and more specifically cachexia and anaemia, known as the major lethal features of AAT contributing to mortality. For instance, it has been demonstrated that NO can be implicated in host pathology by inhibiting hematopoiesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Mabbott1">[43]</xref>. Anaemia can also be partially linked to inflammation via non-specific erythrophagocytosis by macrophages hyperactivated by chronic inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Taylor1">[44]</xref>, and also via the IL-6 induced production of hepcidin, an iron regulatory hormone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Andrews1">[45]</xref>. Additionally, cachexia is mainly a consequence of excessive production of TNFα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Lucas1">[46]</xref> which is a major inflammatory cytokine. On the other hand, the late stages of HAT are characterized by parasites crossing the BBB and invasion of the CNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Masocha1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Grab1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Barrett1">[47]</xref> by mechanisms that are still not fully understood. One proposed model is that parasites could use leukocytes alteration to disrupt the integrity of the endothelial barrier to penetrate the nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Masocha2">[48]</xref>. Here we show a NF-κB dependent induction of ICAM1 and VCAM1 expression. These are crucial adhesion molecules in the process of leukocyte transmigration, therefore, NFκB activation by <italic>T. b. gambiense</italic> may potentially play a role in crossing the BBB, by increasing leukocyte migration and subsequently, parasite penetration into the CNS. However, TS presence does not necessarily imply BBB crossing, which probably involves other factors.</p>
<p>In summary, this work reinforces the role of TS as virulence factors in AT, and upholds the hypothesis that TS-induced NF-κB activation may contribute to inflammation, an important component in the development of pathogenesis during AT. Eventually, the already established anti-disease effect of immunization by TS in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Coustou1">[21]</xref> may be partially explained by its effect on the endothelial activation and the consequent inflammatory response. Here, we proposed a dual role for trypanosomal SA/TS in both inflammation and anemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003710-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). In fact, SA/TS are released very early in the infection course and cause erythrocyte desialylation, strongly contributing to the development of anaemia at least in the acute phase of the infection; at the same time, SA/TS activate endothelial cells leading to a pro-inflammatory response with outcomes on the immune system, anaemia development and potentially on BBB crossing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Masocha3">[49]</xref>. SA/TS might also participate in immune system activation as described in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Todeschini1">[50]</xref>. Other virulence factors are well known to intervene in this host/pathogen interaction, such as cathepsins and PAMPs (Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns). Cathepsins cause host injuries, anaemia and could participate in BBB crossing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Abdulla1">[51]</xref>. PAMPS, like CpG DNA, GPI-anchor of VSG, etc., interact with specific receptors, called PRR (Pattern Recognition Receptors) and trigger a host immune response leading to production of cytokines and other mediators that participate in inflammation, anaemia and host injuries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Kennedy1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Mansfield1">[53]</xref>. Finally, all these factors sustain a balance between parasite growth and its control, on which the host survival depends. Here we propose a model of the host/pathogen molecular cross talk showing the central role of SA/TS. In such a model, parasites use different strategies to trigger anaemia and inflammation. This configuration is consistent with previous results showing that mice models respond differently to infections depending on the trypanosome species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Magez1">[54]</xref>. It also explains why in field infections, the severity of the disease and its physiopathological features are widely dependent on the trypanosome species and its specificities, such as the ability to invade tissues, the genetic variability between isolates (especially from distinct geographical regions) and above all the host range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003710-Taylor2">[55]</xref>.</p>

<title>NO assay</title>
<p>For <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, M Lung and M Bone Marrow cell lines, or BAE were incubated for 6 h, 16 h and 24 h with <italic>T. congolense</italic> IL3000 strain and washed in PBS. Generation of intracellular nitrite was determined by adding 5 µM of 5,6 diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-2DA, Sigma) for 40 min at 37°C in the dark. Medium was removed, cells were washed in PBS for 15 min, and fluorescence intensity was measured with an Optima plate reader (BMG Labtech, Germany) (Excitation/Emission: 485/520). This assay was also performed after addition of 1 mM Nω-Nitro-L-arginine (Sigma), a competitive inhibitor of NO synthase. For <italic>in vivo</italic> assays, total nitrate and nitrite levels in mice sera were measured using a fluorometric kit (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sera were deproteinized by ultrafiltration through Vivaspin columns (Sartorius) prior to assay.

<title>Flow cytometry analysis of adhesion molecules expression</title>
<p>M Lung and M Bone Marrow endothelial cell lines were cocultured with <italic>T. congolense</italic> for 6, 16 and 24 h. Culture medium was removed and cells washed then detached by trypsin treatment. Endothelial cells Fc receptors were blocked by adding mouse serum (1∶10) for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with rat monoclonal antibody anti-CD31 APC conjugated (eBioscience) and rat mAb anti-ICAM1 or anti-VCAM1 FITC conjugated (Biolegend) for 30 min on ice, then washed in PBS. Data were collected on a FACS Canto (Becton Dickinson) flow cytometer and analysed using the FACSDiva software. Cells were gated for forward and side-angle scatters and 10 000 fluorescent particles of each gated population were analysed. The analytical method was described in the results.</p>

<title>SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting</title>
<p>Total protein preparations of M Lung (one confluent well of a 6 wells plate per condition) were obtained by adding 100 µl of 1% SDS with loading buffer and heating at 100°C in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail (complete Mini, EDTA-free; Roche Diagnostics, GmbH). 20 µl were loaded per well and separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) before transfer onto polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Membranes were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-IκB-α (Ser32/36) or anti-IκB-α (Cell Signaling) 1∶1000 in TBS (Tris-buffered saline: 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) 0.05% tween20, 5% BSA followed by horseradish peroxidase -conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Sigma; 1∶10 000).
