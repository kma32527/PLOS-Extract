<abstract>
<p>Gram-negative bacterial pathogens deliver a variety of virulence proteins through the type III secretion system (T3SS) directly into the host cytoplasm. These type III secreted effectors (T3SEs) play an essential role in bacterial infection, mainly by targeting host immunity. However, the molecular basis of their functionalities remains largely enigmatic. Here, we show that the <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> T3SE HopZ1a, a member of the widely distributed YopJ effector family, directly interacts with jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins through the conserved Jas domain in plant hosts. JAZs are transcription repressors of jasmonate (JA)-responsive genes and major components of the jasmonate receptor complex. Upon interaction, JAZs can be acetylated by HopZ1a through a putative acetyltransferase activity. Importantly, <italic>P. syringae</italic> producing the wild-type, but not a catalytic mutant of HopZ1a, promotes the degradation of HopZ1-interacting JAZs and activates JA signaling during bacterial infection. Furthermore, HopZ1a could partially rescue the virulence defect of a <italic>P. syringae</italic> mutant that lacks the production of coronatine, a JA-mimicking phytotoxin produced by a few <italic>P. syringae</italic> strains. These results highlight a novel example by which a bacterial effector directly manipulates the core regulators of phytohormone signaling to facilitate infection. The targeting of JAZ repressors by both coronatine toxin and HopZ1 effector suggests that the JA receptor complex is potentially a major hub of host targets for bacterial pathogens.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens rely on the type III secretion system, which is a specialized protein secretion apparatus, to inject virulence proteins, called effectors, into the host cells. The type III secreted effectors (T3SEs) directly target host substrates in order to promote bacterial colonization and disease development. Therefore, the identification and characterization of the direct host targets of T3SEs provides important insights into virulence strategies employed by bacterial pathogens to cause diseases. Here, we report that the plant pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> T3SE HopZ1a physically interacts with and modifies the jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins in plant hosts. JAZ proteins are components of the receptor complex of the plant hormone jasmonates (JA) and key transcription repressors regulating JA-responsive genes. HopZ1a belongs to the widely distributed YopJ (for Yersinia Outer Protein J) family of T3SEs with a potential acetyltransferase activity. <italic>P. syringae</italic> producing HopZ1a, but not the catalytic mutant, leads to the degradation of AtJAZ1 during infection. As a result, HopZ1a activates JA signaling and promotes bacterial multiplication in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. This work provides the first example of a bacterial effector that subverts host immunity by directly targeting the receptor complex of a defense-associated hormone in plants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A prevailing concept for plant-pathogen interactions highlights the continuing battles between the activation of plant immune responses upon pathogen perception and the subversion of host immunity by virulence factors produced by successful pathogens. One branch of the plant immunity system is based on the recognition of pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMP/MAMPs), which leads to a signal transduction cascade, and eventually <italic>PAMP-triggered immunity</italic> (PTI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Zipfel1">[1]</xref>. PTI, broadly referred as basal defense in plants, restricts the growth of the vast majority of potential pathogens encountered by plants in the surrounding environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Boller1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Jones1">[3]</xref>. However, successful pathogens produce virulence factors to effectively suppress PTI. For example, Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, such as <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic>, inject type III-secreted effectors (T3SEs) into the host cell to actively inhibit PTI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Block1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Galan1">[5]</xref>. As a counter-attack strategy, plants have evolved nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins to perceive specific T3SEs, directly or indirectly, and elicit <italic>effector-triggered immunity</italic> (ETI), which is often associated with localized programmed cell death at the infection sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Boller1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Jones1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Chisholm1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recent studies suggest that many <italic>P. syringae</italic> T3SEs suppress PTI and/or ETI by targeting important components of plant immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Galan1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Grant1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Xin1">[8]</xref>. Although the virulence targets of a few T3SEs have been characterized, the molecular mechanisms by which the majority of T3SEs subvert host resistance or facilitate nutrient acquisition remain elusive. HopZ1 is a <italic>P. syringae</italic> T3SE that belongs to the widely distributed YopJ family of cysteine proteases/acetyltransferases produced by both plant and animal bacterial pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Ma1">[9]</xref>. The YopJ-like T3SEs share a conserved catalytic core, consisting of three key amino acid residues (histidine, glutamic acid, and cysteine), which is identical to that of clan-CE (C55-family) cysteine proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Barrett1">[10]</xref>. However, several members of the YopJ effector family have been shown to possess acetyltransferase activity. YopJ and VopA modify their target proteins (mitogen-associated protein kinases and Ikkα/β) in animal hosts and the acetylation of these host targets blocks their phosphorylation and the subsequent defense signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Mukherjee1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Orth1">[12]</xref>. PopP2 produced by the plant pathogen <italic>Ralstonia solanacerum</italic> has an autoacetylation activity, which is essential for its recognition in resistant plants; however, whether PopP2 can modify its target proteins in the host remains unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Tasset1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Two functional HopZ1 alleles, HopZ1a and HopZ1b, have been identified in <italic>P. syringae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Ma1">[9]</xref>. HopZ1b is produced by <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>glycinea</italic> (<italic>Pgy</italic>) strains, which are the causal agents of bacterial blight disease on soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Ma1">[9]</xref>. HopZ1b<italic><sub>Pgy</sub></italic><sub>BR1</sub> (HopZ1b in <italic>Pgy</italic> strain BR1; hereafter HopZ1b) promotes <italic>P. syringae</italic> multiplication in soybean; whereas the closely-related HopZ1a<italic><sub>Psy</sub></italic><sub>A2</sub> (HopZ1a in <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>syringae</italic> strain A2; hereafter HopZ1a) triggers an HR in soybean cultivar Williams 82 and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> accession Columbia-0 (Col-0, wild-type) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Zhou1">[14]</xref>. HopZ1 mutants with the catalytic cysteine residues (C216 in HopZ1a or C212 in HopZ1b) substituted by alanines lose the virulence function or the HR-triggering activity, indicating that the functions of HopZ1 alleles require their enzymatic activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Ma1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Zhou1">[14]</xref>. In addition, HopZ1 has a potential N-terminal myristoylation site (Gly2) which directs the proteins to the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Zhou1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Lewis1">[15]</xref>. This myristoylation site of HopZ1a contributes to its avirulence function in both soybean and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Zhou1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Lewis1">[15]</xref>. However, it is not clear whether this myristoylation site is important for the virulence function of HopZ1a. HopZ1 exhibited weak cysteine protease activities in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Ma1">[9]</xref>. Recent studies showed that HopZ1a also possessed an acetyltransferase activity and could use tubulin as a substrate in vitro. Modification of tubulin is associated with the disruption of microtubule cytoskeleton, which may contribute to bacterial pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Lee1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>To identify potential host targets of HopZ1, we conducted yeast two-hybrid screening using a cDNA library of the natural host soybean and identified several HopZ1-interacting proteins (ZINPs). ZINP1 (2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase, GmHID1) is a key enzyme in the soybean isoflavone biosynthetic pathway and a positive regulator of soybean basal defense. HopZ1 induces the degradation of GmHID1, and hence a decreased isoflavone production in soybean, resulting in increased plant susceptibility to bacterial infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Zhou2">[17]</xref>. HopZ1 also enhances bacterial infection in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which does not have a putative ortholog of GmHID1. To understand the mechanisms underlying the virulence function of HopZ1a in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, we characterized another family of ZINPs, which were identified as jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins. JAZs are key transcriptional repressors of the jasmonate (JA) signaling pathway and major components of the JA receptor complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Chini1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Thines1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Sheard1">[20]</xref>. JA plays an important role in regulating plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Some <italic>P. syringae</italic> strains produce the JA-mimicking phytotoxin coronatine, which efficiently activates JA signaling to facilitate bacterial entry into plant apoplastic space and suppress defense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Brooks1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Katsir1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Zeng1">[23]</xref>. Therefore, HopZ1a may also target the JAZ proteins to promote bacterial infection. Consistent to this hypothesis, HopZ1a was previously reported to induce the expression of the JA/ethylene marker gene <italic>AtPDF1.2</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, indicating that it could activate JA/ethylene signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Macho1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we report that HopZ1a directly interacts with JAZ proteins of soybean and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. We show that HopZ1a induces the degradation of AtJAZ1, and promotes JA-responsive gene expression during <italic>P. syringae</italic> infection. Furthermore, HopZ1a functionally complements the growth deficiency of a <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> mutant that does not produce coronatine. All these activities depend on the intact catalytic core of HopZ1a, which acetylates JAZ proteins in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest that HopZ1a facilitates bacterial infection by manipulating the JA signaling pathway in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p>

<title>HopZ1a physically interacts with GmJAZ1</title>
<p>Using yeast two-hybrid screens, we identified the HopZ1a-interacting proteins (ZINPs) from a soybean cDNA library <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Zhou2">[17]</xref>. Among them, ZINP3 (Gm7g04630) was interesting because it shows significant homology to the Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins. We designated ZINP3 as GmJAZ1 because it is most similar (51% similarity in full-length amino acid sequences and 62% similarity in the ZIM and Jas domains) to AtJAZ1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. GmJAZ1 was then further pursued as a direct target of HopZ1a.</p>
<p>We first confirmed the physical interaction between HopZ1a and GmJAZ1 by in vitro pull-down using recombinant GST-HopZ1a and GmJAZ1-HA proteins over-expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. GST-HopZ1a or GST (empty vector) was purified from whole cell lysate using glutathione resins and then incubated with an equal amount of whole cell lysate of <italic>E. coli</italic> expressing GmJAZ1-HA. GST-HopZ1a-bound resins, but not GST-bound resins, provided enrichment of GmJAZ1-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003715-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), suggesting that HopZ1a interacted with GmJAZ1 in vitro. The catalytic mutant HopZ1a(C216A) also interacted with GmJAZ1, similar to wild-type HopZ1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003715-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) HopZ1a and GmJAZ1 interact in vitro. GmJAZ1-HA and GST-HopZ1a proteins were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Precipitation of GmJAZ1 with HopZ1a was determined by western blots before (Input) and after affinity purification (Pull-down) using anti-HA antibody. The protein abundances of GST, GST-HopZ1a and GST-HopZ1a(C216A) on the affinity resins after washes were detected by Coomassie blue staining.

Leaves co-infiltrated with <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> carrying GmJAZ1-cYFP+nYFP or cYFP+HopZ1a(C216A)-nYFP were used as negative controls.

<p>We next examined the sub-cellular localization of GmJAZ1 to determine whether it co-localizes with HopZ1a in plant cells. GmJAZ1-YFP was expressed in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> using <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transient expression. Yellow fluorescence was examined in the pavement cells of the infiltrated leaves at 48 hours post inoculation (hpi) using confocal microscopy. Fluorescence was detected both on the plasma membrane and in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003715.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Previous studies reported that HopZ1a mainly locates on the plasma membrane with a sub-pool of HopZ1a in the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Zhou2">[17]</xref>. These results suggest that GmJAZ1 and HopZ1a could co-localize in plant cells. To further confirm that HopZ1a indeed enters the nucleus, we performed nuclear fractionation of <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> cells expressing HopZ1a(C216A). The catalytic mutant HopZ1a(C216A) was used in this experiment, because the expression of the functional HopZ1a triggers cell death in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Ma1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Zhou1">[14]</xref>. Consistent with the previous confocal microscopy data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Zhou2">[17]</xref>, we detected the presence of HopZ1a(C216A) from both cytosolic and nuclear fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003715.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). These data confirmed that HopZ1a and GmJAZ1 co-localize in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> cells.</p>
<p>We further used the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay to determine the interaction between HopZ1a and GmJAZ1 in planta. HopZ1a(C216A) and GmJAZ1 were fused to the nonfluorescent N-terminal domain of YFP (1–155 aa, nYFP) and the C-terminal domain of YFP (156–239 aa, cYFP), respectively, at their C-termini. When the fusion genes were co-expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, fluorescence was detected on the plasma membrane and in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003715-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), consistent with the subcellular localization of GmJAZ1 and HopZ1a. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate the interaction of HopZ1a and GmJAZ1 in vitro and in planta.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Interaction with HopZ1a leads to the degradation of GmJAZ1</title>
<p>We have previously observed HopZ1-mediated degradation of another HopZ1-interacting protein GmHID1 when GmHID1 and HopZ1 were transiently co-expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Zhou2">[17]</xref>. Therefore, we examined whether HopZ1a can also induce the degradation of GmJAZ1. GmJAZ1-FLAG and HopZ1a-HA were co-expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, and the abundance of GmJAZ1 was determined at 20 hpi before the onset of visible cell death symptoms, which usually starts at 30 hpi. We chose 20 hpi because the expression level of GmJAZ1 was too low for protein analysis at earlier time points. A significant reduction of GmJAZ1 protein level was observed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves co-expressing wild-type HopZ1a-HA, compared to leaves expressing the HopZ1a catalytic mutant or infiltrated with <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> carrying the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003715-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). These results suggest that HopZ1a induces the degradation of GmJAZ1 in plant cells and the degradation requires the enzymatic activity of HopZ1a.</p>

<p>Incubation of GmJAZ1 and HopZ1a proteins purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> did not lead to observable changes in the abundance of GmJAZ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003715-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

Again, a significant decrease in GmJAZ1 protein level was observed in the presence of wild-type HopZ1a, but not the catalytic mutant HopZ1a(C216A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003715-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).

<p>To exclude the possibility that the reduced GmJAZ1 protein levels might have been resulted from cell death triggered by wild-type HopZ1a in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, we performed two control experiments. Firstly, we co-expressed the green fluorescence protein (GFP) with HopZ1a-HA or HopZ1a(C216A)-HA in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>. The GFP protein levels remained unchanged in the presence of either wild-type or the catalytic mutant of HopZ1a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003715.s003">Fig. S3A</xref>).

<title>HopZ1a acetylates JAZs in vitro</title>
<p>Several effectors from the YopJ family, including HopZ1a, have been shown to possess acetyltransferase activities.

The acetylation of GmJAZ1 appeared to be weaker in the autoradiograph compared to that of AtJAZ6. This is due to the low expression level of GmJAZ1 in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which only allowed us to use a much lower amount (1 µg), compared to AtJAZ6 (10 µg) in the reactions.

<p>To further confirm that the function of HopZ1a is specifically related to its ability to activate the JA pathway, we introduced HopZ1a into <italic>Pto</italic>DC3000 and performed the same bacterial growth assay. HopZ1a was previously shown to enhance the infection of <italic>Pto</italic>DC3000 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Lewis2">[30]</xref>. However, despite numerous trials, we did not observe any enhancement of HopZ1a on in planta multiplication of <italic>Pto</italic>DC3000. In fact, we consistently detected a decrease in the population of <italic>Pto</italic>DC3000(HopZ1a) compared to <italic>Pto</italic>DC3000 carrying the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003715-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). Thus, HopZ1a can partially substitute for coronatine to promote bacterial infection.</p>
<p>Because COI1 is required for HopZ1a-induced degradation of AtJAZ1, we then examined whether COI1 is also required for the virulence activity of HopZ1a in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. For this purpose, we generated <italic>coi1-1, zar1-1</italic> double mutant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants, which were inoculated by <italic>Pto</italic>DC3118 carrying the empty vector, HopZ1a or HopZ1a(C216A). The bacterial populations of these three strains remained the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003715-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>), confirming that the virulence activity of HopZ1a requires COI1. To further confirm that HopZ1a was unable to activate JA signaling in the mutant plants, we also determined the transcript levels of the JA-responsive genes <italic>AtJAZ9</italic> and <italic>AtJAZ10</italic>, as well as the SA-biosynthetic gene <italic>AtICS1</italic> after bacterial inoculation. Similar to <italic>Pto</italic>DC3000, <italic>Pto</italic>DC3118 expressing HopZ1a was also unable to induce the expression of <italic>AtJAZ9</italic> and <italic>AtJAZ10</italic> or suppress the expression of <italic>AtICS1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003715.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). These data suggest that both the phytotoxin coronatine and the effector HopZ1a activate JA signaling in a COI1-dependant manner.</p>
<p>HopZ1a contains a potential N-terminal myristoylation site (Gly2) which may direct the association of HopZ1a with plasma membrane in plant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Zhou1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Lewis1">[15]</xref>. We therefore examined whether the Gly2 residue was required for the virulence function of HopZ1a. The bacterial population of <italic>Pto</italic>DC3118 carrying HopZ1a(G2A) was similar to that of <italic>Pto</italic>D3118 carrying wild-type HopZ1a in <italic>Arabidopsis zar1-1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003715.s007">Fig. S7</xref>). This result demonstrates that HopZ1a(G2A) retained the virulence activity to promote <italic>Pto</italic>D3118 multiplication in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, indicating that the potential myristoylation site is not required for the virulence function of HopZ1a.</p>
<p>Taken together, our experiments showed that HopZ1a enhanced <italic>P. syringae</italic> infection in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> in a manner similar to coronatine, which is a potent activator of JA signaling during bacterial infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>T3SEs manipulate a variety of cellular processes in eukaryotic hosts for the benefit of pathogen infection. Emerging data suggest that bacterial pathogens have evolved various effectors to manipulate the signaling of JA and SA, which are important plant hormones that regulate defense response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-RobertSeilaniantz1">[37]</xref>. SA-dependent defense plays a major role in plant immunity against biotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens, such as <italic>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</italic> and <italic>P. syringae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Zheng1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-RobertSeilaniantz1">[37]</xref>. The <italic>P. syringae</italic> effector HopI1 directly targets Hsp70 in choloroplasts to suppress SA accumulation and thereby facilitate bacterial infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Jelenska1">[38]</xref>. In addition, the <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> effector XopD was also shown to repress SA signaling during bacterial infection of tomato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Kim1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-ODonnell1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Kim2">[41]</xref>. Here, we report that the <italic>P. syringae</italic> effector HopZ1a represses SA accumulation, probably as an indirect effect of the activation of JA signaling.</p>
<p>In this study, we report that HopZ1 directly targets JAZs, the key negative regulators of JA signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Chini1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Thines1">[19]</xref>. Because JA signaling pathway is antagonistic to SA-dependent defense, activating JA signaling would be an attractive bacterial strategy to suppress host defense and facilitate pathogenesis of these pathogens. Indeed, recent studies have shown a remarkable example in which the <italic>P. syringae</italic> phytotoxin coronatine structurally mimics the active form of JA and targets the JAZ repressors for degradation to efficiently activate JA signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Sheard1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Katsir1">[22]</xref>. However, it has been rather puzzling that only a few <italic>P. syringae</italic> strains produce coronatine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Hwang1">[42]</xref>. A previous study showed that a T3SE, AvrB, was also able to promote JA signaling, apparently through an indirect mechanism via the activation of MPK4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Cui1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-He1">[44]</xref>. We show here that the effector HopZ1a directly interacts with JAZs and at least some JAZs can be used by HopZ1a as substrates for acetylation. Importantly, HopZ1 mediates the degradation of AtJAZ1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and promotes bacterial infection in a COI1-dependent manner. This new finding raises the exciting possibility that JAZ repressors (hence the JA receptor complex) may be a common hub of host targets for diverse bacterial virulence factors. Consistent with this notion, oomycete pathogens were also found to produce effectors that interact with AtJAZ3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Mukhtar1">[45]</xref>. These pieces of evidence suggest that the JA receptor complex might be the Achilles' heel in plant defense system during the arms race with microbial pathogens.</p>
<p>HopZ1a enhances the in planta multiplication of <italic>Pto</italic>DC3118, but not that of <italic>Pto</italic>DC3000, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. A weak growth enhancement of <italic>Pto</italic>DC3000 by HopZ1a was reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Lewis2">[30]</xref>. We were unable to replicate the published data, probably due to differences in experimental conditions. Our experiments, including the JA-responsive gene expression, JAZ protein degradation and bacterial in planta multiplication, consistently suggest that HopZ1a activates the JA signaling pathway in a manner similar to coronatine. However, HopZ1a only partially complements the function of coronatine. This could be because HopZ1a is not as potent as coronatine in inducing the degradation of JAZs. Coronatine has dual functions during the pre-entry and post-entry stages of bacterial infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Zeng1">[23]</xref>, whereas the type III secretion genes are generally believed to be expressed after the bacteria have entered the apoplast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Rico1">[46]</xref>. Although it remains to be determined whether HopZ1a could promote stomata opening at the pre-entry stage, it is possible that HopZ1a mainly substitutes coronatine function inside the plant tissues. In addition, proteins might not be as stable as metabolites in planta, which may also explain the partial complementation of HopZ1a for the virulence deficiency of the coronatine mutant <italic>Pto</italic>DC3118.</p>
<p>As transcription regulators, JAZs are believed to function in the nucleus. However, HopZ1a was previously shown to mainly locate on the plasma membrane and this localization was mediated by a potential myristoylation site in the N-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Lewis1">[15]</xref>. Our protein-protein interaction and localization analyses showed that HopZ1a is also located in the nucleus and it interacts with JAZs both in the nucleus and on the cytosol/plasma membrane. Importantly, the mutant HopZ1a(G2A), which is abolished for its localization on the plasma membrane, was still able to promote <italic>Pto</italic>DC3118 infection. These data demonstrate that the membrane localization of HopZ1a is only important for host recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Zhou1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Lewis1">[15]</xref>, but not required for virulence activity. This is consistent with the primary localization of JAZs in the nucleus as transcription repressors.</p>
<p>YopJ-like T3SEs produced by plant pathogens appear to have various enzymatic activities. AvrXv4 of <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic> was reported to be a SUMO protease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Roden1">[47]</xref>. AvrBsT, also from <italic>Xanthomonas</italic>, exhibited a weak cysteine protease activity in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Szczesny1">[48]</xref>. PopP2 in <italic>R. solanacearum</italic> has autoacetylation and trans-acetylation activities in vitro, but it does not seem to acetylate its host target proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Tasset1">[13]</xref>. Recently, HopZ1a was demonstrated to acetylate tubulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Lee1">[16]</xref>. Our experiments showed that GmJAZ1 and AtJAZ6 are also substrates of HopZ1a. Importantly, we found that HopZ1a induces the degradation of AtJAZ1 during bacterial infection. In the presence of the active form of JA or coronatine, the F-box protein COI1 interacts with JAZs via the C-terminus Jas motif and recruits JAZs to the <italic>26S</italic> proteasomes for degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Chini1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Thines1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Katsir1">[22]</xref>. The fact that HopZ1a-mediated AtJAZ1 degradation is dependent on COI1 suggests that this degradation could also be dependent on the <italic>26S</italic> proteasomes as a consequence of JAZ modification by HopZ1a. Post-translational modifications, including acetylation, have been shown to induce or repress proteasomal degradation. For example, in mammalian cells, the acetyltransferase ARD1 acetylates Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), which promotes its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003715-Jeong1">[49]</xref>. Further investigations are needed to determine how HopZ1a-mediated acetylation of JAZs could facilitate COI1-dependent degradation of JAZ repressors.</p>
