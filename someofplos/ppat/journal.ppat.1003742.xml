<abstract>
<p>Adenovirus E4orf4 protein induces the death of human cancer cells and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Binding of E4orf4 to the B/B55/Cdc55 regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is required, and such binding inhibits PP2A<sup>B55</sup> activity leading to dose-dependent cell death. We found that E4orf4 binds across the putative substrate binding groove predicted from the crystal structure of B55α such that the substrate p107 can no longer interact with PP2A<sup>B55α</sup>. We propose that E4orf4 inhibits PP2A<sup>B55</sup> activity by preventing access of substrates and that at high E4orf4 levels this inhibition results in cell death through the failure to dephosphorylate substrates required for cell cycle progression. However, E4orf4 is expressed at much lower and less toxic levels during a normal adenovirus infection. We suggest that in this context E4orf4 largely serves to recruit novel substrates such as ASF/SF2/SRSF1 to PP2A<sup>B55</sup> to enhance adenovirus replication. Thus E4orf4 toxicity probably represents an artifact of overexpression and does not reflect the evolutionary function of this viral product.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The adenovirus E4orf4 protein when expressed alone at high levels induces the death of human cancer cells but not normal primary cells. It also is toxic in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, which we have used as a model system in some studies. Toxicity induced by the E4orf4 protein is largely dependent on its ability to associate with the highly conserved B/B55/Cdc55 class of regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), of which the mammalian B55α species is best characterized structurally. We showed previously that binding to B55α appears to inhibit PP2A activity against at least some substrates. In the present study, we mapped the E4orf4 binding site on both yeast Cdc55 and mammalian B55α and propose how such binding may inhibit PP2A activity. The implications of E4orf4 binding on PP2A activity are of significant scientific interest in terms of the process by which PP2A recognizes and dephosphorylates its substrates. We also propose that E4orf4 binding in the context of viral replication serves the quite different function of introducing novel substrates for dephosphorylation by the PP2A holoenzyme.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows the considerable amino acid similarity in critical parts of Cdc55 and B55α.

The crystal structure of B55α-containing PP2A holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) revealed that the β-hairpin arm on the bottom face of B55α interacts with the A subunit, and the C subunit binds to the other end through interactions with HEAT repeats 11–15 of the A scaffolding subunit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Xu1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Xing1">[51]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> phosphatase assays using purified PP2A subunits suggested that the top face of B55α possesses a putative acidic substrate binding groove, as mutations affecting residues Glu27, Lys48, and Asp197 decreased phosphatase activity against the substrate Tau <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Xu1">[50]</xref>. E4orf4 was found to reduce PP2A activity in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays and when expressed at high levels in mammalian cells to induce hyperphosphorylation of certain PP2A substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Li1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-OShea1">[52]</xref>. Additionally, low levels of okadaic acid or expression of I<sub>1</sub><sup>PP2A</sup>, both PP2A inhibitors, actually were found to enhance E4orf4 toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Li1">[12]</xref>. These results suggest that binding of E4orf4 protein inhibits PP2A activity against at least some substrates if sufficiently high levels are expressed and we believe that it is the failure to dephosphorylate substrates necessary for cell cycle progression that induces cell toxicity. The finding that E4orf4 toxicity is tumor cell-specific makes it a potential candidate for development of new cancer therapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Marcellus1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Shtrichman2">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Marcellus3">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Kleinberger2">[53]</xref>. Thus the establishment of the E4orf4 binding site on B55α/Cdc55 might further our understanding of the mechanism of E4orf4-induced cell death and facilitate development of small molecules that mimic E4orf4 action.</p>

With the present knowledge of the detailed structure of B55α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Xu1">[50]</xref> we revisited the possibility of identifying the E4orf4 binding site on both Cdc55 and B55α by introducing more meaningful mutations located on exposed surfaces. Using this approach we delineated regions of both Cdc55 and B55α involved in E4orf4 binding. In both cases E4orf4 binding occurs across the putative substrate binding groove, and with B55α, E4orf4 was shown to prevent binding and dephosphorylation of the substrate p107, suggesting that inhibition of PP2A activity may result from interference with the access of substrates to the holoenzyme. Nonetheless, we believe that the major function of E4orf4 during viral replication, wherein E4orf4 levels are considerably lower, is to target substrates such as ASF/SF2/SRSF1 to PP2A<sup>B55</sup> to enhance their dephosphorylation.</p>

Differences entail an extended loop in the region where the β-hairpin arm should be located, as well as an additional loop not present in B55α that protrudes from the bottom face of Cdc55 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g001">Figures 1B and 1C</xref>). The predicted Cdc55 structure also exhibits a putative substrate binding groove similar to that of B55α. We used site-directed mutagenesis to produce a series of mutants to map the E4orf4 binding site on both Cdc55 and B55α, targeting residues that were conserved between B55α and Cdc55 and present in exposed surfaces. All residues targeted in this study are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, and all mutations listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003742-t001">Tables 1</xref> (B55α) and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003742-t002">2</xref> (Cdc55).</p>

<title>Residues in both B55α and Cdc55 required for E4orf4 binding are located <italic>north</italic> of the putative substrate binding groove</title>
<p>Although many B55α mutants were generated and all rigorously tested, only data pertaining to mutations affecting E4orf4 binding will be discussed in detail. Mutations specified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003742-t001">Table 1</xref> were made in FLAG-B55α-expressing plasmid DNAs that were then transfected into H1299 cells along with HA-E4orf4-expressing plasmid DNAs to test E4orf4 binding. Results from co-immunoprecipitation experiments with protein extracts from these cells are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, where HA-E4orf4 was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibodies and western blotting performed using anti-FLAG antibodies to detect binding to FLAG-B55α species. Unlike the binding of wild type B55α to E4orf4, a charge reversal of Asp340 to Lys completely eliminated E4orf4 binding. Mutation of nearby Ile342 and Phe343 to Ala residues individually had either no effect or exhibited reduced binding, respectively; however, in combination the I342A/F343A mutant was totally defective in E4orf4 binding. Conversion of nearby Lys345 to Ala did not affect binding greatly; however, in combination the I342A/F343A/K345A mutant was totally defective. In studies such as these it is never certain that alteration of even a single residue might induce a significant change in overall protein conformation; however, results from co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that all mutants were still capable of associating with the PP2A A subunit, suggesting that little overall change in structure occurred. Thus Asp340 and Phe343 appear to be important for E4orf4 binding. These residues mapped to a helical region that protrudes from the top face of the main β-propeller structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, this region is located just “north” of the putative substrate binding groove, where <italic>north</italic> is defined relative to the orientation of B55α shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, and where the substrate binding groove runs “east-west” on the top face of B55α/Cdc55, with <italic>east</italic> located near the catalytic subunit.</p>

<p>Mutants were also generated in Cdc55, and again, only data pertaining to mutations that had significant effects on E4orf4 binding will be discussed. Mutations, as specified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003742-t002">Table 2</xref>, were made and plasmid DNAs expressing altered Cdc55 proteins were transformed into yeast cells. A strain lacking <italic>CDC55</italic> was used, to yield yeast cells exogenously expressing FLAG-tagged versions of wild type or mutant Cdc55, in the presence or absence of E4orf4 expressed from a second plasmid DNA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g003">Figure 3B</xref> shows results from an experiment in which Cdc55 mutants were assessed for E4orf4 and A subunit binding in reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation studies. Cdc55 mutants involving reversal of negative charge on Asp342, Glu345, and Asp347 individually, or in combination, were tested. Of the three, D347K had a pronounced effect relative to wild type Cdc55, and the D342K/E345K/D347K triple mutant was also incapable of binding E4orf4, even though all were capable of interacting with Tpd3. Alteration of these residues to Ala yielded similar results (data not shown). It should be noted that D347K is the yeast equivalent to D340K in B55α shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g003">Figure 3A</xref> that failed to bind E4orf4. Placement of Asp347 on the predicted structure of Cdc55 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g002">Figure 2B</xref>.</p>
<p>To correlate E4orf4 binding with toxicity, cell growth assays were conducted in the presence of either empty or E4orf4-expressing plasmid DNAs using <italic>cdc55Δ</italic> background yeast strains exogenously expressing Cdc55 <italic>north</italic> mutants under the normal <italic>CDC55</italic> promoter. <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003742-t003">Table 3</xref> summarizes cell growth assays as well as PP2A holoenzyme-forming capabilities of the Cdc55 mutants, where all mutants are compared to wild type Cdc55 and representative data are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003742.s001">Figure S1</xref>. All mutants were capable of reconstituting rapamycin sensitivity like wild type Cdc55, supporting the observation that all were capable of interacting with Tpd3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g003">Figure 3B</xref>. The ability of Cdc55 <italic>north</italic> mutants to bind E4orf4 closely correlated with E4orf4-induced cell death. E4orf4 was toxic or partially toxic in cells expressing the D342K and E345K mutants, respectively, both of which were able to associate with E4orf4; however, in cells expressing D347K and D342K/E345K/D347K that were unable to bind E4orf4, little toxicity was observed. Taken together, these results suggested that E4orf4 binds to comparable helical regions on both Cdc55 and B55α that protrude from the top face of the main β-propeller structure located just <italic>north</italic> of the putative substrate binding groove, and that this binding correlates with the ability of E4orf4 to induce cell death.</p>

<p>Cell growth assays were performed with these mutants, with results again summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003742-t003">Table 3</xref> and representative data shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003742.s002">Figure S2</xref>. All mutants were capable of reconstituting rapamycin sensitivity. E4orf4 was partially toxic in cells expressing E82K that was partially defective in E4orf4 binding. E4orf4 exhibited reduced toxicity with E84K and E82K/E84K/E85K/K86E that failed to interact stably with E4orf4. E4orf4-induced toxicity was low with mutants E85K and K86E, despite the fact that they were partially defective or apparently normal for E4orf4 binding, respectively. Thus unlike the Cdc55 <italic>north</italic> mutants, the ability of <italic>south</italic> mutants to bind E4orf4 poorly correlated with E4orf4 toxicity.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggested that this region of Cdc55 is also implicated in E4orf4 binding. Placement of Glu82, Glu84, and Glu85 on the predicted Cdc55 structure is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, indicating a region <italic>south</italic> of the putative substrate binding groove directly across from the helical region previously found to be involved in E4orf4 binding.</p>
<p>Because a region <italic>south</italic> of the Cdc55 putative substrate binding groove was implicated in E4orf4 binding, studies were conducted to determine if this region also plays a role with mammalian B55α. Corresponding mutations were generated and introduced into B55α-expressing plasmid DNAs and tested for E4orf4 and PP2A A binding as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g003">Figure 3A</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g004">Figure 4B</xref> shows that unlike the situation in yeast, B55α mutant E91A/E93A/E94A appeared normal for E4orf4 binding; however, all or almost all binding was lost when these amino acid alterations were combined with <italic>north</italic> mutations, namely I342A and F342A that alone exhibited wild type or only partially reduced binding, respectively. All mutants formed PP2A holoenzymes as all were capable of co-immunoprecipitating with the A subunit. These results suggested that this region of B55α <italic>south</italic> of the putative substrate binding groove is also implicated in E4orf4 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggested that the interaction of E4orf4 with the <italic>north</italic> region of B55α is much stronger than with the region to the <italic>south</italic>. They also suggested that with Cdc55 a significant interaction with E4orf4 takes place on both sides of the putative substrate binding groove. These differences in binding may not be surprising and the fact that E4orf4 binds both efficiently and functionally to Cdc55 reflects a remarkable conservation of structure from yeast to man. And importantly, the mutational analyses in yeast were invaluable, as it may not otherwise have been possible to implicate the <italic>south</italic> region of B55α in binding.</p>

<title>The E4orf4 and Tau substrate binding sites partially overlap</title>
<p>To characterize E4orf4 binding further, additional B55α mutants were tested as before. D116K and D197K, the latter previously proposed to be implicated in binding of the Tau substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Xu1">[50]</xref>, alone were capable of associating normally with E4orf4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g005">Figure 5A</xref>); however, binding was lost when these alterations were combined with the F343A <italic>north</italic> mutation, which alone exhibited only slightly reduced binding. Again, co-immunoprecipitation experiments involving the PP2A A subunit showed that the overall structure of the B55α mutants was mostly intact, as all mutants were capable of associating with the PP2A A subunit. These results suggested that both Asp116 and Asp197 of B55α are also implicated in interactions with E4orf4. The remaining residues proposed to be involved in Tau binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Xu1">[50]</xref> were also modified and mutants assessed for E4orf4 binding. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g005">Figure 5B</xref> shows that as with D197K, E27R and K48E alone were able to bind E4orf4 normally, as was the case with a mutant combining alterations in all three residues involved in Tau dephosphorylation (E27R/K48E/D197K); however, as previously seen when the D197K mutation was combined with the F343A <italic>north</italic> mutation, the combined mutant E27R/F343A also lost the ability to bind E4orf4. Interestingly, the combined mutant K48E/F343A exhibited no additional loss of E4orf4 binding when compared to F343A alone. These results suggested that there is considerable but not complete overlap in the binding sites of E4orf4 and the PP2A substrate Tau (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

<title>Role of E4orf4 in viral infection: E4orf4 targets ASF/SF2/SRSF1 to PP2A<sup>B55α</sup></title>
<p>We have been aware for some time that induction of cell toxicity may not represent the true role of E4orf4 during adenovirus infection. E4orf4 killing is dose-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Marcellus3">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Li1">[12]</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g008">Figure 8A</xref> shows by western blotting against FLAG that the level of E4orf4 expression during a typical infection with wild type Ad5 expressing FLAG-E4orf4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Miron2">[57]</xref> is more than an order of magnitude lower than that required for efficient cell death in routine killing assays where E4orf4 is expressed via plasmid DNA or viral vector. Thus other E4orf4 functions may be of much more importance to the virus. E4orf4 is known to facilitate the switch in viral mRNA expression from early to late genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Kanopka1">[58]</xref> and was found to interact with the SR proteins ASF/SF2/SRSF1 and SRp30c. Furthermore, E4orf4 point mutants that no longer associate with either PP2A or ASF/SF2/SRSF1 were found incapable of relieving the repressive effect of SR proteins on splicing of late adenoviral mRNA. These results suggested that the dephosphorylation of ASF/SF2/SRSF1 by PP2A alters splice site selection to allow late viral protein production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-EstmerNilsson1">[59]</xref>. Thus the actual role of E4orf4 in the infectious cycle may be to deliver critical substrates to B55-containing PP2A holoenzymes, including ASF/SF2/SRSF1, as it has been found to be an E4orf4 interacting partner (Teodoro, J.G., unpublished results; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-EstmerNilsson1">[59]</xref>).</p>

<p>Thus we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using EGFP-ASF/SF2/SRSF1, HA-E4orf4, and FLAG-B55α. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g008">Figure 8B</xref> shows that an interaction between E4orf4 and ASF/SF2/SRSF1 was detected, as found previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-EstmerNilsson1">[59]</xref>; however, we also observed that an interaction between B55α and ASF/SF2/SRSF1 occurred only in the presence of E4orf4, suggesting that E4orf4 targets ASF/SF2/SRSF1 to B55α-containing PP2A holoenzymes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g008">Figure 8C</xref> shows that whereas B55α associated with ASF/SF2/SRSF1 in the presence of wild type E4orf4 or the class II E4orf4 mutant K88A, no such association was seen with the class I mutant R81A/F84A.

Moreover, during the course of a 24 h infection with wild type Ad5 expressing FLAG-E4orf4, the interaction between ASF/SF2/SRSF1 and B55α was enhanced compared to a similar infection involving adenovirus lacking E4orf4. These results suggest that during adenovirus infection, ASF/SF2/SRSF1 is targeted to the B55α form of PP2A in an E4orf4-dependent manner.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our previous studies suggested that E4orf4 binding to the regulatory subunit B55α inhibits PP2A activity against at least some substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Li1">[12]</xref>. To determine the molecular basis for this inhibition we used a genetic approach to elucidate E4orf4 binding sites. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g002">Figures 2A and 2B</xref> summarize all mutations made in both B55α and Cdc55, respectively. The magenta highlighted residues on the B55α structure (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003742-t004">Table 4</xref> with their E4orf4 binding abilities relative to wild type B55α) in the PP2A<sup>B55α</sup> holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) indicate the location of mutations that reduced or eliminated E4orf4 binding. Similarly, indicated on the predicted Cdc55 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) are magenta highlighted residues (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003742-t004">Table 4</xref> with their E4orf4 binding abilities relative to wild type Cdc55), which represent sites on Cdc55 to which E4orf4 binds. Our current results suggest that E4orf4 binds to a distinct helical region of both B55α and Cdc55 located on the <italic>north</italic> side of the putative substrate binding groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This region of B55α was also identified in a recent study published while the present report was being prepared <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Horowitz1">[23]</xref>. The Phe343 residue identified by Horowitz <italic>et al.</italic> as being involved in E4orf4 binding was the only residue in common with our current study. Although this group identified Tyr337 as being involved in E4orf4 binding, in our hands this same residue converted to either Ala or Phe showed no loss of E4orf4 binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003742-t001">Table 1</xref>); however, both studies pointed to the helical region <italic>north</italic> of the putative substrate binding groove as a region of interaction for E4orf4. Horowitz <italic>et al.</italic> also implicated an adjacent helix region containing Phe280. We did not find this particular helix to be involved in E4orf4 binding as alteration of Glu283 had no effect. Nevertheless we did not systematically examine this helix and thus the E4orf4 <italic>north</italic> binding site on B55α may be broader than that proposed in our study. But importantly, in addition to this <italic>north</italic> region identified by both groups, we found that a region in both B55α and Cdc55 directly across and just <italic>south</italic> of the putative substrate binding groove is also implicated in E4orf4 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Amino acid alterations in this region had a greater effect with Cdc55 than with B55α as mutations in this area of Cdc55 alone were sufficient to eliminate interactions with E4orf4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) whereas combinatorial mutations were necessary with B55α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). These findings were not surprising as there are minor differences between the B55α structure and the predicted Cdc55 structure in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and clearly E4orf4 has evolved to associate with mammalian B55α not Cdc55. Nevertheless, binding of E4orf4 to corresponding regions of both Cdc55 and B55α appears to exert similar downstream biological effects in yeast and mammalian cells in terms of toxicity and cell cycle perturbations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Kornitzer1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Roopchand1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Mui1">[14]</xref>.</p>

<p>Correlation of E4orf4 binding with toxicity in yeast (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003742-t003">Table 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003742.s001">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003742.s002">S2</xref>) indicated that although a high degree of association was found between the E4orf4 binding and toxicity with Cdc55 <italic>north</italic> mutants, this correlation was less perfect with some of the Cdc55 <italic>south</italic> mutants. Perhaps such minor discrepancies, particularly with the K86E Cdc55 mutant, are comparable to class II E4orf4 mutants, which, despite being able to associate with B55α, are defective in cell killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Marcellus3">[7]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g006">Figure 6</xref>, class II E4orf4 mutants bind to B55α in a very unstable manner as may be the case for E4orf4 binding to the K86E Cdc55 mutant. The observation that some Cdc55 mutants that co-immunoprecipitated less well with E4orf4 were still partially able to transduce E4orf4 toxicity resembles results obtained by Horowitz <italic>et al.</italic> with B55α in very different analyses in which, using nuclear condensation and fragmentation as a measure of cell killing, they demonstrated only a small statistical reduction in toxicity even with <italic>north</italic> B55α mutants defective in E4orf4 binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Horowitz1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our data strongly suggest that E4orf4 binding to B/B55 subunits traverses the putative substrate binding groove and subsequently may interfere with interactions of some or all substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The distance between the regions <italic>north</italic> and <italic>south</italic> of the putative substrate binding groove of B55α is between 15 to 25 Å, a distance that could potentially accommodate a single E4orf4 protein molecule. Although the structure of E4orf4 has not been determined, it is predicted to be composed of three helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Horowitz1">[23]</xref> that could potentially bind to Cdc55 or B55α across the substrate binding groove. Our group and others have found that E4orf4 expression correlates with reduced PP2A activity against at least some potential PP2A<sup>B55α</sup> substrates such as p70<sup>S6K</sup> and 4E-BP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Li1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-OShea1">[52]</xref>, and we hypothesized that E4orf4 induces cell death by blocking the ability of PP2A<sup>B55</sup> to dephosphorylate key substrates. We now have strong evidence in support of this hypothesis as we demonstrated that E4orf4 inhibits the binding of substrate p107 to PP2A<sup>B55α</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g007">Figure 7</xref>). These results also validated the functional role of the substrate binding groove proposed for this region in a previous analysis of B55α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Xu1">[50]</xref>. Two of three residues shown previously to be implicated in Tau dephosphorylation, Glu27 and Asp197, appear to be involved in binding E4orf4, although the third, Lys48, was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), thus suggesting a partial overlap. Interestingly, Asp197 of B55α was previously found to be involved in p107 binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Jayadeva1">[54]</xref>, an observation confirmed in our studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that there may be an important overlap for interactions between B55α and its substrates and with E4orf4. We have attempted to conduct similar binding studies with Tau and certain other putative PP2A<sup>B55α</sup> substrates; however, we were not able to find conditions to detect stable interactions. It is possible that p107 may be retained more readily than most substrates because it is multiply phosphorylated. The fact that the E4orf4 binding site on B55α does not completely conform to the putative substrate binding site allows the possibility that binding of some substrates to PP2A<sup>B55α</sup> holoenzymes could still occur in the presence of E4orf4. Nevertheless E4orf4 could serve as a unique tool in identifying at least some as yet unidentified PP2A<sup>B55</sup> substrates.</p>
<p>Several scenarios by which E4orf4 could modify PP2A activity are possible. In addition to inhibiting PP2A activity, E4orf4 could target substrates to the PP2A holoenzyme, or E4orf4 binding could even modify the substrate binding groove such that it could accommodate new substrates; however, we believe that these functions are probably not crucial for the selective killing of human tumor cells. Inhibition of PP2A activity actually enhances toxicity in mammalian tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Li1">[12]</xref>, suggesting that PP2A phosphatase activity per se is not important for toxicity. Our model is that when overexpressed, E4orf4 titrates out the pool of functional PP2A<sup>B55</sup> holoenzymes, thus preventing dephosphorylation of substrates critical for cell survival. This effect might be informative in terms of PP2A function and, as E4orf4 kills human cancer cells preferentially, of potential importance for the development of new cancer therapies related to regulation of PP2A. Nevertheless, we consider that this toxicity represents an artifact of overexpression relative to its function during adenovirus replication.</p>
<p>We believe that the function of the E4orf4 protein for the virus is largely to deliver critical substrates to B/B55-containing PP2A holoenzymes. To this end we examined one substrate the dephosphorylation of which was known to be affected by E4orf4, ASF/SF2/SRSF1, an SR protein that mediates alternative splicing of late viral mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-Kanopka1">[58]</xref>. Studies involving E4orf4 mutants suggested that an interaction between E4orf4, ASF/SF2/SRSF1, and an active PP2A complex was required for E4orf4-induced SR protein dephosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003742-EstmerNilsson1">[59]</xref>. Confirming these early results, we showed that E4orf4 targets ASF/SF2/SRSF1 to PP2A<sup>B55α</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003742-g008">Figure 8B and 8D</xref>). Given these findings we believe that perhaps many additional targets that optimize adenovirus replication remain to be identified.</p>
