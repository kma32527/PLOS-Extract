<abstract>
<p>Prion diseases are driven by the strain-specific, template-dependent transconformation of the normal cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into a disease specific isoform PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Cell culture models of prion infection generally use replicating cells resulting in lower levels of prion accumulation compared to animals. Using non-replicating cells allows the accumulation of higher levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and, thus, greater amounts of infectivity. Here, we infect non-proliferating muscle fiber myotube cultures prepared from differentiated myoblasts. We demonstrate that prion-infected myotubes generate substantial amounts of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and that the level of infectivity produced in these post-mitotic cells, 10<sup>5.5</sup> L.D.<sub>50</sub>/mg of total protein, approaches that observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. Exposure of the myotubes to different mouse-adapted agents demonstrates strain-specific replication of infectious agents. Mouse-derived myotubes could not be infected with hamster prions suggesting that the species barrier effect is intact. We suggest that non-proliferating myotubes will be a valuable model system for generating infectious prions and for screening compounds for anti-prion activity.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>This manuscript describes the generation of a new cell culture system to study the replication of infectious prions. While numerous cell lines exist that can replicate prions, these systems are usually based upon proliferating cells. As mammalian cell cultures double approximately every day, prions established in the culture must also, at least, double to be maintained. This is problematic, however, as prions replicate relatively slowly and cell replication may outpace prion replication. In fact, many cell culture systems do not replicate prions and those that do often do not replicate all strains of prions. Here we describe the use of differentiated non-proliferative muscle cells to replicate prions without the interfering effect of cell division. We observed that prions accumulate to very high levels in this muscle cell culture with infectivity approaching that observed in animals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prions are the etiological agents responsible for the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. These neurodegenerative diseases affect mammals, are inevitably fatal, and are always associated with the accumulation of a specific post-translationally modified isoform of a normal host glycoprotein, PrP<sup>C</sup>. This abnormal conformation, the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> isoform, differs from PrP<sup>C</sup> structurally, resulting in dramatic functional consequences. While PrP<sup>C</sup> is readily degraded by proteases, soluble in detergent and rich in alpha-helical structure, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is typically characterized by resistance to proteinase K (PK) digestion, detergent insolubility, amyloid formation and β-sheet structure. <italic>In vivo</italic> the disease-specific isoform of the prion protein (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) accumulates to high levels, a process that is marked by a progressive neurodegeneration that is always fatal as well as the generation of hundreds of millions of lethal doses of transmissible prions.</p>
<p>Experimentally, prion infections are typically performed in rodents: wild type mice, transgenic mice or hamsters. Incubation periods are generally “short” (compared to prion infections of cervids, sheep or cattle), ranging from two months in hamsters and certain transgenic mouse lines to greater than a year for other mouse strains and agent strain combinations. Brain infectivity levels are extraordinarily high at clinical stage, 10<sup>9</sup> 50% lethal doses (LD<sub>50</sub>) in end stage hamster brain and 10<sup>8</sup> LD<sub>50</sub> in mouse models.</p>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> models of prion replication have been established by incubating infectious brain homogenates with various susceptible cell lines, most of neuronal origin, and all expressing PrP<sup>C</sup>, obligatory as a source for PrP<sup>Sc</sup> generation. Typically, dividing cells are exposed to brain homogenates, derived from infected mice, and the cells are then serially passaged until the inoculum is diluted out. PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulates to a steady state determined by the accumulative effect of prion replication, the dilutive effect of cell division and subsequent passaging, prion secretion into the media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Leblanc1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Alais1">[2]</xref> and prion degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Bueler1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Weissmann1">[6]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> replication of prions has been observed in numerous cell types including scrapie mouse brain cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Haig1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Haig2">[9]</xref>, fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Clarke2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Vorberg1">[11]</xref>, epithelia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Vilette1">[12]</xref>, glia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Markovits1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Roikhel1">[14]</xref>, microglia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Iwamaru1">[15]</xref>, PC12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Rubenstein1">[16]</xref>, Schwann cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Follet1">[17]</xref>, hypothalmic neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Schatzl1">[18]</xref> and neuron-like cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Dron1">[19]</xref>. By far, however, the most widely used cells for <italic>in vitro</italic> replication of prions are mouse Neuro-2a (N2a), neuroblastoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Markovits1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Race1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Nishida1">[22]</xref>. Prion infection of cell cultures typically results in relatively low levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and infectivity being generated. In the N2a cells, the level of infectivity is very low, ∼3×10<sup>3</sup> LD<sub>50</sub> per 1×10<sup>7</sup> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Race1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Butler1">[21]</xref>. When infected neuroblastoma cell lines are subcloned and highly susceptible sublines are isolated however, the infectivity can increase to ∼2×10<sup>4</sup> LD<sub>50</sub> per 1×10<sup>7</sup> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Race2">[23]</xref>. Alternatively, highly susceptible N2a sublines can be isolated and subsequently infected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Bosque1">[24]</xref>, allowing for cognate uninfected cells to be propagated as controls.</p>
<p>One difficulty in generating and maintaining <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures of prion infection is that the infectivity levels are low and some species and strain combinations do not result in infection or stable infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Bosque1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Bian1">[27]</xref>. Cell lines that divide rapidly tend not to support prion replication, presumably due to the dilutive effect of cell replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Ghaemmaghami1">[28]</xref>. One potential means of overcoming these effects is the use of post-mitotic, differentiated cells for studies of prion replication. Murine-derived C2C12 myoblast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Yaffe1">[29]</xref> provide an intriguing possibility as myoblasts are proliferative but following serum deprivation, terminally differentiate into post-mitotic myotubes, a syncytium of fused myoblasts. Muscle expresses relatively high levels of PrP<sup>C</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Brown1">[30]</xref>,which promotes muscle regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Stella1">[31]</xref>, and can harbour and replicate prion infectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Bosque2">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Angers1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>We report that differentiated non-proliferative myotube cultures can replicate prions to surprisingly high levels. Previous work with this cell culture system only observed infection, with 22L prions, when C2C12 cells where co-cultured with susceptible neuroblastoma cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Dlakic1">[34]</xref>. Our studies have focussed on the infection of myotubes, not myoblasts, an approach that may prove useful as the terminally differentiated cells do not divide, removing the dilutive effect of passage in assays of scrapie replication. This system more closely mimics the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation, where a less dynamic population of cells accumulates PrP<sup>Sc</sup>.</p>

<title>Expression of PrP<sup>C</sup> in terminally differentiated myotubes</title>
<p>Proliferative myoblasts are capable of undergoing terminal differentiation into muscle fiber-like myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). Spontaneous differentiation occurs at high cell density and after serum withdrawal. Fully differentiated myotubes are multinucleated, contain sarcomeres and can contract. Monolayers of myotubes can remain intact for weeks. Importantly, as a cell culture system for PrP<sup>Sc</sup> replication, myotubes express approximately one fifth as much normal prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) as brain normalized per mg protein and an equivalent amount to N2a neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g001">Figure 1b</xref>) though N2a cells are known to be variable in their characteristics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Chasseigneaux1">[35]</xref>. Slightly higher levels of PrP<sup>C</sup> are consistently observed in C2C12 myotubes compared to myoblasts. PrP<sup>C</sup> expressed in myoblasts is predominately di-glycosylated.</p>

<title>Myotubes accumulate PrP<sup>Sc</sup> whereas myoblasts do not</title>
<p>To examine the replicative potential of prions in a terminally differentiated muscle cell line and contrast them with non-differentiated replicative muscle precursor cells, we exposed both C2C12 myoblast and myotube cultures to RML prions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g002">Figure 2</xref>). C2C12 cells were propagated and expanded as myoblasts, seeded into individual wells or flasks, grown to confluence and differentiated into a layer of myotubes upon serum withdrawal. Myotubes can easily be infected with brain homogenates by diluting infected brain homogenate into the media. Myoblast cultures were infected as sub-confluent proliferating cultures, splitting as necessary to prevent differentiation. By passage nine, fifteen days after infection, accumulation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> was not detectable in myoblast cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g002">Figure 2b</xref>) consistent with the results of Dlakic et al. 2007 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Dlakic1">[34]</xref>. The infection of differentiated myotubes gave a very different result. We routinely observed accumulation of newly generated proteinase K resistant PrP<sup>Sc</sup> by 10 days post-infection in myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g002">Figure 2a</xref>). Levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> subsequently increased with time.</p>

Confluent myotubes were infected by incubation of cells in media spiked with 100 µL of 1% RML brain homogenate or mock infected with normal brain homogenate overnight. Media was changed daily. After 5, 10 or 15 days in culture, cells were lysed and analyzed for PK-resistant PrP. (B) Myoblasts were infected by incubating in media spiked with 100 µL of 1% RML brain homogenate or normal brain homogenate. Cells were analyzed after passages 7, 8 and 9 which correspond to myotube days 11, 13 and 15 respectively and no PrP<sup>Sc</sup> was observed. For both panels (A,B), 7.5 µg of protein was loaded in PK- lanes. 15 µg of protein equivalent was loaded in lanes treated with PK. 10 µl of 0.15% BH was loaded ∼11.25 µg protein.

<title>Myotube-generated PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is highly infectious</title>
<p>To determine the titre of myotube-generated PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, aliquots of cell homogenates were used to infect C57Bl/6 mice. To generate material for the bioassay, we infected T75 flasks of confluent myotubes with RML prions and harvested cells at indicated time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g003">Figure 3</xref>). 30 µL of this lysate was inoculated, intracerebrally, into weanling C57Bl/6 mice. A standard curve for infectivity was performed in parallel with mice being inoculated with serial 10-fold dilutions of RML brain homogenate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003755.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Mice inoculated with the infected C2C12 cell lysate (15 days post-infection) had an incubation period of 181.7 days. This suggests a level of infectivity approximate to a 0.3% brain homogenate from mice clinically affected with RML. Between 4- and 15- days post infection, the amount of infectivity present in C2C12 myotubes increased ∼10 fold and a statistically significant difference in incubation period was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g003">Figure 3</xref>). C2C12 myotubes accumulated 10<sup>5.5</sup> LD<sub>50</sub>/mg protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) as calculated based upon comparison of incubation periods from C2C12 derived material compared to standard 10-fold dilutions of RML brain homogenate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). 10% RML brain homogenate contained 10<sup>7</sup> LD<sub>50</sub>/mg protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<title>C2C12 myotubes replicate prions to high levels of infectivity.</title>
<p>(A) C2C12 myotubes infected with RML were collected at 4 or 15 days post infection by scraping in PBS, centrifuging and resuspending in 500 µL of water. 30 µL of this cell material was inoculated intracranially into weanling C57Bl/6 mice. A statistically significant difference in incubation period was observed between 4 and 15 days indicative of prion replication p&lt;0.05. Parallel inoculation of serial 10-fold dilutions of RML brain homogenates were performed. (B) Plot of infectivity in each inocula standardized per gram of protein inoculated. C2C12 myotubes infected with RML were collected at 4, 6, 8, 10, 13 and 15 days post-infection as in (A) and bioassayed. Infectivity of the C2C12 derived samples was calculated by comparing the observed incubation periods from each sample with those from brain homogenate dilutions and normalizing the data to protein content. Prion infectivity increases in C2C12 myotube cultures from day 4 to day 15 post-infection.</p>

<title>PrP<sup>Sc</sup> replication in myotubes does not cause any overt cellular pathology</title>
<p>Cell cultures containing prion-infected and mock-infected myotubes were observed daily. Over the time course of the experiments (up to 21 days), no cell loss was observed in prion-infected plates as compared to mock-infected. To examine the cells for molecular responses to prion infection, gene expression profiling was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Expression profiles from infected and uninfected cells were similar and no genes were up-regulated greater than 2-fold by prion infection. Two genes were downregulated by &gt;2-fold by prion infection, Carbonic anhydrase 3 and 2310046K23Rik, an un-annotated transcript. No genes were differentially regulated to an 85% confidence interval as assessed by T-test and a FDR based approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Benjamini1">[36]</xref>. Subsequently, we examined those genes which were up-regulated in C2C12 cells infected with prion disease by submitting the “top 20” genes to the Prion Disease Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://prion.systemsbiology.net/" xlink:type="simple">http://prion.systemsbiology.net/</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Hwang1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Gehlenborg1">[38]</xref> for which annotations were known. The genes were up-regulated in infected tubes between 1.36 and 1.6 fold. Four of the genes in the “top 20 list” (Iigp1, tgfb1, ifit1, Aldh1l2) were found to be up-regulated in brains of prion-infected mice suggesting that the changes observed might contain a prion-specific signature.</p>

<p>To compare PrP<sup>Sc</sup> levels in prion-susceptible mouse cell lines, following exposure to RML agent, total protein (100 µg) collected from infected cell lysates and from infected brain homogenates was subjected to PK digestion (50 µg/mL final concentration). Strong signals were observed in the prion-infected C2C12 samples and the brain homogenates. Weaker PrP<sup>Sc</sup> levels were observed in the N2a and SMB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g005">Figure 5</xref>). To semi-quantify the differences in signal intensity, we digested and loaded ten times more total protein from infected myotubes than RML brain homogenate and ten times more N2a and SMB cell protein than myotube protein. These data indicate the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> generation in C2C12 cells is considerably more robust than the other cell culture systems and within an order of magnitude of RML-infected brain homogenates.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have demonstrated that non-replicative myotube cultures can readily be infected with mouse prion agent. PrP<sup>Sc</sup> replication occurs in a short period of time, is robust, and levels of infectivity are relatively high. Input mouse brain homogenate-derived PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, evidenced by dominance of the mono-glycosylated band, routinely became undetectable after 5 days post-exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g008">8</xref>). As media was changed daily, it is remains unclear whether the input PrP<sup>Sc</sup> was actively degraded by the cells or diluted out by media changes. Three lines of evidence suggest that the C2C12 myotubes are replicating prions: 1) in scrapie mouse brain homogenate, the inocula used on our cells, the dominant band of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is monoglycosylated, whereas the C2C12-generated PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is predominantly diglycosylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g008">8</xref>). The shift in the glycosylation pattern allows us to discriminate between input material and de novo generated material (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003755.s002">Figure S2</xref>); 2) HY TME prions were only detectable at 5 days post-exposure suggesting agent does not persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g008">Figure 8</xref>); and 3) bioassay of cell lysates demonstrated an increase in infectivity over the course of the cell infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> observed is due to replication and not persistence.</p>
<p>Although this is the first study to establish prion infection in C2C12 myotubes, we are not the first to attempt infection of C2C12 cells. Dlakic et al. established infections of C2C12 cells with 22L prions but only when co-cultured with susceptible N2a cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Dlakic1">[34]</xref>. We were unsuccessful in infecting myoblasts but consistently infected myotubes directly, i.e., without co-infection with N2a cells. The successful infection of myotubes with 22L, ME7 and RML suggests that the differences observed are a result of both prion strain used for infection and/or the differentiation state of the C2C12 cells. Infection of myotubes with RML and ME7 was more robust than with 22L and we were only successful in infecting completely differentiated myotubes.</p>
<p>Typical proliferative cell cultures are constantly dividing and must be split. This means that, for prion infections to be maintained in culture, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> replication must outpace cell replication and degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Ghaemmaghami1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Weissmann2">[43]</xref>. This is especially important considering that cell lines replicate at different rates. We observe that C2C12 myoblasts double every 18 hours. Contrast this cellular replication rate with <italic>in vivo</italic> accumulation (replication and degradation) of prions, a process that can take years to fulminate in clinical disease. The replication rate of cell lines may explain the differential susceptibility of different cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Vorberg1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Nishida1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Bosque1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Rubenstein2">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Mahal1">[47]</xref> or clonally-derived sub-lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Bosque1">[24]</xref> to infection with different prion strains. In C2C12 cells, we observed replication of 3 different strains of prions, albeit with different levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> at 14 days post-exposure. Another issue with proliferating cell lines is the potential genomic instability of these cells. For example, the median chromosome number of the N2a neuroblastoma cell line is 95 and the range is 59–193 (ATCC datasheet, CCL-131). By contrast, C2C12 myoblasts are diploid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Hardeman1">[48]</xref>. It is clear that stochastic genetic drift of chromosome number over generations of cell culture could cause changes in cell replication rate and/or PrP<sup>C</sup> expression, both of which may affect PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation or molecular responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Chasseigneaux1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Julius1">[49]</xref>. Finally, proliferative adherent cell cultures are routinely passaged by trypsinization. Since PrP<sup>C</sup> is expressed on the cell surface, and cleaved by trypsinization, passaging cells may result in a temporary decrease of PrP<sup>C</sup> required for conversion. Myotube cultures, by contrast, are relatively static allowing direct comparison between parallel plates where the influence of cell division (replication rate, changes in chromosomal abnormalities, effect of trypsinization, etc) is removed.</p>
<p>Myotubes can accumulate substantial PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and associated infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We routinely observe robust PrP<sup>Sc</sup> signals from infected myotubes when loading only 10 µg of PK-digested total protein equivalent. Our data suggest that ∼10 fold higher levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> are being generated in C2C12 myotube culture than in common N2a cells. While we observed substantially higher levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in C2C12 myotubes compared with chronically infected N2a cells, the heterogeneity of N2a cells with respect to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> replication cautions against concluding with respect to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> levels in general. Many different sublines of N2a cells can be isolated some which fail to replicate PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and others which are quite prolific. Subclones of infected N2a cells accumulate 1 LD<sub>50</sub> per 158 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Race3">[50]</xref> or per 500 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Butler1">[21]</xref>, suggesting a titre of approximately10<sup>4</sup> LD<sub>50</sub> per 1×10<sup>7</sup> cells. A T75 flask of C2C12 myotubes at 15 days post infection contains 10<sup>6</sup> LD<sub>50</sub>; as C2C12 myotubes form a monolayer of non-proliferative multinucleated myofibers, titre cannot be expressed as LD<sub>50</sub> per cell, however, a confluent 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask of non-differentiated C2C12 myoblasts contains ∼1×10<sup>7</sup> cells. This result is comparable to that observed in differentiated PC12 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Rubenstein2">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Rubenstein3">[51]</xref> suggesting a similar conclusion, that differentiated non-replicative cells can accumulate prion infectivity to high levels. Importantly, C2C12 myotubes are not of neuronal origin, implying that the non-replicative differentiated state, and not the neuronal state, is the critical factor for allowing high levels of infectivity to accumulate in both C2C12 and PC12 cells.</p>
<p>We did not detect overt effects of prion infection in C2C12 myotubes as assessed by cell morphology or gene expression profiling despite the accumulation of appreciable levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and infectivity. This apparent lack of cell toxicity has been observed in most cell cultures systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Julius1">[49]</xref> for <italic>ex-vivo</italic> PrP<sup>Sc</sup> replication, excepting GT-1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Schatzl1">[18]</xref>. The accumulation of high levels of infectivity in C2C12 myotubes and PC12 cells absent any observable cytopathic effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Rubenstein3">[51]</xref> suggests that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> itself is generally non-toxic to cultured cells; the cytoxicity appears to be specific to neurons in the central nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Mallucci1">[52]</xref>. This strongly suggests that the apparent lethality of prion disease must be due at least in part to the multiple cell types or complex architecture present in the CNS.</p>
<p>To examine the potential of myotubes to serve as a model system for assay of prion inhibition, we tested pentosan polysulfate (PPS), a well-established molecule with known anti-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> replication properties, for its ability to hinder PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation in the myotubes. PPS inhibited PrP<sup>Sc</sup> replication in the myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g006">Figure 6</xref>) but its efficacy was less than that observed in proliferative systems where PPS treatment and cell passage can completely remove infectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Caughey1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Birkett1">[40]</xref>. It is likely that, in cultured replicating cells, the dilutive effect of cell passage coupled with the PPS inhibition of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> replication enhances the apparent effect of PPS. This observation supports the suggestion by Weissmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Weissmann1">[6]</xref> of that current proliferative cell-based models for assay of inhibition of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> replication are inadequate. <italic>In vivo</italic>, there is no comparable dilution of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> to that created by the serial passage of proliferative cell cultures. Treatment of infected myotubes with PPS also extended the time that inocula, as indicated by dominance of mono-glycosylated PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, persisted in the culture. A strong signal from carry-over inocula is present at day 4 in PPS treated cells and seems to persist longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g006">Figure 6b</xref>) than in myotubes without PPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g006">Figure 6a</xref>). One possibility is that PPS enhances the binding of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> to cells preventing it being washed out by media changes. Alternatively, PPS may interfere with degradation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>.</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic>, transmission of hamster HY or white-tailed deer CWD prions to mice is not efficacious and is associated with a large species barrier<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Prusiner1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003755-Raymond1">[54]</xref>. We examined our cell-based assay for prion replication fidelity by challenging C2C12 myotubes with hamster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003755-g008">Figure 8</xref>) and deer prions and were unable to replicate prions from either species, consistent with the normal host range of these agents. This suggests that C2C12 myotubes may be a good model system with which to probe species barriers and prion adaptation, at least with regard to mouse prion protein.</p>
<p>In summary, we have developed a novel, non-proliferative cell culture system that replicates prion infectivity to high levels generating substantial amounts of protease-resistant prion protein. This approach may be useful for probing prion strain and species barrier phenomena. Moreover, this system may allow a better assessment of putative anti-scrapie compounds as it removes the confounding effect of cell-replication from that of prion replication. We are currently adapting the myotube system for use with other prion agents.</p>
