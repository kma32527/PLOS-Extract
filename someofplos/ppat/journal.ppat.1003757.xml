<abstract>
<p>Malaria transmission-blocking (T-B) interventions are essential for malaria elimination. Small molecules that inhibit the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ookinete-to-oocyst transition in the midgut of <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes, thereby blocking sporogony, represent one approach to achieving this goal. Chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans (CS-GAGs) on the <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> midgut surface are putative ligands for <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> ookinetes. We hypothesized that our synthetic polysulfonated polymer, VS1, acting as a decoy molecular mimetic of midgut CS-GAGs confers malaria T-B activity. In our study, VS1 repeatedly reduced midgut oocyst development by as much as 99% (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) in mosquitoes fed with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>. Through direct-binding assays, we observed that VS1 bound to two critical ookinete micronemal proteins, each containing at least one von Willebrand factor A (vWA) domain: (i) circumsporozoite protein and thrombospondin-related anonymous protein-related protein (CTRP) and (ii) vWA domain-related protein (WARP). By immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed that VS1 stains permeabilized <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. berghei</italic> ookinetes but does not stain <italic>P. berghei</italic> CTRP knockouts or transgenic parasites lacking the vWA domains of CTRP while retaining the thrombospondin repeat region. We produced structural homology models of the first vWA domain of CTRP and identified, as expected, putative GAG-binding sites on CTRP that align closely with those predicted for the human vWA A1 domain and the <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> MIC2 adhesin. Importantly, the models also identified patches of electropositive residues that may extend CTRP's GAG-binding motif and thus potentiate VS1 binding. Our molecule binds to a critical, conserved ookinete protein, CTRP, and exhibits potent malaria T-B activity. This study lays the framework for a high-throughput screen of existing libraries of safe compounds to identify those with potent T-B activity. We envision that such compounds when used as partner drugs with current antimalarial regimens and with RTS,S vaccine delivery could prevent the transmission of drug-resistant and vaccine-breakthrough strains.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>To achieve malaria elimination, the consensus expert opinion is that new approaches to drug and vaccine design are desperately needed. We have undertaken a novel, comprehensive approach towards the development of a malaria transmission-blocking drug based on the strategy of inhibiting <italic>Plasmodium</italic> development in the mosquito by interfering with obligate cellular interactions between the parasite and the mosquito-midgut epithelium. We have successfully designed a potent transmission-blocking small molecule (VS1) that mimics the structure of molecules on the mosquito-midgut surface called glycosaminoglycans (GAG), which are thought to serve as ligands for parasite attachment prior to cell invasion. Using assays in which mosquitoes were fed with infectious blood, we tested the effect of VS1 on <italic>Plasmodium</italic> development in the mosquito and found that the GAG mimic dramatically reduced the intensity of infection in the midgut. Binding experiments and immunofluorescence microscopy indicate that VS1 binds to the circumsporozoite- and TRAP-related protein (CTRP), a micronemal protein expressed by ookinetes essential for midgut invasion. This interaction profoundly inhibits a key step of parasite development, thereby abrogating downstream events necessary for mosquito-to-human transmission. The work described lays the framework for bringing a truly novel transmission-blocking drug to fruition.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Each year more than half a million people die from malaria, a disease caused by protozoan parasites in the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. The life cycle of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites includes asexual development in the human host and obligatory sporogonic development in the <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito vector with transmission from person to person only made possible through the bite of an infected anopheline. Despite substantial investment in malaria research, it is widely accepted that current interventions are insufficient to achieve the ultimate goal of eradication and that a combination of anti-malaria strategies including those that target parasite transmission give eradication efforts the best chance to succeed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Alonso1">[1]</xref>. Moreover, the evolutionary capacity of vectors and parasites to overcome chemical- and drug-based interventions emphasizes the need for new weapons in the anti-malaria arsenal. It is in this context that malaria transmission-blocking (T-B) interventions (vaccines and drugs) have received significant attention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-malERA1">[2]</xref>. In fact, recent progress has shown that probing the basic biology underlying mosquito-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> interactions can identify novel intervention targets not only in the parasite, but in the mosquito as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Dinglasan1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Angrisano1">[6]</xref>. Importantly, seminal work by Delves, <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Delves1">[7]</xref> have brought increased attention to the potential T-B activity of drugs that failed to demonstrate efficacy against <italic>Plasmodium</italic> asexual stages but have been resurrected as novel T-B candidate compounds. These efforts highlight the need for T-B molecules and open new avenues for the development and/or repurposing of compounds that have direct activity against the parasite soon after ingestion into the mosquito midgut during blood feeding.</p>
<p>In the mosquito blood meal, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> gametocytes differentiate into gametes and fuse to form zygotes, which then develop into motile ookinetes. For parasite development to continue, ookinetes must find and adhere to membrane-associated ligands on the midgut epithelial surface, a pre-requisite for cell invasion. Experimental evidence from <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> suggests that ookinete attachment and invasion is mediated by micronemal proteins, including the circumsporozoite protein and thrombospondin-related anonymous protein-related protein (CTRP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Trottein1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Yuda2">[13]</xref> and von Willebrand factor A domain-related protein (WARP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Li1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Yuda3">[14]</xref>. The function of WARP is unclear, while CTRP has a demonstrated role in ookinete motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Dessens1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Ramakrishnan1">[15]</xref>. However, both are essential for midgut epithelial cell invasion by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ookinetes. Once inside the cell, ookinetes make their way to the midgut basal lamina where they differentiate into oocysts, each giving rise to thousands of sporozoites that are released into the hemocoel upon maturation and rupture. Sporozoites are then swept into the circulating hemolymph and carried to the salivary glands. Following successful salivary gland invasion, sporozoites remain in the lumen of the salivary duct until host delivery during blood feeding. Clearly, negotiating the midgut tissue barrier in the vector is crucial for successful establishment of the parasite in the mosquito and hence, subsequent transmission to human hosts.</p>
<p>In this study we exploit knowledge of crucial molecular interactions between <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ookinetes and the apical microvillar surface of the mosquito midgut to design proof-of-concept small molecules that interfere with ookinete attachment. Previous work demonstrated that sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are present on both the apical and basal surfaces of the midgut epithelium, with chondroitin sulfate (CS) predominant on the apical side (i.e., facing the midgut lumen) and heparan sulfate (HS) predominant on the basal side <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Dinglasan3">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Sinnis1">[16]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003757.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). RNAi-mediated knockdown of the <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> peptide-<italic>O-</italic>xylosyltransferase, an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in CS and HS biosynthesis, resulted in mosquitoes with CS-depleted midgut apical surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Dinglasan3">[5]</xref>. When infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. berghei</italic> in feeding assays, these mosquitoes demonstrated significantly lower oocyst infection intensities relative to controls. The study also showed binding affinity for two types of CS (CS-A and CS-E) in mature ookinetes, consistent with a previous report demonstrating that the ookinete micronemal proteins PfWARP and PfCTRP bind to sulfated GAGs <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Li1">[10]</xref>. Inspired by the idea that these molecular interactions could be disrupted by small molecules that mimic the charged structural elements involved in ligand binding, two short-chain, water-soluble compounds were synthesized for <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> T-B studies based on their potential to interfere with parasite protein-GAG interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003757-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Here we describe efforts to test this strategy with the underlying hypothesis that when a mosquito ingests these small molecules in an infectious blood meal, the compounds will interfere with ookinete-GAG interactions, therefore preventing midgut invasion and abrogating subsequent developmental steps in sporogony. Based on key studies in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Dessens1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Ramakrishnan1">[15]</xref>, we further hypothesize that the molecular basis of ookinete-GAG interactions, and hence those between ookinetes and our GAG-mimetics, involve the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> micronemal proteins CTRP and/or WARP. Our findings showed that this novel strategy dramatically reduced infection intensity in the mosquito midgut, and multiple lines of evidence suggest that the mechanism underlying the T-B effect involved binding of our GAG-mimetic decoy to one or more von Willebrand factor A (vWA) domains found in the protein CTRP.</p>

<title>Synthesis of small molecule inhibitors</title>
<p>Synthesis of polysulfonated polymers (VS1 and VS2-PVP) proceeded with the addition of 100 mg of potassium persulfate to 5 g (0.38 mmol) of vinyl-sulfonic acid (VS1) sodium salt water solution and adjusted to basic pH with sodium hydroxide. The final solution was warmed for 20 hr at 80°C, then cooled to room temperature (RT), diluted with water and ultra-filtered through a membrane with a nominal cut-off of 10,000 Da. The fraction retained was freeze-dried and the product obtained was a white powder. Size exclusion chromatography was used following different reaction times to obtain oligomers of different length and molecular mass. These compounds were then purified by ultra-filtration through different cut-off membranes (500 Da, 1000 Da, 5000 Da), and average molecular weights were measured by size exclusion chromatography and MALDI spectrometry.</p>

<title>Parasites, mosquito maintenance and transmission-blocking assays</title>
<p>Transmission-blocking assays for vinyl-sulfonic acid compounds (including preliminary VS1 and VS2-PVP experiments) were tested using both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> systems. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies were performed using the murine malaria parasite <italic>P. berghei</italic> (ANKA 2.34) following IACUC approved protocols. For each experiment, two to three naïve, donor mice (Swiss Webster, 20–24 g) were inoculated (i.v.) with blood stage <italic>P. berghei</italic> and then checked for parasitemia by blood smear five to six days later. Once parasitemia reached ≥10%, donors were sacrificed via cardiac puncture and parasitemic blood was used to inoculate (i.v.) eight to ten experimental mice per test compound. Two to three days post-inoculation, experimental mice were smeared and checked for exflagellating gametocytes. Mice demonstrating an average of at least 1 and fewer than 6 exflagellations per 40× field were assigned to a treatment group, weighed and anesthetized. For each mouse, a pre-injection 500 ml cup of <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> mosquitoes (<italic>n</italic> = 50) were allowed to feed for 15 to 20 min. The mouse was then removed from the mosquito cup, injected with either a vinyl sulfonic acid compound (250 µg/ml or 500 µg per 24 g body weight), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, same dose as VS1or VS2-PVP), or the carrier only (PBS) via tail vein injection (iv) and then allowed to recover for 10 to 15 min. Following recovery, a post-injection cup of mosquitoes (<italic>n</italic> = 50) was allowed to feed as before. Unfed mosquitoes were then removed from both pre- and post-injection cups via mouth aspiration. For each control and test compound, three to five pre- and post-injection sets of mosquitoes were maintained on sucrose and water for 10 days at 19°C, 80% relative humidity. On day 10, midguts were dissected from all surviving mosquitoes and stained with 0.1% mercurochrome for 20 mins. Oocyst number for each midgut was determined by microscopy and at least three independent experiments were performed for each compound.</p>

With the exception of the parasite load experiment, each set of studies consisted of independent experiments in which the age of the gametocyte culture (16–17 days), the age of mosquitoes (4–6 days), and the blood-meal gametocytemia (0.3%) and hematocrit (45%) were kept consistent. In the parasite-load experiment, all else was the same except for the blood-meal gametocytemia which varied as described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref>.

<title>ELISA-based binding and competition assays</title>
<p>Biotinylated VS1-NH<sub>2</sub> in a volume of 100 µl (10 µg/ml) was applied to each well of a streptavidin-coated (2 µg/ml) 96-well microtiter plate that had been blocked with PBS, 1% BSA (Thermo Pierce) and incubated for two hours at RT. During VS1 incubation, 6×His-tagged recombinant PvWARP and PvCTRP (5 µg/ml) were each mixed separately with heparin and CSA (100 µg/ml) in blocking buffer and incubated for 2 hr at RT. The microtiter plate was subsequently washed three times with PBS to remove excess VS1, and then 100 µl of 6×His-tagged recombinant PvWARP or PvCTRP alone (10 or 5 µg/ml) or of the recombinant protein-GAG mixture was added to each well, with the exception of the no-protein and irrelevant-protein controls. The latter received a 6×His-tagged recombinant glycosyltransferase from <italic>An. gambiae</italic>. Binding and/or competition with VS1 was allowed to proceed for 2 hr at RT. Following three washes with PBS, anti-His MAb (Sigma) was added to each well and incubated for 1 hr at RT. After three washes with PBS + Tween-20 (0.05%), anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP were added and incubated for 1 hr at RT. Following another wash step, TMB ELISA substrate (Pierce) was used for detection.

<title>Small molecule inhibitors exhibit <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> transmission-blocking activity</title>
<p>Our primary goal was to design synthetic polymers that can mimic sulfated CS-GAGs that have been shown to bind ookinetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003757-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003757.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). However, the likelihood of CS-GAGs, with C4S and C6S sulfation on the midgut microvillar surface was challenged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Sinnis1">[16]</xref>. Using capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection, we confirmed the presence of both C4S and C6S chondroitin GAGs on <italic>An. gambiae</italic> midgut brush border microvilli vesicles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003757.s001">Figure S1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003757.s009">Text S1</xref>). Based on these data, we hypothesized that polymers with high sulfation densities would be appropriate for our study. As such, two polysulfonated polymers were generated by polymerization of vinyl-sulfonic acid (VS1) and copolymerization of vinyl-sulfonic acid with 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (VS2-PVP). The sulfate groups on the polysulfonated polymers are anionic at physiologic pH and would presumably bind to ookinete proteins that would naturally bind to GAGs on the midgut surface. Note that it was previously shown that the blocking phenomenon is predicted to occur at the apical midgut surface, and that basal lamina GAGs do not influence the ultimate read-out of these T-B studies, which is oocyst prevalence and intensity measurements at 8 or 10 days post-blood feeding, for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. berghei</italic>, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Dinglasan3">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Initial data from malaria T-B studies indicated that VS1 was non-toxic and well tolerated by both mice and mosquitoes. Although VS2-PVP was tolerated by mice, mosquitoes that ingested the compound had poor survivorship in multiple experiments within 24 hrs following blood feeding. This low survivorship prevented a proper comparison of infection intensity between midguts dissected from pre- and post-injection mosquitoes; and consequently, this compound was not pursued further. In preliminary <italic>in vitro</italic> standard membrane feeding assays (SMFAs), VS1 demonstrated 98.5% and 92.3% inhibition of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> oocyst development in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> and <italic>An. stephensi</italic>, respectively. <italic>In vivo</italic> direct feeding assays (DFA) with mice infected with <italic>P. berghei</italic> demonstrated a somewhat lower effect of the compounds on parasite development in <italic>An. stephensi</italic>, with VS1 reducing oocyst intensity relative to controls by 77%. These preliminary data from both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> malaria models demonstrated the potential for VS1 to act as a potent T-B compound. Moreover, to exclude the possibility that micro- and macrogamete fertilization events could be adversely affected by VS1, we tested the effect of the compound on male microgamete exflagellation and noted that the number of exflagellation centers were unaffected (data not shown). We therefore pushed this small molecule forward as the lead compound for further testing, which included (i) assays to determine if T-B activity varies according to polymer length, (ii) dose-ranging assays to estimate the IC<sub>50</sub> of VS1, (iii) ELISA-based binding and competition assays using a candidate gene approach, specifically recombinant versions of the ookinete micronemal proteins CTRP and WARP, and (iv) immunofluorescence microscopy to confirm binding of VS1 to wild-type ookinetes from both <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. berghei</italic>, as well as ookinetes from knockout lines of <italic>P. berghei</italic>.</p>

<title>VS1 demonstrates potent transmission-blocking activity across ranges of polymer length, parasite load, and polymer concentration</title>
<p>To assess the influence of polymer length, the product following VS1 synthesis was fractionated into three molecular-weight categories by size exclusion chromatography, VS1-10,000; VS1-3,000; and VS1-1,000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003757-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Based on preliminary dose ranging experiments, each new compound was then tested at a concentration of 250 µg/ml using both <italic>in vitro</italic> (SMFA) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (DFA) malaria models. Polyvinylpyrrolidone, a non-sulfated, neutrally charged control (PVP), which represents the unsulfated VS1 backbone, was used as a control. In SMFAs the three VS1 compounds were tested in parallel against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in two replicate experiments using two different vector species, <italic>An. gambiae</italic> and <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. In all four experiments, each of the VS1 compounds significantly reduced oocyst intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003757-g001">Figure 1B–E</xref>). VS1-3,000 consistently performed the best; inhibiting oocyst development by 86.0%–99.0% in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003757-g001">Figure 1 B, C</xref>) and 88.0%–93.5% in <italic>An. stephensi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003757-g001">Figure 1 D, E</xref>).

<p>Due to its consistent T-B activity, VS1-3,000 was selected for use in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> NF54 SMFA experiments to assess the compound's effectiveness across variations in parasite load in the blood meal (gametocytemia) and to estimate the IC<sub>50</sub> of VS1 in two different anopheline vectors. For the parasite-load experiments, we chose to test VS1 potency at levels of gametocytemia that captured values routinely observed during the conduct of membrane feeding assays in the field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Paul1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Bousema1">[25]</xref>. With the concentration of VS1-3,000 set at 250 µg/ml, a SMFA was performed in which four gametocyte concentrations were tested in the presence and absence of VS1. In this experiment, a day 17 gametocyte culture at 3.0% gametocytemia was pelleted and the packed red blood cells (RBCs) were diluted with uninfected blood to 0.3% and 0.1% gametocytemia. Each of these dilutions was in turn diluted 1∶10 with uninfected blood yielding 4 concentrations that ranged from 0.01%–0.3% gametocytemia (∼800–24,000 stage V gametocytes per µl of blood). The level of gametocytemia commonly used in laboratory-based SMFAs (0.3%) is typically much higher than that found in the field to ensure consistent and robust infections in mosquitoes, allowing more rigorous tests of T-B activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Bousema1">[25]</xref>. Though a widely accepted approach, a criticism of the SMFA is that the assay better tests the effects of compounds (or antibodies) on oocyst intensity than prevalence of infection among mosquitoes. Since the ultimate goal is to reduce the latter to zero, we wanted to perform the SMFA over a range of gametocytemias once we established that VS1 consistently reduces the oocyst burden at the usual gametocytemia of 0.3%. In this set of experiments, VS1-3,000 once again demonstrated a potent reduction in oocyst intensity at 0.3% gametocytemia, reducing the median oocyst number per midgut from 92.0 to 8.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003757-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). However, the prevalence of infection was unchanged between carrier-only and VS1 treatments at this level of gametocytemia. Interestingly, as the gametocytemia was reduced from 0.3%, the effect of VS1 on infection prevalence increased while the reduction in oocyst intensity remained high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003757-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>). In fact, at the two levels of gametocytemia most relevant to the field (i.e., 0.03% and 0.01%), the median oocyst number was reduced to 0 in the VS1 treatments while prevalence was reduced from 89% and 67% in carrier-only treatments to 21% and 13% in VS1 treatments, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003757-g003">Figure 3B, C</xref>). In other words, at levels of gametocytemia where untreated mosquitoes averaged fewer than 5 oocysts per midgut and where most mosquitoes were infected, VS1 treatment reduced infection prevalence 4–5 fold and infection intensity by 10 fold. Under these conditions, most VS1-treated mosquitoes were uninfected, while the few that were tended to have a single oocyst.</p>

<title>VS1 shows binding affinity to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ookinetes</title>
<p>Since VS1 is a hypothesized structural mimetic of midgut-microvillar sulfated GAGs, we sought to determine whether VS1 can directly bind to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ookinetes. To this end, we used biotinylated VS1-NH<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003757-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) to probe non-permeabilized and permeabilized <italic>P. berghei</italic> ookinetes generated <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as <italic>ex vivo</italic> blood-meal derived <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ookinetes isolated from dissected mosquito midguts. Only permeabilized <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ookinetes showed strong binding affinity to VS1 by immunofluorescence microscopy. The VS1 staining pattern suggested that it is not associated entirely with the ookinete surface since it did not consistently bind to non-permeabilized ookinetes nor did it localize with the abundant ookinete surface marker P28 (also called Pbs21 in <italic>P. berghei</italic>) in either <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (WT<sub>Pf</sub>) or <italic>P. berghei</italic> (WT<sub>Pb</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003757-g004">Figure 4A, 4B</xref>). VS1 binding appears to be centrally and apically localized in the cytoplasm, suggestive of interaction with micronemal proteins since these proteins are not constitutively secreted to the ookinete surface and are stored in the micronemes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Li1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Lal1">[26]</xref>. In addition to ookinetes, VS1 also bound to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> retorts (i.e., developing ookinetes) (data not shown), and a portion of permeabilized <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. berghei</italic> round cells. These cells are likely to be zygotes or unfertilized macrogametes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003757.s003">Figure S3E–L</xref>) since they are stained with P28, a surface marker well described in the literature, which is expressed from macrogametes to early oocyst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Sinden1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Mair1">[29]</xref> ruling out the possibility that these cells are <italic>P. berghei</italic> or <italic>P. falciparum</italic> gametocytes.

We cannot rule out an effect of VS1 in macrogametes and/or zygotes because those stages were not the focus of the current research, but any effect in these stages will potentiate the effect of VS1 against transmission of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. We evaluated the effect of VS1 in the ability of microgametes to exflagellate in <italic>P. berghei</italic> and found that VS1 had no inhibitory effect on exflagellation between pre- and post-injection mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003757.s008">Table S2</xref>). Furthermore, dissection of mosquitoes 24 hours after feeding with either PBS or VS1 showed presence of ookinetes in the blood meal (data not shown). Nevertheless, more studies are needed to more thoroughly assess the effect of VS1 on macrogametogenesis, fertilization, and ookinete development. Because we are working with a T-B compound, targeting more than one stage of the parasite in the mosquito gut would strengthen the outcome of our final goal, completely blocking transmission of malaria.</p>

<title>VS1 binds to recombinant CTRP and WARP proteins</title>
<p>We used a candidate gene approach to identify potential targets or binding ligand(s) of VS1 among the repertoire of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> ookinete micronemal proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Kaneko1">[30]</xref>, focusing particularly on those with established roles in midgut attachment or invasion. The literature indicates that two such proteins, CTRP and WARP, bind to sulfated GAGs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Li1">[10]</xref>; and although both are in the apicomplexan TRAP/MIC2 family of proteins, their domain architectures are quite different <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Kaneko1">[30]</xref>. WARP is an approximately 40 KDa protein with a signal peptide and a single vWA domain, and we hypothesize that based on the published data WARP is secreted from the ookinete microneme and can thus work as an extracellular adaptor protein, potentially bridging the parasite surface (or surface molecules) with midgut apical membrane ligands. The much larger CTRP is approximately 230 KDa and contains a signal peptide followed by six contiguous vWA domains, seven contiguous thrombospondin (TS) domains, a transmembrane domain, and a short acidic cytoplasmic domain at the C-terminus that interacts with the motility actomyosin machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Kaneko1">[30]</xref>. The first four vWA domains of CTRP are more similar to one another than to vWA domains 5 and 6 when comparing six species of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. Interestingly, a phylogenetic analysis of the vWA domains from TRAP, CTRP, and WARP among these species shows that WARP and CTRP form a single clade and that the vWA domain of WARP most recently shared a common ancestor with the fifth vWA domain of CTRP, suggesting that WARP evolved from CTRP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Kaneko1">[30]</xref>. We emphasize that the domain architectures and amino acid sequences of these two proteins are highly conserved across Plasmodia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Li1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Kaneko1">[30]</xref> and argue that VS1's potency against both rodent and human malaria, as well as its ookinete staining pattern as reported here, suggests that VS1's binding partner(s) is likewise highly conserved across Plasmodia. Thus given the above and the aim of identifying the mechanism of action for VS1, we sought to investigate the binding activity of <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> CTRP and WARP to VS1, following the argument that VS1 should bind to these two molecules. We produced soluble recombinant WARP and the first vWA domain of CTRP from <italic>P. vivax</italic> using a cell-free wheat germ system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003757.s005">Figure S5</xref>) and evaluated binding affinity via ELISA. As expected, both recombinant PvCTRP and PvWARP bound to VS1 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003757-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). To better delineate binding specificity, competition assays with heparin and chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) were performed. If VS1 binds primarily to the putative GAG-binding sites on the vWA domains of CTRP and WARP, then we would expect that heparin, and perhaps to a lesser extent CSA, at a concentration of 100 µg/ml should completely inhibit binding. However, we observed that both heparin and CSA only partially inhibited VS1 binding to PvCTRP and PvWARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003757-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that VS1 binds to additional sites not used by heparin on either recombinant protein or that it binds to them with greater affinity.</p>

<title>VS1 does not bind to CTRP- or vWA domain knockout lines of <italic>P. berghei</italic></title>
<p>The ELISA results demonstrated that VS1 binds to recombinant WARP and the first vWA domain of CTRP <italic>in vitro</italic>, so to test binding <italic>in vivo</italic> we obtained three lines of <italic>P. berghei</italic> in which CTRP had been either completely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Dessens1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Ramakrishnan1">[15]</xref> or partially knocked out <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Ramakrishnan1">[15]</xref> and compared VS1 staining patterns by immunofluorescence microscopy. One of the partial knockouts, a line known as ΔA<sub>6</sub>, expresses CTRP that is missing all six of the vWA domains but contains all seven of the thrombospondin domains. Conversely, CTRP expressed by the other partial knockout line, ΔTS<sub>7</sub>, includes the six vWA domains but lacks any of the thrombospondin domains. Since the recombinant CTRP protein used in the ELISA consisted only of the first vWA domain, we predicted <italic>a priori</italic> that the VS1 binding pattern to ΔTS<sub>7</sub> ookinetes would be similar to wild type ookinetes, while the VS1 signal in both the CTRP knockout (CTRP<sub>KO</sub>) and ΔA<sub>6</sub> lines would be diminished. However, if VS1 also binds to any of the TS domains <italic>in vivo</italic>, the VS1 signal would be much lower in the CTRP<sub>KO</sub> than in either of the partial knockouts. A caveat to this approach is that if VS1 also binds to WARP <italic>in vivo</italic>, we would expect some portion of the VS1 signal observed in wild type ookinetes to be shared among all of the knockout lines.</p>
<p>Immunofluorescence microscopy images from CTRP<sub>KO</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003757-g004">Figure 4D</xref>) indicate that VS1 binds to CTRP in permeabilized ookinetes. Furthermore, comparisons of staining patterns from the partial knockouts strongly suggest that VS1 binding involves vWA domains but not the TS domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003757-g004">Figure 4E, F</xref>). Furthermore, the apparent loss of VS1 signal in both the CTRP<sub>KO</sub> and ΔA<sub>6</sub> lines also suggests that VS1 localizes to the micronemes (as suggested by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003757-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) and that CTRP is the primary micronemal target of VS1and not WARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003757-g004">Figure 4D, F</xref>). These data further reconcile the observed cytoplasmic staining of putative zygotes/macrogametes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003757.s003">Figure S3</xref>) with the previously reported staining of round forms with CTRP antisera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Templeton1">[11]</xref>. Without a WARP knockout line we cannot rule out that binding to WARP may occur <italic>in vivo</italic> or that some of the T-B activity we observed is due to such an interaction. It should be noted that WARP expression/secretion is not well understood and may be temporally regulated or even midgut contact-dependent for different <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species. Thus, <italic>in vitro</italic> generated <italic>P. berghei</italic> ookinetes or <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ookinetes isolated from the blood-meal bolus may not express detectable levels of WARP. However, the CTRP<sub>KO</sub> and ΔA<sub>6</sub> microscopy data are persuasive and we note that VS1 binding by ELISA is consistently stronger for the first vWA domain of CTRP than for WARP. Moreover, the phylogenetic relationship among CTRP and WARP vWA domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Kaneko1">[30]</xref> in combination with the ELISA and immunofluorescence microscopy data reported here, suggest that VS1 primarily targets the first four vWA domains of CTRP. The divergence of vWA domains 5 and 6 and their evolutionary relationships with WARP suggest that these domains bind VS1 secondarily or not at all.</p>

<title>Homology model predicts GAG-binding sites in CTRP vWA domain</title>
<p>In the absence of a CTRP crystal structure, we used homology modeling to predict heparin-binding sites on CTRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003757-g005">Figure 5A–E</xref>).

A superposition of Model 1 with vWFA1 (1AUQ) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003757.s006">Figure S6A–B</xref>) suggests that the two models predominantly differed in their overall length and the conformation of the loops connecting the beta sheet core and flanking alpha helices.

<p>Host-cell GAGs have been shown to be important mediators of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> development in its two hosts, including merozoite invasion of RBCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Boyle1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Crandall1">[36]</xref>, infected RBC sequestration to placenta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Achur1">[37]</xref>, ookinete invasion of the midgut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Dinglasan3">[5]</xref>, and sporozoite invasion of mosquito salivary glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Armistead1">[38]</xref> and vertebrate hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Sinnis2">[39]</xref>. Here we tested a strategy that exploits this feature of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> biology and demonstrated that VS1, a putative GAG-mimetic, reduced midgut oocyst development by as much as 99% in mosquitoes fed with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> or <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>. Through direct-binding assays, we observed that VS1 bound to two ookinete micronemal proteins necessary for midgut invasion, each containing at least one vWA domain: (i) CTRP and (ii) WARP. By immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed that VS1 stains permeabilized <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. berghei</italic> ookinetes but does not stain <italic>P. berghei</italic> CTRP knockouts or transgenic parasites lacking the vWA domains of CTRP while retaining the thrombospondin repeat region. Finally, we used structural homology models of the first vWA domain of CTRP to identify residues likely involved in binding GAGs, as well as the VS1 compound. Based on these data, our working model for the mechanism underlying VS1's T-B activity is that it binds to CTRP once the protein is secreted from the micronemes of ookinetes prior to midgut attachment and invasion. CTRP is essential for gliding motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Dessens1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Ramakrishnan1">[15]</xref> and contains six vWA domains, which commonly play roles in cell adhesion to GAGs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Trottein1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Li1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Kaneko1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Tonkin1">[34]</xref>. Our data suggest that VS1 either interrupts the gliding process on the midgut apical microvillar surface or coats the surface of the ookinete through its interaction with CTRP, thus preventing attachment to ligands (e.g., chondroitin sulfate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Dinglasan3">[5]</xref>) on the apical surface of the midgut epithelium. Nevertheless, due to observed binding of VS1 to permeabilized round cells, we cannot rule out that VS1 may potentially have an added benefit and affect additional parasite stages found in the blood meal, particularly macrogametes and/or zygotes. Further studies into these beneficial side effects are necessary.</p>
<p>When designing the GAG-mimetic strategy, data from the literature suggested that sulfation density per disaccharide unit and the manner of presentation (i.e., how the underlying structure of the sugar scaffold influences the 3D projection of sulfated moieties) are critical factors in inhibiting pathogen-GAG interactions. Boyle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Boyle1">[35]</xref>, for example, found that heparin and the <italic>E. coli-</italic>derived K5 polysaccharide inhibits merozoite entry into RBCs and that variations in the average number of sulfate groups/saccharide unit for K5, which consists of glucoronate as opposed to iduronate, exhibited different inhibitory effects against merozoites, with sulfate densities &gt;3/disaccharide producing the most potent IC<sub>50</sub> estimates. Therefore, we sought to determine the minimal T-B polymer length of VS1 with the hope of minimizing the likelihood of diverse structural conformations that can occur with longer polymers, which could in turn affect the presentation/projection of anionic moieties. Although we were able to demonstrate that VS1-3,000 was the most effective polymer, we cannot, however, predict its structure. VS1-3,000 is unlikely to remain linear in solution or in the midgut after blood feeding. With this caveat in mind, we suspect that binding to the recombinant or native CTRP and WARP molecules may engender a specific VS1 conformation. Regardless, we expect that VS1 binding is largely due to the predicted GAG-binding motifs on the vWA domain(s) of CTRP and WARP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Li1">[10]</xref>. However, the concentration of heparin used in our studies, which would otherwise result in the near complete inhibition of high affinity protein-GAG interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Hileman1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Martin1">[42]</xref> only reduced VS1 binding by ∼25%. It should be noted, however, that cases exist in the literature where soluble heparin cannot completely outcompete vWA domain-GAG interactions. For example, heparin-BSA binding to the vWA domain of PfTRAP can be competed between 45–66% using 50 µg/ml of soluble heparin and that a 10-fold increase in heparin concentration reduced binding to 9–27% of control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-McCormick1">[43]</xref>. Even more striking is a report that neither a 50-, 100-, or 1,000-fold molar excess of soluble heparin could completely inhibit binding between the PfTRAP vWA domain and the surface of HepG2 cells, which was thought to be GAG mediated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Akhouri1">[44]</xref>. In this set of experiments, each concentration reduced binding by approximately 15%, 55%, and 70%, respectively, suggesting that the PfTRAP vWA domain utilizes both GAG and a non-GAG binding sites. In combination, these data suggest that each recombinant protein in our study has either stronger binding affinity for VS1 than for either heparin or CSA, that the predicted GAG-binding regions do not completely explain the interactions of VS1 with PvCTRP or PvWARP, or more likely, a combination of these two scenarios. Tertiary structures of mammalian heparin-binding proteins have also been shown to enhance affinity and specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Kuschert1">[41]</xref>. We cannot rule out the possibility of cryptic GAG-binding sites on CTRP and WARP that provide cooperative binding to VS1, as suggested at least in part by potential basic residue patches identified on two homology models of the first vWA domain of CTRP, which appears to be a primary ligand of VS1. In terms of sulfation density and propensity to form various non-linear conformations, VS1 is clearly different from Heparin and natural GAGs. In this context, cooperative binding may be conferred by VS1 “wrapping around” CTRP and interacting with basic residues along different faces of the protein. The presence of potential additional binding sites suggests that CTRP (as opposed to other GAG binding proteins) can be specifically targeted by the next generation of VS1-based chemical mimetics. Clearly, a crystal structure for CTRP is needed to clarify the hypotheses generated by our two models.</p>
<p>To date, the antimalarial pipeline is filled with compounds that act on related biochemical pathways (e.g., folate biosynthesis), which also increase the likelihood of the development of parasite cross-resistance to these “new” compounds. The need to discover drugs that act on unpredicted or uncharacterized biochemical pathways that are completely different from those associated with current antimalarials is paramount <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Baum1">[45]</xref>. Our approach fits this mold, as it represents a completely novel mechanism of action compared to those associated with the existing, new, and now “rediscovered” list of antimalarials and T-B compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Delves1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Among the various T-B strategies, drugs offer a distinct advantage over vaccines since the efficacy of the compound is dose dependent and human immune-system independent, the latter being a potentially significant issue given that individuals in malaria endemic regions may suffer from malnourishment and concomitant infections by immune-modulating pathogens such as HIV and helminths. Although we have shown that VS1 is a potent T-B molecule, we emphasize that it cannot be used as a drug in its current form. However, we intend to use the data reported here to establish a high-throughput approach for identifying a next-generation “druggable” malaria T-B compound that would inhibit ookinete invasion of the midgut beyond that observed for VS1 (i.e., achieve zero infection prevalence among treated mosquitoes). We recognize, however, that if the next generation compound only replicates the T-B activity reported for VS1 and were used alone in the field, it would unlikely reduce infection prevalence in the mosquito population below the threshold necessary for sustained transmission . Nevertheless, it is widely believed that no anti-malarial intervention on its own will lead to regional elimination and eventual eradication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-Alonso1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003757-malERA1">[2]</xref>. We envision that in this context, such compounds may be valuable in a range of epidemiologic settings. Potential applications include (i) general use in conjunction with existing artemisinin combination therapies, which we emphasize do not kill stage V gametocytes, to prevent recurrent transmission from the treatment-seeking segment of the population, (ii) use in regions with unstable malaria (e.g., highlands) to curb transmission during epidemics, (iii) use in combination with a T-B vaccine targeting sexual stage parasites to act as a safety net to “mop up” break-through parasites, and (iv) at the end game of the malaria eradication effort, as mass distribution of T-B compounds may offer a cost-effective approach to preventing asymptomatic, gametocytemic individuals, who would not otherwise seek treatment, from infecting anopheline mosquitoes, thus preventing resurrection of epidemic malaria transmission.</p>
