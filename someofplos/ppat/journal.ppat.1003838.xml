<abstract>
<p>The high rates of RNA virus evolution are generally attributed to replication with error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. However, these long-term nucleotide substitution rates span three orders of magnitude and do not correlate well with mutation rates or selection pressures. This substitution rate variation may be explained by differences in virus ecology or intrinsic genomic properties. We generated nucleotide substitution rate estimates for mammalian RNA viruses and compiled comparable published rates, yielding a dataset of 118 substitution rates of structural genes from 51 different species, as well as 40 rates of non-structural genes from 28 species. Through ANCOVA analyses, we evaluated the relationships between these rates and four ecological factors: target cell, transmission route, host range, infection duration; and three genomic properties: genome length, genome sense, genome segmentation. Of these seven factors, we found target cells to be the only significant predictors of viral substitution rates, with tropisms for epithelial cells or neurons (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) as the most significant predictors. Further, one-tailed t-tests showed that viruses primarily infecting epithelial cells evolve significantly faster than neurotropic viruses (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001 and <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001 for the structural genes and non-structural genes, respectively). These results provide strong evidence that the fastest evolving mammalian RNA viruses infect cells with the highest turnover rates: the highly proliferative epithelial cells. Estimated viral generation times suggest that epithelial-infecting viruses replicate more quickly than viruses with different cell tropisms. Our results indicate that cell tropism is a key factor in viral evolvability.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>RNA viruses are the fastest evolving human pathogens, making their treatment and control difficult. Compared to DNA viruses, RNA viruses replicate with much lower fidelity, which can explain why RNA viruses evolve significantly faster than most DNA viruses. However, there is tremendous variation among the evolutionary rates of different RNA viruses, which is not explained by variation in mutation rates. Here we present a survey of mammalian RNA virus rates of evolution, and a comprehensive comparison of these rates to different properties of virus genomic architecture and ecology. We found that cell tropism is the most significant predictor of long-term rates of mammalian RNA virus evolution. For instance, viruses targeting epithelial cells evolve significantly faster than viruses that target neurons. Our results provide mechanistic insight into why viruses that infect respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelia have been difficult to control.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>RNA viruses are responsible for a disproportionate number of emerging human diseases, including influenza, ebola hemorrhagic fever, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, which place tremendous health and economic burdens on both the developing and developed world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Holmes1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Peters1">[2]</xref>. In 2008, rotavirus and measles virus caused the deaths of 570,000 children under the age of five, making them two of the leading killers of children worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-World1">[3]</xref>. In 2009, it was estimated that rotavirus infections alone result in $325 million in medical treatment costs and $423 million in societal costs each year <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Rheingans1">[4]</xref>. Further, the implementation of many intervention strategies has either failed or been delayed as a result of the evolutionary dynamics of these pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Holmes1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Hanada1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Perelson1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Gerrish1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Domingo1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Lauring1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Differences in viral evolutionary dynamics, such as rates of evolution, can explain why certain viruses have the capacity to adapt to new host species, increase in virulence, or develop resistance to antivirals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Gerrish1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Domingo1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Lauring1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Moya1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Vignuzzi1">[11]</xref>. Therefore, understanding why some RNA viruses evolve more quickly can facilitate better prediction of their pathogenic and epidemiological potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Domingo1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Moya1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Vignuzzi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Pybus1">[12]</xref>. Though extremely high nucleotide substitution rates are a defining feature of RNA virus evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Holmes1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Duffy1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Sanjun1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Sanjun2">[15]</xref>, there have been few attempts to comprehensively examine the driving genomic and ecological factors behind these rates.</p>
<p>Differences in the strength and direction of selection pressures on these viruses result in variation among their substitution rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Holmes1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Hanada1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Duffy1">[13]</xref>. However, while some general patterns have been observed in selection pressures, such as enhanced purifying selection on the structural proteins of arboviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Chare1">[16]</xref>, there have been no attempts to quantify the relationship between selection pressures and long-term viral substitution rates.</p>
<p>The high rates of RNA virus evolution are most commonly attributed to their replication with error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Holmes1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Jenkins1">[17]</xref>, but these nucleotide substitution rates are known to span at least three orders of magnitude <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Hanada1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Jenkins1">[17]</xref> and do not correlate well with experimentally measured viral mutation rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Hanada1">[5]</xref>. Further, the substitution rates of some DNA viruses, which replicate with high-fidelity DNA polymerases, are comparable to the high substitution rates of RNA viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Duffy1">[13]</xref>. Therefore, the polymerase error rate alone cannot explain the substitution rate variation in RNA viruses.</p>
<p>Along with mutation rate, viral replication frequency directly impacts the rate at which mutations can be introduced, and ultimately fixed as substitutions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Duffy1">[13]</xref>. Replication frequencies could be influenced by a variety of factors related to viral genomic architecture or ecology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Duffy1">[13]</xref>. For example, weak negative correlations between viral genome lengths and substitution rates have been attributed to either enhanced replication frequencies or higher mutation rates in viruses with smaller genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Sanjun2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Jenkins1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Eigen1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Bradwell1">[19]</xref>. It has also been suggested that different transmission and infection modes result in differences in generation time, ultimately causing variation among per-year rates of synonymous substitution of RNA virus structural genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Hanada1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this modern survey of mammalian RNA virus evolution rates, we generated and compiled published substitution rates of structural and non-structural genes produced by Bayesian coalescent analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Drummond1">[20]</xref>. We analyzed these rates as a function of seven factors related to virus genomic architecture (<italic>i.e.</italic>, genome length, genome sense, and whether or not the genome is segmented) and virus ecology (<italic>i.e.</italic>, target cell, transmission mode, host range, and whether the infection is acute or persistent). We also evaluated the relationships of viral substitution rates with dN/dS estimates, experimentally measured mutation rates, and estimated generation times. Though recombination undeniably plays a role in shaping viral evolutionary dynamics and could inflate substitution rate estimates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Holmes2">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Hughes1">[22]</xref>, we conservatively removed any potential recombinants from our datasets prior to analysis. Through this broad analysis, we were able to demonstrate that cell tropism, and its impact on viral generation time, has the greatest influence on rates of mammalian RNA virus evolution.</p>

<title>Datasets</title>
<p>A review of the literature yielded 92 published Bayesian nucleotide substitution rate estimates for the structural genes of 35 different mammalian RNA viral species, and 21 published Bayesian rates for RdRps or a non-structural gene of 14 different viral species (referred to collectively as “non-structural,” <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003838.s004">Table S1</xref>). These rates were supplemented with 26 novel Bayesian substitution rates of structural genes of 19 different viral species, and 19 novel Bayesian rates of non-structural genes of 16 different viral species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003838.s005">Table S2</xref>). Collectively, these rates span three orders of magnitude, ranging from 3.0×10<sup>−5</sup> to 1.5×10<sup>−2</sup> nucleotide substitutions per site per year (ns/s/y) and 2.0×10<sup>−5</sup> to 1.3×10<sup>−2</sup> ns/s/y for the structural genes and non-structural genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003838.s004">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Plotting the levels of each variable by ascending mean substitution rate revealed similar patterns (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the same ordering of levels) for both the structural (S) and non-structural (NS) datasets in three of these variables, excepting transmission route. Viral substitution rates grouped according to target cell (panels 1A and 1B), transmission route (panels 1C and 1D), infection type (panels 1E and 1F), and host range (panels 1G and 1H) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003838-g001">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Substitution rates were also grouped by viral genomic architecture (genome sense/strandedness, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003838-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>, and genome segmentation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003838-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>) and plotted against viral genome length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003838-g002">Figure 2E and 2F</xref>). There were no apparent relationships between genomic properties and substitution rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003838-g002">Figure 2</xref>), including no linear relationship between substitution rates and genome lengths in either dataset (coefficient of determination, S: <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.06, NS: <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.08).</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>ANCOVA analyses were performed separately on the structural and non-structural gene datasets to determine which, if any, of seven factors (target cell, transmission route, infection mode, host range, genome length, genome sense, and genome segmentation) significantly predict the nucleotide substitution rates of mammalian RNA viruses. To explore the many dummy-coded categorical variables, three analyses were run using different variable levels as the base levels (see Methods for details, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003838-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003838-t002">2</xref>).

Standardized residual plots identified only six potential outliers of the 118 structural gene rates and one potential outlier of the 40 non-structural gene rates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003838.s001">Figure S1</xref>), indicating that the data are normally distributed and therefore amenable to a general linear model.</p>

<p>Regardless of the base levels, target cells were the only significant predictors of log-transformed substitution rates for both structural and non-structural genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003838-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003838-t002">2</xref>), with cell tropism as the only significant predictor variable by type III sum of squares (SS) analyses (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.003 for the structural and non-structural gene datasets, respectively). Targeting epithelial cells or neurons was found to be the most significant predictor of structural gene rates in each analysis where these were not the base levels (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003838-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003838-g003">Figure 3</xref>), while targeting neurons was found to be the sole significant predictor of substitution rates for the smaller non-structural gene dataset (<italic>P</italic> = 0.009, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003838-t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003838-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Further, there was a high correlation between each viral species' estimated structural gene substitution rate and its corresponding non-structural gene rate (33 viruses, Pearson <italic>r</italic> = 0.87, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001).

<p>To minimize any potential bias introduced by using multiple published rates for a single viral strain or species, we conducted control analyses using datasets with only one rate per species. For species with multiple substitution rates in one of our datasets, we calculated the average log substitution rate and used that as the sole substitution rate for the species in the control analysis. These data were also normally distributed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003838.s002">Figure S2</xref>), but the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003838.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for these analyses were slightly lower than for the full datasets (S: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003838.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.65, NS: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003838.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 0.70, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003838.s006">Tables S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003838.s007">S4</xref>). These control results were consistent with those from the full dataset analyses: tropisms for epithelial cells or neurons were the most significant substitution rate predictors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003838.s006">Tables S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003838.s007">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003838.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of the high correlation between the structural and non-structural gene rates, we combined the two datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003838-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and performed a final set of three ANCOVA analyses using this combined dataset. The results from these analyses were nearly identical to those from the structural gene analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003838.s008">Table S5</xref>). The exception was that, in addition to cell tropism, Type III SS analysis also identified transmission route as a significant predictor variable (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007), though it was still less significant than cell tropism (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001). More specifically, in addition to different cell tropisms, transmission through arthropod vectors was also found to be a significant rate predictor in one of the three analyses (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003838.s008">Table S5</xref>).</p>

<p>To ensure that any substitution rate variability attributed to a given predictor variable was not significantly dependent on other predictor variables, we examined collinearity in all datasets. With the exception of the persistent infection variable, which was nested with the endothelial target cell variable and thus excluded, the ANCOVA analyses for the structural gene rate datasets and the combined rate dataset showed no significant collinearity (no variance inflation factors (VIF) were greater than 10). For the non-structural gene rate datasets, many different predictor variables had VIF&gt;10. However, subsequent analyses where each individual variable was removed did not significantly reduce collinearity in these datasets (data not shown). Due to the consistent results between the structural and non-structural gene datasets, as well as those from the combined rate dataset, we concluded that correlations among independent variables did not significantly impact our results.</p>
<p>Since target cells were found to be the only consistently significant predictors of substitution rates, a series of one-tailed t-tests was used to confirm which cell tropisms are associated with higher viral substitution rates than others. Viruses that target epithelial cells were found to have significantly higher structural gene substitution rates than viruses that target neurons, endothelial cells, or leukocytes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003838-t003">Table 3</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0009). Similarly, viruses that target epithelial cells were found to have significantly higher non-structural gene substitution rates than viruses that target neurons, hepatocytes, or leukocytes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003838-t004">Table 4</xref>, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0007). These results were recapitulated in the control datasets that only used one rate per viral species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003838.s009">Tables S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003838.s010">S7</xref>). It should be noted, however, that most of the viruses in this study that are classified as targeting leukocytes ultimately cause systemic infections and infect a wide variety of cell types. Consequently, viruses in the leukocyte target cell category had the most rate variation of all the target cell categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003838-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Because transmission through arthropod vectors was also found to be a significant rate predictor in the ANCOVA analyses based on the combined datasets and because of the correlation between epithelial cell tropism and fecal-oral/respiratory transmission, we evaluated any significant variation among substitution rates of viruses with different transmission routes. Using a series of one-tailed t-tests, we found that viruses that are transmitted through the fecal-oral/respiratory route have significantly higher substitution rates than those transmitted by arthropod vectors (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001). However, we also compared different cell tropisms within each of these transmission routes. We found that fecal-oral/respiratory transmitted viruses that target epithelial cells have significantly higher substitution rates than those that target other cell types (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003838-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

<p>We also tested for linear relationships between viral substitution rates and other evolutionary parameters for which only smaller subsets of our datasets could be analyzed.

<p>ANCOVA and t-tests consistently revealed epithelial cell tropism and neurotropism as the most significant viral substitution rate predictors.

Shorter average generation times lead to more rounds of replication per year, which could neatly explain higher per-year substitution rates.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A variety of intrinsic and ecological factors could plausibly alter the tempo of virus evolution by influencing the rate at which genetic diversity is generated, maintained, and fixed within viral populations. Others have focused on genomic properties as drivers of substitution rate variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Sanjun1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Sanjun2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Jenkins1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Eigen1">[18]</xref>, demonstrating a weak negative correlation between the genome lengths and substitution rates of RNA viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Sanjun2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Jenkins1">[17]</xref> or suggesting that ssRNA viruses evolve faster than dsRNA viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Sanjun2">[15]</xref>. However, we did not find any significant relationship between genomic properties and substitution rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003838-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003838-g003">3</xref>). While some have conducted more limited studies on the influence of ecological factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Hanada1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Streicker1">[37]</xref>, we performed a comprehensive analysis that revealed that cell tropism is a key factor in understanding mammalian RNA viral substitution rates.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that persistent viruses evolve more slowly than those that produce acute infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Holmes1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Hanada1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Sanjun2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-MaljkovicBerry1">[38]</xref>. Unfortunately, with the exception of latent viruses, which are most commonly retro- or DNA viruses and thus not within the scope in this study, it can be difficult to classify viruses as acute or persistent. The duration of persistence can vary; most persistent viral infections begin with an acute phase and may occasionally be resolved after only this acute phase (<italic>e.g.</italic>, HCV), and many viruses that predominantly result in acute infections occasionally persist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Virgin1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Lemon1">[40]</xref>. By classifying the viruses in this study as accurately as possible, we found no significant association between infection mode and substitution rate. However, only three viruses in this study, all endothelial-infecting hantaviruses, were classified as strictly persistent. This causes the nesting of the persistent level with tropism for endothelial cells, and the persistent infection variable was therefore excluded from our analyses. Infection duration could be a factor explaining substitution rate variation across the Baltimore classifications of viruses, but there is no evidence that it affects the mammalian RNA virus substitution rates included in this study.</p>
<p>Transmission mode and, less explicitly, host range are frequently invoked as determinants of viral substitution rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Hanada1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Woelk1">[41]</xref>. Specifically, plant or animal viruses that primarily rely on arthropod vectors for transmission, and therefore obligately infect very diverse hosts, are thought to evolve more slowly than viruses with other transmission modes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Hanada1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Woelk1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Coffey1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Weaver1">[43]</xref>. Surprisingly, only one of our 15 ANCOVA analyses implicated transmission route as a significant substitution rate predictor, and we found no significant relationship between substitution rate and host range.</p>
<p>The seven genomic and ecological factors examined are not necessarily independent. For example, 25% of the arboviruses in our study are neurotropic, the second-most common cell tropism of our arboviruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003838.s004">Table S1</xref>). Therefore, the observation that vector-borne viruses tend to evolve more slowly is qualitatively consistent with our results. Cell tropism does appear to be the more significant factor, though, as our results show that arboviruses with other cell tropisms evolve significantly faster than those with neurotropism. Previous studies have also indicated that phylogenetic relationships are predictive – that sister taxa have similar rates of evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Hanada1">[5]</xref>. We initially included virus families as an explanatory variable in our analyses, but we had to discard it due to high colinearity with these other seven variables (data not shown). Once the virus families were removed, there was no statistically significant colinearity within the structural gene dataset. Of these seven non-colinear factors, cell tropism was the best predictor of viral substitution rates. The smaller non-structural gene dataset, on the other hand, had significant collinearity among predictor variables that could not be resolved. The NS dataset also had only 1/3 of the taxa, inherently reducing its statistical power. It was not possible to expand the mammalian RNA virus NS dataset at this time; our novel rate analyses increased the number of reliable rates by 40% by exhaustively searching the available sequences in GenBank. The results of the combined dataset were nearly identical to those from the dataset of only S rates, again identifying target cells as the only consistent predictor variables. While many factors likely influence nucleotide substitution rates, and there may be inherent relationships among some of our seven variables, our results affirm that cell tropism is the most significant predictor of mammalian RNA virus substitution rate.</p>
<p>Though previously unexplored, cell tropism could influence viral substitution rates by the same mechanisms that have been suggested for the other ecological factors described above <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Hicks1">[44]</xref>. Infection of different host cells could expose viruses to different selection pressures, which could influence the rates at which mutations are fixed as substitutions. Additionally, it is possible that cell tropism influences the rate at which genetic diversity is generated by affecting viral mutation rates or generation times.</p>

<title>Selection pressures do not predict substitution rates</title>
<p>Variation in strength and/or direction of selection has frequently been invoked as a determinant of viral substitution rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Pybus1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Duffy1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Holmes2">[21]</xref>.

However, variation is observed in the strength of purifying selection due to differences in host ranges.

The dN/dS estimates based on non-structural genes of arboviruses were only moderately lower than those for non-arboviruses (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04). Further, we found no significant correlation between the estimated dN/dS and substitution rates, suggesting that detectable differences in selection pressures do not explain the variation in substitution rates of mammalian RNA viruses. To date, there are no data supporting a link between cell tropism and sustained differences in selection pressures.</p>

<title>Mutation and substitution rates are uncorrelated</title>
<p>Compared to the slower evolution of DNA viruses, the evolution of RNA viruses is dominated by their high mutation rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Holmes1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Duffy1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Sanjun2">[15]</xref>.

However, while differences in spontaneous mutation rates appear to be significantly correlated to the long-term substitution rates of DNA viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Sanjun2">[15]</xref>, this linear relationship disappears past a certain mutation rate threshold: around 10<sup>−6</sup> mutations per site per infectious cycle, the lower end of the mutation rate range of RNA viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Duffy1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Sanjun2">[15]</xref>. It is, therefore, not surprising that we found no significant correlation between substitution rates and the available, reliable mutation rate estimates. Additionally, a recent study of the retrovirus HIV-1 found that infection of different cell types did not lead to differences in mutation rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Holtz1">[51]</xref>, providing some evidence that mutation rate is not correlated with cell tropism. Together, these data suggest that mutation rate variation among different cell types is not driving higher substitution rates in epithelial-infecting mammalian RNA viruses.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3c">
<title>Generation time could explain substitution rate variation</title>
<p>Ruling out selection, mutation rates, and recombination frequencies as drivers of RNA virus substitution rates implies that the rate variation is largely the result of variation in replication dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Hanada1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Duffy1">[13]</xref>.

Further, as an alternative to differential selection pressures, the argument that transmission mode drives viral substitution rates assumes that viruses that can be transmitted more rapidly will have shorter generation times (<italic>e.g.</italic>, horizontal transmission vs. vertical transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Hanada1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Salemi1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Vandamme1">[53]</xref>).</p>

However, there is evidence that for at least some RNA viruses, viral genome replication is highly dependent on host cell proliferation, with RNA synthesis occurring at much lower rates in poorly proliferating cells than in rapidly dividing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Scholle1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Feuer1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Honda1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Nelson1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Kusov1">[60]</xref>. For example, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that hepatitis C virus genome replication is enhanced in proliferating cells, perhaps due to higher levels of available nucleotides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Nelson1">[59]</xref>, or because of higher levels of viral protein synthesis facilitated by nuclear translation initiation factors that only become available in the cytoplasm during cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-Honda1">[58]</xref>.

<p>We are the first to provide statistical evidence that cell tropism predicts rates of mammalian RNA virus evolution, likely through its influence on virus generation time.

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>In order to determine which factors most significantly predict substitution rates of mammalian RNA viruses, ANCOVA analyses were run using SPSS Statistics v21 (IBM) with log-transformed mean substitution rates as the dependent variable and seven overarching predictor variables (target cell, transmission route, whether the infection is acute or persistent, host range, genome length, genome sense, and whether or not the genome is segmented). For each variable, different base levels were tested to ensure that the chosen base level did not significantly influence the results. Collinearity among the variables was also assessed, with variance inflation factors (VIF) greater than 10 indicating redundancy among variables. Separate ANCOVA analyses were run on the structural and non-structural gene datasets. As there were multiple published rates for some viral species and strains, additional analyses were run for both the S and NS datasets with only one substitution rate per virus species.

<p>One-tailed t-tests were subsequently run in R v2.14.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003838-R1">[87]</xref> to provide an additional measure of significant directional variation among the log-transformed mean rates of different levels for any categorical variable that was found to be a significant rate predictor (α = 0.01, adjusted by Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons) in the ANCOVA analyses.

<p>Additionally, though there were no dN/dS or mutation rate estimates available for all viruses used in this study, the available data for each variable were compared to corresponding log-transformed mean substitution rate estimates using Spearman rank correlation (for dN/dS) or Pearson correlation coefficient (for mutation rates).
