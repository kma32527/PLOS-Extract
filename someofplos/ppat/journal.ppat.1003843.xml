<abstract>
<p>The homeostatic mechanisms that regulate the maintenance of immunological memory to the multiple pathogen encounters over time are unknown. We found that a single malaria episode caused significant dysregulation of pre-established Influenza A virus-specific long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) resulting in the loss of Influenza A virus-specific Abs and increased susceptibility to Influenza A virus re-infection. This loss of LLPCs involved an FcÎ³RIIB-dependent mechanism, leading to their apoptosis. However, given enough time following malaria, the LLPC pool and humoral immunity to Influenza A virus were eventually restored. Supporting a role for continuous conversion of Influenza A virus-specific B into LLPCs in the restoration of Influenza A virus immunity, B cell depletion experiments also demonstrated a similar requirement for the long-term maintenance of serum Influenza A virus-specific Abs in an intact LLPC compartment. These findings show that, in addition to their established role in the anamnestic response to reinfection, the B cell pool continues to be a major contributor to the maintenance of long-term humoral immunity following primary Influenza A virus infection, and to the recovery from attrition following heterologous infection. These data have implications for understanding the longevity of protective efficacy of vaccinations in countries where continuous infections are endemic.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Antibody responses to infectious pathogens are critical in host survival, recovery and protection from reinfection; they also correlate with the success of vaccination. It is currently thought that antibody serum titers are maintained at protective levels over long periods of time by specialized long-lived antibody-secreting plasma cells residing in the bone marrow. Indeed, antibodies against the original virus can still be found in survivors of the 1918 Spanish Flu, more than 90 years ago. However, it is also becoming clear that subsequent infection with heterologous pathogens may cause attrition of previously established immunological memory, in order to accommodate new lymphocyte specificities in the finite space of the host. This phenomenon is seemingly at odds with long-term maintenance of immunological memory. We also show that a single episode of malaria, caused by infection by <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi</italic>, leads to the loss of preexisting plasma cells, serum antibodies and protective immunity against Influenza A virus. However, Influenza A virus-specific immunity does eventually recover in these animals with the replenishment of plasma cells by B cells over the course of several weeks. Thus, the reported mechanism reconciles attrition of immunological memory by heterologous infection and long-term stability, and places B cells, instead of their descendant plasma cells, at the center of humoral memory.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Infection or vaccination usually induces high levels of antigen-specific antibodies (Abs) in the systemic circulation and mucosal surfaces. These Abs can be maintained for long periods of time in the absence of re-infection, despite the relatively short half-life of serum immunoglobulins, which is measured in weeks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Vieira1">[1]</xref>. For example, virus-neutralizing Abs have been detected in humans over 90 years after Influenza A virus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Yu1">[2]</xref> and in mice over 250 days after lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Slifka1">[3]</xref>. The establishment of these long-term Ab responses relies on the maintenance of antigen-specific memory B cells (MBCs) and long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs). MBCs and LLPCs occupy distinct anatomical locations in the spleen and bone marrow, respectively, which are thought to be of finite size and under homeostatic control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Radbruch1">[4]</xref>. One consequence of such regulation is that new antigenic challenges, particularly with complex pathogens that generate large populations of MBCs and LLPCs, would affect the maintenance of Ab responses to previously encountered antigens.</p>
<p>Infection with the malaria parasite, <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, has long been known to induce a strong B cell response, giving rise to large numbers of LLPCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Nduati1">[5]</xref>, hypergammaglobulinemia in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Greenwood1">[6]</xref> and in experimental models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Cadman1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Achtman1">[8]</xref>, and perturbations of splenic and bone marrow microarchitecture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Cadman1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Looareesuwan1">[9]</xref>. Ab responses, MBCs or LLPCs specific for antigens administered prior to or during an experimental blood-stage malaria infection can be delayed, and/or reduced in magnitude and avidity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Achtman1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Wykes1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-StrambachovMcBride1">[11]</xref>. Similar observations were made after <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> infection of mice, which caused a reduction in pre-established MBCs and LLPCs and an increase in susceptibility to heterologous infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Radwanska1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>The mechanisms by which subsequent infections may cause the attrition of pre-existing heterologous MBCs and LLPCs are not entirely understood. Apoptosis of pre-existing parasite-specific and unrelated MBCs and LLPCs has been described in non-lethal rodent <italic>Plasmodium</italic> strain <italic>P. yoelii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Wykes1">[10]</xref>. Immune complexes cross-linking of the inhibitory receptor FcÎ³RIIB on the surface of LLPCs have been shown to induce apoptosis of LLPCs in the bone marrow that were induced by protein immunization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Xiang1">[13]</xref>. However, it is currently unclear whether or not similar mechanisms underlie loss of pre-established humoral immunity following protein immunization or parasitic infection.</p>
<p>Loss of pre-existing heterologous humoral immunity following parasitic infections has been documented extensively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Wykes1">[10]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Radwanska1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Goumard1">[14]</xref> and is seemingly at odds with long-term maintenance of antiviral Abs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Amanna1">[15]</xref>. Therefore we examined more closely both the kinetics and potential mechanisms of humoral memory attrition. Here, we investigated whether the blood stages of the malaria parasite would affect pre-established humoral immunity to Influenza A virus. We established a mouse model of sequential infection with Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) and the rodent malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi</italic> (AS). We found that sequential infection of PR8-immune mice with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> resulted in the loss of pre-established serum PR8-specific Abs and LLPCs in the bone marrow, and this rendered mice more susceptible to PR8 challenge. Moreover, during <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection, LLPCs underwent apoptosis in the bone marrow, through an FcÎ³RIIB-dependent mechanism. However, the loss of pre-established humoral immunity was temporary, as antiviral serum Abs and LLPC numbers did eventually return to levels observed before the <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection. Importantly, B cells were essential for the maintenance of long-lived serum Ab titers to PR8, as B cell depletion in PR8-immune mice resulted in the eventual loss, without recovery, of LLPCs and antiviral serum Abs. These results confirm the detrimental effect of parasitic infection on the LLPC pool and serum titers of antiviral antibodies, which is eventually restored by further LLPC generation, thus reconciling humoral memory attrition by subsequent infection and long-term stability.</p>

<title>Loss of pre-established humoral immunity after infection with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic></title>
<p>BALB/c mice were first infected with PR8 and the kinetics of Ab induction, specific serum Ab concentrations and specific plasma cells and MBCs were quantified at various time points after infection. Intranasal PR8 infection resulted in a gradual increase in serum HA-specific IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>), which plateaued at a median of approximately 100 Âµg/ml 80â100 days post infection, and remained stable for a further 100 days. By contrast, HA-specific IgM increased within the first 14 days, but did not increase further over the 200-day period of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). Serum neutralizing Ab (nAb) titers measured by a modified viral neutralization test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Kassiotis1">[16]</xref> followed a very similar kinetic to HA-specific IgG Ab response measured by ELISA, peaking approximately 80 day after infection and remaining stable for up to 200 days post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>)</p>

<p>To determine whether the established anti-PR8 humoral response would be affected by a malaria infection, BALB/c mice were infected with 10<sup>5</sup> <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> pE 105 or 150 days after intranasal inoculation of PR8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g001"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>), when the PR8 HA-specific IgG response was stable. Infection with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> at both time points caused a significant reduction in HA-specific IgG within 21 days after the <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g001"><bold>Figure 1DâE</bold></xref>). Importantly the loss of HA-specific IgG Abs was accompanied by a substantial decrease in titers of PR8 neutralizing Abs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g001"><bold>Figure 1F</bold></xref>), and consequently there was also a significant loss of anti-viral immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g001"><bold>Figure 1G</bold></xref>), as shown by the increased viral titers on day 3 upon re-challenge of these PR8-<italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infected mice with PR8 42 days after <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection. Although the cellular immune response to Influenza A virus rechallenge can be highly protective, it is typically delayed in comparison with the immediate protected afforded by pre-existing Abs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Flynn1">[17]</xref>. Therefore, susceptibility to PR8 re-challenge at this early time-point would be indicative of the loss of PRR-specific humoral immunity after <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection.</p>
<p>The loss of PR8-specific Abs was not due to a reduction in half-life of IgG, as neither acute nor chronic <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection induced increased clearance of IgG (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003843.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>). We also established that there was little cross-reactivity of Abs induced by each infection (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003843.s001">Figure S1AâC</xref></bold>), and Abs induced by infection with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> alone were not able to neutralize PR8 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003843.s001">Figure S1D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Therefore, a <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection induced loss of pre-established PR8-specific Abs, which was unrelated to homeostatic regulation of immunoglobulin concentrations.</p>

<title>Loss of pre-established bone marrow plasma cells during acute infection with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic></title>
<p>After infection or immunization, serum Ab levels are thought to be maintained by long-lived plasma cells (LLPC) in the bone marrow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Slifka1">[3]</xref>. Therefore, we investigated whether the reduction of HA-specific Abs, and thus reduced immunity to re-infection with PR8, following a <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection could be due to the loss of LLPC.</p>
<p>First, BALB/c mice were infected with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> and the absolute number of bone marrow (BM) cells from femur pairs was determined for up to 80 days after <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection. In addition, parasitaemia was monitored throughout acute <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection. Bone marrow cellularity was reduced by day 8 following the <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>), coinciding with the peak of parasitaemia, and then recovered on day 20 as the parasitaemia dropped, and remaining stable for up to 80 days post-infection.</p>

<p>We determined the number of HA-specific Ab-secreting cells (ASC) in the bone marrow as a measure of pre-established LLPC. After a primary PR8 infection, HA-specific ASCs accumulated in the bone marrow and reached a stable number by approximately day 50, and remained at this level for up to 250 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>). However, when PR8-immune mice were infected with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> 150 days later, there was a significant reduction in the number of HA-specific ASC within 21 and for up to 42 days of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g002"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref><bold> and </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g002"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref>).

<p>Despite similar peak parasitaemias, there was no loss of either total bone marrow cellularity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g004"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>) or HA-specific ASCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g004"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>) on day 8 of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection in FcÎ³RI,II,III<sup>â/â</sup> mice compared with the significant loss in C56BL/6 mice. In line with this, FcÎ³RI,II,III<sup>â/â</sup> mice retained their pre-established levels of HA-specific serum IgG for up to 56 days after <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g004"><bold>Figure 4D</bold></xref>), whereas there was a significant drop in Ab levels in wild-type C56BL/6 mice at this time. Interestingly, although there was no reduction in total bone marrow cellularity in FcÎ³RI,II,III<sup>â/â</sup> mice after a <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection, there was a significant loss of total bone marrow cellularity in FcÎ³RIIB<sup>â/â</sup> mice infected with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g004"><bold>Figure 4E</bold></xref>), suggesting that the loss of LLPC and the loss of other cells may be via engagement of different Fc receptors.

In line with this, whilst a substantial fraction of total bone marrow cells and bone marrow LLPC in C56BL/6 mice infected with <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> was apoptotic and expressed Annexin V, there was no change in Annexin V expression levels in infected FcÎ³RIIB<sup>â/â</sup> mice at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g004"><bold>Figures 4G and 4H</bold></xref>).

<p>Contrasting the rapid and sustained reduction in HA-specific MBCs, the total MBC niche appeared to be rapidly depleted, but filled up to pre-existing numbers by day 42 (data not shown), presumably with MBC of irrelevant specificities.</p>
<p>In contrast to HA-specific MBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g006"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>), HA-specific ASCs in bone marrow were not immediately depleted by anti-hCD20 mAb treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g006"><bold>Figure 6B and C</bold></xref>). However, we observed a significant decrease in the number of HA-specific ASCs from 70 days post-depletion onwards in hCD20tg mice, but not in hCD20tg-negative littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g006"><bold>Figure 6B and C</bold></xref>). In contrast, there was no change in total IgG ASCs in hCD20tg mice, even 150 days post-depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g006"><bold>Figure 6D</bold></xref>). The eventual loss of HA-specific ASCs, but not of total IgG ASCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g006"><bold>Figure 6E</bold></xref>), suggested that this loss was not a non-specific effect of 2H7 treatment, but perhaps a consequence of the long-term depletion of the HA-specific B cell compartment, which is therefore unable to replenish the HA-specific ASC niche.</p>
<p>Finally, we observed a significant loss of HA-specific IgG only from 70 days post-depletion and for up to 150 days post-depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g006"><bold>Figure 6F</bold></xref>), without any change in total serum IgG in hCD20tg mice (data not shown). This eventual loss of HA-specific ASC and HA-specific serum IgG at later time-points after depletion of HA-specific B cells demonstrates the importance of a complete HA-specific B cell compartment to maintain numbers of HA-specific ASC and HA-specific IgG in mice. The kinetics of the loss of HA-specific ASC and HA-specific Ab were very similar. From these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003843-g006"><bold>Figure 6C and F</bold></xref>), in the absence of a HA-specific B cell compartment, the half-life of HA-specific ASC was calculated to be approximately 72 days, whilst the half-life of serum HA-specific Abs is approximately 86 days.</p>
<p>The requirement for HA-specific B cells in maintaining long-term HA-specific ASCs and Abs strongly suggests that HA-specific B cells are very likely to be responsible for the eventual return of HA-specific ASCs, and therefore serum HA-specific Ab at late time points of <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have used a mouse model to examine the requirements for maintenance of long-term humoral immunity to Influenza A virus, a virus that induces life-long humoral immunity in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Yu1">[2]</xref>. We show that serum levels of Influenza A virus-neutralizing Abs are maintained by continuous conversion of Influenza A virus-specific B cells into antibody-secreting LLPCs under steady-state conditions. A single malaria episode significantly dysregulates this maintenance of Influenza A virus-neutralizing Abs: a <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection, initiated after the B cell and antibody responses to Influenza A virus reach a stable plateau, results in the loss of pre-established serum Abs and plasma cells specific to Influenza A virus and in increased susceptibility to Influenza A virus re-infection. The loss of LLPC and the reduction in Abs is mediated via an FcÎ³RIIB-dependent mechanism resulting in their apoptosis. However, continuous conversion of Influenza A virus-specific B cells into LLPCs following <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection eventually replenishes the LLPC pool and restores humoral immunity to Influenza A virus, highlighting that this arm of adaptive immunity can withstand considerable homeostatic disruption.</p>
<p>Homeostatic regulation of LLPC occurs as they compete for space in survival niches, supported by intrinsic and extrinsic survival resources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Moser1">[27]</xref>. The size of the LLPC niche in the bone marrow is finite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Radbruch1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Sze1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Terstappen1">[29]</xref> and has to accommodate LLPCs with specificities against different infections over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Radbruch1">[4]</xref>. LLPCs may therefore be lost from their niches by competition from new migrating plasmablasts generated by heterologous infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Radbruch1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Odendahl1">[18]</xref>. During each new immune response, some of the pre-established LLPCs are assumed to be removed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Radbruch1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Fairfax1">[30]</xref>. If the numbers of newly migrating plasma cells are sufficiently large to reduce the number of established antigen-specific LLPCs to below the threshold required to sustain enough specific serum Abs to neutralize re-infection, the host may effectively lose protective immunity to that pathogen. Loss of Influenza A virus-specific ASCs and concomitant loss of protective immunity to Influenza A virus re-infection following <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection, in the face of a total IgG ASC pool which did not change during <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection, strongly suggests that such a mechanism operates in this context. Although our analysis took place on day 3 post-rechallenge, which was heavily reliant on pre-existing Abs for protection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Flynn1">[17]</xref>, we cannot formally exclude the potential contribution of cellular immunity. However, unlike the finite LLPC compartment, it is thought that the memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment is expandable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Vezys1">[31]</xref> and therefore perhaps not as susceptible to stochastically-determined attrition as the LLPC pool is.</p>
<p>Several mechanisms have been put forward to explain loss of LLPCs from bone marrow as a result of subsequent infection or immunization. As suggested for developing B cells in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> infections of mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Viki1">[32]</xref>, loss of expression of CXCL12 on LLPCs, which is required for their retention in BM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Tokoyoda1">[33]</xref>, could result in displacement from the BM and subsequent cell death. Although we did not investigate levels of CXCL12 expression on LLPCs, we found no evidence of displacement of LLPCs or HA-specific ASCs into the blood, suggesting that this may not explain the loss of ASCs in this <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection. Rather, our data support the idea that plasma cells undergo apoptosis <italic>in situ</italic> in the bone marrow, in agreement with previous studies in <italic>P. yoelii</italic> infections, in which caspase-3-dependent apoptosis of MBCs and LLPCs was evident <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Wykes1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Apoptosis of LLPCs following injection of an immunogenic cocktail of antigens has been suggested to result from binding of immune complexes to the inhibitory FcÎ³RIIB expressed on B cells and plasma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Xiang1">[13]</xref>. A cell-intrinsic role for FcÎ³RIIB in LLPC apoptosis was demonstrated in adoptive transfer studies of wild-type and FcÎ³RIIB-deficient immune splenocytes, which were then differentiated into LLPCs upon secondary challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Xiang1">[13]</xref>. Early studies using <italic>P. chabaudi</italic>-infected mice also implicated immune complexes of lipoproteins and IgG in inhibiting Ab secretion from ASCs <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Goumard1">[14]</xref>. Here, we show that loss of Influenza A virus-specific LLPCs is also dependent on FcÎ³RIIB, as mice lacking this receptor did not lose pre-established HA-specific ASCs and their LLPCs did not undergo apoptosis following a <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection. Although, a cell-intrinsic role of FcÎ³RIIB in LLPC loss, as previously demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Xiang1">[13]</xref>, was not investigated in this study, it is likely that the observed loss of LPPCs is brought about by FcÎ³RIIB-dependent apoptosis, triggered by extensive hypergammaglobulinemia and the generation of immune complexes that occur during acute <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Achtman1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Stephens1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, in this study we found that Influenza A virus-specific Abs eventually returned to the levels observed before the <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infections, suggesting that specific LLPCs were being replenished despite the fact that the Influenza A virus infection had been eliminated several months previously. One explanation for this is that Influenza A virus-specific B cells have been reactivated, differentiating into PCs and repopulating the Influenza A virus-specific LLPC niche. Indeed, we could show that B cell depletion in Influenza A virus-immune hCD20-transgenic mice resulted in specific depletion of Influenza A virus-specific B cells and eventual loss of LLPCs and Influenza A virus-neutralizing Abs. In contrast, the total IgG ASC population in the bone marrow, the major LLPC reservoir, was not affected by anti-hCD20 mediated depletion, indicating that the eventual loss of HA-specific ASCs and HA-specific IgG was due to a depleted HA-specific B cell pool. Hence our data strongly support a mechanism whereby Influenza A virus-specific B cells contribute to the continuous replenishment of Influenza A virus-specific bone marrow plasma cells and serum Abs.</p>
<p>Generation of Influenza A virus-specific ASCs may also originate either from the recruitment of new naÃ¯ve B cells into a chronic response, an ongoing low-level GC reaction or reactivation of MBCs. However, the GC B cell population was unaffected during B cell depletion in hCD20 transgenic mice, and the naÃ¯ve B cell population, as well as the total MBC population was relatively quickly restored following cessation of anti-hCD20 treatment. These two populations could in principle restore Influenza A virus-specific ASCs. However, Influenza A virus-specific serum Abs showed very little recovery following anti-hCD20 treatment, as did the Influenza A virus-specific MBC population. This observation strongly suggests that the continuous seeding of the LLPC pool and replenishment following <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> infection are mediated by MBCs.</p>
<p>MBCs have a variety of properties, which enable them to maintain serum Abs even in the absence of re-infection. MBCs can survive independently of antigen stimulation and in the absence of mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Maruyama1">[35]</xref>, are intrinsically programmed for faster signaling and self-renewal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Tomayko1">[36]</xref>, and have been documented to re-circulate for up to 90 years after the last known infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Yu1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Crotty1">[37]</xref>. Furthermore, they are unique from other B cell subsets and LLPCs in their independence of the cytokines BAFF and APRIL for their survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Benson1">[38]</xref> and have their own specialized niches like the spleen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-MamaniMatsuda1">[39]</xref>, although the properties of these niches are not well characterized.</p>
<p>While MBCs do not spontaneously differentiate into ASCs, MBCs have a higher propensity to differentiate into PCs than naÃ¯ve B cells upon activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Bernasconi1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Benson2">[40]</xref>. MBCs differentiate into plasma cells upon antigenic stimulation and they have the potential to react to a wider range of pathogenic epitopes than the Abs produced by LLPCs, due to their lower-affinity, more polyreactive B cell receptors (BCRs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-DalPorto1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Tarlinton1">[42]</xref>, meaning that both homologous antigen and cross-reactive stimulation can stimulate the MBC B cell receptor. In addition, human and mouse MBCs can differentiate <italic>in vitro</italic> into plasma cells upon non-BCR-mediated, non-specific Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Bernasconi2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Benson2">[40]</xref>. Therefore there are a number of ways in which MBCs can maintain serum Abs. Over time, MBCs can continually differentiate into ASCs whenever the host encounters homologous re-infection, cross-reactive heterologous infections, or in any inflammatory context with TLR ligands and bystander T cell help, and thus frequently boost serum Ab titers, and/or replenish the LLPC niche <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Bernasconi2">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although antigen-independent MBC conversion to LLPC has been suggested by studies in humans and <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Bernasconi2">[22]</xref>, evidence that non-specific TLR or cytokine-mediated reactivation of MBC occurs <italic>in vivo</italic> in mice is currently lacking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Benson2">[40]</xref>. In contrast, mouse studies have demonstrated that persistence of viral antigens following Influenza A virus infection can be very long, spanning weeks or months <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-JelleyGibbs1">[43]</xref>. It is therefore likely that reactivation of Influenza A virus-specific MBCs and continuous generation of LLPCs is a consequence of antigen retention. Further supporting this notion, MBCs have been shown to reconstitute humoral immunity to cytomegalovirus upon adoptive transfer into re-challenged, but not into antigen-free recipients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Hebeis1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Klenovsek1">[45]</xref>, and MBC reactivation in the lung of Influenza A virus re-challenged mice requires the presence of intact viral particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Onodera1">[46]</xref>. Therefore, both antigen retention and continuous generation of virus-specific ASCs may be seen as part of a robust mechanism to ensure both long-term maintenance of Influenza A virus-neutralizing serum Abs and recovery following episodes of attrition.</p>
<p>These reports indicate that there is a strong biological basis for the importance of MBCs, not just in the anamnestic response, but also in the general maintenance of long-lived serum Abs in the absence of re-infection. However these findings are seemingly at odds with the notion that serum Abs are maintained only by LLPCs, which was inferred by previous B cell depletion studies in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Ahuja2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-DiLillo1">[26]</xref>. The latter studies suggested that the LLPCs generated by protein immunization and acute infection with LCMV (Armstrong) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Slifka1">[3]</xref> are capable of surviving and maintaining pre-established serum Ab titers for long periods of time, despite MBC depletion by monoclonal Abs or irradiation. Our findings suggest that maintenance of long-term humoral immunity exclusively by LLPCs, in the absence of input from B cells, might not be a universal feature of all viral infections. The degree of reliance of the LLPC pool and consequently of protective immunity on continuous conversion of B cells into LLPCs is likely dependent on the size of the virus-specific LLPC pool. A large LLPC pool will require less B cell input before its size is reduced below the critical threshold for protection. In contrast, a small LLPC pool will not be able to resist attrition without continuous B cell input.</p>
<p>Our data have implications for the longevity of protective efficacy of vaccinations in malaria-endemic countries. Field data in humans on the impact of malaria infection on pre-existing immunity are relatively limited. The efficacy of childhood vaccination is reduced in malaria-endemic countries such as Nigeria or The Gambia as compared to non-endemic areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Greenwood2">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Abdurrahman1">[48]</xref>, although the precise underlying reasons are not clear. Furthermore, there are documented outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as polio, despite a high level of vaccination coverage in the same areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Hanlon1">[49]</xref>. However, as the majority of vaccine efficacy studies are carried out in very young infants and children, they might be confounded by a number of factors, such as the immaturity of the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Schellenberg1">[50]</xref> and high pre-existing titers of maternal Abs, which inhibit the development of MBCs and LLPCs. It has been documented that a co-infection with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (i.e. detectable parasitaemia) suppresses the development of vaccine-induced immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Greenwood2">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Williamson1">[51]</xref>, although there are also reports that overall vaccine-induced immunity has not been affected in malaria-endemic countries <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Temple1">[52]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Cutts1">[55]</xref>. Similar studies in farm animals have shown that infection with African trypanosomes significantly reduced the efficacy of several commercial vaccines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Holland1">[56]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003843-Mwangi1">[60]</xref>; however almost all these studies were done with vaccinations given during the time of Trypanosome infection and so do not provide answers to whether a parasite infection caused a loss of pre-established immunity. There is a dearth of investigations into the longevity of pre-established immunity in older age groups living in or moving into malaria-endemic countries where the parasite may have the ability to abrogate pre-established immunity and render the host susceptible to secondary infection. This would be extremely relevant in the context of multiple vaccination programs in malaria-endemic countries.</p>
