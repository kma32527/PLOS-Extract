<abstract>
<p>Neutrophils are the host's first line of defense against infections, and their extracellular traps (NET) were recently shown to kill <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites. Here we report a NET-destroying molecule (Lundep) from the salivary glands of <italic>Lutzomyia longipalpis</italic>. Previous analysis of the sialotranscriptome of <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> showed the potential presence of an endonuclease. Indeed, not only was the cloned cDNA (Lundep) shown to encode a highly active ss- and dsDNAse, but also the same activity was demonstrated to be secreted by salivary glands of female <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic>. Lundep hydrolyzes both ss- and dsDNA with little sequence specificity with a calculated DNase activity of 300000 Kunitz units per mg of protein. Disruption of PMA (phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate)- or parasite-induced NETs by treatment with recombinant Lundep or salivary gland homogenates increases parasite survival in neutrophils. Furthermore, co-injection of recombinant Lundep with metacyclic promastigotes significantly exacerbates <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection in mice when compared with PBS alone or inactive (mutagenized) Lundep. We hypothesize that Lundep helps the parasite to establish an infection by allowing it to escape from the leishmanicidal activity of NETs early after inoculation. Lundep may also assist blood meal intake by lowering the local viscosity caused by the release of host DNA and as an anticoagulant by inhibiting the intrinsic pathway of coagulation.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Salivary components from disease vectors help the arthropod to acquire blood. Here we show that an arthropod vector salivary enzyme affects the innate immune system of the host—mainly the destruction of neutrophil traps—allowing the <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasite to evade the host immune response and to cause an infection. This work highlights the relevance of vector salivary components in parasite transmission and further suggests the inclusion of these proteins as components for an anti-<italic>Leishmania</italic> vaccine. Importantly, because salivary proteins are always present at the site of natural transmission, this work further encourages the testing of vaccine candidates using the natural route of transmission—the bites of an arthropod vector—instead of current practices based solely on needle injection of parasites.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Leishmaniasis comprises human and animal diseases caused by parasites of the genus <italic>Leishmania</italic> that are transmitted by the bite of infected sand flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Alvar1">[1]</xref>. <italic>Leishmania</italic> transmission occurs when an infected sand fly probes the host's skin in search of a blood meal. During probing and feeding, sand flies salivate into the host's skin. Saliva contains powerful pharmacologic components that mediate blood-feeding success and facilitate <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection, first shown when <italic>Lutzomyia longipalpis</italic> salivary glands (SGs) were reported to enhance <italic>Leishmania major</italic> infection in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Titus1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Kamhawi1">[3]</xref>. In the last two decades, SG and recombinant salivary proteins were investigated for their effect in enhancing pathogen transmission in different model systems (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Oliveira1">[4]</xref>). The powerful <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> vasodilator maxadilan along with hyaluronidase were shown to facilitate transmission and establishment of <italic>L. major</italic> parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Morris1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Volfova1">[6]</xref>; however, as we show here, these salivary compounds are not the only active components of sand fly saliva that exacerbate parasite infection.</p>
<p>Neutrophils are considered the host's first line of defense against infections and have been implicated in the immunopathogenesis of leishmaniasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-AbiAbdallah1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Charmoy1">[10]</xref>. <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites evade killing by neutrophils by blocking oxidative burst and entering a nonlytic compartment unable to fuse with lysosomes or by resisting the microbicidal activity of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Gabriel1">[11]</xref>. The mechanism of NET formation (NETosis) in response to <italic>Leishmania sp.</italic> is still under investigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Gabriel1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-GuimaraesCosta1">[12]</xref>; however, recent studies have shown the direct effect of <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> SG extract (SGE) in <italic>L. major</italic> parasite survival inside host neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Prates1">[13]</xref>. This effect was abrogated by pretreatment of SGE with proteases as well as preincubation with antisaliva antibodies, supporting the hypothesis that <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> salivary protein(s) help <italic>Leishmania</italic> survival inside neutrophils. The negative effect of NETosis to <italic>Leishmania</italic> was recently documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-GuimaraesCosta1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this report, we present direct experimental evidence that Lundep (<italic><underline>Lu</underline>tzomyia</italic> <underline>N</underline>ET <underline>de</underline>stroying <underline>p</underline>rotein), a secreted salivary endonuclease, is responsible for the NET-destroying activity of <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> and that this activity enhances parasite infectivity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, Lundep may assist blood-meal intake by lowering the local viscosity caused by the release of host DNA and as an anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory by inhibiting the intrinsic pathway of coagulation.</p>

<title>Initial findings</title>
<p>Bioinformatic survey of the <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> sialotranscriptome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Valenzuela1">[14]</xref> identified a transcript (AY455916; Lundep) containing the NUC-motif (prokaryotic and eukaryotic double (ds) and single (ss) stranded DNA and RNA endonucleases also present in phosphodiesterases) indicative of nonspecific DNA/RNA endonuclease. Alignment of the Lundep putative active center with other proteins of the same family shows the presence of the conserved RGH triad found in most DNases characterized so far (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003923.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). The importance of these residues for catalysis has been previously studied in detail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Miller1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Shlyapnikov1">[16]</xref>. Putative endonucleases retrieved using Lundep as query in the NCBI database, grouped into well supported clade, indicating that they are orthologs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003923.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Visual inspection of sand fly sequences revealed the presence of signal peptide and the putative active site triade RGH necessary for DNA hydrolysis. These putative secreted salivary endonucleases may have the same biological role as Lundep in other sand fly species. The expressed sequence tag of Lundep has a predicted signal peptide of 24 aa, indicative of secretion. Accordingly, endonuclease activity was confirmed in SGEs of female <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003923-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). No endonuclease activity was detected in the SGs of males, which are not blood feeders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003923-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, this activity is present in secretions of probing <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003923-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against rLundep blocked the DNase activity of rLundep and SGE, indicating that Lundep is the major endonuclease in <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> SGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003923.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

<p>Recombinant Lundep (rLundep) was cloned from a SG cDNA library using standard PCR procedures and subcloned into VR2001 expression vector. rLundep was expressed in HEK293 cells and purified by affinity and size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003923.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). rLundep has a strict requirement of divalent metal ions for endonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003923.s003">Figure S3B</xref>,C) with broad pH optimum (5.0–8.0). Purified rLundep hydrolyzes both single-stranded (ss)- and double-stranded (ds)DNA with little sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003923.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

<title>Effect of salivary endonuclease on NET destruction and parasite survival</title>
<p>Because the scaffold of NETs is DNA, we hypothesized that SGE or rLundep could help <italic>L. major</italic> parasites escape from the microbicidal activity of NETs. To test this, we analyzed the ability of <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> SGE and rLundep to destroy human NETs induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and <italic>L. major</italic> metacyclic promastigotes.</p>
<p>Human neutrophils from healthy subjects were activated by PMA or <italic>L. major</italic> parasites for 4 h at 37°C. DNA—the major structural component of NETs—and neutrophil elastase (HNE) were detected by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003923-g002">Figure 2A–F</xref>). Released human neutrophil elastase (HNE) was quantitated using a fluorogenic substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003923-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). First, we analyzed the ability of <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> SGE and rLundep to affect the integrity of PMA-induced NETs. PMA-activated neutrophils were incubated with culture medium (negative control), rLundep, <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> SG, and commercial bovine DNase-I (positive control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003923-g004">Figure 4</xref>). After 30 minutes of incubation, supernatants were collected for HNE quantification and neutrophils fixed and stained for DNA (blue) and HNE (green). NETs remained intact in cells treated with culture medium but were disintegrated by SG or rLundep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003923-g002">Figure 2B, C</xref>). Mutagenesis of Lundep active site (mLundep, RGH197AAA) abrogated its DNase activity and did not affect NETs' integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003923-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We also looked at the HNE released from NETs as an indicator of NET destruction. HNE is normally bound to NETs and found at low concentrations in culture supernatants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Beiter1">[17]</xref>. PMA-activated neutrophils showed that treatment with SGE or rLundep significantly increases the concentration of HNE compared with control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003923-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

Samples were stained for DNA (blue) and human neutrophil elastase (HNE) (green) and Lm-RFP (red).

<p>The effect of rLundep and <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> SGE on <italic>Leishmania</italic>-neutrophil interaction was analyzed <italic>in vitro</italic>. Neutrophils were activated with 10<sup>6</sup> <italic>Leishmania major</italic> expressing red-fluorescent protein (Lm-RFP) promastigotes for 4 h before treatment with <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> SG or rLundep. The NET-destroying activity of <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> SGE and rLundep hydrolyzed the parasite-induced NETs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003923-g002">Figure 2E,F</xref>) and significantly increased the concentration of HNE in the supernatants when compared with medium alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003923-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> SGE and rLundep significantly increased <italic>L. major</italic> survival, indicating that parasites can escape from the leishmanicidal activity of NETs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003923-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).

<title>Lundep exacerbates <italic>Leishmania</italic> metacyclic promastigotes infection in mice</title>
<p>The infection model we used in this work is <italic>Lu. longipalpis-L. major</italic>. Although <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> is not the natural vector of <italic>L. major</italic> this specie of sand fly is permissive to <italic>L. major</italic> infections in laboratory conditions. Furthermore, our laboratory has a well-established murine model of infection for this pair.</p>
<p>Sand-fly bites and needle injection have been previously shown to induce neutrophil recruitment to the parasite inoculation site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Peters1">[18]</xref>. These neutrophils capture <italic>L. major</italic> parasites early after inoculation and efficiently initiate <italic>L. major</italic> infection. To investigate whether rLundep had any effect in exacerbating parasite infectivity <italic>in vivo</italic>, a model of <italic>L. major</italic> infection in C57BL/6 mice was utilized. Four- to five-week-old mice (five animals per group, three independent experiments) were intradermally infected with 10<sup>3</sup> <italic>L. major</italic> promastigotes (control) or parasites admixed with rLundep. Co-inoculation of rLundep with <italic>L. major</italic> parasites resulted in a significantly increased cutaneous lesion, averaging 2-fold larger than those observed in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003923-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). By week 9, control mice had their lesions significantly reduced, whereas cutaneous lesions in mice inoculated with the parasite-rLundep mixture had not healed. Furthermore, the presence of rLundep in <italic>L. major</italic> inoculum resulted in a markedly higher parasite burden in their lesions (15-fold) when compared with parasite alone or in the presence of mLundep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003923-g005">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003923-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

Ear lesions were completely healed in mice inoculated with parasite alone, while mice infected with <italic>L. major</italic>-rLundep had not healed after 9 weeks.

<title>Relevance of Lundep for <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> blood feeding behavior. Inhibition of the contact pathway of coagulation and feeding success</title>
<p>The plasma contact system consists of five plasma proteins that assemble when blood comes into contact with negatively charged surfaces. It has been previously shown that soluble DNA and NETs allow the assembly and activation of the contact system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Oehmcke1">[19]</xref>. The effect of Lundep on the intrinsic coagulation pathway activation was based on the generation of human factor XIIa by soluble DNA or aPTT reagent. One hundred nM of Lundep or TBS was preincubated at 37°C with 100 µg of salmon sperm DNA or 10 µl of aPTT reagent in the presence of the chromogenic substrate S2302. After 20 minutes, the reaction was initiated by adding 50 µl of human normal reference plasma, and the amidolytic activity of FXIIa was measured at 405 nm. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003923-g007">Figure 7A</xref> shows that pretreatment of soluble DNA with Lundep markedly inhibited activation of FXIIa in human normal reference plasma while no effect was observed when aPTT reagent was utilized. Oehmcke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Oehmcke1">[19]</xref> demonstrated that NETs and activated PMN cells can initiate contact activation and promote thrombus formation in the arterial and venous systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Fischer1">[20]</xref>. Consequently, our results indicate that the DNase activity of Lundep may contribute to the antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory functions of <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> saliva.</p>

<p>The feeding success of <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> on mice passively immunized with anti-Lundep or pre-immune IgG (control) was carried out on anesthetized mice. Starved female flies, 2 to 4 days old (never previously fed on blood), were placed in meshed vials, and groups of 10 flies were applied to the surface of both ears of mice passively immunized with either anti-Lundep or pre-immune (naïve) IgG. Flies were allowed to feed for 10 minutes and scored by visual inspection as fully fed, partially fed, or unfed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003923-g007">Figure 7B</xref> shows that flies fed on mice passively immunized with anti-Lundep antibodies were significantly less successful in obtaining a blood meal, while flies feeding on passively immunize mice with naïve IgG fed significantly better in the 10-minute period (p = 0.0001, χ<sup>2</sup> test). Tripet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Tripet1">[21]</xref> highlighted the benefits of feeding aggregations in <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> in particular when feeding on hosts pre-exposed to sand flies bites, suggesting that group feeding maximizes the effect of the salivary component injected at the biting site. Accordingly, abrogating or reducing the salivary nuclease activity of the flies may result in a more viscous blood pool affecting the dispersion of other salivary components involved in blood feeding.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although the killing mechanism(s) of pathogens trapped by NETs is poorly understood, the relevance of secreted endonuclease as a mechanism of evading the microorganism-killing activity of NETs has been highlighted by the presence of endonuclease activity in bacteria-evading, NET-dependent killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Beiter1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Buchanan1">[22]</xref>. The mechanism by which <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes evade killing by neutrophils may be related to their ability to block oxidative burst and to enter a nonlytic compartment unable to fuse with lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Laufs1">[23]</xref> or by resisting the microbicidal activity of NETs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Gabriel1">[11]</xref>. Munafo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Munafo1">[24]</xref> demonstrated that disrupting NETs with DNase-I attenuates extracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by neutrophils stimulated with bacteria. Moreover, this reduction in ROS production is independent of actin depolymerization and phagocytosis.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate that Lundep, a female-specific secreted endonuclease, is an important factor contributing to establishment of <italic>Leishmania</italic> infection. Our observations are also in agreement with previous reports showing that parasite-induced NETs have leishmanicidal activity, thought to be mediated by histones, one of the NETs' structural components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-GuimaraesCosta1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Wang1">[25]</xref>. NETs may also play a role in entrapment of parasites, hence interfering with their ability to enter host cells. Accordingly, by disrupting NETs, Lundep can effectively facilitate the survival of <italic>L. major</italic> parasites in neutrophils and, ultimately, in infecting macrophages and dendritic cells.</p>
<p>Together, these <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments demonstrate that rLundep and <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> SG degrade the DNA scaffold of NETs, destroying their functional integrity. Furthermore, Lundep protected <italic>L. major</italic> parasites from the leishmanicidal activity of NETs, increasing promastigote survival and exacerbating <italic>L. major</italic> infection. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of an induced pathology arise from anti-NET DNAse activity or some other untested mechanism. Because Lundep exacerbated infection with <italic>L. major in vivo</italic> and anti-Lundep antibodies abrogate the enzyme's function, Lundep may be considered a potential vaccine target in an anti-<italic>Leishmania</italic> vaccine cocktail.</p>
<p>With regards to the role of salivary endonucleases in blood feeding arthropods, Calvo and Ribeiro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Calvo1">[26]</xref> proposed that a salivary endonuclease from the mosquito <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> could act as a spreading factor for other salivary activities by reducing the local viscosity at the biting site and hence decreasing the time taken to obtain a blood meal. We also found that anti-Lundep antibodies significantly decreased the feeding success of female <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> flies in passively immunized mice. These results may have epidemiologic relevance in the potential use of Lundep in vaccine, as longer probing and feeding times may trigger defensive behavior of the host, resulting in a disruption of blood feeding or even killing of the sand fly. Evidence of cross-talking between inflammation and coagulation is mounting in the literature. Fuchs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Fuchs1">[27]</xref> demonstrated that NETs are a unique link between inflammation and thrombosis-promoting thrombus organization and stability. Moreover, NETs provide a negatively charged surface that allows the binding and activation of a contact activation system. Activation of the plasma contact system triggers several cascade systems such as the kallikrein-kinin system, the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, the classical complement cascade, and the fibrinolytic system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Nickel1">[28]</xref> rendering an unfavorable environment for blood feeding arthropods. Accordingly, hydrolyzing the DNA scaffold of NETs at the biting site may also reduce local inflammation and prevent propagation of blood clotting facilitating the intake of a blood meal.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we provide experimental evidence that a secreted salivary endonuclease in <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> is capable of destroying NETs produced by activated human neutrophils and that this enzymatic activity exacerbates <italic>L. major</italic> infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, Lundep can assist the flies in blood feeding by reducing local inflammation elicited by the vertebrate host. We believe that our findings are of broad interest to the scientific community. Besides providing new insight into the basic biology of sand-fly blood feeding, the discovery of an endonuclease in SGs of <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> may also have broad implications for understanding the biologic function of secreted endonucleases in other arthropods and the pathogens they transmit.</p>

<title>Measurement of parasite loads</title>
<p>Parasite load was determined using a limiting dilution assay as described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Lima1">[37]</xref>. Briefly, ear tissue was excised and homogenized in RPMI medium. The homogenate was serially diluted on Schneider medium 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µl/ml streptomycin, and 40 mM HEPES and seeded in 96-well plates containing biphasic blood agar (Novy-Nicolle-McNeal). The number of viable parasites was determined from the highest dilution at which promastigotes could be found after 21 days of culture at 23°C.</p>

<title>Polyclonal antibody production and purification</title>
<p>Polyclonal antibodies against rLundep were raised in rabbits by Spring Valley Laboratories, Inc. (Woodline, MD) using a standard protocol. Briefly, rabbits were immunized three times with 125 µg of rLundep every 21 days and the serum collected at day 72. A 10-ml aliquot of rabbit serum (immunized or naïve) was diluted to 50 ml in phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap protein A HP column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and the IgG eluted using a linear gradient of citric acid (100 mM, pH 3.4) on an Akta purifier system (GE Healthcare). Fractions containing purified IgG were pooled and dialyzed against 1× PBS for 16 h at 4°C. IgG quantification was based on 1 absorbance unit at 280 nm equals 0.7 mg/ml.</p>

<title>Antibody protection assay</title>
<p>To investigate the neutralizing activity of anti-rLundep antibodies on its enzymatic activity, <italic>an in vitro</italic> assay was developed. Purified anti-rLundep or naïve antibodies (0 and 5 µg/ml) were mixed with rLundep (10 nM) or SGEs (1 pair) and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. Plasmid DNA hydrolysis and visualization was carried out as described above.</p>

<title>Effect of rLundep on the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation</title>
<p>The effect of rLundep on the intrinsic coagulation pathway was based on the generation of human factor XIIa by DNA or aPTT reagent. Ten µl of rLundep (100 nM) or TBS was preincubated at 37°C with 100 µg of salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) or 10 µl of aPTT reagent (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX) in the presence of 5 µl of the chromogenic substrate S2302 (Diapharma, West Chester, OH). TBS alone was utilized as the reaction blank. After 20 minutes, the reaction was initiated by adding 50 µl of citrated-human normal reference plasma (Diagnostica Stago, Inc. Parsippany, NJ) and the amidolytic activity of fXIIa measured at 405 nm in a plate reader (Molecular Devices). All reactions were supplemented with 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Final concentrations of rLundep and S2302 in the assay reaction were 13 nM and 300 µM, respectively.</p>

<title>Feeding success in passively immunized mice</title>
<p>Purified rabbit anti-Lundep or naïve antibodies were given to the recipient mice via intraperitoneal inoculation of 100 µg (100 µl volume) 15 minutes before exposing five to six CL57B/6 mice to sand flies (10 flies in each ear). Feeding success of sand flies in passively immunized mice was measured on anesthetized animals (four per group) as described Belkaid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003923-Belkaid1">[38]</xref>. Briefly, groups of 10 female flies (3 to 4 day old) were caged in polystyrene tube the day before the experiments was carried out and deprived of sugar. Ready-to-use vials containing starved flies were applied to the surface of anesthetized mouse ear that was previously given either anti-Lundep antibodies or purified naïve IgG. Flies were allowed to feed for 10 min, removed, and scored as either fed or unfed. Flies with their entire abdomen fully engorged or with visible blood were considered as fed. <italic>Lu. longipalpis</italic> flies used in this experiment were not blood fed previously and had no eggs in their abdomen, enabling assessment of a blood meal by visual inspection.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism v 5 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) and plotted as bar graphs or scatter plots. Comparisons were made with the 2-tailed <italic>t</italic> test with 95% confidence interval and 2-way analysis of variance. P&lt;0.05 was considered significant (*, p&lt;0.05; **, p&lt;0.01; ***, p&lt;0.001).). For feeding success, a χ<sup>2</sup> test with 95% confidence interval was used.</p>
