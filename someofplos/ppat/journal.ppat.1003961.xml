<abstract>
<p>The Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein gE-gI is a transmembrane Fc receptor found on the surface of infected cells and virions that binds human immunoglobulin G (hIgG). gE-gI can also participate in antibody bipolar bridging (ABB), a process by which the antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) of the IgG bind a viral antigen while the Fc binds to gE-gI. IgG Fc binds gE-gI at basic, but not acidic, pH, suggesting that IgG bound at extracellular pH by cell surface gE-gI would dissociate and be degraded in acidic endosomes/lysosomes if endocytosed. The fate of viral antigens associated with gE-gI–bound IgG had been unknown: they could remain at the cell surface or be endocytosed with IgG. Here, we developed an in vitro model system for ABB and investigated the trafficking of ABB complexes using 4-D confocal fluorescence imaging of ABB complexes with transferrin or epidermal growth factor, well-characterized intracellular trafficking markers. Our data showed that cells expressing gE-gI and the viral antigen HSV-1 gD endocytosed anti-gD IgG and gD in a gE-gI–dependent process, resulting in lysosomal localization. These results suggest that gE-gI can mediate clearance of infected cell surfaces of anti-viral host IgG and viral antigens to evade IgG-mediated responses, representing a general mechanism for viral Fc receptors in immune evasion and viral pathogenesis.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) infects 40–80% of adults worldwide. HSV-1 initiates infection at mucosal surfaces and spreads along sensory neurons to establish a life-long latent infection that can lead to neurological diseases. Humans usually develop IgG antibodies that specifically recognize pathogens via fragment antigen binding (Fab) variable regions. HSV-1 can avoid the protective effects of antibodies by producing gE-gI, a receptor that binds to the constant portion of IgGs (Fc), thereby tethering the antibody in a position where it cannot trigger downstream immune functions. A gE-gI–bound IgG can participate in antibody bipolar bridging (ABB) such that the Fabs bind a viral antigen and the Fc binds gE-gI. The fate of ABB complexes had been unknown. We used live cell fluorescent imaging to follow ABB complexes during their formation and transport within a cell. We demonstrated that ABB assemblies were internalized into acidic intracellular compartments, where gE-gI dissociated from IgG–viral antigen complexes and the IgG and antigen were targeted for degradation within lysosomes. These results suggest that gE-gI mediates clearance of infected cell surfaces of both anti-viral IgGs and viral antigens, a general mechanism to facilitate latent infection by evading IgG-mediated responses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV), and Pseudorabies Virus (PrV) are members of the alpha herpes virus family, which are characterized by a relatively short replicative cycle in epithelial tissues and egression to and latent infection of the sensory neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Maresch1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Hufner1">[5]</xref>. Alpha herpes viruses have evolved many strategies to evade the host immune system. For example, antibodies do not appear to function effectively in clearance of HSV-1. It has been shown that the severity and persistence of HSV-1 lesions do not correlate with serum levels of neutralizing antibodies in infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Corey1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Dasgupta1">[7]</xref>. HSV-1 encodes type 1 transmembrane glycoproteins, glycoprotein E (gE) and glycoprotein I (gI), that are displayed on the surface of infected cells and virions. Together they function as a receptor for the Fc region of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Johnson1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Johnson2">[9]</xref> and have also been implicated in cell-to-cell spread of virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Dingwell1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Polcicova1">[11]</xref>. In addition, gE is required for HSV-1 movement inside both neuronal and epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Howard1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Wang1">[15]</xref>. The Fc receptor function of gE-gI, which hinders access to the IgG Fc region and thus allows HSV-infected cells to escape recognition by Fc-dependent effector cells, may serve as a mechanism to block antibody-related host defenses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Friedman1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>The gE-gI heterodimer is found on the surface of both virions and infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Johnson1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Goldwich1">[17]</xref>. It has been proposed that endocytosis signals in the cytoplasmic tails of HSV and/or VZV gE and gI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Wisner1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Maresova1">[20]</xref> result in uptake of gE-gI into intracellular compartments of infected cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Olson1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Kenyon1">[23]</xref>. At neutral pH and the slightly basic pH of the cell surface, the gE-gI heterodimer displays a strong binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub>∼340 nM) for the Fc regions of human IgG1, 2, and 4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Johnson1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Chapman1">[24]</xref>. gE alone binds to human Fc with an affinity ∼100-fold weaker than the gE-gI heterodimer (K<sub>D</sub>∼30 µM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Sprague1">[25]</xref>, whereas gI alone shows no Fc or IgG binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Basu1">[26]</xref>. Although endocytosis of gE-gI has been confirmed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Olson2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Kenyon1">[23]</xref>, gE-gI-mediated uptake of IgG bound to antigen into intracellular compartments and the fate of potentially endocytosed IgG had not been investigated. However, the binding affinity of gE-gI for IgG was shown to be pH dependent, with the heterodimer displaying strong binding activity at pH 7.4 and no binding below pH 6.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Sprague1">[25]</xref>. This suggested that any IgG that was endocytosed along with gE-gI would dissociate from gE-gI at the acidic pH of endosomes and degradative intracellular compartments, providing a potential mechanism for HSV-1 to facilitate degradation of anti-viral IgGs.</p>
<p>Antibodies specific for HSV-1 antigens can be simultaneously bound at the surface of HSV-infected cells to gE-gI via their Fc region and to a cell surface antigen by their antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Frank1">[27]</xref>. This process, which is known as antibody bipolar bridging (ABB), may be a strategy to prevent the host from utilizing anti-HSV-1 antibodies in immune responses. It has been shown that gE-gI can mediate ABB on the surface of HSV-infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Frank1">[27]</xref> and that gE-gI is required to prevent host immune functions that require Fc binding, such as complement activation and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, under conditions in which bipolar bridging could occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Dubin1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Lubinski1">[30]</xref>.</p>

<p>Although the participation of gE-gI in ABB has been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Frank1">[27]</xref>, questions regarding the fate of a cell surface ABB complex remain. Given that the cytoplasmic tails of gE and gI include YXXφ and dileucine motifs that trigger endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Wisner1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Alconada1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Olson3">[32]</xref>, a bound IgG and its associated antigen might be endocytosed together with gE-gI. In this scenario, a cell surface viral antigen that is not normally endocytosed could be transported to acidic compartments not in its trafficking itinerary. The IgG/antigen complex would then presumably enter a degradative pathway after dissociating from gE-gI at acidic pH. Alternatively, the gE-gI/IgG/antigen complex could dissociate prior to endocytosis, so that either the IgG/antigen complex remained at the cell surface while gE-gI was endocytosed, or the antigen remained at the cell surface while the gE-gI/IgG complex was endocytosed. A final possibility is that formation of an ABB complex would inhibit gE-gI endocytosis so that the entire complex remained at the cell surface.</p>
<p>Here we describe an <italic>in vitro</italic> system using transiently-transfected human cells to monitor the internalization and trafficking of gE-gI, IgG, and an antigen under conditions in which ABB could or could not occur. Under conditions that favored ABB between an antigen and gE-gI, we found that the antigen and its bound antibody were internalized and targeted to compartments with lysosomal characteristics. By contrast, only background levels of IgG and antigen were found in intracellular compartments when the conditions did not permit IgG binding to gE-gI and/or ABB complex formation. We also demonstrated that the internalized surface antigen, HSV-1 gD, was localized in lysosomal compartments, presumably for degradation. These results suggest that ABB promotes the uptake of IgG and associated viral antigens, which are directed to intracellular degradative compartments that are not part of their normal trafficking itineraries. This provides a mechanism for HSV-infected cells to evade IgG-mediated immune responses by clearing host IgG and viral antigens from the cell surface.</p>

<title>Components of a system to investigate ABB complexes</title>
<p>To create a model system to study the internalization and trafficking of ABB complexes, we co-expressed HSV-1 gE-gI and a cell surface viral antigen, HSV-1 gD, in a human cell line (HeLa) and then determined the effects of adding IgGs that either could or could not form bridged complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We chose to investigate ABB trafficking in transfected cells rather than HSV-1–infected cells because viral proteins other than gE, gI and gD could introduce factors that might confound or obscure gE-gI–mediated effects. For example, HSV-1 gM can reroute gD from the cell surface to the trans-Golgi network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Zhang1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Crump1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>We first established conditions under which we could express gE-gI and characterize its interactions with different IgGs. To avoid potential toxicity of herpes virus glycoproteins in stable cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Friedman2">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Litwin1">[37]</xref>, we expressed the proteins transiently in mammalian cells. To ensure equal levels of expression of gE and gI in the same cell, we created a bicistronic gE-gI construct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003961.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) using F2A, a picornavirus 2A-like peptide sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Ryan1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Gao1">[40]</xref>. We used 3-D confocal immunofluorescence imaging to analyze gE and gI expression from the bicistronic construct in fixed HeLa cells. Cells expressing gE and gI exhibited intracellular staining for both proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003961.s001">Figure S1B</xref>), similar to the reported localization pattern of VZV gE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Edson1">[41]</xref>. Cells transfected with the gE-F2A-gI construct showed comparable levels of both proteins, and all cells that expressed one of the proteins also expressed the other, thus the 2A-containing construct successfully enabled expression of both gE and gI. Therefore staining with anti-gE could be used to verify expression of both gE and gI in the transfected cells.</p>
<p>The next component of our model system involved expression of a membrane-bound antigen. We chose HSV-1 gD, a cell surface glycoprotein found on HSV-1 virions and infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Norrild1">[42]</xref> for which fusion of the cytoplasmic tail to a fluorescent protein did not affect function in viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Snyder2">[43]</xref>. gD binds to host receptors on target cells, and together with other HSV-1 glycoproteins including gB, gH and gL, it is required for HSV-1 infection in cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Reske1">[44]</xref>. The cytoplasmic tail of gD does not include known endocytosis motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Brideau1">[45]</xref>, thus gD would be expected to be primarily localized to the cell surface. We fused the cytoplasmic tail of gD to a fluorescent protein (Dendra2 or Cerulean) so that the localization of gD could be directly tracked (gD-Dendra2) or indirectly determined using an anti-GFP antibody (gD-Cerulean) that would not interfere with the binding of antibodies to the gD ectodomain. We created a plasmid to express gD alone and also a tricistronic construct to express gD together with gE and gI by including a second picornavirus 2A-like peptide sequence. The tricistronic construct directed expression of gE, gI and gD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003961.s001">Figure S1A–C</xref>), which could also be achieved by co-transfection of the gE-gI bicistronic construct together with the gD expression vector. Confocal immunofluorescence imaging of cells transfected with the gD expression plasmid alone, the gE-gI bicistronic and gD plasmids, or the tricistronic plasmid showed gD primarily at the cell surface, where it colocalized with a plasma membrane marker (CellMask), and only background staining in the cytosol and intracellular organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g001">Figure 1B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003961.s001">Figure S1D</xref>).</p>
<p>The final component of our model system was a set of antibodies that could bind to both gE-gI and gD, only to gD, or only to gE-gI. HSV-1 gE-gI exhibits a species preference for IgGs by binding human IgG (hIgG), but not mouse IgG (mIgG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Lubinski1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Johansson1">[46]</xref>. Thus for the anti-gD antibodies, we constructed two forms of the monoclonal anti-gD antibody HSV8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Burioni1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Mayfield1">[48]</xref>: one in which the Fabs were fused to a hIgG1 Fc (anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub>), which could bind to gE-gI via its Fc and to gD via its Fabs, and one in which the Fabs were fused to a mIgG2a Fc (anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub>), which could bind to gD but not to gE-gI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). For the antibody that could bind to gE-gI but not gD (IgG<sub>hFc</sub>), we used a hIgG against an irrelevant antigen (HIV-1 gp120). To verify that the antibodies exhibited the expected binding properties, we used confocal fluorescence microscopy to demonstrate that anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> bound to transfected cells expressing only gD or only gE-gI, that IgG<sub>hFc</sub> bound to cells expressing gE-gI, but not to cells expressing only gD, and that anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub> bound to cells expressing gD but not to cells expressing only gE-gI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g001">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003961.s002">Figure S2</xref>). None of the antibodies bound to cells expressing only Dendra2 or to non-transfected cells in the same field of view (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003961.s001">Figures S1E</xref>, 2).</p>

<title>Characterization of gE-gI- and gD-expressing cells</title>
<p>Cells expressing the gE-gI heterodimer specifically internalized hIgG but not mIgG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003961.s002">Figure S2</xref>), correlating with the binding properties of gE-gI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Chapman1">[24]</xref>. In contrast, gE-gI–negative cells in the same field, cells transfected with gI alone, and untransfected cells did not internalize detectable amounts of IgG under identical assay and imaging conditions (data not shown). Internalization of hIgG in gE-gI–expressing cells was observed when hIgG was incubated at pH 7.4 but not at pH 6.0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003961.s002">Figure S2</xref>), correlating with the pH-dependent binding interaction between gE-gI and IgG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Sprague1">[25]</xref>. Staining for gE and internalized hIgG showed some colocalization, although many intracellular compartments were positive for either gE alone or hIgG alone, consistent with dissociation of hIgG from gE-gI after internalization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003961.s002">Figure S2</xref>,3). In order to determine if antibody binding to gD could trigger IgG and/or gD internalization via a gE-gI–independent mechanism, we repeated the internalization experiments using cells expressing only gD that had been incubated with anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub>, anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub> or IgG<sub>hFc</sub>. Bound anti-gD antibodies remained on the cell surface with little or no internalization and the distribution of gD-Dendra2 was not significantly changed by incubation with anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub>, anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub> or IgG<sub>hFc</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). These results verified that gD localization was unaffected by incubation with antibodies in the absence of gE-gI.</p>

<title>Internalization of ABB complexes</title>
<p>We next conducted internalization experiments on cells expressing gE-gI and gD under conditions in which ABB complexes either could or could not form. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the gE-F2A-gI and gD-Cerulean vectors and then incubated with fluorescent-labeled anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub>, anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub>, or IgG<sub>hFc</sub>. Cells were fixed and stained with antibodies against gE and GFP (to localize gD-Cerulean). In samples treated with anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub>, gD was no longer found at the plasma membrane, but in intracellular compartments, whereas in samples treated with either IgG<sub>hFc</sub> or anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub>, gD was localized to the cell surface, with little or no staining in intracellular compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Similar results were found when cells were treated with unlabeled versions of the three antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003961.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). These results suggested that under conditions in which an antibody (anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub>) can bind to both gD and gE-gI, gD was internalized by gE as a complex with the antibody, whereas when the antibody could bind only to gD (anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub>) or only to gE-gI (IgG<sub>hFc</sub>), gD remained at the cell surface. As expected, anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> and IgG<sub>hFc</sub> were internalized, whereas anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub> remained at the cell surface where it colocalized with gD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). When gD was internalized by addition of the anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> antibody, gD and anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> localized to the same compartments, suggesting they remained as a complex, whereas gE did not colocalize with either anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> or with gD in intracellular compartments, consistent with dissociation of the antibody-gD complex from gE-gI in acidic compartments. These observations were confirmed by quantitative 3-D colocalization analyses, which demonstrated significant colocalization of anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> with gD (resulting from colocalization in intracellular compartments) but no colocalization above background for gE with either IgG or with gD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As expected, we observed significant colocalization of anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub> with gD, which we attributed to their binding interaction at the cell surface, but no significant colocalization of IgG<sub>hFc</sub> with gD, consistent with its inability to bind gD. The lack of colocalization of IgG<sub>hFc</sub> with gE again suggested pH-dependent dissociation of this gE-gI ligand after internalization into acidic intracellular compartments.</p>

<title>Trafficking of ABB complexes to lysosomes</title>
<p>We next used live cell imaging to follow the intracellular trafficking of ABB complex components and a lysosomal marker, epidermal growth factor (EGF).

At early time points in samples incubated with anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub>, gD and anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> fluorescence was localized at the cell surface, and the small amount of gD and anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> fluorescence observed intracellularly was not in EGF-positive compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; 10 min panel).

<title>Trafficking of ABB complexes through recycling endosomes</title>
<p>To further investigate intracellular trafficking of the components of the ABB complex, we conducted live cell imaging experiments using labeled transferrin (Tf).

Several rounds of endocytosis may be required to fully release iron from Tf, thus partially iron-loaded Tf inside endosomes can be recycled to the cell surface as a complex with TfR, where it would remain associated with TfR, allowing another round of receptor-mediated endocytosis into acidic compartments to facilitate release of remaining iron from Tf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Young1">[59]</xref>.</p>
<p>As described for the experiments with EGF, HeLa cells transiently expressing gE, gI, and gD–Dendra2 were co-incubated with fluorescent-labeled iron-loaded Tf and a labeled version of either anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub>, IgG<sub>hFc</sub> or anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub>, and 4-D live cell confocal imaging was performed. At an early time point (5 min), cells incubated with anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> showed anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> and gD labeling at the cell surface and inside the cell, with many intracellular gD–anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> complexes found in the same compartment as Tf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). At later time points, fewer Tf-positive compartments were also positive for gD and anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g005">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003961.s008">Movie S4</xref>).

IgG<sub>hFc</sub> also colocalized with Tf at the 5 min time point, but not at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), consistent with gE-gI–mediated internalization of IgG<sub>hFc</sub> into Tf-positive compartments followed by a diverging intracellular itinerary for IgG<sub>hFc</sub> and Tf, with IgG<sub>hFc</sub> being routed to lysosomes after dissociation from gE-gI. After 60 min, some regions at the cell surface showed colocalization between gD and Tf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g005">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003961.s009">Movie S5</xref>). As gD was shown to remain at the cell surface upon addition of IgG<sub>hFc</sub> to gE-gI–expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g002">Figures 2B</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g003">3B</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g005">5C</xref>), the colocalization of gD with Tf at the cell surface at later time points likely represents colocalization of gD with cell surface TfR complexed with Tf that had not completely released its iron.

<p>Statistical analyses of pairwise 3-D colocalizations showed significant colocalization of gD with the two anti-gD antibodies, but not with IgG<sub>hFc</sub>, at time points after 5 min of incubation, as expected since only the anti-gD antibodies should be bound to gD throughout the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g006">Figure 6</xref>). When incubated with anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub>, Tf colocalized at an early time point (5 min) with both gD and anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub>, likely reflecting transient passage of anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub>–gD complexes bound to gE-gI through Tf-positive early endosomes and subsequent re-routing of anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub>–gD complexes through downstream Tf-negative degradative compartments. In cells incubated with IgG<sub>hFc</sub>, the IgG also colocalized at 5 min with Tf, again likely representing endocytosis of IgG<sub>hFc</sub> into Tf-positive compartments prior to routing to degradative compartments. Consistent with our results and the known Tf trafficking itinerary, colocalization of gD with Tf observed after 5 min in cells incubated with IgG<sub>hFc</sub> likely reflected colocalization of cell-surface gD with cell-surface Tf receptor-Tf complexes formed after an initial round of Tf endocytosis. This interpretation also explained the observed colocalization of both gD and anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub> with Tf after the 5 min time point. Tf colocalization with either gD or anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub> did not significantly change after 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Antibody bipolar bridging (ABB), in which an anti-viral IgG bound to a cell surface antigen also binds to an Fc receptor, has the potential to protect virions and infected cells from IgG-mediated immune responses. gE-gI is an HSV-1 heterodimeric complex that can function as a receptor for human IgGs by binding to their Fc regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Johnson2">[9]</xref>, thus it can mediate ABB in HSV-1–infected cells. Experiments performed in HSV-1-infected cells to compare the efficacy of IgGs that can or cannot form ABB complexes suggested that bipolar bridging protects HSV-1 and HSV-1–infected cells from antibody- and complement-dependent neutralization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Frank1">[27]</xref>, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Lubinski1">[30]</xref>, and granulocyte attachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-VanVliet1">[29]</xref>. Since gE-gI is endocytosed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Wisner1">[18]</xref>, associated IgGs are predicted to be taken into intracellular compartments along with the viral receptor, as we have now demonstrated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003961.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The fate of a cell surface ABB complex remained unknown. Given that most antibodies bind protein antigens with high affinities roughly comparable to the nM affinity of gE-gI for IgG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Sprague1">[25]</xref>, it was possible that antigen-antibody complexes would remain associated during gE-gI-mediated endocytosis such that internalization of gE-gI could indirectly cause uptake of cell surface viral antigens, redirecting them and any associated IgGs to acidic intracellular compartments. This would allow the virus to clear the cell surface of viral antigens and anti-HSV-1 IgGs. Here we constructed an <italic>in vitro</italic> system to monitor the trafficking of bipolar bridged complexes involving the HSV-1 Fc receptor gE-gI, the HSV-1 antigen gD, and IgGs.</p>
<p>Cells expressing gE-gI and gD were incubated without IgG or with one of three forms of IgG: anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> (binds gD and gE-gI), anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub> (binds gD only), and IgG<sub>hFc</sub> (binds gE-gI only) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We then used confocal fluorescence microscopy to localize the HSV-1 proteins, the IgGs, and intracellular markers. In the absence of IgG, gE-gI was mainly intracellular, whereas gD was primarily at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003961.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). This distribution did not change appreciably when cells were incubated with IgGs that could not form ABB complexes (anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub> or IgG<sub>hFc</sub>), but we observed an increase of gD inside intracellular compartments upon addition of anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub>, an IgG that could participate in ABB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In order to objectively evaluate the images, we performed quantitative colocalization studies of ABB components and intracellular markers (Tf for early and sorting endosomes; EGF and Lysotracker for lysosomes) in at least 30 fixed cells and five live cells for each experimental condition. In cells treated with anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub>, these studies showed a significant increase of gD in early endosomes and sorting endosomes at early time points followed by transport of gD into lysosomes, by contrast to the primarily cell surface localization of gD in cells treated with IgG<sub>hFc</sub> or anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g003">Figure 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g006">6</xref>). Given that addition of anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> or anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub> or IgG<sub>hFc</sub> did not cause redistribution of gD to intracellular compartments in cells that did not express gE-gI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), these results demonstrated that ABB complexes were endocytosed along with gE-gI. Although these experiments were done in transfected cells, extrapolating these results to virally-infected cells would provide a mechanism by which HSV-infected cells can sequester both anti-HSV-1 antibodies and viral antigens from the host immune system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Model of ABB and non-ABB component trafficking.</title>
<p>Cell surface ABB complexes (the Fc of anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> bound to gE-gI and the Fabs bound to gD) are endocytosed into early endosomes (EE) and sorting endosomes (SE). Upon acidification, the Fc region of anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> dissociates from gE-gI but the Fabs remain bound to gD. The IgG-gD complex then enters the lysosomal pathway (Lys) to be degraded. Intracellular trafficking of compartments containing ABB components depends upon intact microtubules (thin straws adjacent to intracellular vesicles). Free gE-gI could be trafficked via a retrograde pathway to the Golgi/ER network and recycling endosomes (RE) before recycling back to the cell surface. IgG<sub>hFc</sub> bound to gE-gI traffics similarly, but does not recruit cell surface gD into ABB complexes. Anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub> remains bound to gD at the cell surface.</p>

<p>Other studies have demonstrated that ABB resulting from addition of polyclonal anti-HSV-1 antibodies induced patching, capping and extrusion of alpha-herpes viral glycoproteins in some cell lines, another means of removing viral antigens from the surfaces of infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Favoreel1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Rizvi1">[61]</xref>. Large cross-linked complexes of gE-gI–IgG–antigen could form upon binding of polyclonal antisera containing anti-gE or anti-gI antibodies. The decision to extrude or endocytose an ABB complex might depend on whether the complex exceeds the ∼200 nm size threshold for clathrin-mediated endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Olson3">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>The sharply pH-dependent binding affinity of the gE-gI–IgG interaction (binding at pH 7.4 but not pH 6.0) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Sprague1">[25]</xref> suggested that IgGs bound to gE-gI at the slightly basic pH of the cell surface would dissociate upon encountering the acidic pH of endosomes. Since antibody-antigen interactions are normally stable over the same pH range, an antigen-IgG complex would likely remain associated after the IgG dissociated from gE-gI. This assumption is consistent with our data that showed colocalization of gD and anti-gD throughout the course of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g002">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g006">6</xref>). Additionally, we observed relatively low correlation coefficients for gE colocalization with gD when cells were incubated with anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub>, and for gE with hIgGs when cells were incubated with anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> or IgG<sub>hFc</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Separation of the intracellular trafficking itineraries of gE-gI and IgG–antigen complexes would allow the bulk of gE-gI molecules to be recycled back to the cell surface, likely passing through the ER-Golgi compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Farnsworth1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Alconada2">[63]</xref>, while IgG–antigen complexes that had dissociated from gE-gI would traffic to increasingly acidic compartments, ultimately being targeted to lysosomes for degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This scenario is supported by the preferential colocalization of gD with lysosomal markers when cells were incubated with anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g003">Figures 3A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g004">4</xref>), and IgGs with EGF when cells were incubated with either of anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> or IgG<sub>hFc</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g003">Figures 3A,B</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003961-g004">4</xref>).</p>
<p>Both degradative and recycling pathways could be used to further the agenda of HSV-1 in infected cells: with each new infective event HSV-1 only needs to evade the host humoral immune system for a finite amount of time before nascent viral particles are competent to spread to uninfected cells and new hosts. Internalization of ABB complexes and consequent degradation or recycling offers an elegant solution for HSV-1 to clear membrane proteins that serve as antigenic targets and to selectively remove anti-HSV-1 antibodies, thereby preventing IgG-mediated immune effector functions.</p>

<title>DNA constructs for HSV-1 gD, gE and gI expression in mammalian cells</title>
<p>Genes for HSV-1 gE, gI and gD were provided by Dr. Homayon Ghiasi, Cedars-Sinai Medical Research Institute. Single promoter DNA constructs expressing either one or multiple HSV-1 genes were made using the In-Fusion Enzyme kit from Clontech Inc. (Mountain View, CA), which uses a ≥15 bp overlap to fuse DNA fragments and a linearized vector. To prepare the gD constructs, HSV-1 gD and fluorescent protein (Cerulean or Dendra2) gene sequences were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pCEP4 mammalian expression vector (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) such that the fluorescent protein was fused C-terminal to the cytoplasmic tail of gD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003961.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Confocal imaging using anti-gD antibodies for staining revealed no systematic differences in localizations of gD compared with gD-Cerulean or gD-Dendra2 (data not shown).</p>
<p>To co-express gE and gI from the same mRNA, a spacer encoding a furin protease site (R-X-R/K/X-R) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Thomas1">[64]</xref>, a flexible linker (S-G-S-G) and a picornavirus F2A peptide sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Szymczak1">[65]</xref> were inserted between the HSV-1 gE and gI gene sequences in a pCDNA4.0.TO vector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Szymczak1">[65]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Barsov1">[67]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003961.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). The flexible linker between the N-terminal gE protein and the 2A peptide sequence was added to improve the efficiency of the ribosomal skip mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Szymczak1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Donnelly1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Holst1">[69]</xref>, and the furin cleavage site was added to remove remnants of the linker and P2A sequences. To construct the gE-gI bicistronic vector, the gE gene was modified by PCR to include a 17 bp overlap and a 5′ Not I site, and the gI gene was modified to insert the furin-linker-F2A sequence at its 5′ (N-terminal) end, and a Kpn I site and a 17 bp overlap at its 3′ (C-terminal) end. Both PCR cassettes were fused onto the pCDNA4.0 vector, previously linearized with NotI and KpnI restriction enzymes, using the In-Fusion enzyme kit (Clontech).</p>
<p>To co-express HSV-1 gE, gI and gD-Dendra2 from a single mRNA, we inserted a second form of 2A sequence (a porcine teschovirus-1-derived 2A (P2A) peptide sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Tamura1">[70]</xref>) between gI and gD-Dendra2 to create a tricistronic construct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003961.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). The gE-F2A-gI encoding sequence was modified by PCR to include a 17 bp overlap at the 5′ end of the gE gene and a Kpn I site plus the P2A peptide sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Tamura1">[70]</xref> at the 3′ end of the gI gene. The HSV-1 gD-Dendra2 sequence was modified by PCR to insert the P2A sequence at the 5′ end of the gD gene and an EcoRI site and a 17 bp overlap at the 3′ end of the Dendra2 gene. Both PCR cassettes were fused onto the pCDNA4.0 vector, previously linearized with NotI and EcoRI, using the In-Fusion enzyme kit.</p>

<title>Expression and purification of antibodies</title>
<p>Genes for the heavy and light chains of the anti-gD antibody HSV8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Mayfield1">[48]</xref> were provided by Dr. Stephen Mayfield, Scripps Research Institute. The HSV8 light chain gene was modified by PCR to include 5′ and 3′ EcoRI sites and then ligated into the pCDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Life Technologies). The portion of the HSV8 heavy chain gene encoding the Fab V<sub>H</sub> and C<sub>H</sub>1 domains was modified by PCR to include a 5′ XhoI site and a 3′ SpeI site and then subcloned into the pAc-k-Fc baculovirus expression vector (PROGEN Biotechnik), which includes the gene for the human IgG1 Fc (hFc). This gene was modified by PCR to include 5′ and 3′ BamHI sites and then subcloned into the pCDNA3.1 expression vector using the BamHI site. To make an anti-gD antibody with a mouse Fc region (mFc), PCR was used to insert a 5′ BamHI site and a 3′ bridging sequence (21 nucleotides encoding the end of the HSV8 Fab followed by 20 nucleotides encoding the IgG2a mFc). The Fc portion of the mIgG2a gene (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) was modified by PCR to include the bridging sequence and a 3′ BamHI site. The two products were mixed together and PCR amplified to generate the anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub> fusion, which was then ligated into the pCDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Life Technologies).</p>
<p>Antibodies were expressed by co-transfection of heavy and light chain expression vectors to produce anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub> and anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub> (anti-gD antibodies with a human or a mouse Fc region), and IgG<sub>hFc</sub> (2G12, a human IgG1 antibody against HIV gp120) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Trkola1">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Trkola2">[72]</xref>.

Six days post-transfection, IgGs were purified from the harvested media by Protein A chromatography using Protein A agarose beads (Pierce/Thermo-Scientific).

<title>Cell culture, transfection and preparation</title>
<p>HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 100 µg/mL penicillin/streptomycin mix (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and incubated at 37°C under a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Fully confluent cells were detached using 0.25% (w/v) trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies) and passaged every 3 days.</p>
<p>Attempts to make stable HeLa cell lines constitutively expressing gE, gI, or both proteins were unsuccessful, presumably due to toxicity associated with expression of these proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Litwin1">[37]</xref>. A stable cell line expressing VZV gE under the control of an inducible promoter was reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Mo1">[19]</xref>. We therefore attempted to use a dual induction system involving expression of gE under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Yao1">[74]</xref> and expression of gI under the control of a cumate-inducible promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003961-Mullick1">[75]</xref>. Although we were able to create a stable HeLa cell line expressing an inducible gE, we were unable to isolate stable cell lines that expressed gI after induction, either in the gE-inducible cell line or in cells that did not express gE (data not shown). We therefore switched to transient transfections to express gE, gI and gD for short periods of time. The gE-F2A-gI, gE-F2A-gI-P2A-gD-Dendra2 and gD-Cerulean expression vectors were transiently transfected either alone or in various combinations into HeLa cells using a cationic liposome transfection procedure (Lipofectamine 2000, Life Technologies). At least 18 hours post-transfection, the cells were treated with 75 µg/mL cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) to attenuate intracellular staining of newly synthesized proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus. Two hours later, the cells were rinsed in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution, 10 mM MES pH 6.0, 1% ovalbumin, and 75 µg/mL cycloheximide (M1 buffer) at 37°C for 5 min to remove trace amounts of bovine IgG in the ultra-low IgG serum used for cell culture (the pH was lowered to 6.0 to promote dissociation of any bovine IgG present in the serum that might be bound to cell surface gE-gI). The cells were then incubated at 37°C with 2 µg/mL labeled or unlabeled IgG (either anti-gD<sub>hFc</sub>, anti-gD<sub>mFc</sub>, or IgG<sub>hFc</sub>) in a serum-free Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Life Technologies) and 75 µg/mL cycloheximide at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
