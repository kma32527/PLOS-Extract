<abstract>
<p>The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is extremely prevalent in the human population. Infection by HCMV is life threatening in immune compromised individuals and in immune competent individuals it can cause severe birth defects, developmental retardation and is even associated with tumor development. While numerous mechanisms were developed by HCMV to interfere with immune cell activity, much less is known about cellular mechanisms that operate in response to HCMV infection. Here we demonstrate that in response to HCMV infection, the expression of the short form of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 (ADAR1-p110) is induced. We identified the specific promoter region responsible for this induction and we show that ADAR1-p110 can edit miR-376a. Accordingly, we demonstrate that the levels of the edited-miR-376a (miR-376a(e)) increase during HCMV infection. Importantly, we show that miR-376a(e) downregulates the immune modulating molecule HLA-E and that this consequently renders HCMV infected cells susceptible to elimination by NK cells.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects a high percentage of the human population. HCMV infection is life threatening to immune-compromised individuals and when transmitted to the fetus can cause severe birth defects. Thus, it is crucial to understand the anti-viral strategies that are induced in response to HCMV infection. By using molecular tools, next generation deep sequencing of small RNAs and a novel human decidual organ culture we demonstrate that in response to HCMV infection the cell launches an anti-viral response that via miRNA editing enables the elimination of HCMV infected cells. We find that following HCMV infection a specific ADAR1 isoform, ADAR1-p110, is strongly induced and that in addition editing of miR-376a is also increases. We continue to show that the edited-miR-376a then downregulates the inhibitory molecule HLA-E, and by doing so promotes the elimination of HCMV infected cells by NK cells. Finally we demonstrate that in decidual tissues ADAR1-p110 is induced and that HLA-E levels are reduced in response to HCMV infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>HCMV is a dsDNA herpesvirus, which is highly prevalent in the human population. It establishes its life long latency by using a diverse panel of sophisticated immune evasion strategies, and specifically by manipulating the expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Mocarski1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Furman1">[4]</xref>. One of the fascinating examples with this regard is the viral protein UL40 that encodes a signal peptide similar in its sequence to the signal peptide of HLA class I molecules. The UL40 signal peptide is processed and loaded specifically in the groove of HLA-E and thus induces its surface expression, where it can inhibit NK cells function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Tomasec1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Ulbrecht1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Natural Killer (NK) cells are innate immune lymphocytes, which recognize and eliminate hazardous cells such as virally infected, transformed and damaged cells. The activity of NK cells is regulated by a balance of signals generated by activating and inhibitory receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Arnon1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Seidel1">[10]</xref>. While the activating ligands of NK cells are diverse, most of the NK inhibitory ligands belong to the HLA class I family. Thus, reduction in the normal expression levels of HLA class I proteins will result in the activation of NK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Ljunggren1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Raulet1">[12]</xref>. Among the HLA class I proteins, the non-classical HLA-E is distinct in that it presents in its groove only a limited variety of peptides, which are primarily derived from the signal peptides of other HLA class I molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-OCallaghan1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-OCallaghan2">[14]</xref>. HLA-E is mainly recognized by the inhibitory CD94/NKG2A heterodimer and by the activating CD94/NKG2C receptors, both are expressed by T cells and NK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Braud1">[15]</xref>. Interestingly, expansion of NK clones expressing NKG2C is often seen HCMV-seropositive individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Guma1">[16]</xref>, yet the function of these NK clones is unclear.</p>
<p>Several activating NK cell receptors exist, that bind to divers ligands. The NKG2D receptor is one of the potent NK cell activating receptors, recognizing 8 different ligands: UPBP 1–6, MICA and MICB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Raulet2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Raulet3">[18]</xref>. While the ULBP family has orthologous in mice and in primates, mice do not encode MIC genes and most primates encode only a single MIC gene. We have shown in the past that the expression of MICA and MICB is controlled by cellular and by viral miRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Nachmani1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Tsukerman1">[21]</xref>. Interestingly, one of the miRNA that was shown by us to target MICB, miR-376a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Nachmani1">[19]</xref>, is known to be edited by ADAR enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Kawahara1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>RNA editing is a post-transcriptional modification that generates diversity in RNA molecules and in proteins. A-to-I RNA editing is catalyzed by the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Farajollahi1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Nishikura1">[24]</xref>, which bind dsRNA structures (that are not completely defined), and can thus edit protein-coding mRNAs and non-coding RNA molecules such as microRNAs (miRNAs). The editing of miRNAs can result in a change in the specificity of the miRNA, especially if the editing event occurs in the seed sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Nishikura1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>Two active ubiquitously expressed ADAR genes are known, ADAR1 and ADAR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Nishikura1">[24]</xref>. The ADAR1 enzyme has two considerably different isoforms; ADAR1-p150, which is induced by type I interferon (IFN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Patterson1">[25]</xref> and is located mainly in the cytoplasm and ADAR1-p110, that is thought to be constitutively expressed and is located mainly in the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-George1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Kawakubo1">[28]</xref>. ADAR proteins are physiologically crucial as knock-out of Adar1 is embryonic lethal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Hartner1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-XuFeng1">[31]</xref> and knock-out of Adar2 results in behavioral abnormalities including epileptic seizures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Higuchi1">[32]</xref>. ADAR proteins also function during viral infections and were shown to be either proviral or antiviral <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Samuel1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we show that specifically during HCMV infection ADAR1-p110, and not ADAR1-p150, is induced. We further show that increased editing of miR-376a is observed upon HCMV infection and that the edited miR-376a (miR-376a(e)), downregulates the expression of HLA-E to render infected cells susceptible to elimination by NK cells.</p>

<title>ADAR1-p110 is induced during HCMV infection via a specific promoter</title>
<p>Because it is known that ADAR1-p150 is induced during several viral infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Tenoever1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Chambers1">[37]</xref> and since it is unknown whether ADAR proteins are induced during HCMV infection we initially analyzed the expression of the two active ADAR proteins, ADAR1 and ADAR2, prior and following HCMV infection of Human Foreskin Fibroblasts (HFFs). ADAR2 was undetected in HFF cells prior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s001">Fig. S1a</xref>), and following infection (data not shown). Surprisingly, although it is known that the expression of ADAR1-p150 is induced following interferon (IFN) treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Patterson1">[25]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s001">Fig. S1b</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s001">Fig. S1c</xref>), only the expression of ADAR1-p110, which was considered until now constitutive, significantly increased following HCMV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s001">Fig. S1d</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we investigated whether ADAR1-p110 would be induced by additional HCMV strains. We infected cells with AD169, TB40/E, low passage Merlin strain, and with a clinical isolate (CI) and observed increased expression of ADAR1-p110 following infection by all strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s001">Fig. S1e</xref>). The induction of ADAR1-p110 was not cell specific as it was observed also in ARPE-19 cells (epithelial origin) infected with the TB40/E strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g001">Fig. 1c</xref>, quantified <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s001">Fig. S1f</xref>). Next, to examine whether the induction of ADAR1-p110 is virus specific, we infected HFF cells with additional herpesviruses; HSV1 and HSV2, and did not observe any changes in ADAR1-p110 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g001">Fig. 1d</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s001">Fig. S1g</xref>). We also infected A549 cells with the DNA virus Adenovirus (AdV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g001">Fig. 1e</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s001">Fig. S1h</xref>), and with the RNA viruses Influenza and the human metapneumovirus (hMPV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g001">Fig. 1f</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s001">Fig. S1i</xref>). We used A549 in these cases, as HFF cells are not permissive to infections with these viruses. Following infection we did not observe changes in ADAR1-p110 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g001">Fig. 1e and f</xref> quantified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s001">Fig. S1h and I, </xref>respectively). Yet, the expression of ADAR1-p150 was increased by these viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g001">Fig. 1e and f</xref> quantified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s001">Fig. S1h and I, </xref>respectively). Thus we conclude that following HCMV infection ADAR1-p110 is specifically induced.</p>

<title>ADAR1-p110 is induced via specific promoter during HCMV infection</title>
<p>To elucidate the mechanism of ADAR1-p110 induction we cloned all known <italic>ADAR1</italic> promoters upstream to a Firefly reporter. Expression of the <italic>ADAR1</italic> gene is controlled by four alternative promoters, of which three drive the expression of ADAR1-p110 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>, genomic regions 1B, 1C and 2, white boxes, translation initiation at Met296) and a fourth promoter, IFN-inducible, that controls the expression of ADAR1-p150 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>, genomic region 1A, black box, translation initiation at Met1). The activity of each reporter was assessed under IFN-α or IFN-β treatments or during HCMV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>). As previously reported, the genomic region 1A induced the reporter's activity following IFN treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Patterson1">[25]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>). Importantly, while genomic regions 1C and 2 did not affect the activity of the Firefly reporter in the various treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>), genomic region 1B strongly induced Firefly activity, only following HCMV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>). We also assessed the activity of the various reporters in ARPE-19 cells infected with TB40/E strain and obtained similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g002">Fig. 2c</xref>)</p>

<p>(a) Schematic description of the alternative promoters of the ADAR1 gene (black arrows) and their alternative splicing (dotted lines). Exons 1B, 1C and 2 (white boxes), drive the expression of the ADAR1-p110, while exon 1A (black box) drives the expression of ADAR1-p150.

<p>To investigate at which stage of infection is ADAR1-p110 induced, we transfected HFF cells with the 1B reporter, and then infected the cells in the presence or absence of late-gene expression inhibitor, Ganciclovir (GCV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g002">Fig. 2d</xref>). As can be seen, GCV treatment did not affect ADAR1-p110 induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g002">Fig. 2d</xref>). Indeed when we followed the kinetics of ADAR1-p110 induction we observed that the induction of the 1B reporter's expression was very rapid, and was detected as early as six hours post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g002">Fig. 2e</xref>, black bars). Moreover, it was not induced when a UV-inactivated virus was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g002">Fig. 2e</xref>, grey bars), indicating that the 1B promoter is activated only due to infection by a transcriptionally active virus, either by the virus itself or as a cellular response to HCMV infection.</p>

<title>ADAR1-p110 affects the editing of miR-376a</title>
<p>MiR-376a was shown to be one of the primary miRNAs that undergo editing by ADAR proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Kawahara1">[22]</xref>. Here we observed that ADAR1-p110 is specifically induced during HCMV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g001">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g002">2</xref>). Thus, we were next interested to evaluate the levels of the edited-miR-376a (named here miR-376a(e)) during HCMV infection. As miR-376a and miR-376a(e) differ in only one nucleotide, it is impossible to distinguish between the two miRNAs by qRT-PCR. Hence we performed next generation small RNA sequencing on uninfected and HCMV infected HFF cells and observed an increase in miR-376a(e) levels following infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p>

<p>To demonstrate that ADAR1-p110 has a role in the editing of miR-376a during HCMV infection we knocked down ADAR1. Because the transcript of ADAR1-p110 is included within the transcript of ADAR1-p150 it is impossible to knock down only ADAR1-p110 without affecting the expression of ADAR1-p150. We therefore prepared two shRNA constructs, one that targets ADAR1-p150 specifically (shADAR1-p150) and another that targets both isoforms of ADAR1 (shADAR1) and transduced HFF cells with these constructs. The KD of ADAR1-p110 by shADAR1 was very efficient as demonstrated by WB analysis of uninfected and HCMV infected HFF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g003">Fig. 3c</xref>), while the KD of ADAR1-p150 affect only the expression of ADAR1-p150 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Next, we evaluated the levels of miR-376a(e) in the shADAR1 cells following HCMV infection by small RNA next generation sequencing and observed reduced levels of miR-376a(e) as compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g003">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>
<p>To corroborate the above findings, we cloned ADAR1-p110 into a lentiviral vector and transduced HFF cells. The over expression of ADAR1-p110 was validated by WB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g003">Fig. 3e</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g003">Fig. 3f</xref>).

<title>Editing of miR-376a abolishes its ability to regulate MICB</title>
<p>So far we showed that ADAR1-p110 is induced specifically during HCMV infection and that ADAR1-p110 can edit miR-376a. Interestingly, we demonstrated in the past that miR-376a down regulates the expression of the stress-induced ligand MICB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Nachmani1">[19]</xref>. Because the editing of miR-376a occurs in its seed region, it is expected (as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Kawahara1">[22]</xref>) that the target spectrum of miR-376a(e) will be different than that of miR-376a. Indeed, miR-376a(e) does not have a full seed base-pairing with the 3′UTR of MICB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>).

<p>RKO cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding miR-376a, miR-376a(e), or a control miRNA. As previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Nachmani1">[19]</xref>, a moderate, yet statistically significant reduction in MICB expression was observed in cells transduced with miR-376a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>, left, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g004">Fig. 4c</xref>), while the expression of other NKG2D ligands expressed on RKO cells was not affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s003">Fig. S3a</xref>). In contrast, little or no change in MICB levels was observed in cells transduced with miR-376a(e) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g004">Fig. 4b</xref> right, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g004">Fig. 4c</xref>). Furthermore, dual luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-376a(e) is unable to repress reporter's activity when fused to the 3′ UTR of MICB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g004">Fig. 4d</xref>). These observations were supported by NK killing assays against the transduced RKO cells in which the expression of miR-376a lead to reduced NK cell killing while expression of miR-376a(e) had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g004">Fig. 4e</xref>). Thus, we concluded as we previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Tsukerman1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Bauman1">[38]</xref> that even a moderate change in MICB expression that is mediated by miR-376a is sufficient to affect NK cytotoxicity and that miR-376a(e) does not affect MICB expression. In light of future findings describe below, we also assessed the levels of HLA-E on RKO cells and found that they do not express HLA-E (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s003">Fig. S3b</xref>).</p>
<p>We next transduced RKO cells with lentiviral vectors expressing either ADAR1-p110 or a control vector and assessed the levels of the NKG2D ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g004">Fig. 4f</xref>, quantified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g004">Fig. 4g</xref>). Although RKO cell already express ADAR1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s004">Fig. S4a</xref>) overexpression of ADAR-p110 (black histograms), moderately elevated the levels of MICB only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g004">Fig. 4f</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g004">Fig. 4g</xref>), probably due to reduced miR-376a levels. As an additional control we also overexpressed ADAR1-p110 in cells that do not express or express little amounts of MICB (293T and BJAB, but express ADAR1-p110, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s004">Fig. S4a</xref>) and observed no changes in the expression of MICB or in other NKG2D ligand (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s004">Fig. S4b</xref>).

<title>MiR-376a(e) directly binds the 3′ UTR of HLA-E and regulates its expression</title>
<p>Because miR-376a(e) does not control the expression of MICB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) and since we showed that ADAR1-p110 is strongly induced specifically upon HCMV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g001">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g002">2</xref>) leading to increase levels of miR-376a(e) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).

<p>Whether HLA-E is regulated by miRNAs is unknown. Therefore, we initially tested this by knocking down the RNase III enzyme Drosha (one of the central enzymes involved miRNA biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Bartel1">[39]</xref>). KD of Drosha (which was validated by WB, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s005">Fig. S5a</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s005">Fig. S5b</xref>) resulted in elevated levels of HLA-E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g005">Fig. 5b</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g005">Fig. 5c</xref>).</p>
<p>To demonstrate that miR-376a(e) specifically, controls the expression of HLA-E we overexpressed miR-376a(e), miR-376a or a control miRNA in BJAB cells (we selected BJAB cells because they express HLA-E). Indeed reduced HLA-E levels were observed only in cells transduced with miR-376a(e), whereas the unedited miR-376a or control-miRNA had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g005">Fig. 5d</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g005">Fig. 5e</xref>).</p>
<p>To validate that miR-376a(e) regulates HLA-E by directly binding to the predicted binding sites, we fused the 3′ UTR of HLA-E downstream to a <italic>Firefly</italic> reporter.

To demonstrated that miR-376a(e) regulates HLA-E expression by direct binding to the predicted sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g005">Fig. 5a</xref>), we generated reporters bearing single (mut187 or mut1342) and double (mut187 and mut1342, named Dmut) mutations in the predicted binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). All mutant reporters abolished the miR-376a(e)-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g005">Fig. 5g</xref>).

<p>Finally, qRT-PCR analysis of the relative abundance of HLA-E mRNA in cells transduced with miR-376a(e) demonstrated no effect as compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g005">Fig. 5h</xref>), suggesting that miR-376a(e) represses HLA-E expression through translational inhibition.</p>

<title>MiR-376a(e)-mediated regulation of HLA-E during infection affects NK cell cytotoxicity</title>
<p>After we demonstrated that antagonizing ADAR1-p110 and miR-376a(e) affects HLA-E during HCMV infection we next wanted to test the functional implications of these findings.</p>
<p>HCMV infected HFF cells were initially transduced with the shADAR1 lentiviruses indeed showed reduced NK killing (data not shown). Yet, when the interaction between HLA-E and CD94 (the chain that recognizes HLA-E) were blocked, only a partial restoration of killing was observed (data not shown), suggesting that the ADAR1 proteins affect other molecules and pathways, in addition to HLA-E, that control NK cell activity.</p>
<p>Thus to demonstrate the functional effect miR-376a(e) has on NK killing of HCMV infected HFF cells we utilize the sponges mentioned above and for that we initially verified the sponge's specificity. HFF cells were transduced with the sponges against miR-376a and against miR-376a(e) and MICB levels were evaluated. In agreement with our above results in which we showed that miR-376a(e) does not control the expression of MICB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>), only the anti-miR-376a sponge had an effect on the levels of MICB in uninfected HFF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g007">Fig. 7a</xref>). In contrast, during HCMV infection only the anti-miR-376a(e) sponge led to increase levels of HLA-E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g007">Fig. 7b</xref>). We have also tested whether the sponges affect MICB expression following HCMV infection and observed that none of the sponges affect MICB expression during infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003963.s008">Fig. S8</xref>). This is because the anti-miR-376a(e) sponge does not antagonize MICB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g007">Fig. 7a</xref>) and because, as we have previously shown the anti-miR-376a sponge by itself is not sufficient to alter the levels of MICB during HCMV infection due to a synergistic interaction with the viral miR-UL112 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Nachmani1">[19]</xref>.</p>

<p>HLA-E is the known ligand of two immune receptors; the inhibitory heterodimer CD94/NKG2A and the activating heterodimer CD94/NKG2C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Braud1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Borrego1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Lee1">[43]</xref>. It was demonstrated that the proportion of NKG2C<sup>+</sup> NK cells increases significantly after HCMV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Guma1">[16]</xref>, yet the functional significance of this expansion is still unclear. Thus, to test the functional significance of the miR-376a(e)-mediated control of HLA-E during infection we isolated NK cells from four HCMV<sup>neg</sup> and four HCMV<sup>pos</sup> donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g007">Fig. 7c</xref>). Consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Guma1">[16]</xref>, the proportion of the NKG2C<sup>+</sup> NK population was indeed higher in the HCMV<sup>pos</sup> as compared to HCMV<sup>neg</sup> donors, while the proportion of NKG2A<sup>+</sup> NK cells was lower in the HCMV<sup>pos</sup> donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g007">Fig. 7c</xref>). In contrast, the proportion of CD94<sup>+</sup> NK cells (CD94 is the common chain of the NKG2A and NKG2C heterodimers that recognizes HLA-E) did not significantly change between donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g007">Fig. 7c</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, HFF cells transduced either with the anti-miR-376a(e)-sponge or with a control sponge, were infected with HCMV and subjected to killing by NK cells derived from HCMV<sup>neg</sup> and HCMV<sup>pos</sup> donors. Irrespective of the donors' NKG2C<sup>+</sup> NK cells percentage, the expression of the anti-miR-376a(e)-sponge which led to increased levels of HLA-E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g006">Fig. 6c</xref>), resulted in inhibition of NK function and reduced killing of infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g007">Fig. 7d</xref>). Blocking of CD94 led to equivalent levels of killing of all cells by all donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g007">Fig. 7d</xref>). We also performed the reciprocal experiments in which we transduced HFF cells with miR-376a(e) (which leads to the down regulation of HLA-E). In this scenario, the killing of the infected HFF was increased (due to reduced inhibition) and as above, the increased killing was observed by all donors, irrespective of their phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g007">Fig. 7e</xref>). Blocking of CD94 restored the killing to that observed with cells infected by control miRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g007">Fig. 7e</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these results demonstrate the dominance of the inhibitory signal generated by NKG2A in controlling NK cell activity and the importance of the regulation of HLA-E by miR-376a(e) during HCMV infection.</p>

<title>HCMV infection induces ADAR1 and reduces HLA-E expression in human decidua</title>
<p>We next wanted to investigate the influence of ADAR1-p110 induction on HLA-E expression in vivo. However, HCMV is very different from the mouse CMV (MCMV) and as the human virus infects only humans there is practically no murine model that enables us to investigate HCMV infection in vivo. Moreover, no sites for the mouse orthologue of miR-376a(e) (mmu-miR-376b(e)) were predicted in the 3′UTR of the mouse orthologue of HLA-E, Qa-1b.</p>
<p>HCMV is highly prevalent in the human population and is the leading cause of congenital infection, associated with severe birth defects and intrauterine growth retardation. The decidua is the maternal part of the placenta through which infection of HCMV is probably transmitted to the fetus. Recently, a new organ culture model was established in which human decidua is maintained, ex-vivo, and infected with HCMV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Weisblum1">[44]</xref>. This unique model enables us to examine some of our observations under physiological conditions.</p>
<p>Decidual organs were infected with the AD169 strain of HCMV that expresses IE72-GFP enabling the detection of infected cells (GFP<sup>pos</sup>). As expected, the HCMV infected cells (GFP<sup>pos</sup>) demonstrated typical enlarged cell morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). The organ cultures were next immunofluorescencenly stained for ADAR1 or HLA-E expression either early (36 hrs) or late (7days) during HCMV infection. In agreement with our above results, HCMV infected cells (GFP<sup>pos</sup> cells) demonstrated elevated nuclear ADAR1-p110 staining at both early and late time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g008">Fig. 8a–d</xref>). In contrast, HLA-E levels were initially increased in HCMV infected cells (GFP<sup>pos</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g008">Fig. 8e and 8f</xref>), probably because of the viral UL40 protein, but were then reduced as infection prolonged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003963-g008">Fig. 8g and 8h</xref>), probably due to the editing of miR-376a(e) which results in the down regulation of HLA-E.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>ADAR1 encodes two isoforms: ADAR1-p110, which was until now thought to be constitutively expressed, and ADAR1-p150, which is IFN-induced. These two isoforms are located at different compartments in the cell; ADAR1-p110 is located primarily in the nucleus, and ADAR1-p150 is located mainly in the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Nishikura1">[24]</xref>. It is therefore expected that each isoform will have a specific range of RNA targets, and thus different roles in different physiological conditions.</p>
<p>The role of ADAR1 proteins (especially ADAR1-p150) during infection was mostly investigated in the context of RNA viruses such as influenza virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Tenoever1">[34]</xref>, hepatitis C virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Taylor1">[35]</xref> Rift Valley fever virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Suspene1">[36]</xref> and mumps virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Chambers1">[37]</xref>. ADAR enzymes can also edit transcripts of DNA viruses (including viral miRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Samuel1">[33]</xref>), but in DNA virus infections it is unknown which ADAR protein mediates these editing events and what are the functional consequences of such editing.</p>
<p>Herein we demonstrate that the expression of ADAR1-p110 is induced during HCMV infection. We further show that this induction in ADAR1-p110 expression is HCMV specific and that it was not observed when other viruses were used. Additionally we show that miR-376a is edited during HCMV infection and that knockdown or over expression of ADAR1-p110 affects miR-376a editing, suggesting that ADAR1-p110 controls the editing of miR-376a during HCMV infection.</p>
<p>Whether ADAR1-p110 is induced by a viral component or by cellular is still unknown. We have shown that the kinetics of ADAR1-p110 induction is very rapid, and that the anti-viral drug Ganciclovir can not block this induction. In an attempt to investigated whether one of the immediate early genes of HCMV are responsible for the ADAR1 induction we expressed the viral transcription activators IE72 and IE86 in HFF cells, but did not observe any change in the levels of ADAR1-p110 (data not shown). Thus, further work is required to reveal whether it is a cellular or a viral component that is required for the ADAR1-p110 induction.</p>
<p>We also show that HLA-E, which was not known previously to be regulated by miRNAs, is downregulated by miR-376a(e) and that this consequently leads to the elimination of the HCMV infected cells by NK cells.</p>
<p>The question of why HCMV “allows” the induction of ADAR1 is interesting; particularly in view of the data we provided which show that the ADAR1-p110 induction is HCMV specific. It is possible that HCMV itself is dependent on cellular components of RNA editing for successful gene expression and infection (as in the case of viral miRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Skalsky1">[45]</xref>) and thus can not evade the anti-viral response mediated by ADAR1-p110. Indeed it was shown that ADAR enzymes can edit transcripts of DNA viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Samuel1">[33]</xref>. It is also possible that the virus developed mechanisms, which are yet unknown, to temper with the ADAR1-p110 response. This might be in similarity to what has been recently shown regarding IFI16 sensing of HCMV and the counter mechanism of the virus mediated by pUL83 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Li1">[46]</xref>. Perhaps this balanced response enables the co-existence of the virus with its host.</p>
<p>As we have demonstrated that an UV-inactivated virus does not induce ADAR1-p110, it is tempting to speculate that a viral component controls ADAR1-p110 induction. Yet, it is also possible that upon live virus infection cellular-downstream elements trigger the induction of ADAR1-p110. Thus whether the induction of ADAR1-p110 is an anti-viral response or a viral-mediated tactic that the host turns to its advantage is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Previously we showed that upon HCMV infection the virus downregulates the activating ligand MICB by the viral miRNA miR-UL112 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Beziat1">[47]</xref>. We also demonstrated that miR-UL112 acts synergistically with the cellular miR-376a (that also regulates MICB), and that this leads to reduce killing of the infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Nachmani1">[19]</xref>. Here we show that editing of miR-376a renders the infected cells susceptible to NK cell cytotoxicity. We were able to distinguish between these two seemingly contradicting observations because we used two different viruses. In all current experiments we had to use the AD169 laboratory strain of HCMV as similarly to clinical strains it encodes a UL40 protein with a leader peptide capable of being presented in the groove of HLA-E (GenBank accession number FJ527563). In our previous work we used the TB40/E strain that has a mutation in UL40 (GenBank accession number EF999921) and is unable to be presented by HLA-E and thus is unable to induce HLA-E expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Magri1">[48]</xref>. Therefore, when TB40/E is used editing of miR-376a has no effect on HLA-E levels and we could nicely observe that the infected cells were less susceptible due to the viral and cellular miRNAs operating to reduce NK cell killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Nachmani1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>It is difficult to determine which strategy is superior to which, the viral down regulation of MICB or that of the host through increased editing and down regulation of HLA-E. During infection, both the virus and the host employ many mechanisms that affect the progress of infection. As HCMV is known to infect <italic>in vivo</italic> a wide rage of cells and furthermore as the virus has two modes of infection (latent and lytic) the question of who has the upper hand in this battle - the virus or the host, becomes very complicated. Thus, whether an infected cell will be killed or not depends not only on the specific cell in question but also on the mode and stage of infection as well as on the balance between the anti-viral and the viral strategies as shown here and in our previous publications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Nachmani1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Bjorkstrom1">[49]</xref>.</p>
<p>It was demonstrated here and previously that HCMV<sup>pos</sup> individuals have increased proportion of NKG2C<sup>+</sup> NK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Guma1">[16]</xref>. HCMV infection is a prerequisite for the expansion of these NKG2C<sup>+</sup> NK cells as infection with other viruses, such as Hantaviruses, induces the expansion of the NKG2C<sup>+</sup> population only in HCMV<sup>pos</sup> individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Bjorkstrom1">[49]</xref>. Although the expansion of the NKG2C<sup>+</sup> NK cells is well established the role and functional significance of the NKG2C<sup>+</sup> NK cells is still unclear and actually it is thought that it is only few NKG2C<sup>+</sup> NK clones that expand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Bjorkstrom1">[49]</xref>. Importantly, it was demonstrated that inhibition by NKG2A is dominant over the NKG2C activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Beziat1">[47]</xref>. Our current results are in line with these observations as we show that although the proportion of NKG2C<sup>+</sup> cells is higher in HCMV<sup>pos</sup> individuals, the outcome of neutralizing miR-376a(e) during infection (which leads to increased HLA-E levels) is inhibition of NK cell function irrespective of the donors' serotype.</p>
<p>The new mechanism of HLA-E regulation via miRNA editing discovered here is unique to humans. The mouse orthologous protein of HLA-E, Qa-1b, does not contain predicted binding sites for the mouse orthologue of miR-376a(e). Thus, to demonstrate the induction of ADAR1 and reduction in HLA-E expression following HCMV infection in physiological settings, we used a decidua organ culture model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Weisblum1">[44]</xref> and observed that during HCMV infection ADAR1-p110 expression is induced and that HLA-E expression is reduced. This unique system could be used in the future to study exciting questions regarding the relationships between the virus and its human host.</p>

The level of <sup>35</sup>S release was measured after 5 hours of incubation with effectors (at 37°<sub>c</sub>) by a β-counter TopCount (Packard). When blocking antibody was used, NK cells were preincubated with 0.5 ug/well of the blocking antibody on ice for 1 hour, and then the <sup>35</sup>S labeled target cells were added for 5-hour incubation.</p>

<title>Human decidual organ culture</title>
<p>Decidual tissues from women undergoing first-trimester elective pregnancy terminations were obtained by deep scraping to obtain maternal tissue from the basal plate and placental bed encompassing the decidua with interstitial trophoblastic invasion. The study was approved by the Hadassah Medical Center Institutional Review Board and was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki, good clinical practice guidelines, and the human experimentation guidelines of the Israeli Ministry of Health. All donors gave written informed consent. Preparation of organ culture was as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Skalsky1">[45]</xref>. For infection of decidual organ cultures, immediately after the sectioning the tissues were placed in 48-well plates (∼5 slices/well to maintain optimal viability) and were inoculated with the virus (40 PFU/well).</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence, image processing and quantification</title>
<p>The following antibodies were used: anti-hHLA-E (MEM-E02, diluted 1∶500, generously provided by V.H.), anti-hADAR1 (SigmaAldrich, prestige antibodies, HPA003890, diluted 1∶650), detected by Goat anti-mouse DyLight647 or Goat anti-Rabbit DyLight647 (Jackson). Images were obtained using a Leica SP50 confocal microscope, using a 40× (1.25 NA) Leica oil objective. ImageJ software was used for image processing and quantification. Single cell intensities were normalized to the average fluorescence intensity of all cells after reduction of background intensity.</p>

<title>Next generation small RNA sequencing data analysis</title>
<p>The Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform was used. All sequenced samples underwent initial pre-processing prior to differential expression analysis. Briefly, sequencing adapters were clipped and bases with quality lower than 30 were removed from both ends of each sequenced read. Reads shorter than 16 nucleotides after clipping and trimming were discarded. Remaining reads were mapped against the mature human miRNA reference sequences (downloaded from miRBase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Kozomara1">[51]</xref>, allowing up to 2 mismatches between read and reference using BWA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Li2">[52]</xref>. Reviewing the reads mapping to miR-376a (MIMAT0000729), a pileup of the supported alleles and their sequencing quality was produced using SAMtools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003963-Li2">[52]</xref>. The expected sequencing error rate was calculated per-position and a binomial cumulative distribution was implemented to differ significant modifications from sequencing errors.</p>
