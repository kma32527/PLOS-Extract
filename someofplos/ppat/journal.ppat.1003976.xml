<p>HIV infection and the associated chronic immune activation alter T cell homeostasis leading to CD4 T cell depletion and CD8 T cell expansion. The mechanisms behind these outcomes are not totally defined and only partially explained by the direct cytopathic effect of the virus. In this manuscript, we addressed the impact of lymphopenia and chronic exposure to IFN-α on T cell homeostasis. In a lymphopenic murine model, this interaction led to decreased CD4 counts and CD8 T cell expansion in association with an increase in the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) levels resulting in enhanced CD4 T cell responsiveness to IFN-α. Thus, in the setting of HIV infection, chronic stimulation of this pathway could be detrimental for CD4 T cell homeostasis.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>While the acute CD4 depletion observed in the initial phase of HIV infection is likely due to direct cytopathic effects of the virus, the mechanism/s underlying the steady decline of the CD4 T cell pool during the chronic phase of infection are unclear and are felt to be associated with “immune activation.” We hypothesized that the combination of two distinct forces: homeostatic (CD4 T cell depletion) and inflammatory (HIV-driven IFN-α), lead to a form of T cell activation that results in a decline in the CD4 T cell pool and an increase in the CD8 T cells. IL-7 and lymphopenia enhanced CD4 T cell responsiveness to IFN-α by modulating expression of the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 1, 2 and 3. In a murine model, CD4 T cell depletion and CD8 T cell expansion were observed in a lymphopenic host chronically treated with IFN-α. These findings suggest that a synergistic interaction between lymphopenia and IFN-α may play a role in the pathogenesis of HIV infection. The analysis of this pathway may contribute to the development of new strategies to reverse the dysregulation of the T cell pools seen in patients with HIV infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Homeostatic forces regulate the number and survival of T cell clones throughout life, allowing only a limited degree of non-antigen driven expansion for each individual cell in order to preserve the diversity of the T cell repertoire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Boyman1">[1]</xref>. This is achieved by a balance between signals that mediate survival and proliferation, which are regulated by homeostatic cytokines such as IL-7 and IL-15. Through homeostatic mechanisms, the size of the T cell pool remains relatively constant despite the expansion of T cell clones during antigen-specific responses. In an immune competent host, homeostatic proliferation is controlled by the limited availability of homeostatic cytokines. However, under lymphopenic conditions, a robust homeostatic proliferation occurs leading to polyclonal T cell expansion and accumulation of cells with a highly activated memory phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Boyman1">[1]</xref>. This is observed in certain human clinical conditions such as bone marrow transplants and HIV infection, where an increased availability of IL-7 is detected in the serum of the patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Hakim1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Douek1">[4]</xref>. During HIV infection, in addition to HIV-specific immune responses, there is a generalized immune activation that alters the homeostasis of the CD4 and CD8 T cell pools leading to CD4 T cell depletion and CD8 T cell expansion. The mechanisms behind these extreme outcomes are not totally understood. The direct cytopathic effects of HIV do not appear adequate to explain this dichotomy. HIV-induced CD4 T cell depletion triggers a homeostatic response that occurs in an inflammatory environment rich in Type-I IFNs and driven by HIV replication. Both lymphopenia and viral load contribute to the immune activation observed in the CD4 T cell pool. In contrast, the expansion and activation of the CD8 T cell pool is tightly correlated with levels of HIV replication and does not appear influenced by homeostatic forces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Catalfamo1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Kovacs1">[9]</xref>. The Type-I IFN activity associated with HIV infection is reflected by increased mRNA transcripts of genes such as OAS1, ISG15, IFNAR1 and STAT1 in both CD4 and CD8 T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Rotger1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Catalfamo3">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Type-I IFN signals through a receptor consisting of two subunits (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) complexed with JAK1 and TYK2. Activation of these tyrosine kinases leads to the phosphorylation of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 1, 2, 3 and 5 (STAT1, -2, -3 and -5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Gadina1">[13]</xref>. While Type-I IFNs are critical for antiviral immunity, in the setting of chronic HIV/SIV infection, chronic exposure has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of the infection, a distinguishing feature of pathogenic from non-pathogenic SIV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Rotger1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Jacquelin1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Bosinger1">[15]</xref>. To understand the mechanisms by which HIV infection alters the homeostasis of CD4 and CD8 T cell pools, we hypothesized that lymphopenia and the chronic exposure to IFN-α may both play a role in this dysregulation. In the present manuscript, we show that IL-7 <italic>in vitro</italic> or lymphopenia <italic>in vivo</italic> can upregulate the total levels of STAT1, -2 and -3, rendering CD4 T cells more sensitive to IFN-α. Levels of total STAT1 (t-STAT1) were associated with the degree of lymphopenia and IL-7 serum levels in HIV-infected patients. In a murine model, lymphopenia and chronic treatment with IFN-α led to diminished survival of CD4 T cells and an expansion of CD8 T cells, thus recapitulating the alterations of the homeostasis of these pools observed in patients with HIV infection. In addition, these data provide new evidence that IL-7 <italic>in vitro</italic> can enhance Type-I IFN responses by modulating the levels of the STATs. This effect could enhance T cell effector differentiation and be advantageous in host defense against pathogens. However, chronic stimulation of this pathway in the setting of lymphopenia and uncontrolled HIV viral replication could be detrimental for CD4 T cell homeostasis and may contribute to the aberrant immune activation and eventual CD4 T cell depletion observed in these patients. The analysis of these pathways can contribute to the development of new strategies to reverse the dysregulation in the T cell pools seen in patients with HIV infection.</p>

<title>Total levels of STAT1 are increased in T cells from HIV-infected individuals with high viral loads</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>in vivo</italic> CD4 T cell proliferation in patients with HIV infection is correlated with both CD4 T cell counts and HIV-RNA levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Hyrcza1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Catalfamo3">[12]</xref>. In addition, CD4 T cells from viremic HIV-infected patients showed an enhanced response to <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with IFN-α measured by phosphorylation of STAT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Catalfamo3">[12]</xref>. Because of the potential implication of chronic stimulation of this pathway in CD4 T cell homeostasis, we investigated the mechanisms involved in this process. We hypothesized that this enhanced response could be due to increases in the levels of proteins involved in Type-I IFN signaling pathway, such as IFNAR1 and STATs.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we first studied a longitudinal cohort of patients to determine the levels of t-STAT1 before and after combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) and suppressed viremia to &lt;50 copies/ml. Following therapy, CD4 T cell counts increased from 198 to 264 cells/µl (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003976-t001">Table 1</xref>). The analysis of the intracellular expression of t-STAT1 in naïve (CD45RA<sup>+</sup> CD27<sup>+</sup>) and memory (CD45RA<sup>−</sup> CD27<sup>+</sup>) CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets by flow cytometry showed that both naïve and memory CD4 T cells expressed high levels of t-STAT1 prior to therapy that were significantly reduced with treatment (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Similar results were observed in naïve CD8 T cells (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). Memory CD8 T cells expressed lower levels of t-STAT1 than naïve CD8 T cells and their expression was also further reduced by treatment (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). These results indicate that levels of t-STAT1 are upregulated during HIV infection. Additionally, the differential expression of t-STAT1 in CD4 and CD8 memory T cells suggests potential differences in their responses to Type-I IFNs.</p>

<title>IL-7 enhances IFN-α responsiveness by modulating expression levels of t-STATs in T cells</title>
<p>To define the mechanisms involved in modulating t-STAT1 levels during HIV infection, we examined the role of two cytokines associated with CD4 T cell lymphopenia (IL-7) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Napolitano1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Fry1">[17]</xref> and viral replication (IFN-α) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Rotger1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Jacquelin1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Bosinger1">[15]</xref>. PBMCs from healthy donors cultured with IL-7 for 3 days showed significant increases in t-STAT1 levels in naïve and memory CD4 T cells and naïve CD8 T cells when compared to cells cultured with media alone (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g002">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003976.s001">Fig. S1a</xref>, b). Consistent with the observations from the longitudinal cohort of patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), the smallest increases were seen in memory CD8 T cells (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>).</p>

<p>PBMCs from healthy donors (n = 12) were cultured 3 days in media alone (black symbols), rhIL-7 (10 ng/ml; blue symbols) or rhIFN-α (100 U/ml; red symbols). After 3 days of culture, the cells were harvested, washed and rested overnight. Rested cells were stimulated <italic>in vitro</italic> with rhIFN-α (100 U/ml) for 30 minutes and analyzed for intracellular expression of t-STAT1 (<bold>a</bold>) and phosphorylated STAT1 (<bold>b</bold>) in naïve and memory T cell subsets. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed for comparisons of the MFI of t-STAT1 and p-STAT1 between groups.</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003976.g002" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>We next tested the ability of cells cultured with IL-7 or IFN-α to respond to further <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with IFN-α. T cells cultured with IL-7 showed enhanced phosphorylation of STAT1 (p-STAT1) in response to <italic>in vitro</italic> IFN-α stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g002">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003976.s001">Fig. S1c</xref>). In contrast, cells cultured for 3 days with IFN-α were refractory to further <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with IFN-α and did not show phosphorylation of STAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g002">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003976.s001">Fig. S1c</xref>).</p>
<p>These results suggested interplay between IL-7 and Type-I IFN in T cells that is mediated by the levels of STAT1 induction and subsequent phosphorylation. We next examined the effect of these cytokines on other STATs known to be involved in Type-I IFN signaling pathway (STAT2, -3 and -5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Gadina1">[13]</xref>. Freshly isolated CD4 T cells from healthy volunteers cultured for 3 days with IL-7 showed 8.3-, 2.1- and 2.7-fold increases in t-STAT1, t-STAT2 and t-STAT3 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>). No changes were noted in total levels of STAT5. Cells cultured with IL-7 and then stimulated with IFN-α exhibited 3.7-, 2-, 2.5- and 2.5-fold increases in p-STAT1, -2, -3 and -5 respectively. No such effects of IL-7 were observed on total CD8 T cells likely due to the predominance of CD8 memory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>). These changes in CD4 T cells were mainly attributed to the modulation of t-STAT expression levels since IL-7 had no significant effect on the expression of IFNAR1 on T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003976.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). In contrast, cells initially cultured in the presence of Type-I IFN were generally refractory to further <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with IFN-α and phosphorylated only small amounts of STAT proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

<p>These results demonstrate that IL-7 can induce upregulation of multiple components of the Type-I IFN signaling pathway leading to an enhanced response to IFN-α. Thus, in the context of HIV infection, the increased availability of IL-7 associated with HIV-induced CD4 T cell lymphopenia, could render CD4 T cells more susceptible to the chronic effects of Type-I IFNs.</p>

<title>Higher levels of t-STAT1 in CD4 T cells are associated with lower CD4 T cell counts and higher IL-7 serum levels in HIV infected patients</title>
<p>We next evaluated the contributions of <italic>in vivo</italic> lymphopenia (CD4 T cell counts) and serum levels of IL-7 to t-STAT1 expression and activation (p-STAT1) in patients with chronic HIV infection. To limit the contributions of viremia, we studied a cohort of patients receiving cART who had HIV-RNA levels of &lt;50 copies/ml for more than 9 months (IQR 9–35 months, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1003976-t002">Table 2</xref>). Levels of t-STAT1 and detection of p-STAT1 after <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with IFN-α were analyzed by flow cytometry. CD4 T cells from patients with CD4 counts &lt;200 and between 200–500 cells/µl showed significantly higher levels of t-STAT1 expression when compared with those patients with CD4 counts &gt;500 cells/µl (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). The latter showed t-STAT1 expression levels similar to those observed in healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>). Although significant, less marked differences were observed in CD8 T cells as a function of CD4 counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>). In addition, an inverse correlation was noted between t-STAT1 levels in both CD4 and CD8 T cells and CD4 T cell counts (r = −0.52, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 and r = −0.34, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>).

<title>Lymphopenia and chronic exposure to Type-I IFN alter CD4 T cell homeostasis in a murine model</title>
<p>To experimentally examine the interaction between lymphopenia and Type-I IFN <italic>in vivo</italic> and its potential impact in CD4 and CD8 T cell homeostasis, we performed a series of experiments in which lymphocytes were adoptively transferred into lymphopenic mice that were receiving chronically-administered IFN-α.</p>
<p>Initially, we analyzed t-STAT1 and p-STAT1 expression in donor T cells transferred into lymphopenic or lymphoreplete mice. Lymph node (LN) cells from wild type C57BL/6 (B6 CD45.2 donor) mice were adoptively transferred into either congenic lymphoreplete B6.SJL (B6 CD45.1 host) or lymphopenic B6.SJL-[KO]RAG1 (RAG<sup>−/−</sup> host) mice. At day 7 after transfer, both CD4 and CD8 donor T cells proliferated under lymphopenic conditions, whereas they did not divide when transferred into lymphoreplete hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g005">Fig. 5a</xref>). Donor T cells transferred into lymphopenic RAG<sup>−/−</sup> mice showed significantly increased levels of t-STAT1, in LNs as well as in the spleen, when compared to cells transferred into lymphoreplete B6 hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g005">Fig. 5a, b</xref>). The lower upregulation of t-STAT1 in splenic cells was associated with an increased proportion of highly proliferating T cells with an effector memory and effector phenotype when compared to cells derived from the LNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003976.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). In the LNs, increased levels of t-STAT1 were associated with enhanced phosphorylation of STAT1 in response to <italic>in vitro</italic> IFN-α stimulation in CD4 donor T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g005">Fig. 5a, c</xref>). In contrast, lower levels of STAT1 phosphorylation were noted in splenic cells after <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with IFN-α when comparing cells that had been transferred into lymphopenic mice to those transferred into lymphoreplete hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g005">Fig. 5c</xref>).

These data suggest that a lymphopenic environment can induce upregulation of t-STAT1 expression, leading to enhanced p-STAT1 following IFN-α stimulation.</p>

<p>Since IL-7 <italic>in vitro</italic> was able to upregulate t-STAT1, we next analyzed its contribution in the setting of lymphopenia. We performed adoptive cell transfer experiments into RAG<sup>−/−</sup> and IL-7<sup>−/−</sup> x RAG<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Because IL-7 is critical for T cell survival, these experiments were analyzed 5 days after cell transfer. IL-7 deficiency in the RAG<sup>−/−</sup> background reduced IL-7 dependent lymphopenia-induced slow proliferation and survival of the transferred cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g006">Fig. 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003976.s006">Fig. S6a</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Tan1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Schluns1">[20]</xref>.

<p>To eliminate the rapid TCR driven proliferation in the RAG<sup>−/−</sup> background, we next assessed the role of IL-7 in sublethally irradiated hosts. In this model, the lymphopenia is not as severe as in RAG<sup>−/−</sup> mice and transferred cells compete with the host cells during reconstitution by undergoing slow homeostatic proliferation which is IL-7 dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Min1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Guimond1">[22]</xref>. 24 hours after sublethal irradiation, mice were treated with either anti-IL-7 and anti-IL7R or isotype control mAbs before cell transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Sudo1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Grabstein1">[24]</xref>. LNs and spleens were analyzed 5 days after transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g006">Fig. 6c</xref>). In this model, donor cells undergoing homeostatic proliferation upregulated the levels of t-STAT1 when compared to cells transferred into a lymphoreplete B6 host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g006">Fig. 6c, d</xref>). Treatment with anti-IL-7 and anti-IL7R mAbs blocked homeostatic proliferation. Because blockade of IL-7 signaling reduced survival of donor CD4 and especially CD8 T cells, in LNs and spleen, only CD4 donor T cells were analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003976.s006">Fig. S6b</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Tan1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Schluns1">[20]</xref>.

These results suggest that lymphopenia <italic>in vivo</italic> drives increased expression of t-STAT1 in CD4 T cells that is partially dependent on IL-7.</p>
<p>We next analyzed the impact of chronic exposure to IFN-α on T cell homeostasis. Lymphopenic RAG<sup>−/−</sup> mice received LN cells from congenic B6 CD45.2 mice. Administration of recombinant murine (rm) IFN-α was started on day 5 after transfer. Mice were treated with therapeutic doses of 10,000 U of rmIFN-α, daily (∼4×10<sup>5</sup> U/kg/day), for one month <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Gil1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Essers1">[27]</xref>.

<p>Analysis of the CellTrace Violet profiles of CD4 and CD8 donor T cells showed extensive proliferation in LNs and spleens for both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g007">Fig. 7a</xref>). We found no differences between the proliferation profiles of CD4 donor T cells from treated and non-treated animals. However, an increased proliferation of CD8 donor T cells was observed in both LNs and spleen of IFN-α treated mice, suggesting differences in the response to Type-I IFN by these two pools. Similar proportions of the naïve, central memory, effector memory and effector phenotype of CD4 donor T cells were observed in both LNs and spleen of the control and rmIFN-α treated animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1003976.s007">Fig. S7a</xref>, b).

<p>While the absolute numbers of CD4 and CD8 donor T cells recovered from LNs did not differ substantially between IFN-α treated and control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1003976-g007">Fig. 7b</xref>), significant decreases in CD4 donor T cell numbers were noted in the spleens of the rmIFN-α treated mice.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Patients with HIV infection show a unique form of immune activation leading to CD4 T cell depletion and CD8 T cell expansion. The CD4 T cell depletion observed in these patients is only partially explained by a direct cytopathic effect of the virus. The small number of actively infected cells at any given point suggests that other mechanisms may play a role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Douek3">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Lane1">[29]</xref>. The mechanisms behind these extreme outcomes for both CD4 and CD8 T cells pools remain unresolved. Because CD4 T cells are under continuous homeostatic pressure, we hypothesized that these outcomes could be associated with differences in homeostatic regulation of these two pools and in their response to the combination of cytokines associated with lymphopenia and viral replication. In the present manuscript, we have shown that chronic exposure to Type-I IFN under lymphopenic conditions can lead to impaired CD4 T cell homeostasis resulting in diminished CD4 T cell counts in association with CD8 T cell expansion. This phenotype recapitulates the alterations of the CD4 and CD8 T cell pools seen in patients with HIV infection. Our data support a model in which CD4 T cells under lymphopenic conditions become more responsive to IFN-α by modulating the levels of STATs. This continuous stimulation of CD4 T cells may lead to activation induced cell death (AICD) and decreased survival. In contrast, the same set of stimuli lead to CD8 T cell expansion.</p>
<p>The different outcomes observed in the CD4 and CD8 T cell pools in the setting of untreated HIV infection are associated with distinct mechanisms that regulate the homeostasis of these pools. For instance, in healthy controls and HIV infected patients, CD4 T cell homeostatic proliferation is tightly associated with CD4 T cell counts. This association is weak in CD8 T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Catalfamo3">[12]</xref>. The overall size of the CD4 T cell pool is highly controlled and does not undergo large expansions following antigenic exposure <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast, such expansions are common in the CD8 T cell pool.</p>
<p>Lymphopenia-induced proliferation is a mechanism triggered to maintain the CD4 T cell pool at a relatively constant size. IL-7 is a central homeostatic cytokine in this process that promotes T cell survival. Cells undergoing slow (IL-7 dependent) or fast (IL-7 independent) proliferation acquire new properties such as, memory phenotype and secretion of cytokines like IL-2 and IFN-γ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Min1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Cho1">[30]</xref>. These effects are also observed in humans T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Geginat1">[31]</xref> and in patients after bone marrow transplant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Fry2">[32]</xref>. Therefore, lymphopenia and increased availability of IL-7 generates a complex environment. In patients with HIV infection, the relatively weak association observed between IL-7 and levels of t-STAT1 suggests that lymphopenia in combination with other factors potentially driven by ongoing viral replication may play a role.</p>
<p>Several reports have shown that IL-7 upregulates expression of CD95 in T cells and IL-7 serum levels correlate with CD95 expression and increased susceptibility to CD95-induced apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Fluur1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Sammicheli1">[35]</xref>. Our data extend these observations by demonstrating that IL-7 <italic>in vitro</italic> can also modulate the levels of STATs in T cells and thus modulate their responses to Type-I IFNs. This is an unexpected characteristic of IL-7 and suggests that this pathway may be advantageous in host defense against pathogens. Accordingly, recent reports in an animal model of acute influenza A virus suggested a role for IL-7 in adaptive immunity against viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Plumb1">[36]</xref>. Similarly, administration of IL-7 in chronic LCMV infection model overcame infection and limited organ damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Pellegrini1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>In contrast, in a scenario in which the host is chronically lymphopenic, such as HIV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Napolitano1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Fry1">[17]</xref>, in association with an environment rich in Type-I IFNs maintained by viral replication, this interaction may lead to more immune activation and dysregulation of the homeostasis of the CD4 T cell pool. By modifying this relationship, such as by the administration of super physiological doses of IL-2 or IL-7 to patients with HIV infection receiving cART, one can see increased T cell counts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Levy1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Kovacs2">[40]</xref>. Thus increasing the levels of homeostatic cytokine and reducing the inflammatory environment by cART may lead to improvement in T cell counts.</p>
<p>Type-I IFNs are important cytokines with anti-viral and regulatory functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-GarciaSastre1">[41]</xref>. They can inhibit thymopoiesis and B cell development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Wang1">[42]</xref> and can induce proliferation and exhaustion of hematopoietic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Sato1">[43]</xref>. The potential detrimental effects of chronic exposure to Type-I IFN in HIV/SIV pathogenesis have been largely reported. For example, Type-I IFN can induce CD4 T cell-TRAIL/DR5-mediated apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Herbeuval1">[44]</xref>. Chronic exposure to Type-I IFN may have detrimental consequences on T cell homeostasis and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Essers1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Herbeuval1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Hardy1">[48]</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic>, HIV and SIV infection trigger a strong Type-I IFN response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Rotger1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Jacquelin1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Bosinger1">[15]</xref>. Paradoxically, the administration of super physiological doses of Type-I IFN have been shown to have both anti-tumor effects in the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma and anti-viral effects leading to reduction in HIV-RNA levels in patients with high CD4 T cell counts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Lane2">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Tavel1">[50]</xref>. These effects were associated with decreases in both CD4 and CD8 T cells.</p>
<p>Because of the potential detrimental effects of chronic Type-I IFN signaling in patients with HIV infection, blockade of this pathway has been explored as a potential therapeutic target. A recent report using an antagonist of TLR7/9 that blocks IFN-α production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in SIV infected rhesus macaques had shown that pDCs are not the only source of IFN-α production in this infection model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Kader1">[51]</xref>. In addition, blockade of IFN-α production by pDCs did not prevent activation of T cells nor was it effective at reducing viral loads and had minimal effect on IFN-stimulated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Kader1">[51]</xref>. The anti-viral properties of IFN-α are best established and successfully used in the treatment of infectious diseases and cancer in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Lane2">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Tavel1">[50]</xref>. In this regard, it is not surprising that therapies blocking IFN-α signaling may compromise immunity against HIV and other pathogens.</p>
<p>In contrast to the anti-viral effects of Type-I IFNs, the immune modulatory properties of these cytokines are broad and less understood. For example, while IFN-β is used to treat the inflammatory autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis, its mechanism of action in this setting is poorly understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Axtell1">[52]</xref>. The present model will help to dissect some of these properties of IFN-α signaling pathway in the setting of lymphopenia and may allow for identifying more direct targets of these immune modulatory functions.</p>
<p>IL-7 <italic>in vitro</italic> and lymphopenia <italic>in vivo</italic> differentially regulated expression of t-STATs in CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as their responses to Type-I IFN. Memory CD8 T cells from healthy controls and HIV-infected patients expressed lower levels of t-STAT1 than naïve CD8 T cells, suggesting differences in their responsiveness to Type-I IFN <italic>in vivo</italic> as a function of T cell phenotype and state of activation. Previous reports have suggested that differences in the expression levels and activation of STATs in human PBMCs may explain differences in the induction of apoptosis after exposure to Type-I IFNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-vanBoxelDezaire1">[53]</xref>. In animal models of viral infection, it has been reported that T cell responsiveness to cytokines is controlled by their relative expression of the STAT transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Levy2">[54]</xref>. For instance, regulation of expression levels of t-STAT1 in CD8 T cells has been described as a mechanism by which CD8 T cells can escape the anti-proliferative effects of Type-I IFNs during LCMV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Lecuroux1">[55]</xref> and basal and temporal changes in the expression levels of several STATs have been demonstrated as significant in shaping the immune responses in the LCMV model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1003976-Kallal1">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>Altogether these findings suggest that during HIV infection, the interplay of lymphopenia and inflammation (Type-I IFN) may lead to alterations in the ways that CD4 and CD8 T cells respond to stimulation with Type-I IFNs. Further dissection of the relative roles of these forces during HIV infection may provide us with better approaches to correct the immunologic abnormalities seen in HIV infected patients.</p>
