<abstract>
<p><italic>Metarhizium robertsii</italic> is a plant root colonizing fungus that is also an insect pathogen. Its entomopathogenicity is a characteristic that was acquired during evolution from a plant endophyte ancestor. This transition provides a novel perspective on how new functional mechanisms important for host switching and virulence have evolved. From a random T-DNA insertion library, we obtained a pathogenicity defective mutant that resulted from the disruption of a sterol carrier gene (<italic>Mr-npc2a</italic>). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that <italic>Metarhizium</italic> acquired <italic>Mr-npc2a</italic> from an insect by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Mr-NPC2a binds to cholesterol, an animal sterol, rather than the fungal sterol ergosterol, indicating it retains the specificity of insect NPC2 proteins. Mr-NPC2a is an intracellular protein and is exclusively expressed in the hemolymph of living insects. The disruption of <italic>Mr-npc2a</italic> reduced the amount of sterol in cell membranes of the yeast-like hyphal bodies that facilitate dispersal in the host body. These were consequently more susceptible to insect immune responses than the wild type. Transgenic expression of Mr-NPC2a increased the virulence of <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic>, an endophytic insect-pathogenic fungus that lacks a Mr-NPC2a homolog.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The ability of infectious agents to evolve different host ranges contributes to the emergence of new diseases, and this host switching could also account for the wide variety of fungal associations with animals, plants and other fungi. There must be mechanisms for such host shifts, but these remain largely unknown. In this study, we phylogenetically predict that the endophytic fungus <italic>Metarhizium robertsii</italic> acquired a sterol carrier gene from insects through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This sterol carrier is involved in maintaining cell membrane sterols, and thus membrane integrity, when <italic>M. robertsii</italic> proliferates in the haemocoel of living insects. Therefore, the acquisition of genetic material from a host has contributed to the development of fungal entomopathogenicity. In order to simulate this evolutionary event, the sterol carrier gene was transformed into an endophytic insect-pathogenic fungus (<italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic>) that lacks an endogenous Mr-NPC2a homolog. The virulence of <italic>B. bassiana</italic> was increased by expression of Mr-NPC2a.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>New infectious diseases are constantly appearing, and their origins are diverse. Human behavior and practices are important factors, for example, catastrophic declines in amphibian and bat populations have been attributed to pathogenic fungi spread by humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Voyles1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Lorch1">[2]</xref>. Another important origin is the ability of infectious agents themselves to evolve different host ranges, which would certainly contribute to the impact of invasive species. Such host switching probably accounts for the wide variety of fungal associations with animals, plants and other fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Suh1">[3]</xref>. There must be mechanisms for such host shifts, although these remain largely unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Ricklefs1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Archie1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Raffaele1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between distantly related bacteria contributes significantly to the emergence of new pathogens but HGT is usually thought to play a minor role in eukaryotes. However, data from multiple genomic sequences suggests that HGT has also occurred between eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Gilbert1">[7]</xref>, and may bestow a clear selective advantage to fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Slot1">[8]</xref>. A gene encoding a critical virulence factor was transferred from one species of fungal pathogen to another, leading to the emergence of a new damaging disease of wheat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Friesen1">[9]</xref>. HGT from bacteria to fungi is relatively common <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Richards1">[10]</xref>, and a few examples are known where HGT has occurred between plants and either pathogenic fungi or parasitic plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Sun1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Mower1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Davis1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Keeling1">[14]</xref>. Microsporidian intracellular parasites <italic>Enephalitozoon</italic> may have acquired a purine nucleotide phosphorylase from an arthropod that is not a host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Selman1">[15]</xref>. There is also a longstanding controversy as to whether the malaria causing pathogen <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> has horizontally acquired human genetic material that might facilitate its long stay in the body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Bar1">[16]</xref>. Otherwise, HGT between eukaryotic pathogens and animal hosts has been neither predicted nor characterized.</p>
<p>Fungi are the commonest pathogens of insects and crucial regulators of insect populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Roberts1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Fang1">[18]</xref>. <italic>Metarhizium robertsii</italic> (formerly known as <italic>Metarhizium anisopliae</italic>) is the best studied entomopathogenic fungus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Fang2">[19]</xref> as well as being an important plant-growth-promoting endophyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Behie1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Fang3">[21]</xref>. Phylogenomic analysis suggests that the ancestor of <italic>Metarhizium</italic> was an endophyte, with entomopathogenicity being an acquired characteristic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Xiao1">[22]</xref>. The evolutionary transition of a fungus from an endophyte to an insect pathogen provides a novel perspective on how new functional mechanisms important for host switching and virulence are acquired. In this study, we identified a new virulence factor (Mr-NPC2a) of <italic>M. robertsii</italic> by screening an <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>-mediated T-DNA insertion library. We provide evidence that <italic>Mr-npc2a</italic> was horizontally acquired from an insect and allowed <italic>Metarhizium</italic> to compete with insect hosts for the sterols necessary to maintain cell membrane integrity.</p>

<title>Characterization of the sterol carrier gene <italic>Mr-npc2a</italic> as a pathogenicity mutant</title>
<p>Using <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>-mediated fungal transformation, we generated a set of 20, 328 T-DNA-tagged <italic>M. robertsii</italic> strain ARSEF2575 mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Fang4">[23]</xref> which we screened for virulence mutants against wax worm larvae (<italic>Galleria mellonella</italic>) (Pet Solutions, OH USA). A transformant (M298) that showed a significantly slower killing speed than the wild type strain was selected for further study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004009-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The open reading frame (ORF) of the gene MAA_03817 (Genbank accession no.: EFZ01221) was found to be disrupted in this mutant. MAA_03817 showed significant similarity to insect Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) proteins, and thus was designated as Mr-NPC2a. We deleted the ORF of <italic>Mr-npc2a</italic> in wild type <italic>M. robertsii</italic>, and the resulting disruptant (<italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic>) showed the same loss of virulence as M298 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004009-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The details of the T-DNA insertion and gene deletion alleles are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004009.s001">Fig. S1</xref>. <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic> was complemented by a genomic clone of <italic>Mr-npc2a</italic>.

<p>The phenotype of <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic> on PDA (potato dextrose agar) plates was indistinguishable from the wild type strain, M298 and the complemented <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic>. Formation of infection structures (appressoria) by <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic> on the hindwings of <italic>Locusta migratoria manilensis</italic> (kindly provided by Dr. Wangpeng Shi at China Agricultural University) was not significantly different from the wild type strain, M298 and the complemented <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic>. The hyphal bodies [unicellular hyphal bodies (blastospores) and multicellular hyphal bodies] of <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic>, M298, the wild type strain and the complemented <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic> all began to appear in the hemolymph 36-hours after topical infection of <italic>G. mellonella</italic>, but the number of <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic> hyphal bodies (20±6.8 hyphal bodies/mL) and M298 (22±3.2 hyphal bodies/mL) was significantly less than the wild type (36 hyphal bodies ±9.3/mL) and the complemented <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic> (38 hyphal bodies ±9.5/mL). From 36 to 60 h post-inoculation, wild type hyphal bodies and the complemented <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic> hyphal bodies significantly outnumbered <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic> and M298 in the hemolymph. The number of the complemented <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic> hyphal bodies was not significantly different from the wild type strain at all time points (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05). Likewise, the number of M298 hyphal bodies was not significantly different from <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic> at all time points (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004009.s005">Table S1</xref>). This set of data suggests that disruption of <italic>Mr-npc2a</italic> only impairs pathogenesis after <italic>M. robertsii</italic> enters the haemocoel.</p>
<p>All <italic>Galleria</italic> infected with the wild type strain or the complemented <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic> died as larvae, whereas nearly 40% of insects infected by <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic> or M298 survived. Similar numbers of conidia were produced on the cadavers of insects killed by the wild type strain, by the complemented <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic>, by <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic> and by M298 (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05), so in terms of fecundity Mr-NPC2a enhanced fitness by 40%. Based on above data, M298 and <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic> are functionally indistinguishable, so only <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic> was used for following studies.</p>

<title><italic>Metarhizium</italic> acquired the sterol carrier Mr-NPC2a from insect hosts by horizontal gene transfer</title>
<p>Genome analysis showed that there are 3 NPC2-like proteins in <italic>M. robertsii</italic>: MAA_03817 (Mr-NPC2a), MAA_10401 (Mr-NPC2b, Genbank accession no.: EFY94139) and MAA_03340 (Mr-NPC2c, Genbank accession no.: EFZ00744). All three <italic>Metarhizium</italic> NPC2-like proteins have conserved putative cholesterol/lipid binding sites, and six cysteine residues that form a hydrophobic core for sterol binding typical of Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) sterol carriers. Mr-NPC2b shows 70% similarity to Mr-NPC2c (6e<sup>−53</sup>), but except for the aforementioned cholesterol/lipid binding sites and hydrophobic core, they show no significant similarity to Mr-NPC2a. We screened for homologs of Mr-NPC2a, Mr-NPC2b and Mr-NPC2c proteins using a protein based local alignment search tool (BLASTP, e-value cutoff 1e<sup>−05</sup>) against databases provided by NCBI (Genbank), JGI (Joint Genome Institute) and Broad Institute. No Mr-NPC2a homologs were identified when Mr-NPC2b or Mr-NPC2c were used as the query sequences; likewise no Mr-NPC2b and Mr-NPC2c homologs were identified when Mr-NPC2a was used as the query. Thus, BLASTP clearly differentiates between the evolutionary relationships of Mr-NPC2a and the related Mr-NPC2b and Mr-NPC2c. Homologs of Mr-NPC2b and Mr-NPC2c are widespread in the fungal kingdom being found in Ascomycota, Basidomycota, Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota. A phylogenetic analysis conducted with Mr-NPC2b, Mr-NPC2c and 30 other NPC2s showed that their phylogenetic relationship is consistent with previously established species phylogenies, demonstrating vertical inheritance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004009.s003">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>
<p>Mr-NPC2a homologs were identified in only two fungi (BLASTP, e-value cutoff 1e<sup>−05</sup>)–the ergot fungus <italic>Claviceps purpurea</italic> and <italic>Metarhizium acridum</italic>. All other Mr-NPC2a homologs were from insects and other animals including vertebrates. No homologs were found in plant, bacteria, archaea and viruses. A TBLASTn search against NCBI genomes (e-value cutoff 1e<sup>−05</sup>) only identified the same homologs as BLASTP. The origin of NPC2a was assessed using a variety of models and methods for phylogenetic reconstruction. The phylogenies consistently showed that <italic>Metarhizium</italic> and <italic>C. purpurea</italic> sequences exclusively clustered with insect sequences with high support (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004009-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004009.s006">Table S2</xref>). We then compared the topology of the obtained tree with those of alternative trees using eight tests including SH-test and AU-test provided by the program CONSEL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Shimodaira1">[24]</xref>. The cluster of fungal NPC2as with vertebrate NPC2s was not statistically rejected, but these constrained trees were significantly less supported than the obtained tree. Furthermore, vertebrates lack close contact with <italic>Metarhizium</italic> and <italic>C. purpurea</italic>, whereas insects regularly encounter both fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Roberts1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Butler1">[25]</xref>. Since sympatry is almost a prerequisite for HGT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Danchin1">[26]</xref>, the fungi are much more likely to have acquired NPC2a from insects than vertebrates. Details about the tree topology comparisons are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004009.s007">Table S3</xref>.</p>

<p>Although it is the most likely that <italic>Metarhizium</italic> and <italic>C. purpurea</italic> acquired NPC2a from insects, the fungal NPC2as show low overall similarity to insect sequences (the lowest E value was 6e<sup>−15</sup>). However, NPC2 paralogs are remarkably divergent even in the same insect species, consistent with rapid diversification. For example, the fruitfly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has 8 NPC2 proteins designated as NPC2a-NPC2h (Genbank accession numbers are NP_608637, NP_650331, NP_649976, NP_649975, NP_731439, NP_651219, NP_651823 and NP_651824, respectively), and the similarity of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> NPC2a to other NPC2 proteins ranges from 3e<sup>−16</sup> (NPC2b, 50% similarity) to as low as 3e<sup>−03</sup> (NPC2g, 37% similarity). It is likely therefore that the insect ancestor of Mr-NPC2a could also have had low similarity to currently known insect NPC2 proteins.</p>
<p>We then looked at the genomic context of the <italic>npc2a</italic> genes in <italic>Metarhizium</italic> and <italic>C. purpurea</italic> to investigate how these fungi may have acquired <italic>npc2a</italic> gene from insects. The microsyntenies are almost the same in ∼40 kb <italic>M. robertsii</italic> and <italic>M. acridum</italic> DNA fragments containing the <italic>npc2a</italic> genes, indicating that the <italic>npc2a</italic> gene was acquired before the diversification of <italic>M. robertsii</italic> and <italic>M. acridum</italic> ∼33–43 MYA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Xiao1">[22]</xref>, and no significant genomic rearrangements have happened since. However, little microsynteny is retained between <italic>Metarhizium</italic> and other fungi including <italic>C. purpurea</italic>; only one <italic>M. robertsii</italic> gene (MAA_03818, Genbank accession no.: EFZ01222) adjacent to <italic>Mr-npc2a</italic> (MAA_03817) has a homolog (CPUR_07480, Genbank accession no.: CCE3355) adjacent to the <italic>C. purpurea npc2a</italic> gene (CPUR_07479, Genbank accession no.: CCE33554). CPUR_07480 and MAA_03818 have homologs in other fungi but not insects, showing that this gene is vertically inherited. CPUR_07480 and MAA_03818 have LITAF-like zinc ribbon domain, but their functions have not been characterized. Conversely, the microsynteny of the sequence around the <italic>C. purpurea npc2a</italic> gene (CPUR_07479) and CPUR_07480 is conserved among many fungi including <italic>Metarhizium</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004009-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The virulence of most fungal pathogens of plants and animals is a quantitative attribute, and thus many different genes and strategies are used simultaneously to cause disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Horbach1">[33]</xref>. Through evolution, fungi have acquired new virulence mechanisms, and increases in pathogen virulence have likely therefore evolved in a stepwise manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Gardiner1">[34]</xref>. The important role of HGT in the evolution of fungal virulence is being illuminated by comparative genomics, but in only a few cases has the importance of the transferred genes been functionally demonstrated with gene knockouts, and no reports describe functional characterization of genes transferred from an animal to a eukaryotic pathogen. Lack of functional characterization is a major bottleneck in understanding the contribution of HGT to pathogen virulence. In this study, we describe how the insect pathogenic fungus <italic>Metarhizium</italic> may have acquired a sterol carrier gene <italic>Mr-npc2a</italic> from its insect hosts by HGT. This sterol carrier is involved in maintaining cell membrane sterols and thus membrane integrity of hyphal bodies in insect hemolymph. It thus helps <italic>Metarhizium</italic> adapt to the hemolymph and facilitates colonization of the host. A feature of <italic>Mr-npc2a</italic> is its specificity for the hemolymph of living insects. The promoter will thus be useful for driving expression of insecticidal proteins, and for manipulating gene expression in hemolymph, via antisense or overexpression constructs, to test whether candidate proteins play critical roles.</p>
<p>Ergosterol is an important constituent of fungal membrane lipids, similar to animal cholesterol, and modulates the fluidity, permeability and thickness of the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Zhang1">[35]</xref>. Under aerobic conditions, fungi synthesize ergosterol <italic>de novo</italic> and this process is oxygen dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Dupont1">[36]</xref>. Under anaerobic conditions, ergosterol biosynthesis is suppressed and fungi need to take up sterols from the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Andreasen1">[37]</xref>. <italic>Metarhizium</italic> infects insects by direct penetration of the cuticle and entry into the haemocoel where the fungus kills insects with a combination of toxins and invasive growth by hyphal bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Fang1">[18]</xref>. However, the insect haemocoel is a hypoxic or even oxygen free environment, necessitating <italic>M. robertsii</italic> takes up sterols for the rapid proliferation of hyphal bodies. The insect hemolymph is the only environment where the fungal hyphal bodies can acquire sterols, and cholesterol is most likely to be exploited because it is the dominant insect sterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Jing1">[38]</xref>. The bulk membrane function of the fungal ergosterol can be provided by structurally related sterols, including cholesterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Jacquier1">[39]</xref>. Fungi can convert cholesterol into ergosterol or incorporate cholesterol directly into plasma membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Berger1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Xiong1">[40]</xref>.</p>
<p>Cholesterol is insoluble and insects use low density lipoproteins (LDL) to transport cholesterol through hemolymph to target tissues where they bind to LDL receptors. <italic>Metarhizium</italic> has a variety of genes with predicted functions that mimic those in insects including an LDL receptor (MAA_08841, Genbank accession no.: EFY95697) and close homologs of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ATP-binding cassette transporters AUS1 [<italic>M. robertsii's</italic> MAA_10338 (Genbank accession no.: EFY94212) and <italic>M. acridum's</italic> MAC_09600 (Genbank accession no.: EFY94889)] and PDR11 [<italic>M. robertsii's</italic> MAA_01883 (Genbank accession no.: EFY02301) and <italic>M. acridum's</italic> MAC_07971(Genbank accession no.: EFY96474)], required for cholesterol uptake in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Alimardani1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>The mechanisms of intracellular cholesterol transport are largely unknown, however, in mammals, cholesterol is exported to organelles by an NPC team that comprises an NPC1 (a lysosomal membrane protein) and NPC2 (a soluble protein in the lysosomal lumen). These mechanisms seem to be conserved in yeast and other fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Berger1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Berger2">[42]</xref>. <italic>M. robertsii</italic> has 1 NPC1-like protein (MAA_02001, Genbank accession no.: EFZ02419) as well as the 3 NPC2 proteins described in this study. Mr-NPC2b and Mr-NPC2c are typical fungal NPC2-like proteins, and their homolog in yeast (yNPC2p) is involved in ergosterol homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Berger1">[28]</xref>. The insect-like Mr-NPC2a is specifically expressed in insect hemolymph and is involved in maintaining cell membrane integrity only after the fungus enters the haemocoel. Although the disruption of <italic>Mr-npc2a</italic> greatly reduced the number of hyphal bodies in the hemolymph of living insects, i.e. suppressed growth, <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic> was still able to kill insects, suggesting that unidentified components can partially substitute for Mr-NPC2a when <italic>M. robertsii</italic> is in the hemolymph. The competition for cholesterol from <italic>Metarhizium</italic> might reduce the amount of sterols available to insects, which could alter the development of insects because insects cannot synthesize sterols and thus have dietary requirement for sterols. However, we did not see significant differences in development (pupation) between <italic>G. mellonella</italic> larva infected by <italic>ΔMr-npc2a</italic> and the wild type strain.</p>
<p>The existence of insect NPC2a homologs both in <italic>Metarhizium</italic> and the ergot fungus <italic>C. purpurea</italic> raises the question: when and how did these fungi acquire NPC2a from insects? There are four possible explanations. First, ancestral fungi had NPC2a proteins that were homologs of insect NPC2 proteins, but during evolution they were only retained by <italic>Metarhizium</italic> spp. and <italic>C. purpurea</italic>. This is unlikely as it would require independent loss of <italic>npc2a</italic> genes in all other fungal lineages. Secondly, <italic>Metarhizium</italic> and <italic>C. purpurea</italic> belong to the family Clavicipitaceae, and it is possible HGT occurred into the common ancestor of <italic>Metarhizium</italic> and <italic>C. purpurea</italic>. But microsynteny of sequence around <italic>C. purpurea npc2a</italic> is conserved with many fungi including <italic>Metarhizium</italic>. spp, whereas the microsynteny of the sequence around <italic>Metarhizium npc2a</italic> (<italic>Mr-npc2a</italic>) showed no conservation with other fungi including <italic>C. purpurea</italic>. So, if the ancestor of <italic>Metarhizium</italic> and <italic>C. purpurea</italic> acquired <italic>npc2a</italic> gene from an insect, this <italic>npc2a</italic> gene had moved from its ancient position to its current area during speciation of <italic>Metarhizium. spp</italic>. There is no evidence for <italic>Metarhizium npc2a</italic> (<italic>Mr-npc2a</italic>) having ever been within a transposon so genome rearrangement rather than transposition would be required for this move. Around <italic>Mr-npc2a</italic> (MAA_03817), only the gene MAA_03815 (Genbank accession no.: EFZ01219) is possibly involved in sterol metabolism which encodes C-4 methylsterol oxidase-like protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004009.s009">Table S5</xref>), but <italic>M. acridum</italic>'s C-4 methylsterol oxidase-like gene (MAC_09281, Genbank accession no.: EFY84691) does not cluster with its <italic>npc2a</italic> gene (MAC_00943 Genbank accession no.: EFY93160). Therefore, no obvious evolutionary force is seen that selected the genome rearrangement in <italic>Metarhizium</italic> genus. Thirdly, ancestors of <italic>C. purpurea</italic> and <italic>Metarhizium</italic> spp. may have independently acquired <italic>npc2a</italic> gene from ancestral insects. It is conceptually easy to understand an insect pathogenic fungus acquiring a gene from its host by HGT. In nature, <italic>C. purpurea</italic> also has physical contact with insects, as it produces ergot honeydew that attracts insects and these spread its conidia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Butler1">[25]</xref>. However, the gene adjacent to <italic>M. robertsii npc2a</italic> (<italic>Mr-npc2a</italic>) and that to <italic>C. purpurea npc2a</italic> are homologs with related genes in other fungi but not in insects. It is improbable that insect <italic>npc2a</italic> genes independently inserted beside the same gene in <italic>M. robertsii</italic> and <italic>C. purpurea</italic>. The final possibility is that an ancestor of <italic>C. purpurea</italic> or <italic>Metarhizium</italic> spp. acquired <italic>npc2a</italic> which was inserted beside the gene MAA_03818 in <italic>Metarhizium</italic> to become MAA_03817 (<italic>M. robertsii npc2a</italic>) or beside the gene CPUR_07480 in <italic>C. purpurea</italic> to become CPUR_07479 (<italic>C. purpurea npc2a</italic>). <italic>C. purpurea</italic> then obtained the two genes (the genes MAA_03818 and MAA_03817) from <italic>Metarhizium</italic> or vice versa. Ecological niche overlap allows HGT of gene clusters between fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Slot1">[8]</xref>, making this the most likely possibility. The genetic distances between the generalist <italic>M. robertsii</italic> (can kill many kinds of insects) and the specialist <italic>M. acridum</italic> (specific for grasshoppers) is greater than that between most other species in the <italic>Metarhizium</italic> genus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Bischoff1">[43]</xref>. Since the ancestor of <italic>Metarhizium</italic> may have acquired <italic>npc2a</italic> gene from an insect before speciation and both genetically distant <italic>M. robertsii</italic> and <italic>M. acridum</italic> retain this gene, it is expected that most of other <italic>Metarhizium</italic> species still have this gene. Therefore, based on currently available information, more <italic>Metarhizium</italic> than <italic>Claviceps</italic> species have <italic>npc2a</italic> genes, so it is more likely that <italic>C. purpurea</italic> was the recipient. However, more <italic>Claviceps</italic> genomes will be needed to confirm the direction of HGT.</p>

The Markov chain Monte Carlo searches were run for 1,000,000 generations, sampling the Markov chains every 1000 generations; the first 250 trees were discarded as ‘burn-in’. In addition, we also employed distance-based neighbor-joining (NJ) trees, which were constructed by using the program Neighbor in MEGA5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Tamura1">[53]</xref>.

<title>Sterol binding assay of Mr-NPC2a</title>
<p>The DNA fragment encoding Mr-NPC2a (signal peptide excluded) was cloned with RT-PCR using total RNA extracted from hyphal bodies collected from the hemolymph of living insects as described below. The sequences of the primers are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004009.s010">Table S6</xref>. PCR product was purified and cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for sequence verification. The DNA fragment was then subcloned into <italic>Eco</italic>RI/<italic>Not</italic>I restriction sites in the expression vector pET32a (EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) to form the pET32a-MrNPC2a plasmid that was then transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21 (DE3) (EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranosid (1 mM) was used to induce recombinant protein expression. Recombinant Mr-NPC2a was purified with HisTALON Superflow Cartridges (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), concentrated and dialyzed with Tris buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) at 4°C using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter unit (EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). Control protein was expressed and purified from BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with pET32a empty vector with the same methods described above.</p>
<p>The ligand-binding assay was performed as described with some modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Shi1">[27]</xref>. Since the <italic>D. melangaster</italic> NPC2a can bind to bacterial Lipid A and cholesterol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Shi1">[27]</xref>, both of them were used as ligands to compare binding specificity of Mr-NPC2a with that of the insect NPC2a. Ergosterol was also tested to look at the binding ability of Mr-NPC2a to the fungal sterol. Lipid A monophosphoryl from <italic>E. coli</italic> F583 (Rd mutant) and cholesterol were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (MO, USA), and ergosterol was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Texas, USA). Wells of flat-bottom 96-well plates (BD falcon, NJ, USA) were coated with 2 or 10 µg/well of each ligand. Control wells with no ligand were coated with the same amount of chloroform/water. The plates were then air dried overnight at room temperature, heated at 60°C for 30 min and then blocked with 200 µL/well of 1 mg/mL BSA in Tris buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) at 37°C for 2 h. Wells were washed with the Tris buffer (four times, each for 5 min) and 500 nM of purified Mr-NPC2a fusion protein or vector protein diluted in binding buffer (the Tris buffer with 0.1 mg/mL BSA) were added to each well of the coated plates (50 µL/well) and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. Plates were then washed and mouse monoclonal anti-polyHistidine antibody was added (100 µL/well) and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Plates were washed again and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Promega, 1∶2000 dilution in binding buffer) was added (100 µL/well) and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Alkaline phosphatase substrate liquid (Sigma Aldrich MO, USA) was then added to each wells and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Plates were shaken for 15 s and the absorbance at 405 nm of each well was determined using a plate reader (FilterMax F3, Molecular Devices, CA, USA). The absorbance from control wells was subtracted and specific binding was calculated by subtracting absorbance from vector protein from the total binding of NPC2 protein. Binding assays were repeated 3 times with 3 repeated wells.</p>

Blastospores were obtained by growing the fungus in nutrition rich medium SDB for 10 d and in the <italic>in vitro</italic> prepared hemolymph for 2 d. GFP fluorescence in blastospores and hyphae was examined directly under microscopy. Blastospores and hyphae were combined for RNA preparation.</p>
<p>The expression of <italic>Mr-npc2a</italic> during infection was examined in appressoria on insect cuticles (the hindwings of <italic>L. migratoria</italic> locusts) and hyphal bodies in the hemolymph of living insects. Appressoria were induced on locust hindwings as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Fang10">[55]</xref>.

<title>Investigating localization of Mr-NPC2a</title>
<p>To investigate the localization of Mr-NPC2a in <italic>M. robertsii</italic>, we constructed the fusion protein Mr-NPC2a: GFP. The coding sequence of Mr-NPC2a (stop codon was excluded) was cloned by PCR, and inserted into the <italic>Eco</italic>RV site of the plasmid pGFP described above, resulting in pMr-NPC2a:GFP. Since Mr-NPC2a is only expressed in hyphal bodies produced in the hemolymph of living insects, it is hard to determine the localization of this protein when its native promoter is used to drive the expression of NPC2a:GFP. Therefore, the expression of the fusion gene was driven by the constitutive promoter <italic>Pgpd</italic> from <italic>A. nidulans</italic> in pGFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-McCluskey1">[30]</xref>.

<p>Sytox Green nucleic acid staining is widely used to assess the integrity of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004009-Gerphagnon1">[32]</xref>. Sytox Green can only enter cells if their cell membrane integrity is compromised, in which case it stains nucleic acids, resulting in a green fluorescence emission (absorption and emission maxima at 502 and 523 nm, respectively). To prepare hyphal bodies for Sytox staining, 50 µL of conidial suspension (10<sup>7</sup> conidia/mL) was injected into a fifth instar larva of <italic>M. sexta</italic>. After 20 h incubation at 27°C, the insect was bled and the hemolymph was collected into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube that was then placed on ice. The hemolymph (100 µL) was then quickly mixed with 5 µL of sytox staining solution (10 µM) by pipetting up and down. The mixture was then immediately loaded on a glass slide and covered with a cover slip. This set was subsequently placed on wet paper towel in a small container and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Stained nuclei were observed under microscopy.</p>
