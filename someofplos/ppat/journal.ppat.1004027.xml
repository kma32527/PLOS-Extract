Furthermore, recognition of DENV by the AaSR-C/AaMCR axis regulates the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which exerts potent anti-DENV activity. Our results both demonstrate the existence of a viral recognition pathway that controls the flaviviral infection by inducing AMPs and offer insights into a previously unappreciated antiviral function of the complement-like system in arthropods.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Hosts are equipped with sophisticated machineries for detecting and eliminating invading viruses before they cause significant physiological damage. Unlike mammals which have both innate and adaptive immune systems, insects rely solely on the innate immune system to limit viral infection. Mosquitoes are natural vectors for many human pathogenic viruses, such as dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus. Despite lacking an immunoglobulin-based humoral response, mosquitoes arm themselves with a functional complement-like system to ward off invading pathogens. Herein, we show that a system composed of complement-related factors recognizes and limits flaviviruses by inducing antimicrobial peptides expression. Understanding antiviral mechanisms in arthropods may provide novel strategies for limiting arboviral transmission in nature.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Animals have evolved multiple immune systems to eradicate pathogenic viruses. The innate immune response plays a crucial antiviral role in the early stage of infection. Immune responses are initiated based on the recognition of viral components, including viral surface glycoproteins and genetic material, by a group of recognition receptors. This recognition activates the complement system and intracellular antiviral signalling cascades, leading to the elimination of viruses and infected cells. Adaptive immunity is then evoked to produce virus-specific immunoglobulins for viral eradication. The antiviral machineries of blood-sucking arthropods, such as mosquitoes, ticks, and sand flies, are quite different from those of mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Weaver1">[1]</xref>. Arthropods lack an immunoglobulin-based adaptive immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Ganesan1">[2]</xref>. Thus, the innate immune system of arthropods plays a central role in the antiviral processes of these organisms.</p>
<p>The complement system functions during the early phase of infection and directly mediates pathogen elimination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Shishido1">[3]</xref>. The recent identification of complement-like factors in arthropods indicates that this system shares common ancestry as an immune defense mechanism in both vertebrates and invertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Levashina1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Blandin1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Buresova1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Cheng1">[7]</xref>. Thioester (TE)-containing proteins (TEPs) share high similarity with mammalian C3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Dodds1">[8]</xref>. TEPs are generally divided into 3 distinct families, including alpha-2-macroglobulins (A2Ms), C3/C4/C5 complement factors, and insect TEPs (iTEPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Blandin2">[9]</xref>. An <italic>Anopheles</italic> TEP induced by <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> can bind and kill parasitic ookinetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Blandin1">[5]</xref>. Multiple iTEPs in <italic>Anopheles</italic> (AgTEP1, AgTEP3 and AgTEP4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Moita1">[10]</xref> play a role in clearing bacteria via phagocytosis. <italic>Drosophila</italic> TEPs (DmTEP2 and DmTEP3) are required for efficient phagocytosis of Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria in S2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-StroscheinStevenson1">[11]</xref>. However, <italic>TEPs</italic> mutation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> did not significantly influence survival rate after different bacterial infection<italic>s</italic>, suggested <italic>Drosophila</italic> TEPs act redundantly or that their absence can be compensated by other components of the immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-BouAoun1">[12]</xref>. Macroglobulin complement-related factors (MCRs), which are members of the iTEP family, are highly conserved in metazoans and form an independent branch separate from other iTEP subfamilies in the phylogenetic tree. RNA interference screening has identified a <italic>Drosophila</italic> MCR (known as DmTEP6) that acts as a key factor in the efficient phagocytosis of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-StroscheinStevenson1">[11]</xref>. Overall, the TEP-based complement-like system functions as an evolutionarily conserved anti-microbial mechanism in arthropods.</p>
<p>Scavenger receptors (SR) are cell surface glycoproteins defined by their ability to bind chemically modified low-density lipoproteins. These receptors are categorized into 6 classes, without conserved domains, suggesting that different primary amino acid (aa) sequences can encode similar 3-dimensional structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Gough1">[13]</xref>. Several classes of SRs are located on the surface of immune cells and function as pathogen recognition receptors. SR-C, a membrane receptor identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that contains 2 complement control protein (CCP) domains (also designated Sushi repeat domains) in its extracellular region, is capable of recognizing both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and is thought to act as a pattern recognition receptor for phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Rmet1">[14]</xref>. The 2 CCP domains of <italic>Drosophila</italic> SR-C are thought to be responsible for microbial interaction.</p>
<p>The CCP domain is a signature module in many mammalian complement proteins. Each CCP consists of a domain of ∼60 aa residues, including a consensus pattern of 4 invariant cysteine residues and some additional conserved residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Casasnovas1">[15]</xref>. CCP has been shown to mediate the protein-protein interactions of complement components and to interact with pathogenic microorganisms. For example, complement receptor 2, containing 16 CCP repeats, acts as a receptor for the cleaved products of C3. Complement receptor 2 is also a well-known cellular entry receptor for Epstein-Barr virus in humans, and its CCP-1 and -2 domains are required for Epstein-Barr virus binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Molina1">[16]</xref>. A membrane cofactor protein (MCP) with 4 CCP repeats has been demonstrated to function as a cellular receptor for measles virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Drig1">[17]</xref>. Structural analysis has shown that the CCP-1 and -2 domains of MCP are responsible for measles virus recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Casasnovas1">[15]</xref>. Another complement regulator with 20 CCP repeats, factor H, reportedly binds the human immunodeficiency virus surface glycoproteins gp41 and gp120 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Stoiber1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Pangburn1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>Many mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses, such as West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, dengue virus (DENV) and yellow fever virus (YFV), are etiologic agents of severe human diseases, including hemorrhagic fever, biphasic fever, encephalitis, and meningitis. DENV is maintained in a transmission cycle between humans and <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-RigauPrez1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Gould1">[21]</xref>. Four serotypes of DENV, sequentially designated DENV1-4, exist in nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Ranjit1">[22]</xref>. <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, a member of the <italic>Culicinae</italic> subfamily, shows a close association with human populations and is a primary vector for DENVs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Halstead1">[23]</xref>. Because <italic>A. aegypti</italic> is easy to cultivate in the laboratory and its genome has been well characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Gubler1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Nene1">[25]</xref>, it has become an ideal model for the investigation of flaviviral pathogenesis and innate immune responses in invertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Cheng1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Cheng2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Liu1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Colpitts1">[28]</xref>. Herein, we report that an <italic>A. aegypti</italic> MCR (AaMCR) is a crucial effector in opposing the flaviviral invasion of mosquitoes. Furthermore, we identified an SR-C with 2 CCP domains in <italic>A. aegypti</italic> that efficiently recognizes DENV and recruits AaMCR to stimulate the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Our findings suggest a new pattern recognition receptor pathway that senses flaviviruses and initiates an antiviral cytokine-like response in <italic>A. aegypti.</italic></p>

<title>Phylogenetic analysis of MCR factors in <italic>A. aegypti</italic></title>
<p>The proteins of the TEP superfamily are key constituents of the immune systems of both vertebrates and invertebrates. TEPs are generally divided into 3 distinct subfamilies: complement C3/C4/C5, A2Ms, and iTEPs. Previous studies have suggested that several iTEP genes found in <italic>Anopheles</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> play a role in microbial elimination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Moita1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-StroscheinStevenson1">[11]</xref>. Furthermore, silencing an <italic>A. aegypti TEP</italic> homologue (<italic>AAEL012267</italic>, known previously as <italic>AeTEP1</italic>) significantly enhances flaviviral infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Cheng1">[7]</xref>, indicating a potential role of <italic>iTEPs</italic> in combating the viral infection of insects. Given the complicated immune function of <italic>iTEPs</italic>, we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of iTEP proteins among <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. MCRs, characterized as a subfamily of iTEPs, cluster along a single branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>AAEL012267</italic> is grouped into the MCR family, indicating that it is an <italic>A. aegypti</italic> MCR homologue (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).The <italic>AAEL012267</italic>-encoded protein is predicted to contain domains that are identical to those of <italic>Drosophila</italic> MCR (DmMCR), suggesting possible conserved functions of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We have therefore re-designated <italic>AAEL012267</italic> as <italic>AaMCR</italic> throughout this study. The thioester domain of iTEPs binds the surface of microbes via a covalent bond and triggers the phagocytosis and opsonization of microbes. However, not all TEPs contain the TE module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The lack of this domain in MCRs suggests a distinct mechanism of action.</p>

<p>(A-B) Knockdown of the <italic>AaMCR</italic> gene. The mosquitoes were microinjected with <italic>AaMCR</italic> or <italic>GFP</italic> dsRNA. The inoculated mosquitoes were sacrificed, and <italic>AaMCR</italic> abundance was assessed via qPCR (A) and immuno-blotting with an AaMCR antibody (B) at 6 days post microinjection. 50 μg of protein from mosquito lysates was loaded into each lane (B). (C-G) Silencing of <italic>AaMCR</italic> enhanced DENVs and YFV (17D) infections in <italic>A. aegypti</italic>. 10 MID<sub>50</sub> DENVs or YFV was inoculated at 3 days post-<italic>AaMCR</italic> silencing. The viral load was assessed at 6 days post-infection through qPCR and normalized against <italic>A. aegypti actin</italic> (<italic>AAEL011197</italic>). The primers and probes used for qPCR are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004027.s008">Table S2</xref>. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results. One dot represents 1 mosquito and the horizontal line represents the median of the results. The data were analyzed statistically by the non-parametric <italic>Mann-Whitney</italic> test. (H) Immuno-blockade of AaMCR enhanced the DENV-2 infection of <italic>A. aegypti</italic>. The AaMCR-N antibody, in 10-fold serial dilutions, was premixed with 10 MID<sub>50</sub> DENV-2 for thoracic co-microinjection. The treated mosquitoes were sacrificed to examine the viral load at 3 (i) and 6 (ii) days post-infection via qPCR and normalized against <italic>A. aegypti actin</italic>. The results were pooled from 3 independent experiments. One dot represents 1 mosquito and the horizontal line represents the median of the results. The data were analyzed statistically using the non-parametric <italic>Mann-Whitney</italic> test. (I) The expression of AaMCR fragment peptides in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. Three fragments of the AaMCR (a, 30–601 aa; b, 590–1,240 aa; c, 1,200–1,793 aa) with a C-terminal HA tag were cloned into the pMT/BiP/V5-His A vector and expressed in the S2 cell supernatant. The supernatant from empty vector-transfected S2 cells was used as a mock. The recombinant peptides were detected with an anti-HA antibody via western blotting. (J) The fragments of AaMCR do not directly interact with DENV-2 E protein in ELISA. The cell supernatant, including the AaMCR fragments were collected at 48 hrs after transfection. The DENV-2 E protein was expressed and purified from a <italic>Drosophila</italic> expression system. Each plate well was coated with 2 ug of DENV-2 E. The interaction was determined using an anti-HA antibody. The empty DNA vector-transfected S2 cell supernatant was used as a negative control.

<p>To understand the role of AaMCR in viral infections more thoroughly, we expressed and purified an N-terminal peptide of from AaMCR (AaMCR-N, 30–601 aa) from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004027.s001">Figure S1F</xref>) and generated mouse polyclonal antiserum against this fragment.

To validate the above results, we generated rabbit polyclonal antiserum using 2 synthetic peptides from the N-terminus of AaMCR. The same bands of ∼200 kDa and ∼50 kDa were detected in a mosquito lysates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004027.s001">Figure S1I</xref>). These results suggest that AaMCR is likely constitutively and rapidly processed into small active fragments and its cleaved peptides function in soluble form in the hemolymph of <italic>A. aegypti</italic>. To rule any off-target effects dsRNA-mediated RNA interference and validate the function of AaMCR, we premixed serial dilutions of the AaMCR-N antibody with the DENV-2 virus and thoracically microinjected the mixture into <italic>A. aegypti</italic>. Blocking the function of AaMCR using this specific antibody dramatically enhanced DENV-2 infectivity in mosquitoes at both 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g002">Figure 2H</xref>, i) and 6 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g002">Figure 2H</xref>, ii) post-inoculation.</p>

We therefore assessed the interaction between AaMCR and DENV-2. AaMCR is a 1,793-aa protein comprised of multiple complement-like domains but lacks an internal TE domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). According to the predicted domains, we divided AaMCR into 3 fragments (AaMCR-a, -b, -c; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004027.s001">Figure S1J</xref>) to be expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g002">Figure 2I</xref>). None of the 3 segments of AaMCR interacted directly with the DENV-2 envelope (E) protein in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g002">Figure 2J</xref>) or co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays (data not shown). We also assessed <italic>AaMCR</italic> mRNA expression in various mosquito tissues. We noted that the abundance of <italic>AaMCR</italic> mRNA varied among the tissues, with the highest abundance being found in the salivary glands, followed by the hemocytes and midgut. However, DENV-2 infection did not induce <italic>AaMCR</italic> mRNA expression in the investigated tissues at serial time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004027.s001">Figure S1K</xref>).</p>

<title>Proteins containing CCP domains restrict the flaviviral infections of <italic>A. aegypti</italic></title>
<p>The CCP domain is an evolutionarily conserved module in the complement system that is essential for reactions in the complement cascade. AaMCR shares high homology with mammalian C3/C4/C5 complement factors. The cleaved fragments of C3 and C4 are recognized by the CCP domains of the complement receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Dempsey1">[29]</xref>. However, the CCP domains of several membrane proteins can be manipulated by microbial pathogens to be used as receptors for cellular entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Molina1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Drig1">[17]</xref>. Our results show that AaMCR does not bind directly to DENV-2, indicating that adaptor molecules may exist to facilitate DENV recognition by AaMCR. We therefore speculated that proteins with CCP domains found in <italic>A. aegypti</italic> may play a role in the AaMCR-mediated antiviral response.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we identified a family of 10 proteins with CCP domains in <italic>A. aegypti</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004027.s007">Table S1</xref>). These 10 <italic>CCP</italic> genes were knocked down individually via thoracic microinjection of dsRNA. DENV-2 was then inoculated into the mosquitoes, and the resultant viral loads were quantified through qPCR 6 days after infection. Individual knockdown of 7 <italic>CCP</italic> genes in mosquitoes significantly enhanced the DENV-2 burden compared with that found in green fluorescent protein (<italic>GFP</italic>) dsRNA-treated mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, the silencing of 6 <italic>CCP</italic> genes increased mosquito susceptibility to YFV (17D vaccine strain) infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating a general antiviral role for the <italic>CCP</italic> genes of <italic>A. aegypti</italic>.

<p>To understand the antiviral mechanism of AaSR-C, we next assessed whether AaSR-C binds directly to DENV-2. The purified AaSR-C-Ex peptide interacted strongly with the DENV-2 E protein in a co-IP assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Purified AaSR-C-Ex also captured DENV-2 virions efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). AaSR-C was predicted to be a membrane protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). To verify that DENV virions bind AaSR-C on the cell surface, we cloned and expressed full-length <italic>AaSR-C</italic> with its trans-membrane region (<italic>AaSR-C-Full</italic>, 23–494 aa; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g004">Figure 4C, left panel</xref>) and constructed a Cu<sup>2+</sup>-inducible AaSR-C-expressing stable cell line. AaSR-C-expressing cells were incubated with DENV-2 virions, and their association with the cell surface was examined using flow cytometry. Non-induced stable cells and empty vector-transfected S2 cells were included as controls. More than 90% of the AaSR-C-expressing cells were bound by DENV-2 virions and showed double-positive staining compared with a negligible number of double-stained cells that were observed in the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). We next performed immunofluorescence staining to explore the location of native AaSR-C and DENV-2 virions. AaSR-C was highly expressed on the surface of hemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g004">Figure 4G</xref>, the 1st row).

<p>We have demonstrated crucial roles for both AaSR-C and AaMCR in controlling the DENV-2 infection of <italic>A. aegypti</italic> in addition to a direct interaction of AaSR-C with DENV-2 or the N-terminus of AaMCR. We next examined whether AaSR-C and AaMCR cooperate in a pathway that opposes DENV infection. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, purified DENV-2 E, AaSR-C-Ex, and AaMCR-a formed a complex in co-IP assays, whereas AaMCR-a did not bind directly to the DENV-2 E protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that AaSR-C-Ex functions as a linker to bring the other 2 proteins together. Likewise, AaSR-C-Ex was shown to be necessary for AaMCR-a binding to DENV-2 virions in an ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). To determine the relationship between AaSR-C and AaMCR in DENV infection, we co-silenced <italic>AaSR-C</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g005">Figure 5E</xref>, i) and <italic>AaMCR</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g005">Figure 5E</xref>, ii) in mosquitoes using dsRNA. Double knockdown had the same effect on DENV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g005">Figure 5E</xref>, iii) and the number of DENV-2 virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g005">Figure 5E</xref>, iv) as single knockdown, suggesting that <italic>AaSR-C</italic> and <italic>AaMCR</italic> function in the same pathway opposing the DENV infection of <italic>A. aegypti</italic>.</p>
<p>In the above experiments, the mosquitoes were infected through intra-thoracic inoculation. To further evaluate the dissemination of DENV in various mosquito tissues following the infection by oral feeding, we silenced <italic>AaMCR</italic> and <italic>AaSR-C</italic>, both individually and together, via intra-thoracic microinjection of dsRNA. Three days after the dsRNA treatment, the mosquitoes were fed with Vero cells-generated DENV-2 and fresh human blood and the specific tissues were dissected at serial time points to evaluate the kinetics of viral dissemination. In accordance with our previous results obtained through intra-thoracic infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g005">Figure 5E</xref>, iii), in the oral feeding experiment, silencing <italic>AaMCR</italic> and/or <italic>AaSR-C</italic> significantly enhanced DENV-2 burden in whole mosquitoes and various tissues, indicating that the complement-like system works as a general mechanism to limit viral infection in mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004027.s005">Figure S5A-S5C</xref>). Moreover, the silencing of these complement components increased the number of infectious DENV-2 virions in salivary glands extracts (SGE) as determined in plaque assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004027.s005">Figure S5D</xref>), suggesting that antiviral immunity in mosquitoes may influence their viral transmission capacity.</p>
<p>To understand the association between AaSR-C, AaMCR, and DENV more thoroughly <italic>in vivo</italic>, we determined their localization in hemocytes using immunofluorescence microscopy. Under an uninfected status, AaMCR showed very little co-localization with AaSR-C on the hemocyte surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g005">Figure 5F</xref>, the 1st row). After infection, AaSR-C co-localized well with AaMCR and DENV on the hemocyte surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g005">Figure 5F</xref>, the 2nd row). Moreover, knockdown of <italic>AaMCR</italic> eliminated AaMCR staining in hemocytes, demonstrating the specificity of the AaMCR antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g005">Figure 5F</xref>, the 4th row). Because AaSR-C but not AaMCR binds DENV directly, knockdown of AaMCR did not influence DENV localization to the hemocyte membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g005">Figure 5F</xref>, the 4th row). Interestingly, <italic>AaSR-C</italic> silencing reduced, but did not fully abolish the fluorescence staining of AaMCR, indicating that additional proteins may recruit AaMCR to hemocytes. Furthermore, we still observed DENV staining after <italic>AaSR-C/AaMCR</italic> silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004027-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). This is because the DENV can still bind to its cellular entry receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Liu1">[27]</xref> or some other membrane proteins on hemocytes. Without AaSR-C and AaMCR, DENV binding to hemocyte surface does not produce AMPs, but still leads to cellular entry via its receptors, resulting in DENV replication.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Hosts are equipped with sophisticated machineries to detect and eliminate invading pathogens before they cause significant physiological damage. Unlike mammals, which have both innate and adaptive immune systems, insects rely solely on RNA interference and potentially on cytokine-like responses to limit viral infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Wang1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Arjona1">[35]</xref>. Despite lacking an immunoglobulin-based humoral response, insects have a functional complement-like system for warding off invading pathogens. For instance, <italic>Anopheles</italic> TEP1 eradicates <italic>Plasmodium</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Blandin1">[5]</xref>, and other <italic>Anopheles</italic> TEPs recognize <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> to target them for phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Moita1">[10]</xref>. DmMCR, which shares multiple common domains with insect TEPs and mammalian complement C3/C4/C5, has been observed to opsonize and phagocytize <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-StroscheinStevenson1">[11]</xref>. However, whether the TEP-based complement-like system plays a role in mosquito defense against viral agents currently remains unclear.</p>
<p>The human complement system consists of more than 30 secreted and membrane-bound proteins. Invading pathogens are recognize by pattern receptors, including C1q, ficolin, and mannose-binding C-type lectin (MBL), subsequently triggering a complement cascade. However, the mechanism of pathogen recognition in insects may be quite different from that in mammals. Comparative genomic analyses have shown that no homologues of human C1q or ficolin exists in <italic>A. aegypti</italic> (Cheng G, Xiao XP, unpublished data). Moreover, the extracellular C-type lectins found in mosquitoes, which are the putative homologues of human MBL, have recently been shown to act as cellular receptors facilitating West Nile virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Cheng2">[26]</xref> and DENV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Liu1">[27]</xref> infection, rather than as antiviral pattern recognition receptors. Herein, we demonstrate that a homologue of macroglobulin complement-related factors (AaMCR) is crucial for restricting flaviviral infections. Silencing of <italic>AaMCR</italic> or immuno-blockade of AaMCR impaired the antiviral ability of mosquitoes. However, AaMCR does not directly interact with DENV surface proteins, suggesting that the antiviral effect of AaMCR is mediated by a certain particular adaptor. To further explore the essential players in this MCR-based antiviral response, we identified 10 proteins containing CCP domains and investigated their role in flaviviral infection in <italic>A. aegypti</italic>. Knockdown of <italic>AAEL006361</italic> enhanced flaviviral infections in the mosquitoes most significantly. Sequence analyses suggested that the protein encoded by <italic>AAEL006361</italic> contains 2 CCP domains at its N-terminus and is a homologue of <italic>Drosophila</italic> SR-C, which is a well-known pattern recognition receptor of bacterial surface components that initiates an antibacterial phagocytic response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Rmet1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Pearson1">[36]</xref>. In accordance with these findings, our results show that AaSR-C is capable of binding DENV surface proteins. The virion-bound AaSR-C then recruits the complement-like factor AaMCR, which induces antiviral immune factors such as AMPs to control viral infection. Indeed, in mammals, most CCP-containing complement components function as regulators of the complement cascades. For example, factor H act as a negative regulator of the alternative complement pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Schmidt1">[37]</xref>, and C4-binding protein (C4BP) functions as an inhibitor of complement C4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Leung1">[38]</xref>. This observation indicates the common distant complement system mechanism between mammals and arthropods.</p>
<p>TEPs generally need to be cleaved into active products following microbial attack. In human complement proteins, the alpha chain of C3 is primarily cleaved into the C3a and C3b active forms after microbial infection. C3a is involved in the inflammatory immune response, whereas C3b is further degraded into C3c and C3d. C3d plays a role in B-cell activation through binding to complement receptor 2. C3c is deposited on the pathogen surface and triggers the phagocytosis and opsonization of pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Dempsey1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Miller1">[39]</xref>. <italic>Anopheles</italic> TEP1 is cleaved into 2 fragments of ∼75 kDa and ∼100 kDa in response to septic wounds and microbial infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Fraiture1">[40]</xref>. However, emerging evidence indicates that not all iTEPs are necessarily proteolytically processed to become active. DmMCR is not cleaved in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 supernatant, and the full-length protein takes its active form without any proteolytic processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-StroscheinStevenson1">[11]</xref>. <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic> MCR lacks the lysine-arginine cleavage motif that is a typical feature of C3-complement molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Buresova1">[6]</xref>. In the present study using 2 polyclonal antibodies against the N-terminus of AaMCR, we detected a ∼50-kDa band below the predicted 206-kDa full-length protein in adult female <italic>A. aegypti</italic> lysates through both reducing and non-reducing sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown), indicating that AaMCR is likely constitutively cleaved into its active form for function.</p>
<p>Mammalian complement proteins C3 and C4, which contain TE and multiple A2M domains, are the central players in the complement system opposing pathogen invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Fuchs1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Avirutnan1">[42]</xref>. The TE modules of C3 and C4 bind to the surface of microbes via a covalent bond, resulting in the phagocytosis and opsonization of microbes. Activated complement proteins C3 and C4 are deposited on the viral surface and subsequently eliminate virions, independent of phagocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Fuchs1">[41]</xref>. <italic>Anopheles</italic> TEP1, which has been reported to be a key factor in bacterial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Moita1">[10]</xref> and parasitic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Blandin1">[5]</xref> elimination, also interacts with pathogens through its TE bond. However, not all of the TEP-pathogen interactions are apparently mediated by covalent TE bonds. <italic>Anopheles</italic> TEP3 (<italic>AGAP010816</italic>), which is an insect TEP without a TE domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Buresova1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Waterhouse1">[43]</xref>, recognizes Gram-negative bacteria for phagocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Moita1">[10]</xref>. DmMCR, which also lacks a TE domain, interacts with <italic>C. albicans</italic> for pathogen eradication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-StroscheinStevenson1">[11]</xref>. These observations imply an unknown alternative mechanism for the recognition of pathogens by iTEPs. Indeed, as demonstrated by our data, AaMCR, a mosquito TEP without a TE domain, recognizes DENV via AaSR-C to enhance AMP production. Given the established interaction between CCP domains and the cleaved C3 fragment or the surface components of pathogens, we speculate that the CCP domains of AaSR-C may play central role in the formation of the AaMCR/AaSR-C/virus complex.</p>
<p>AMPs are evolutionarily conserved components of the innate immune response. Mammalian AMPs have been demonstrated to efficiently eliminate bacteria, enveloped viruses, and fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Hancock1">[44]</xref>. Given their conserved sequences, insect AMPs may play a crucial role in antiviral defense. In fact, a CEC-like peptide was recently found to be induced by DENV infection and to limit the virus in the salivary gland of <italic>A. aegypti</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Luplertlop1">[32]</xref>. Several AMPs belonging to the CEC and DEF families have been shown to present anti-DENV activity in <italic>A. aegypti</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Pan1">[30]</xref>. In agreement with these findings, our results revealed that 7 mosquito <italic>AMP</italic>s are upregulated by DENV-2 infection, among which 3 DEFs and 2 CECs are regulated by the AaMCR-AaSR-C signalling pathway. Multiple AMPs exert antiviral activity against DENV infection. Considering the data obtained in the present study, we propose the following antiviral immune signalling pathway in <italic>A. aegypti</italic>: (1) viral recognition: AaSR-C recognizes the flaviviral surface protein and subsequently recruits AaMCR to form a protein-virus complex; (2) AMP induction: the conjugation of AaSR-C and AaMCR with viruses triggers an immune signalling pathway to stimulate <italic>AMPs</italic> expression; and (3) viral inactivation: the positive charges of AMPs can electrostatically or hydrophobically associate with the components of the viral surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Hancock2">[45]</xref>, subsequently resulting in the flaviviral inactivation.</p>
<p>Similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mosquitoes equip at least three immune signalling cascades: the Toll, Immune Deficiency (Imd), and Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways to fight pathogenic invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Xi1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Dong1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Garver1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-SouzaNeto1">[48]</xref>. Compared with the Imd pathway, the Toll and JAK-STAT pathways are more specific for response to viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Xi1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-SouzaNeto1">[48]</xref>. Toll pathway is activated in response to DENV infection in <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, which triggers robust expression of several Toll pathway marker genes, such as <italic>attacin</italic>, <italic>defensins</italic>, and <italic>cecropins</italic>, to control DENV replication in mosquito tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Dong2">[49]</xref>. The JAK-STAT pathway has also been implicated in anti-viral defenses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-SouzaNeto1">[48]</xref>. Moreover, <italic>Dong et al.</italic> showed that both the Toll and JAK-STAT pathways are activated by <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic> infection, leading to resistance of dengue infection in <italic>A. aegypti</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Dong2">[49]</xref>. Previous studies implied that both the Toll and JAK-STAT pathways may be regulated at least in part by the same signal transduction cascade. Consistent with this hypothesis, the JAK-STAT pathway can be indirectly activated by the Toll cascade in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Lagueux1">[50]</xref>. Here, our results revealed that several mosquito AMPs, regulated by the AaMCR/AaSR-C system, are also modulated by Toll/JAK-STAT responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Dong2">[49]</xref>. Given the partial overlap between Toll/JAK-STAT and AaMCR/AaSR-C regulated AMPs, we speculate that complement-like factors may directly or indirectly function together with the Toll/JAK-STAT pathways. The relationship between complement-like factors and the Toll/JAK-STAT signaling pathways remains to be elucidated in the future.</p>
<p>The antiviral systems of mosquitoes limit viral infection and prevent invading pathogens from causing significant physiological damage in tissues. Our results presented above show that several complement-like factors play a vital role in resistance against dengue infection in <italic>A. aegypti</italic>. These factors are unable to eliminate viruses from mosquitoes but can limit the viral burden to a tolerable level that does not elicit significant tissue damages in mosquitoes and that allows successful viral transmission. Without these antiviral mechanisms, viral replication could cause damages to mosquito physiology and thus decrease the mosquito life span. Previous studies have demonstrated a negative correlation between viral titers and mosquito longevity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-MacieldeFreitas1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Sylvestre1">[52]</xref>. We examined the life span of individual- or co-<italic>AaMCR</italic>/<italic>AaSR-C</italic> dsRNA-treated, DENV-infected mosquitoes and noted that the life span of the <italic>AaMCR</italic>/<italic>AaSR-C</italic> silenced mosquitoes was shorter (though not statistically significantly) than that of <italic>GFP</italic> dsRNA controls following DENV infection (Cheng G, Xiao XP, Unpublished data). Many studies suggest that arboviral infection leads to apoptosis in mosquito tissues. The midgut epithelial cells of <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> undergo apoptosis after West Nile virus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Vaidyanathan1">[53]</xref>. Apoptosis of the salivary glands and midgut of <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> was observed following Sindbis virus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Kelly1">[54]</xref>. Moreover, the level of apoptosis is correlated with virus replication in infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004027-Yen1">[55]</xref>. We assessed apoptosis in mosquito tissues by TUNEL staining, and noted that the number of apoptotic cells in <italic>AaMCR/AaSR-C</italic> silenced mosquitoes was greater than in <italic>GFP</italic> dsRNA controls (Cheng G, Xiao XP, Unpublished data). It is plausible based on the above observations that the antiviral complement mechanism favors DENV transmission and maintenance in nature by extending the life span of DENV infected mosquitoes.</p>
<p>In summary, we have elucidated the antiviral activity of a system composed of the factors, involving multiple complement-related proteins in <italic>A. aegypti</italic>. A similar antiviral mechanism may be present in other arthropods such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Ixodes</italic>, which also exhibit MCR and SR-C homologues. Understanding the antiviral mechanisms of arthropods may provide novel strategies for limiting arboviral transmission in nature.</p>
