<abstract>
<p>Immune responses and DNA damage repair are two fundamental processes that have been characterized extensively, but the links between them remain largely unknown. We report that multiple bacterial, fungal and oomycete plant pathogen species induce double-strand breaks (DSBs) in host plant DNA. DNA damage detected by histone γ-H2AX abundance or DNA comet assays arose hours before the disease-associated necrosis caused by virulent <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic>. Necrosis-inducing paraquat did not cause detectable DSBs at similar stages after application. Non-pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> bacteria also did not induce DSBs. Elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is common during plant immune responses, ROS are known DNA damaging agents, and the infection-induced host ROS burst has been implicated as a cause of host DNA damage in animal studies. However, we found that DSB formation in Arabidopsis in response to <italic>P. syringae</italic> infection still occurs in the absence of the infection-associated oxidative burst mediated by <italic>AtrbohD</italic> and <italic>AtrbohF</italic>. Plant MAMP receptor stimulation or application of defense-activating salicylic acid or jasmonic acid failed to induce a detectable level of DSBs in the absence of introduced pathogens, further suggesting that pathogen activities beyond host defense activation cause infection-induced DNA damage. The abundance of infection-induced DSBs was reduced by salicylic acid and <italic>NPR1</italic>-mediated defenses, and by certain <italic>R</italic> gene-mediated defenses. Infection-induced formation of γ-H2AX still occurred in Arabidopsis <italic>atr/atm</italic> double mutants, suggesting the presence of an alternative mediator of pathogen-induced H2AX phosphorylation. In summary, pathogenic microorganisms can induce plant DNA damage. Plant defense mechanisms help to suppress rather than promote this damage, thereby contributing to the maintenance of genome integrity in somatic tissues.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Multicellular organisms are continuously exposed to microbes and have developed sophisticated defense mechanisms to counter attack by microbial pathogens. Organisms also encounter many types of DNA damage and have evolved multiple mechanisms to maintain their genomic integrity. Even though these two fundamental responses have been characterized extensively, the relationship between them remains largely unclear. Our study demonstrates that microbial plant pathogens with diverse life styles, including bacteria, oomycete and fungal pathogens, induce double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the genomes of infected host plant cells. DSB induction is apparently a common feature during plant-pathogen interactions. DSBs are the most deleterious form of DNA damage and can lead to chromosomal aberrations and gene mutations. In response to pathogen infection, plant immune responses are activated and contribute to suppressing pathogen-induced DSBs, thereby maintaining better genome integrity and stability. The findings identify important ways that the plant immune and DNA damage repair responses are interconnected. Awareness of the above phenomena may foster future development of disease management approaches that improve crop productivity under biotic stress.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Organisms continuously encounter many types of DNA damage and have evolved elegant mechanisms to maintain their genomic integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Jackson1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Ciccia1">[2]</xref>. DNA damage can be induced by a variety of exogenous stresses such as ultraviolet light or genotoxic chemicals, and by endogenous insults such as reactive oxygen species and DNA replication errors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Jackson1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Sedelnikova1">[3]</xref>. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can trigger cell cycle arrest and programmed cell death, and are among the most serious types of DNA damage. Surveillance for DSBs and signaling in response to DSBs are therefore critical for cells to orchestrate DNA repair pathways not only in the germ line but also in somatic tissues, to sustain genome stability and survival of the organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Jackson1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Ciccia1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>Pathogen management of their own (microbial) DNA integrity has a long history of study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Ambur1">[4]</xref>, as does the study of interactions between viruses and host DNA damage repair processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Weitzman1">[5]</xref>. There have been far fewer reports or studies of damage to host DNA caused by microbial pathogens. However, it has recently been established that microbial pathogens of animals can induce host DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Nougayrede1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Arthur1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Multicellular organisms are continuously exposed to microbes and have developed effective immune systems to resist attacks by pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Dodds1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Murphy1">[14]</xref>. Organisms are challenged to balance the health-promoting impacts of antimicrobial responses and the potential toxic effects on surrounding tissue caused by excessive or chronic inflammation. In animal pathogenesis studies, carcinogenic effects of innate immune responses mediated by Toll-like receptors have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-RakoffNahoum1">[15]</xref>. An oxidative burst is a common element of plant and animal antimicrobial responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Murphy1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Lamb1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-OBrien1">[17]</xref>, but reactive oxygen species (ROS) also have well-known DNA damaging activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Sedelnikova1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-RoldanArjona1">[18]</xref>. There is evidence that a significant component of the host genotoxicity of certain microbial infections in animals is attributable to host-generated ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Chakraborty1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Mangerich1">[11]</xref>. In plants, the relative contribution of the defense-associated ROS burst to pathogen restriction as opposed to genotoxicity (DNA damage) remains to be explored.</p>
<p>Plant DNA damage repair pathways have received extensive study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Waterworth1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Balestrazzi1">[20]</xref>. Although the tie-ins of plant DNA damage to other aspects of organismal physiology are often plant-specific, many elements of the plant DNA damage repair pathways resemble those of animals due to conservation of core DNA damage repair mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Waterworth1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Balestrazzi1">[20]</xref>. A hallmark DNA damage response conserved across multicellular organisms is the rapid phosphorylation of histone variant H2AX in the chromatin that flanks break sites, forming γ-H2AX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Rogakou1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Iacovoni1">[22]</xref>. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related) are central mediators of these and other cellular responses to DSBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Abraham1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Friesner1">[25]</xref>. γ-H2AX is one of the most sensitive indicators of DNA DSBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Kinner1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>Associations between DNA damage and plant immune responses have been identified. Exposure of plants to the salicylic acid analogs BTH or INA, or inoculation with the oomycete pathogen <italic>H. arabidopsidis</italic>, was shown to increase the frequency of somatic homologous recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Lucht1">[27]</xref>. Infection of tobacco and Arabidopsis leaves with either tobacco masaic virus or oilseed rape mosaic virus (ORMV) results in both local and systemic increases in homologous recombination frequency, and ORMV inoculations elicited DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Kovalchuk1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Yao1">[29]</xref>. DNA damaging agents induce pathogenesis-related gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Choi1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Kunz1">[31]</xref>, and the DNA damage repair proteins RAD51D, BRCA2 and SSN2 are now known to be involved in regulation of gene expression during plant immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Durrant1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Song1">[34]</xref>. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, a process frequently associated with DNA damage repair, has been shown to impact plant responses to microbial pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-AdamsPhillips1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-AdamsPhillips2">[36]</xref>. Lastly, during the programmed cell death of the hypersensitive response to pathogens expressing effectors (<italic>Avr</italic> gene products) recognized by a corresponding plant <italic>R</italic> gene product, increased signal in TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) assays can be observed, as is also common in animal cell apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Mur1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Ryerson1">[38]</xref>. In spite of the above, DNA damage during plant interactions with virulent pathogens is largely undescribed, and whether DNA damage arises during responses activated by core plant defense mediators such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid or activated microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) receptors also is not known.</p>
<p>Here, we demonstrate that diverse microbial pathogens induce DNA double-strand breaks in host plant genomes. Surprisingly (in light of the mutagenic nature of ROS in many settings), infection-associated <italic>AtrbohD</italic>- and <italic>AtrbohF</italic>-dependent ROS production is not required for pathogen-induced elevation of γ-H2AX. Instead, we find that plant antimicrobial defense mechanisms contribute to suppressed formation and/or rapid repair of γ-H2AX-associated lesions. DNA DSB damage is apparently a common aspect of plant pathogenesis by virulent microbial pathogens, and protection against DNA damage is an important feature of effective plant disease resistance.</p>

<title>Induction of DNA double-strand breaks by bacterial pathogens</title>
<p>To investigate interactions between pathogen infection and genome stress, we used γ-H2AX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Rogakou1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Kinner1">[26]</xref> to monitor the extent of DNA damage in response to bacterial pathogens in Arabidopsis. Wild-type Arabidopsis Col-0 plants were challenged with virulent <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> (<italic>Pst</italic>) strain DC3000 and levels of γ-H2AX at various time points after infection were determined using an anti-γ-H2AX antibody. Accumulation of γ-H2AX was readily detected as early as 2 h after infiltration, with a progressive increase at the indicated time points after infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004030-g001">Figures 1A and 1B</xref>). No γ-H2AX accumulation was observed after mock treatment with 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, suggesting that the elevated levels of DNA damage were triggered by the pathogen rather than by any physical perturbations associated with plant inoculation.</p>

<p>(A–B) Accumulation of γ-H2AX during infection.

The level of γ-H2AX was monitored at (A) 2, 4, 8 h, or (B) 12, 24, 48 h after inoculation, by immunoblot using anti-γ-H2AX antibody. Controls for equivalent loading included a non-specific band detected by the antibody (control) or Ponceau S staining of the same blot. Similar results were obtained in at least three separate experiments. (C) Representative <italic>Pst</italic>-induced DNA damage detected by comet assay. Wild-type Col-0 plants were inoculated with 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, or with <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 or <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000(<italic>avrRpt2</italic>) at 1×10<sup>7</sup> cfu/ml. Tissues were collected 8 or 16 h after inoculation and nuclei were subjected to comet assays.

<p>We also measured the phosphorylation of H2AX in response to <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000(<italic>avrRpt2</italic>), a strain that is isogenic with <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 except for its expression of the effector AvrRpt2. AvrRpt2 induces a strong host resistance response (an <italic>R</italic> gene-mediated incompatible interaction) in plants that express the resistance gene <italic>RPS2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Kunkel1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Yu1">[40]</xref>. Across four independent experiments, the induction of γ-H2AX levels between 2 and 48 h after inoculation was relatively similar between <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000(<italic>avrRpt2</italic>) and <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000. At the early 2, 4 and 8 h time points, minor differences between the two strains in the γ-H2AX levels induced at the same time after inoculation were not reproducible across experiments. To determine whether the high γ-H2AX accumulation after infection is related to the suite of virulence-promoting bacterial effectors delivered via type III secretion, Arabidopsis Col-0 plants were infected with <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000(Δ<italic>hrcC</italic>) that carries a deletion in the <italic>hrcC</italic> gene that encodes a key component of the type III secretion system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Boch1">[41]</xref>. Decreased γ-H2AX accumulation was observed with <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000(Δ<italic>hrcC</italic>) 4 to 8 h after infiltration compared with virulent <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 treatment, and the difference became statistically significant at 24 and 48 h after infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004030-g001">Figures 1A, 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004030.s001">S1</xref>). As points of reference, our group and other laboratories have previously found that the onset of <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000-induced plant cell death is not observed until ∼16–24 h after infection, and <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000(<italic>avrRpt2</italic>)-induced hypersensitive response cell death also occurs relatively late, with an onset ∼14–18 h after inoculation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Whalen1">[e.g.]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Ritter1">[ 42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Yu2">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Gao1">[45]</xref>. Electrolyte leakage (an early sign of the resistance response) is first detected 5–6 h after inoculation of resistant Arabidopsis with <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000(<italic>avrRpt2</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Zhang1">[46]</xref>, and with <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000, cytosolic Ca<italic><sup>2+</sup></italic> increases are not observed for at least 150 min after inoculation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Grant1">[47]</xref>, well after the 2 h time point at which γ-H2AX accumulation is first detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004030-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>Independent evidence that <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>tomato</italic> infection increases DSBs in Arabidopsis was obtained in comet assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004030-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). Comet assays measure DNA damage by directly monitoring the increased capacity of fractured DNA to electrophoretically migrate out of isolated nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Collins1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Dhawan1">[49]</xref>. The roughly comparable levels of DNA damage caused by <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000(<italic>avrRpt2</italic>) and <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 may be a result of infiltration directly into the leaf interior of the relatively high (1×10<sup>7</sup> cfu/ml) and equivalent populations of the two pathogen strains. However, these initial results also suggested that stress may be imposed on plant DNA by plant defense responses.</p>
<p>A number of non-pathogenic bacteria were then tested for their ability to induce DNA DSBs in the host plant. When wild-type Arabidopsis Col-0 plants were infiltrated with <italic>E. coli</italic> strain DH5α at a dose similar to the above <italic>Pst</italic> inoculations, no γ-H2AX was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004030-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Three plant-associated bacterial strains that are not pathogenic on Arabidopsis were also tested: <italic>P. syringae</italic> pv. <italic>glycinea</italic> (<italic>Psg</italic>) is a soybean pathogen that multiplies and produces few visible symptoms when introduced into Arabidopsis leaf mesophyll <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Mishina1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Huynh1">[51]</xref>, <italic>Psg</italic> (<italic>avrRpt2</italic>) expresses the effector AvrRpt2 and induces <italic>R</italic> gene-mediated defenses in Arabidopsis Col-0 despite the low virulence of the parent strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Yu2">[44]</xref> and <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> WCS417r is a biological control strain that has been widely used to trigger induced systemic resistance (ISR) in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Pieterse1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Haas1">[53]</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study discovered that host DNA damage is induced, both in the model organism Arabidopsis <italic>thaliana</italic> and in tomato and potato crop plants, in response to plant pathogens with diverse life styles including a hemibiotrophic bacterial species, an oomycete and a necrotrophic fungus. Similar or reduced levels of DNA DSBs were induced during incompatible interactions when compared with compatible interactions. Plant defense mediators such as ROS, jasmonic acid and MAMP receptors did not on their own increase DSBs, and SA-mediated defenses reduced rather than elevated pathogen-induced DNA damage. These findings provide a new type of evidence of links between the plant immune and DNA damage responses. Prevention and repair of DNA damage is needed, to a greater extent than was previously understood, as an element of the plant defense response.</p>
<p>Previously discovered associations between DNA damage and plant immune responses were noted in the introduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Lucht1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Ryerson1">[38]</xref>. In addition, Yan et al. very recently reported that salicylic acid activates DNA damage responses as part of the plant immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Yan1">[72]</xref>. Similar associations have been established in animal systems. For example, DNA damage can regulate human inflammatory responses through activation of the tumor suppressor p53 and elevated expression of Toll-like receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Menendez1">[79]</xref>, and the DNA damage response induces expression of innate immune system ligands of the NKG2D receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Gasser1">[80]</xref>. The fact that DNA damage induces immune responses suggests that multicellular organisms associate DNA damage with, among other things, microbial infections. The present work and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Yao1">[29]</xref> provide experimental evidence for a key part of this arrangement, by showing that diverse plant pathogens elicit plant DNA damage.</p>
<p>One point of note is the short time after <italic>Pst</italic> infection at which γ-H2AX becomes apparent. The flagellin or EF-Tu MAMPs flg22 or elf18 did not elicit detectable DNA DSBs, but γ-H2AX was reproducibly present within 2 h after <italic>Pst</italic> infection. The pathbreaking findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Lucht1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Kovalchuk1">[28]</xref> indicate that pathogens do not even need to be physically present at a cell for that cell to experience pathogenesis-associated genome stress. They measured homologous recombination rather than directly monitoring DNA damage, but as one example, those researchers reported increased homologous recombination in non-inoculated leaves as early as 8 h after inoculation of tobacco with Tobacco mosaic virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Kovalchuk1">[28]</xref>. This is faster than the virus itself moves. The SA analogs BTH or INA induced a 1.5 to 7 fold increase of homologous recombination frequency 14 days after chemical treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Kovalchuk1">[28]</xref>, while we did not observe increases in DNA DSBs after treatment with SA or JA. However, we examined the level of γ-H2AX at much earlier times points 12, 24 and 48 h after SA or JA application. Yan et al. reported, from comet assays, that SA can induce DNA damage in wild-type and <italic>npr1</italic> mutant plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Yan1">[72]</xref>. This discrepancy between the two studies may have been caused by the use of different DNA damage detection methods or by differences in plant growth and treatment conditions. The main conclusion of Yan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Yan1">[72]</xref>, that SA activates DNA damage responses to potentiate plant immunity, is highly consistent with our main finding that pathogenic microorganisms can induce plant DNA damage and that plant defense mechanisms help to suppress rather than promote this damage.</p>
<p>Production of ROS is one of the earliest cellular responses of plants to pathogens and is also a common response to pathogens in animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Murphy1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Lamb1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-OBrien1">[17]</xref>. The genotoxicity of certain microbial infections in animals has been attributed to host-generated ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Chakraborty1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Mangerich1">[11]</xref>. We found that Arabidopsis <italic>rbohD</italic> and <italic>rbohDF</italic> mutants that are defective in pathogenesis-induced ROS burst still produced extensive pathogenesis-induced DSBs. In addition, the strong ROS inducer paraquat failed to induce extensive DSBs. Furthermore, despite the contrasting induction of a less strong early ROS burst in response to virulent pathogens vs. the combined early ROS burst and a stronger and more prolonged later ROS burst in response to avirulent pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Lamb1">[16]</xref>, both types of <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 pathogens induced similar formation of DSBs. Recognition of diverse MAMPs including both flg22 and elf18 also triggers an oxidative burst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Boller1">[70]</xref> but failed to induce the generation of DSBs. Collectively, these findings indicate that ROS are not key mediators required for pathogen induction of DSBs in the plant pathosystems that we analyzed. A recent paper has analogously suggested that the host ROS triggered by <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection is not required for DSB formation in animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Toller1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Because in our studies the MAMPs flg22 and elf18, the signaling molecules salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, and ROS-generating paraquat each failed to induce detectable level of DSBs, we postulate that direct interaction with one or more pathogen-derived effectors, toxins, or other molecules is required for pathogen induction of DNA damage. Type-III secretion-defective <italic>Pst</italic> DC3000 Δ<italic>hrcC</italic> induced fewer DSBs, suggesting a contribution of one or more Type III-secreted effectors to bacteria-induced plant DNA damage. However, that contribution may be direct, or indirect through effector elicitation of specific host responses, or indirect due to general enhancement of pathogen population sizes. The more significant result of the DC3000 Δ<italic>hrcC</italic> experiments may be that substantial DSB induction was evident even when the Type-III secretion system was disabled.</p>
<p>In the present study, host DNA DSB induction was observed following infection by plant pathogens but not after introduction of non-pathogenic bacteria. Prior work provides some context for this result. For example, the non-pathogenic bacteria <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α and <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> Pf101 elicit defense transcript accumulation and phytoalexin biosynthesis in bean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Jakobek1">[81]</xref>. Inoculation of Arabidopsis roots with <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> strain WCS417r (the strain used in this study) activates induced systemic resistance, which is independent of SA accumulation and pathogenesis-related (<italic>PR</italic>) gene activation but primes plants to respond faster or stronger to pathogen attack <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Pieterse3">[82]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Verhagen1">[83]</xref>. Induction of those responses, then, is not likely to elicit DNA DSBs, although the failure of those non-pathogenic bacteria to induce DNA DSBs may alternatively be attributable to the weak defense response they trigger. In contrast to <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> WCS417r, the soybean pathogen <italic>Psg</italic> was previously shown to trigger a marked systemic increase of SA level and <italic>PR</italic> gene expression in Arabidopsis, leading to elevated systemic resistance to secondary infection, although to a lesser extent compared to those induced by virulent <italic>Pst</italic> and avirulent <italic>Pst avrRpm1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Mishina1">[50]</xref>. So although we do not yet know the mechanism of DNA DSB induction by plant pathogens, and did not observed its induction by ROS, SA, JA, or MAMPs, strength of host defense induction is a feature that correlates with the DNA DSB-inducing behavior of the strains we studied. Recent work with <italic>Psg</italic> on Arabidopsis reminds us that molecular mechanisms of non-host resistance against different plant pathogens can be distinct. The Arabidopsis non-host resistance gene <italic>PSS1</italic> confers a new form of non-host resistance against both a hemibiotrophic oomycete pathogen, <italic>P. sojae</italic> and a necrotrophic fungal pathogen, <italic>F. virguliforme</italic>, but not the bacterial pathogen <italic>Psg</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Sumit1">[84]</xref>.</p>
<p>ATM and ATR are the two primary known signal transducers of DNA breakage, and they initiate a phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction cascade that leads to cell-cycle arrest and repair of DSBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Abraham1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Friesner1">[25]</xref>. In addition to ATM and ATR, a related mammalian enzyme, the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), is capable of phosphorylating H2AX in response to DSBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Park1">[85]</xref>. The relative roles of ATM and ATR in DSB-dependent γ-H2AX induction have been debated, and apparently vary depending on the biological context. For example, Kuhne <italic>et al.</italic> provided evidence that ATM contributes to ionizing radiation-induced γ-H2AX formation in mouse fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Kuhne1">[86]</xref>, whereas a separate report suggested that ATM was not required or played minor role in ionizing radiation-dependent γ-H2AX accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Karlsson1">[87]</xref>. In Arabidopsis the accumulation of γ-H2AX in response to ionizing radiation-induced DSBs is dependent on both ATM and ATR, with a predominant role for ATM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Friesner1">[25]</xref>. We found that pathogen-induced γ-H2AX accumulation was not reduced in two different Arabidopsis <italic>atr atm</italic> double mutant lines. Our finding unsettles the concept that only ATR and ATM carry out this process in plants. Because no obvious homologs of DNA-PK are present in nonvertebrates, our experiments suggest that plants have one or more kinases other than ATM, ATR or DNA-PK that can phosphorylate H2AX, and which do so in response to pathogen infection. This finding of pathogen-induced γ-H2AX accumulation in Arabidopsis <italic>atr atm</italic> double mutants is supported by a recent discovery made using primary cultures of human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, where knockdown of all three major phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinases (ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs) did not abolish the activation of γ-H2AX during viral infection by BKPyV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Jiang1">[88]</xref>. Viral infection by BKPyV did cause severe DNA damage in the absence of ATM or ATR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Jiang1">[88]</xref>, and as previously noted, numerous animal and plant studies have shown that ATM and ATR play central roles in DNA damage repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Waterworth1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Sperka1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Friesner1">[25]</xref>. Hence it is not overly surprising that Arabidopsis <italic>atr atm</italic> double mutant plants exhibit heightened disease susceptibility, even though ATM and ATR are not the sole means through which plant H2AX can be phosphorylated after pathogen infection.</p>
<p>The discovery of pathogen-induced plant DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Yao1">[present study and 29]</xref> opens intriguing avenues for future study. For example, research to pinpoint pathogenesis-induced DSB sites may reveal if preferential sites exist. Investigation of the pathogen factors or pathogen-induced plant factors that lead to infection-associated DNA damage will be a priority, and this may lend insight into disease management mechanisms that can protect the genome from the damage induced by pathogens. The subject has clear implications for improved crop productivity under conditions of biotic stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Waterworth1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004030-Balestrazzi1">[20]</xref>.</p>
