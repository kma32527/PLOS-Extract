<abstract>
<p>Competence for transformation is widespread among bacterial species. In the case of Gram-negative systems, a key step to transformation is the import of DNA across the outer membrane. Although multiple factors are known to affect DNA transport, little is known about the dynamics of DNA import. Here, we characterized the spatio-temporal dynamics of DNA import into the periplasm of <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>. DNA was imported into the periplasm at random locations around the cell contour. Subsequently, it was recruited at the septum of diplococci at a time scale that increased with DNA length. We found using fluorescent DNA that the periplasm was saturable within minutes with ∼40 kbp DNA. The DNA-binding protein ComE quantitatively governed the carrying capacity of the periplasm in a gene-dosage-dependent fashion. As seen using a fluorescent-tagged derivative protein, ComE was homogeneously distributed in the periplasm in the absence of external DNA. Upon addition of external DNA, ComE was relocalized to form discrete foci colocalized with imported DNA. We conclude that the periplasm can act as a considerable reservoir for imported DNA with ComE governing the amount of DNA stored potentially for transport through the inner membrane.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Bacterial transformation is the import and inheritable integration of external DNA. As such, it is believed to be a major evolutionary force. A key step is the import of DNA through the outer membrane. Here, we have characterized the spatio-temporal dynamics of DNA during import and residence in the periplasm of the Gram-negative pathogen <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>. We found that the periplasm can serve as a reservoir for imported DNA that can fill within five minutes by importing DNA from the environment. The amount of imported DNA roughly corresponds to the size of a phage genome. The periplasmic DNA-binding protein ComE is homogeneously distributed in the periplasm in the absence of extracellular DNA. It relocates rapidly to imported DNA when external DNA is added to competent gonococci. As ComE governs the carrying capacity of the periplasm, we propose that it might condense DNA, thus linking DNA uptake to its compaction. Although the import through the outer membrane was localized all around the cell contour, the major part of the imported DNA relocated to the septum at the center of diplococci. Our findings strongly support the idea that the periplasm masses DNA independently of transport through the inner membrane.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Natural competence for transformation is widespread among different bacterial species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Chen1">[1]</xref>. Transformation is thought to speed up adaptive evolution but it is also discussed in the context of genome maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Baltrus1">[2]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Frye1">[3]</xref>. The currently available data from Gram-positive species strongly supports the idea of a coordinated DNA transformation machine that binds DNA at the extracellular side, powers translocation of DNA through the cell envelope and hands the DNA over to the recombination machine at the intracellular side <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Maier1">[4]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Kidane1">[5]</xref>. With the only known exception of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, all characterized naturally competent species are associated with the type IV pilus (T4P) system for DNA import. At the extracellular side, T4P proteins are essential for DNA binding although it is unclear whether long pilus filaments are necessary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Chen1">[1]</xref>. Whereas DNA binding to the competence pilus has been demonstrated in <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Laurenceau1">[6]</xref>, <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> that generate non-retractile T4P show strongly impaired binding efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Aas1">[7]</xref>. In the following, the nomenclature of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> will be used to describe the proteins required for transformation. The major pilin subunit is essential for binding and import of DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Long1">[8]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Aas1">[7]</xref> but replacing the gonococcal pilin PilE by the major subunit of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> or of <italic>Fracisella tularensis</italic> supports DNA import and transformation as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-WintherLarsen1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Salomonsson1">[10]</xref>. The transformation rate is modulated by the relative levels of the minor pilins ComP. PilV acts antagonistically at the level of DNA binding with ComP increasing transformability in a dose-dependent fashion and PilV decreasing it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Aas1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Aas2">[11]</xref>. PilV appears to exert its inhibitory effects by competing with ComP for access to the Tfp assembly machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Aas2">[11]</xref>. The presence of a 12 bp DNA Uptake Sequence (DUS) strongly enhances the probability for DNA-import by <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Goodman1">[12]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Frye1">[3]</xref>. ComP binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner, selecting for DNA containing the DUS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Cehovin1">[13]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Aas1">[7]</xref>. The outer membrane channel formed by PilQ is essential for T4P extrusion and DNA import into a DNase-resistant state and moreover shows DNA-binding potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Drake1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Assalkhou1">[15]</xref>. In the periplasm, three components are linked to transformation. The DNA-binding protein ComE has four identical gene-copies on the gonococcal genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Chen2">[16]</xref>. Gradual deletion of these copies leads to gradual decrease in transformation rate by decreasing the probability for DNA import <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Chen2">[16]</xref>. The DNA-binding peptidoglycan-linked lipoprotein ComL and the lipoprotein tetrapac (Tpc) which is associated with separation of dividing diplococci are not essential for DNA uptake but for transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Facius1">[17]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Fussenegger1">[18]</xref>. ComA proteins form the channel through which DNA is transported from the periplasm to the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Facius2">[19]</xref>. In the Gram-positive species <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> it has been shown that incoming ssDNA is immediately coated by single-strand binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Kidane2">[20]</xref>. Single strand binding proteins have been proposed to generate a reservoir of ssDNA in the cytoplasm and to direct the DNA to homologous recombination in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Attaiech1">[21]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Maier1">[4]</xref>. For <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> there is evidence that ssDNA forms transiently in the periplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Chaussee1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>DNA import has been characterized at the single molecule level for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>H. pylori</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Maier2">[23]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Stingl1">[24]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Allemand1">[25]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Allemand2">[26]</xref>. DNA uptake in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> proceeds at a rate of 80 bp/s at low external forces. Application of force using laser tweezers showed that the import was irreversible for forces up to 50 pN. The speed of DNA import was considerably larger in <italic>H. pylori</italic> with 1.3 kbp/s at low force. Application of 23 pN or more triggered extrusion of the previously imported DNA here, demonstrating the import into the periplasm is reversible. Transport through the outer and the inner membrane of <italic>H. pylori</italic> are not coupled in time. <italic>H. pylori</italic> imports fluorescently labeled Cy3-DNA into the periplasm at a somewhat decreased rate relative to unlabelled DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Stingl1">[24]</xref>. Like the case of the ComEC channel based system in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, the <italic>H. pylori</italic> ComEC-based system does not support transport of Cy3-DNA into the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Stingl1">[24]</xref>, suggesting that the processes for inner membrane transport are analogous between these competent species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Kruger1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>In rod-like <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, DNA uptake complexes form at the poles or at the growing septa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Hahn1">[28]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Kidane2">[20]</xref>. They are stable even when the cell wall is disrupted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Kaufenstein1">[29]</xref>. Accordingly, DNA uptake proceeds preferentially from the cell poles. The homologue of gonococcal ComE, ComEA, distributes homogeneously around the cell contour and is thought to enhance initial DNA binding to the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Kramer1">[30]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Provvedi1">[31]</xref>. <italic>H. pylori</italic> accumulates imported Cy3-DNA primarily at the cell poles and at the septa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Stingl1">[24]</xref>. Very recently, it has been shown that competent Gram-positive <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> recruits Cy3-DNA and ComEA at midcell location <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Berge1">[32]</xref>. It is unknown, however, where DNA uptake occurs in Gram-negative cocci.</p>
<p>Here, we visualized the spatio-temporal dynamics of DNA during import from the environment into the periplasm and within the periplasm of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>. We validated the approach of using fluorescent Cy3-DNA by characterizing a number of mutant backgrounds that had been shown to be impaired for DNA uptake. We found that DNA import through the outer membrane occurred all around the cell contour. The periplasm was saturable with DNA and held a considerable amount of Cy3-DNA. With short fragments, saturation occurred on a time scale of minutes. The periplasmic DNA-binding protein ComE strongly affected the carrying capacity of the periplasm, suggesting a role in either removing DNA from the uptake machine or in compacting DNA.</p>

<title><italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> imports Cy3-DNA into a DNase-resistant state</title>
<p>To investigate whether Cy3-DNA could be used to study DNA uptake in gonococci, we incubated gonococci with a 3 kbp fragment of Cy3-DNA containing one DNA uptake sequence (DUS) for 30 min and subsequently treated them with DNase. DNA was labeled randomly along its entire contour. Throughout this work, we used a <italic>recA<sub>ind</sub></italic> background without induction to prevent the cells from antigenic variation of <italic>pilE</italic>. The <italic>recA<sub>ind</sub></italic> strain will be labeled wt in the following, since it shows wt behavior in terms of DNA import through the cell envelope. Wt cells were associated with fluorescent foci that were clearly distinguishable from the fluorescence background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004043.s001">Fig. S1a</xref>), indicating that Cy3-DNA was imported into a DNase-resistant state.</p>
<p>The minor pilins ComP and PilV have been shown to strongly affect DNA uptake at the level of DNA binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Aas1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Aas2">[11]</xref>. We investigated the effect of these minor pilins on the uptake of Cy3-DNA. We performed the DNA uptake assay in a ComP overproducing strain (<italic>P<sub>pilE</sub>comP</italic>) and in a <italic>pilV</italic> deletion strain (<italic>ΔpilV</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>). As expected, both strains showed a strongly increased fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004043.s001">Fig. S1b–d</xref>), indicating that more Cy3-DNA was imported within 30 min. Since the high signal of the <italic>ΔpilV</italic> strain was very convenient for data analysis, we performed all following experiments in this background.</p>

<p>Up until now, DNA uptake by <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> has been investigated at the population level. Therefore, it is unclear whether there is heterogeneity in this process at the level of single cells. To investigate any potential for heterogeneity, we measured the distribution of DNA uptake efficiencies of individual cells. We incubated gonococci with the 3 kbp Cy3 fragment for 30 min, treated the cells with DNase and subsequently quantified the fluorescence intensity of individual cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004043.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). We found that the distribution of fluorescence intensities was very broad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g001">Fig. 1e</xref>). A fraction of cells showed no import of DNA and this fraction was variable between different experiments. Most of the cells in our samples were diplococci. For our analysis we did not distinguish between monococci and diplococci, as the difference in the histograms was visible but small (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004043.s003">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the background level of fluorescence, we repeated the experiment using a strain with a deletion in the retraction ATPase PilT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g001">Fig. 1b</xref>) which is unable to import DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Aas1">[7]</xref>. Furthermore, we investigated a <italic>pilQ</italic> deletion strain that does not form the outer membrane pore, is deficient in DNA uptake, and shows reduced DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g001">Fig. 1c</xref>). We found that both mutations strongly shifted the distribution of fluorescence intensities to lower values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g001">Fig. 1e</xref>). Although the distributions were very broad we calculated the average fluorescence values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g001">Fig. 1f</xref>). We found that in the <italic>pilT pilV</italic> background strain, the amount of DNase-resistant Cy3-DNA was reduced by a factor of 12 as compared to the <italic>ΔpilV</italic> strain and in the <italic>ΔpilQΔpilV</italic> strain the amount of DNase-resistant Cy3-DNA was reduced by a factor of 22. The strong decrease in fluorescence is consistent with previous experiments using radioactively labeled DNA although the factors are considerably lower <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Aas1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Aas2">[11]</xref>, suggesting that the Cy3-DNA methodology has reduced sensitivity.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated whether import of Cy3-DNA into a DNase-resistant state was dependent on the putative inner membrane channel formed by ComA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g001">Fig. 1d</xref>). When repeating the DNA uptake experiment using a <italic>comA</italic> deletion strain (<italic>ΔcomAΔpilV</italic>) we found that the fluorescence distribution was not significantly different from the <italic>ΔpilV</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g001">Fig. 1e, f</xref>), indicating that the imported DNA accumulated in the periplasm. This result was analogous to what was observed previously for <italic>H. pylori</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Stingl1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>Transformation of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> depends on the DNA uptake sequence (DUS). ComP has been shown to be a positive effector of sequence-specific DNA binding and that it is directly involved in binding of DUS-containing DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Aas1">[7]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Cehovin1">[13]</xref>. The DNA uptake assay with fragments lacking the DUS showed strongly reduced fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g001">Fig. 1e, f</xref>). Thus, the uptake of Cy3-DNA was strongly enhanced by the DUS.</p>
<p>We conclude that Cy3-DNA is imported into the periplasm of gonococci and that DUS-related import is dependent on the outer membrane channel formed by PilQ and on the T4P retraction ATPase PilT, but not on the inner membrane channel ComA. Since these results are consistent with previous DNA uptake studies using radioactively labeled DNA, they validate our method for studying DNA uptake using <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> Cy3-DNA. In contrast to the classic method using radioactively labeled DNA, our approach enables us to study DNA uptake at the single cell level and thus reveals strong cell-to-cell variability in terms of the total amount of DNA imported after 30 min.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>The periplasm of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> can retain ample amounts of imported DNA</title>
<p>We investigated whether the periplasm acts as a reservoir for imported DNA. <italic>ΔpilV</italic> cells were incubated with Cy3-DNA for 1 h, treated with DNase and subsequently single cell fluorescence was measured. The total fluorescence intensity per cell did not vary when incubated with Cy3-DNA with fragment lengths of 0.3 kbp, 1 kbp, and 10 kbp at equimolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), indicating that the total amount of imported DNA was independent of fragment length. To convert fluorescence intensity into amount of DNA, we quantified the fluorescence intensity of individual 6 kbp fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004043.s004">Fig. S4</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Maier3">[33]</xref> and compared them to the total fluorescence of individual cells that were incubated with Cy3-DNA from the same labeling reaction for 1 h. We found that the periplasm contained ∼40 kbp of Cy3-DNA. We note that this value might be biased slightly by binding of proteins to the DNA in the periplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Hwang1">[34]</xref>. Furthermore, the Cy3-labeling efficiency is somewhat variable and therefore the fluorescence intensity cannot be directly compared to other experiments using different Cy3-DNA stocks.</p>

<p>Next, we addressed the question whether the periplasm can be saturated with taken up DNA. To this end, we incubated gonococci for 1 h with unlabeled genomic DNA (gDNA) or 3 kbp fragments containing DUS, washed the cells, subsequently incubated them with 3 kbp Cy3-DNA for 30 min and finally treated them with DNase. We found that the distribution of fluorescence intensities was clearly shifted towards lower values when cells were pre-incubated with DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>), indicating that ample amounts of DNA remain within the periplasm during at least 30 min. Deletion of the inner membrane channel ComA did not affect saturation strongly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>). For averaging over the fluctuations in the histogram, we integrated over the distribution of single cell fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g003">Fig. 3 c,d</xref>). This cumulative histogram shows the fraction of cells with fluorescence intensity (FU) up to a given value. Furthermore, we examined the stability and integrity of the imported DNA. Cells were incubated with unlabeled 10 kbp fragments for 1 h, subsequently treated with DNase, and further incubated for various periods of time. Exploiting a protocol recently developed for <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Suckow1">[35]</xref>, we used duplex PCR with primer pairs against the newly imported 10 kbp fragment and against gDNA of gonococci. We found that the 3 kbp DNA fragments amplified from the imported DNA were clearly detectable even after 60 min after DNase treatment in <italic>ΔpilV</italic> and <italic>ΔpilV ΔcomA</italic> backgrounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004043.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). Using wt, the 3 kbp DNA fragments were still detectable after 30 min. Since the signal was lower for wt cells, we did not attempt to amplify DNA at later time points.</p>

<p>DNA turnover in the periplasm may occur as a consequence of dilution due to cell division, degradation, or export. To address turnover, we incubated cells with Cy3-DNA for 1 h, washed them, and subsequently incubated them for a period of 1 h either in the presence or in the absence of unlabeled DNA. We found that the distribution of fluorescence intensities shifted towards lower values independent of ComA after incubation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004043.s006">Fig. S6</xref> a, b), indicating that turnover occurred and was independent of transport through the inner membrane.</p>
<p>Together, these data show that DNA import through the outer membrane occurs independently of inner membrane transport and that large amounts of DNA can be amassed in the periplasm over a time scale of hours.</p>

<title>ComE quantitatively increases the total amount of Cy3-DNA imported into the periplasm</title>
<p>It has been shown previously that ComE is necessary for DNA uptake into a DNAse-resistant state and transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Chen2">[16]</xref>. We investigated whether ComE acted by increasing the carrying capacity of the periplasm or by speeding up DNA import. To this end, we generated isogenic backgrounds varying in <italic>comE</italic> copy number. Since the amount of imported Cy3-DNA was similar for the backgrounds with four and three copies and for one or no <italic>comE</italic> copies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004043.s007">Fig. S7</xref>), we concentrated on strains with two (<italic>ΔcomE<sub>34</sub></italic>) versus no (<italic>ΔcomE<sub>1234</sub></italic>) alleles in the following. In a first set of experiments, we incubated <italic>ΔpilV</italic> cells with 3 kbp DNA for variable amounts of time before treating them with DNase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g005">Fig. 5 a,b</xref>). Comparing the patterns formed in <italic>ΔpilV</italic> and <italic>ΔcomE<sub>34</sub>ΔpilV</italic> at various time points did not reveal a striking difference. For example, at 1 h both mutants showed multiple foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g005">Fig. 5 c, d</xref>). The kinetics could be well described by a single exponential function <italic>FU(t) = FU<sub>max</sub>(1−exp(−t/τ))</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g005">Fig. 5e</xref>). In the <italic>ΔcomE<sub>34</sub>ΔpilV</italic> strain, that carries two copies of the <italic>comE</italic> gene, the capacity was decreased by a factor of ∼3 as compared to the <italic>ΔpilV</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g005">Fig. 5g</xref>). The complete <italic>comE</italic> deletion strain <italic>ΔcomE<sub>1234</sub>ΔpilV</italic> showed a decrease of fluorescence intensity by a factor of ∼24. This reduction is similar to the reduction in a <italic>pilQ</italic> deletion strain in agreement with ComE being necessary for DNA uptake. We note, however, that residual fluorescence was observed in some cells. The characteristic time to saturation was τ = (100±17) min in <italic>ΔpilV</italic>. If ComE would enhance the speed of DNA import, then we would expect that reduction of the ComE concentration leads to an increase in the characteristic time. Instead, we observed a decrease to τ = (62±12) min in <italic>ΔcomE<sub>34</sub>ΔpilV</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g005">Fig. 5f</xref>).</p>

<p>Since we found that ComE increased the carrying capacity of the periplasm, we tested whether ComE was necessary for importing very short DNA fragments of 100 nm. Since Cy3-DNA import showed saturation within minutes, we quantified single cell fluorescence in real-time during incubation with 300 bp Cy3-DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). We found that Cy3-DNA import of short fragments was dependent on ComE. A full <italic>comE</italic> null mutant did not show any increase in fluorescence, indicating that ComE was essential for Cy3-DNA import.

<title>ComE-mCherry relocalizes to DNA-foci</title>
<p>As Cy3-DNA was not homogeneously distributed within the periplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), we investigated whether the periplasmic DNA-binding protein ComE co-localized with DNA.

<p>In the next step, we incubated the <italic>comE-mcherry ΔpilV</italic> cells with 3 kbp Cy5-DNA for 15 min. The distribution of mCherry-fluorescence became spotty, often revealing distinct foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g007">Fig. 7b, c</xref>), reminiscent of the fluorescence pattern generated by imported Cy5-DNA. The patterns of Cy5-DNA and ComE-mCherry were highly correlated, indicating co-localization between ComE and imported DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g007">Fig. 7 b, c</xref>). Most cells that had little or no Cy5-DNA signal retained their ring-like ComE-mCherry fluorescence (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g007">Fig. 7 b</xref> inset).</p>
<p>In summary, ComE-mCherry is homogenously distributed in the periplasm in the absence of transforming DNA. Imported DNA forms foci in the periplasm and co-localization of ComE indicates that the periplasmic DNA interacts with ComE.</p>

<title>Spatio-temporal dynamics of Cy3-DNA foci and ComE-mCherry in the periplasm</title>
<p>We investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of the foci/spotty pattern of Cy3-DNA in the periplasm. To determine the initial location of Cy3-DNA after import, we acquired a time lapse of 10 kbp Cy3-DNA import. Individual 6 kbp Cy3-fragments are clearly visible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004043.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). Indeed, we observed the successive appearance of well-defined fluorescent spots correlated with a step-wise increase of fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g008">Fig. 8 a–d</xref>). These foci showed little movement over a time scale of 60 min (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004043.s010">Movies S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004043.s011">S3</xref>). To investigate whether there was a preferred location of DNA import (as reported for <italic>B. subtilis</italic>), we projected the location of initial occurrence to the major axis of a diplococcus and normalized this distance to the cell length (1 min time resolution). Only diplococci were analysed in order to find the location relative to the septum. We found no preferred location of DNA uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g008">Fig. 8e</xref>). Using DNA that was labeled with the reversibly intercalating dye YOYO, we repeated the experiment.

Spontaneously, the fluorescence accumulated to form a focus whereas the fluorescence in the reminder of the cell decayed. The intensity of the focus increased for ∼10 min and was then stable. At 18 min a second focus appeared again taking ∼15 min to reach its maximum intensity. This second focus was stable for another 30 min. Monococci also formed stable multiple foci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004043.s013">Movie S5</xref>).

For different Cy3-DNA fragments, we found foci around the cell contour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004043-g010">Fig. 10a</xref>).

<title>Putative role of the periplasmic protein ComE</title>
<p>We have shown that ComE-mCherry is homogeneously distributed within the periplasm in the absence of transforming DNA, i.e. after DNase treatment and prolonged incubation in liquid culture. When harvested without DNase treatment, a fraction of cells showed foci that were mostly at the septa between cocci. This finding strongly suggests that gonococci accumulate DNA presumably released by lysis of siblings or by secretion in the periplasm while growing in microcolonies. Most importantly, upon addition of Cy5-DNA, ComE-mCherry localized to the Cy5-DNA foci. These experiments demonstrate that ComE is free to move within the periplasm and is captured by periplasmic DNA. While this manuscript was in revision, it has been reported that the homolog ComEA-mCherry diffuses rapidly in the periplasm of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and co-localizes with YOYO-DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Seitz1">[36]</xref>. Together with experiments showing that expression of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae-comE</italic> can restore functionality in a <italic>V. cholerae-comEA</italic> deletion mutation, ComE-dependent DNA-import into the periplasm can be considered a general mechanism for Gram-negative competent species. Our data further show that association of ComE-mCherry with Cy5-DNA is not a transient phenomenon but that ComE remains associated with periplasmic DNA. Interestingly, the homologue of ComE in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, ComEA, is the only known competence protein that does not localize to the cell pole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Hahn1">[28]</xref>. It has been suggested, that ComEA molecules sequester DNA all around the cell shuffling the DNA to the site of DNA uptake where the rate-limiting step of DNA import occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Kaufenstein1">[29]</xref>. Similarly, in gonococci ComE is likely to compact DNA and to increase the capacity of the periplasmic reservoir.</p>
<p>Indeed, we found that ComE quantitatively governed the carrying capacity of the periplasm. Since the length of the imported DNA fragments did not influence the carrying capacity, we conclude that the ComE concentration is a limiting factor for the amount of DNA that the periplasm can hold. With a height of ∼20 nm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Berry1">[37]</xref> and a cell radius of ∼0.4 µm, the periplasm has a volume of ∼3·10<sup>−5</sup> µm<sup>3</sup>. Considering a 10 kbp DNA fragment and assuming no excluded volume interactions, the volume of the statistical coil with a radius of gyration of 235 nm assumes ∼5·10<sup>−2</sup> µm<sup>3</sup>, indicating that energy must be spent for packaging the DNA. To assess whether the function of ComE is to package the DNA, we incubated gonococci with DNA fragments of the order of the Kuhn segment length of 100 nm (300 bp). The Kuhn segment length is a measure for the stiffness of the polymer, in other words it describes over which length the polymer can be bent by Brownian motion. We found, however, that ComE was essential for the import of 300 bp fragments into the periplasm. Mechanistically, we propose that during DNA import, DNA binds weakly to the machine that pulls the DNA through the outer membrane. To render the import irreversible ComE binds to the incoming DNA and hinders its backward movement, generating a translocation ratchet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Allemand2">[26]</xref>. Additionally, ComE might compact the DNA beyond its Kuhn segment length of 100 nm.</p>

<title>Spatio-temporal dynamics of DNA import and maintenance within the periplasm</title>
<p>Using DNA fragments with a length of 10 kbp, we found that Cy3-DNA foci occurred at random locations around the cell contour. As the time resolution of our time-lapse acquisition was 1 min, this location most likely coincides with the location of import through the outer membrane. The 10 kbp DNA fragments did not show strong mobility over the period of 30 min. The stochastic distribution of DNA import complexes correlates with the distribution of T4P in gonococci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Holz1">[38]</xref>, supporting the idea that DNA directly interacts with components of the T4P system. However, we did not observe T4P-like structures coated with Cy3-DNA during real-time experiments. Therefore, we cannot draw conclusions about the potential role of T4P fibers directly in DNA uptake. This result strongly suggests that multiple DNA import complexes exist and are distributed around the cell contour. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>H. pylori</italic>, DNA import was found to be localized either to the cell pole or to the septum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Hahn1">[28]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Chen2">[16]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Stingl1">[24]</xref>. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, one or two DNA import complexes or accumulations of the latter were stable even when the cell wall was dissolved resulting in cellular deformation to a round morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Kaufenstein1">[29]</xref>. Mostly single T4P pili were found in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> that were randomly located around the cell contour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Seitz2">[39]</xref>. Here, we found that DNA was imported from multiple sites in a single bacterium. We speculate that bacteria that use T4P uniquely for DNA import may form a single pilus, whereas <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> is a peritrichously piliated bacterium in agreement with multiple DNA import sites reported here.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when cells were incubated with 3 kbp Cy3-DNA and subsequently with unlabeled DNA, Cy3-DNA foci tended to move to septa of diplococci. These dynamics were observed only in the presence of unlabeled transforming DNA. Similar central accumulations were observed with 300 bp Cy3-DNA after several minutes. One possible explanation would be that newly incoming DNA pushes the previously imported DNA away from the sites of DNA uptake. The local accumulation of periplasmic DNA is somewhat reminiscent of DNA-filled membrane blebs that have been termed “transformasome” in <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Kahn1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Barouki1">[41]</xref>. In TEM-images these membrane-blebs were found at a 10× increased frequency in competent versus non-competent <italic>H. influenzae</italic>. These sites were proposed to be the sites of DNA-import.</p>
<p>The lipoprotein Tetrapac (Tpc) is essential for transformation and deletion of this putative murein hydrolase shows a severe defect in cell separation generating tetrapacs instead of diplococci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Fussenegger1">[18]</xref>. It is reasonable to assume that Tpc acts at the septum by hydrolyzing the cell wall. Periplasmic DNA would then be trapped at the septum location where Tpc degrades the cell wall. Furthermore, DNA was shown to bind to FtsE which is believed to be involved in cell division through interaction with FtsZ which localizes to the septum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Lang1">[42]</xref>. Very recently, it has been shown that the pneumococcal EndA nuclease localizes to the midcell upon induction of competence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Berge1">[32]</xref>. Interestingly, fluorescently labeled Cy3-DNA also localized to the midcell of competent pneumococci, suggesting that active uptake occurs at this location. Furthermore, they found that midcell localization was independent of <italic>comEC</italic> expression in agreement with our finding that midcell localization was independent of <italic>comA</italic>. It is tempting to speculate that recruitment of DNA to the site of future cell division is a general property of competent cocci although it is currently unclear whether this accumulation is linked to DNA transport through the inner membrane.</p>

<title>Power and limitations of the Cy3-DNA approach</title>
<p>Here we have introduced a novel approach for studying the spatio-temporal dynamics of DNA import in Gram-negative species at the single cell level. So far, DNA import has been mostly studied at the population level. We have verified that the static properties agree with previous reports using radioactively labeled DNA, including the effect of the outer membrane pore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Aas1">[7]</xref>, the inner membrane channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Facius1">[17]</xref>, the minor pilins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Aas1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Aas2">[11]</xref>, and the periplasmic proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Chen2">[16]</xref>. We have previously quantified the effect of Cy3-labels on the speed of DNA-import in <italic>H. pylori</italic> and found that the import speed was decreased by a factor of ∼2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Stingl1">[24]</xref>. Considering that DNA import depends on the pore formed by PilQ and that its inner opening is wide enough to allow translocation of the type IV pilus, we do not expect that the speed of DNA import is strongly influenced by the Cy3-label. One clear limitation of our approach is the fact that Cy3-DNA is not transported into the cytoplasm and as a consequence, transport through the inner membrane cannot be characterized. However, we performed saturation experiments using unlabeled DNA, to verify that accumulation of DNA in the periplasm is not caused by Cy3-labeling. When cells were pre-incubated with unlabeled genomic DNA or with PCR-fragments for 1 h, the fluorescence signal obtained after subsequent incubation with Cy3-DNA was strongly reduced. This experiment verifies that massing of DNA within the periplasm occurs with unlabeled DNA and is not caused by Cy3. Moreover, ComE-mCherry foci formed after treatment with unlabeled transforming DNA and were stable for up to 30 min. This experiment further supports the claim that stable periplasmic DNA foci are not caused by Cy3-labeling. Previous experiments with <italic>H. pylori</italic> showed that YOYO-DNA was imported into the periplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Stingl1">[24]</xref>. Here, we found YOYO-DNA binding to the gonococcal surface, but the signal was lost upon DNase treatment (data not shown). This finding might be caused either by rapid formation of ssDNA in the periplasm, by expulsion of the dye from dsDNA due to DNA compaction in the periplasm, or by quenching.</p>
<p>Most experiments were performed in a <italic>pilV</italic> deletion background to facilitate imaging. This strain has been reported to show a strong increase in the level of both DUS-specific DNA uptake and in the rate of transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Aas2">[11]</xref>. Thus, transport through the inner membrane is not the only bottleneck for transformation and the accumulation of DNA in the periplasm is not likely to be caused by <italic>pilV</italic> deletion. Our experiments show that the gonococcal periplasm is saturable with DNA in a ComE-dependent manner, but it remains unclear, whether the wt reaches saturation. However, within biofilms, gonococci are surrounded by a large amount of genomic DNA and a high abundance of DUS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Steichen1">[43]</xref>. Being continuously exposed to large amounts of DUS containing DNA and potentially dividing at a much lower rate, it is conceivable, that saturation is achieved by the wild type in biofilms. In our experiments, the Cy3-DNA fragments contained only a single DUS, however the deletion of <italic>pilV</italic> increases DUS-dependent binding and uptake, so using the <italic>pilV</italic> mutant in our experimental setup is most likely mechanistically not very different to the wildtype situation in biofilms. Concerning the molecular mechanism of DNA import, the <italic>pilV</italic> strain is not different to that seen in wt backgrounds as DNA import depends on <italic>pilE</italic>, <italic>pilT</italic>, DUS, and on assembled pili <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004043-Aas2">[11]</xref>. In wt gonocoocci, the distribution of DNA-foci was similar to the <italic>ΔpilV</italic> background and imported DNA was stable as well. All things considered, we propose that Cy3-labeling of DNA is a useful tool for studying the spatio-temporal dynamics of DNA import into the periplasm.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our results support the following spatio-temporal dynamics of DNA uptake. DNA transport through the outer membrane is powered by DNA uptake complexes that are randomly distributed over the cellular contour. The periplasmic DNA-binding protein ComE is homogeneously distributed in the periplasm in the absence of DNA. Upon contact with periplasmic DNA, it relocalizes to foci formed by DNA. The carrying capacity of the gonococcal periplasm for DNA depends on ComE in a gene-dosage-dependent fashion. Nanomanipulation experiments will be necessary to investigate whether ComE has an additional role in directly driving DNA-import through the outer membrane. When external DNA is present, the periplasmic DNA is relocated to septa of diplococci. It is tempting to speculate that midcell/septum location of transport through the cytoplasmic membrane is conserved between Gram-positive and Gram-negative cocci. It will be interesting to assess whether the location of inner membrane transport is at the septum.</p>

<title>DNA-labeling</title>
<p>The covalent attachment of Cy3 and Cy5 dyes to DNA was achieved with the help of the <italic>Label IT Nucleic Acid Labeling Kits</italic> (Mirus). According to the manufacturer, the Label IT reagent is bound by a reactive alkylating group to any reactive heteroatom of the DNA without altering the structure of the nucleic acid. The labeling reagent, labeling buffer and 5 µg of DNA were mixed in Milli-Q-H<sub>2</sub>O to a total volume of 50 µl according to the manufacturer's protocol with a 1∶1 (v/w) ratio of Label IT reagent to DNA. The incubation time at 37°C was elongated to 2 h to improve the labeling density. The samples were purified subsequently by using the provided microspin columns. For comparative quantifications, only labeled DNA from the same labelling reaction was used. YOYO-1-iodide (<italic>Invitrogen</italic>) is a dimeric cyanine with a highly specific affinity to bind to DNA. Due to its structure, it can easily intercalate between single base pairs, modifying the DNA less than covalently attached dyes. We used a dye∶bp ratio of 1∶50. For this, 1 µg of DNA in 10 µl Milli-Q-H<sub>2</sub>O was mixed with 0.3 µl of a freshly diluted 0.1 mM YOYO solution in Milli-Q-H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
