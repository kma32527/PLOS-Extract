<abstract>
<p>Replication of plus-strand RNA viruses depends on recruited host factors that aid several critical steps during replication. Several of the co-opted host factors bind to the viral RNA, which plays multiple roles, including mRNA function, as an assembly platform for the viral replicase (VRC), template for RNA synthesis, and encapsidation during infection. It is likely that remodeling of the viral RNAs and RNA-protein complexes during the switch from one step to another requires RNA helicases. In this paper, we have discovered a second group of cellular RNA helicases, including the eIF4AIII-like yeast Fal1p and the DDX5-like Dbp3p and the orthologous plant AtRH2 and AtRH5 DEAD box helicases, which are co-opted by tombusviruses. Unlike the previously characterized DDX3-like AtRH20/Ded1p helicases that bind to the 3′ terminal promoter region in the viral minus-strand (−)RNA, the other class of eIF4AIII-like RNA helicases bind to a different <italic>cis</italic>-acting element, namely the 5′ proximal RIII(−) replication enhancer (REN) element in the TBSV (−)RNA. We show that the binding of AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases to the TBSV (−)RNA could unwind the dsRNA structure within the RIII(−) REN. This unique characteristic allows the eIF4AIII-like helicases to perform novel pro-viral functions involving the RIII(−) REN in stimulation of plus-strand (+)RNA synthesis. We also show that AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases are components of the tombusvirus VRCs based on co-purification experiments. We propose that eIF4AIII-like helicases destabilize dsRNA replication intermediate within the RIII(−) REN that promotes bringing the 5′ and 3′ terminal (−)RNA sequences in close vicinity via long-range RNA-RNA base pairing. This newly formed RNA structure promoted by eIF4AIII helicase together with AtRH20 helicase might facilitate the recycling of the viral replicases for multiple rounds of (+)-strand synthesis, thus resulting in asymmetrical viral replication.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Genome-wide screens for host factors affecting tombusvirus replication in yeast indicated that subverted cellular RNA helicases likely play major roles in virus replication. Tombusviruses do not code for their own helicases and they might recruit host RNA helicases to aid their replication in infected cells. Accordingly, in this paper, the authors show that the yeast eIF4AIII-like Fal1p and Dbp3p and the orthologous plant AtRH2 and AtRH5 DEAD-box helicases are co-opted by <italic>Tomato bushy stunt virus</italic> (TBSV) to aid viral replication. The authors find that eIF4AIII-like helicases bind to the replication enhancer element (REN) in the viral (−)RNA and they promote (+)-strand TBSV RNA synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic>. Data show that eIF4AIII-like helicases are present in the viral replicase complex and they bind to the replication proteins. In addition, the authors show synergistic effect between eIF4AIII-like helicases and the previously identified DDX3-like Ded1p/AtRH20 DEAD box helicases, which bind to a different <italic>cis</italic>-acting region in the viral (−)RNA, on stimulation of plus-strand synthesis. In summary, the authors find that two different groups of cellular helicases promote TBSV replication via selectively enhancing (+)-strand synthesis through different mechanisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Host factors co-opted for replication of plus-stranded (+)RNA viruses are critical in each step of the well-orchestrated infection process. After translation of the viral mRNA-sense genomic RNA(s), the viral (+)RNA and the viral replication proteins together with host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are recruited to the site of viral replication in membranous cellular compartments. Ultimately, the process leads to the assembly of the membrane-bound viral replicase complexes (VRCs), followed by the activation of the polymerase function of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and initiation of complementary RNA synthesis on the viral (+)RNA template <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Nagy1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Belov1">[4]</xref>. Subsequent (+)-strand synthesis in the VRCs takes place in an asymmetric manner, producing excess amounts of (+)-strand progeny, which is released from replication to participate in encapsidation, cell-to-cell movement and other viral processes.</p>
<p>Although the roles of host factors in facilitating the replication process of (+)RNA viruses have been extensively characterized in recent years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Nagy1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Nagy2">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Nagy3">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-deCastro1">[11]</xref>, our current understanding of the role of cellular RBPs, which constitute one of the largest groups of host factors identified is incomplete <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Nagy1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Li1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Ogram1">[13]</xref>. The co-opted RBPs likely affect several steps in viral RNA replication, including viral (+)RNA recruitment, stabilization of the viral RNA, VRC assembly and viral RNA synthesis.</p>
<p><italic>Tomato bushy stunt virus</italic> (TBSV) is a plant RNA virus with a single ∼4,800 nt genomic RNA and has two essential replication proteins, p33 and p92<sup>pol</sup>, required for TBSV replicon (rep)RNA replication in yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) model host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Panavas1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Panaviene1">[15]</xref>. The membrane-bound tombusvirus VRC contains p33 and p92<sup>pol</sup>, and the tombusviral (+)repRNA, which serves both as a template and as a platform during VRC assembly and activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Panaviene2">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Wu1">[20]</xref>. Interestingly, the tombusvirus VRC contains at least seven host proteins as resident members, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, encoded by <italic>TDH2</italic> and <italic>TDH3</italic> in yeast) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Wang1">[21]</xref>, the heat shock protein 70 chaperones (Hsp70, Ssa1/2p in yeast) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Wang2">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Serva1">[25]</xref>, pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc1p) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Serva1">[25]</xref>, Cdc34p E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Li2">[26]</xref>, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Li3">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Li4">[28]</xref>, eEF1Bγ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Sasvari1">[29]</xref>, and Ded1p DEAD-box helicase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Kovalev1">[30]</xref>. The VRC also contains two temporary resident proteins, Pex19p shuttle protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Pathak2">[31]</xref> and the Vps23p adaptor ESCRT protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Li4">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Barajas1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Barajas2">[33]</xref>. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed that the cellular Hsp70, eEF1A and Vps23p are involved in the assembly of the VRC, while the functions of host RBPs, such as eEF1A, eEF1Bγ, GAPDH and Ded1p, are to regulate viral RNA synthesis by the VRC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Nagy2">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Wang1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Pogany2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Sasvari1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Kovalev1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Nagy6">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>In spite of our growing understanding of TBSV replication and TBSV-host interaction, many questions remain. Indeed, multiple genome-wide screens and global proteomics approaches with TBSV using yeast as host identified ∼500 host factors, which interact with viral replication proteins or affect TBSV replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Serva1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Li2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Li4">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Nagy6">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Mendu1">[38]</xref>. Among the host proteins identified are 11 host ATP-dependent RNA helicases out of 39 known yeast helicases that could be involved in TBSV replication. DEAD-box proteins constitute the largest family of RNA helicases, which perform ATP-dependent RNA duplex unwinding, RNA folding, remodeling of RNA-protein complexes, and RNA clamping in cells. DEAD-box helicases are involved in all aspects of cellular metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Linder1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Cordin1">[41]</xref> and affect replication of many viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Ranji1">[42]</xref>, including plant RNA viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Huang1">[43]</xref>. Plant RNA helicases are also implicated in plant responses to abiotic stress and pathogen infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Umate1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Dalmay1">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>The many cellular RNA helicases identified in TBSV screens are intriguing because, tombusviruses and other small RNA viruses do not code for their own helicases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Koonin1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Zuniga1">[48]</xref>. These viruses likely recruit host helicases in order to facilitate viral replication. The best-characterized member of the helicase family involved in tombusvirus replication is the yeast Ded1p (the human DDX3-like) and the similar plant AtRH20 DEAD-box helicases, both of which promote (+)-strand synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Kovalev1">[30]</xref>. Ded1p and AtRH20 bind to the 3′-end of the TBSV minus-strand RNA, making the promoter sequence accessible to p92<sup>pol</sup> for initiation of (+)-strand RNA synthesis. Additional characterization of Ded1p and the similar yeast Dbp2p (similar to human p68) DEAD-box helicases revealed that these helicases play major and overlapping roles in (+)-strand synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Kovalev1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Kovalev2">[49]</xref>. Altogether, the identification of 11 yeast RNA helicases involved in tombusvirus replication suggests that tombusviruses likely co-opt a number of host RNA helicases and these helicases might have a number of unique functions in viral replication.</p>
<p>In this paper, we characterized the novel pro-viral functions of two yeast RNA helicases, which were among those identified in previous screens, and their plant orthologs in TBSV replication. We found that the yeast Dbp3p (DEAD box protein 3, human DDX5-like) and Fal1p (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4AIII-like) DEAD box helicases, which are involved in ribosome biogenesis in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Weaver1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Alexandrov1">[52]</xref>, and the orthologous <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RH2 and RH5 helicases bind to a critical replication enhancer element (REN) present in a 5′ proximal region of the TBSV minus-strand RNA. We show that these cellular helicases can locally unwind the double-stranded (ds) structure within the REN of the replication intermediate <italic>in vitro</italic>. These activities by the host helicases enhance <italic>in vitro</italic> replication and plus-strand RNA synthesis, and the accumulation of TBSV RNA in yeast and plants. We also demonstrate that AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases work synergistically with the DDX3-like AtRH20 helicase (that binds to the 3′ promoter sequence) to facilitate plus-strand synthesis in an asymmetric manner. Altogether, these co-opted host DEAD box helicases greatly enhance TBSV replication by interacting with the viral (−)RNA and the replication proteins within the VRCs.</p>

<title>Overexpression of yeast eIF4AIII-like Fal1p or Dbp3p DEAD-box RNA helicases and the orthologous plant AtRH2 and DDX5-like AtRH5 helicases enhances TBSV RNA replication in yeast and plants</title>
<p>To characterize the functions of host RNA helicases in TBSV replication, first we overexpressed 5 yeast RNA helicases in yeast and tested their effects on TBSV replicon (rep)RNA accumulation via Northern blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004051.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). These helicases were chosen from the 11 previously identified yeast helicases from several complementary high throughput screens using yeast and tombusviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Li2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Li4">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Panavas2">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Jiang1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Mendu1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-ShahNawazUlRehman1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-ShahNawazUlRehman2">[54]</xref>. Overexpression of all 5 host RNA helicases increased TBSV accumulation, with the yeast Dbp3p showing the highest (over 2-fold increase) stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004051.s001">Fig. S1A–B</xref>). The overexpression of these host helicases did not affect the accumulation of p33 replication protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004051.s001">Fig. S1A–B</xref>), suggesting that the effects of this group of RNA helicases are not through increased translation of viral replication proteins. Altogether, the observed 30-to-140% increase in TBSV RNA accumulation due to overexpression of these yeast helicases is significant since overexpression of most yeast proteins nonspecifically reduces TBSV accumulation by 20–30% as demonstrated before based on individual overexpression of 5,500 yeast proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Li2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-ShahNawazUlRehman2">[54]</xref>. Thus, these helicases likely play stimulatory roles in TBSV replication.</p>
<p>For additional in-depth studies, we have selected the yeast Dbp3p and the highly similar Fal1p (human eIF4AIII-like) together with the orthologous <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtRH2 (Fal1p ortholog and human eIF4AIII-like) and AtRH5 (Dbp3p ortholog, human DDX5-like) helicases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Umate1">[44]</xref>]. Overexpression of AtRH2 and AtRH5 stimulated (up to 3-fold increase) TBSV repRNA accumulation in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The stimulation of tombusvirus accumulation (we used <italic>Cucumber necrosis virus</italic>, CNV, which is very closely related to TBSV) was also robust in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> host plants when AtRH2 and AtRH5 RNA helicases were overexpressed (up to ∼2-fold increase in tombusvirus genomic RNA accumulation, and ∼6-fold increase in subgenomic RNA2 accumulation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, lanes 1–4 and 9–12 versus 5–8), suggesting that these cellular helicases are important host factors. While overexpression of AtRH2 and AtRH5 did not affect the phenotype of uninoculated <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants, the tombusvirus-induced symptoms were intensified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) and the symptoms appeared faster (not shown), when compared with the control host plants not overexpressing the AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases. Simultaneous co-overexpression of AtRH2 and AtRH5 increased tombusvirus replication by up to 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, lanes 13–16), similar to the level obtained with individual overexpression of AtRH2 and AtRH5. Also, the symptoms induced by tombusvirus infection in plants with co-overexpression of AtRH2 and AtRH5 were comparable to those induced by the individual overexpression of AtRH2 and AtRH5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that AtRH2 and AtRH5 play comparable and overlapping functions in tombusvirus replication. Overall, the host helicase overexpression studies in yeast and plant established that AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases and the orthologous yeast Dbp3p and Fal1p helicases could support increased level of tombusvirus RNA replication in host cells.</p>

<p>(A) Expression of AtRH2 and AtRH5 in yeast (BY4741) enhances TBSV repRNA accumulation. Top panel: Replication of the TBSV repRNA was measured by Northern blotting 14 h after initiation of TBSV replication. The accumulation level of repRNA was normalized based on the ribosomal (r)RNA. Each sample is obtained from different yeast colonies. Middle and bottom panels: The accumulation levels of His<sub>6</sub>-AtRH2 and His<sub>6</sub>-AtRH5 and FLAG-p33 were tested by Western blotting and total protein loading is shown by SDS-PAGE. Each experiment was repeated twice. (B) Expression of AtRH2 and AtRH5 were done separately or together in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves by agroinfiltration. The same leaves were co-infiltrated with <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> carrying a plasmid to launch <italic>Cucumber necrosis virus</italic> (CNV, a close relative of TBSV) replication from the 35S promoter. The control samples were obtained from leaves expressing no proteins (lanes 5–8). Total RNA was extracted from leaves 2.5 days after agroinfiltration that launched CNV replication. The accumulation of CNV gRNA and subgenomic (sg)RNAs in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves was measured by Northern blotting (Top panel). The ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was used as a loading control and shown in agarose gel stained with ethidium-bromide (bottom panel).</p>

<p>Importantly, binding of AtRH2, AtRH5 and the yeast Dbp3p and Fal1p to the TBSV RIII(−) REN element is a novel feature for co-opted host helicases. Indeed, the previously characterized AtRH20 and the yeast Ded1p and Dbp2p DEAD-box helicases bound the most efficiently to RI(−) sequence carrying the plus-strand initiation promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g003">Fig. 3D</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g002">3C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Kovalev1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Kovalev2">[49]</xref>.

<title>AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases unwind double-stranded RNA structures within the viral replication enhancer region</title>
<p>The efficient binding of AtRH2, AtRH5 and the yeast Dbp3p and Fal1p to the RIII(−) REN region indicates that these helicases might facilitate the unwinding of RNA structures within the RIII(−) REN during replication. Therefore, we tested if recombinant AtRH2 and AtRH5 could unwind partial RNA duplexes, which are known to hinder RdRp-driven RNA synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Stork1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Panavas5">[59]</xref>.

The failure to unwind this partial duplex by Ded1p and AtRH20 is likely due to the preference of these helicases to bind the RI(−) sequence of the tombusvirus RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Kovalev1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Kovalev2">[49]</xref>.

<p>We found that addition of purified recombinant AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases to the purified tombusvirus replicase (obtained from Fal1p depleted yeast) programmed with the DI-72 (−)repRNA stimulated (+)-strand synthesis by up to 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, lanes 2 versus 3 and 7 versus 8). Interestingly, AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases stimulated the production of both full-length (+)-strand repRNA product (via <italic>de novo</italic> initiation) and the 3′-terminal extension product (3′TEX; due to initiation of complementary RNA synthesis by self-priming from the 3′ end of the template, instead of <italic>de novo</italic> initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Panavas6">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Nagy8">[62]</xref>). This is in contrast with AtRH20 and Ded1p helicases, which stimulated the production of mostly full-length (+)-strand repRNA product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, lanes 4 and 9) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Kovalev1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Kovalev2">[49]</xref>. Time-course experiments with the purified tombusvirus replicase and a minimal template carrying RI(−) and RIII(−) REN sequences confirmed that AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases stimulated the production of both full-length (+)-strand RNA and 3′TEX products by ∼two-fold at both early and late time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the stimulation of RNA synthesis by AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases is lost when we used a (−)repRNA lacking 5′ sequences including RIII(−) REN region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>, lanes 3–4 versus 1). This is in contrast with AtRH20, which was able to stimulate the tombusvirus replicase activity on this template RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>, lane 2). This observation was confirmed in <italic>in vitro</italic> time-course experiments with the purified tombusvirus replicase and a template lacking RIII(−) REN by showing the absence of stimulation of RNA synthesis products by AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases at both early and late time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases depend on RIII(−) REN to facilitate the overall efficiency of template use and RNA synthesis on the (−)RNA template by the tombusvirus replicase.</p>
<p>To test if AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases could also stimulate RNA synthesis by the tombusvirus replicase on dsRNA templates, which are formed during TBSV replication (Kovalev et al, in press), we used partial dsRNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>).

<p>To further study the roles of AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases in TBSV replication, we used whole cell extracts (CFE) prepared from yeast containing temperature-sensitive (ts) Fal1p and lacking Dbp3p to support cell-free TBSV replication.

This is in contrast with (−)RNA synthesis (represented by dsRNA product), which was unchanged when the CFE was prepared from dbp3Δ/ts-fal1 yeast versus wt yeast.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Replication of (+)RNA viruses is performed by viral replicases (VRCs), which are membrane-bound ribonucleic acid-protein complexes (RNP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Belov1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Li1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Mine1">[65]</xref>. The VRCs likely have to remodel viral RNA structures, including the dsRNA formed during replication. In addition, the viral RNA plays multiple roles, such as template for translation and RNA synthesis, and as a VRC assembly platform and the viral RNA also becomes encapsidated during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-denBoon1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Belov1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Wu2">[66]</xref>. It is likely that remodeling of the viral RNAs and RNP complexes during the switch from one step to another requires RNA helicases or RNA chaperones. While the larger RNA viruses over 6,000 nt genome-size all code for RNA helicase-like proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Koonin1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Zuniga1">[48]</xref>, small RNA viruses usually do not code for RNA helicases. However, the small RNA viruses likely co-opt cellular RNA helicases during infections as shown for TBSV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Kovalev1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Kovalev2">[49]</xref>. The yeast DDX3-like Ded1p and the orthologous plant AtRH20 helicases are recruited for TBSV replication to promote (+)-strand RNA synthesis by aiding initiation by the viral RdRp. However, genome-wide screens and global proteomics approaches with TBSV have identified 11 host helicases, suggesting that several host helicases might be co-opted during TBSV infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Li4">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Nagy6">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the current work, we have discovered another class of cellular DEAD box RNA helicases, including the yeast eIF4AIII-like Fal1p and Dbp3p and the orthologous plant AtRH2 and DDX5-like AtRH5 DEAD box helicases, which are co-opted by tombusviruses for distinct pro-viral functions. eIF4AIII-like helicases, which assist ribosome biogenesis, are likely involved in local remodeling of large ribosomal RNP structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Alexandrov1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-RodriguezGalan1">[67]</xref>. Although eIF4AIII helicase has striking homology with eIF4A, yet eIF4AIII is functionally distinct from eIF4A, having no known role in translation initiation, and no interaction with ribosome <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Alexandrov1">[52]</xref>. The similar Dbp3p helicase, which is also involved in ribosome biogenesis, affects the endonuclease RNase MRP-driven cleavage of pre-ribosomal RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Garcia1">[51]</xref>. It is currently not known how eIF4AIII or Dbp3p RNA helicases are selected for their cellular functions.</p>
<p>In spite of their different cellular functions, Fal1p and Dbp3p helicases play comparable roles during TBSV replication. We find that, unlike the previously characterized AtRH20/Ded1p helicases, the eIF4AIII-like RNA helicases (i.e., AtRH2, AtRH5, Fal1p and Dbp3p) bind to a different <italic>cis</italic>-acting element, the RIII(−) REN, which is present at the 5′ region of the TBSV (−)RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Also dissimilar with AtRH20/Ded1p helicases is the ability of AtRH2, AtRH5 and the yeast Dbp3p and Fal1p to unwind the dsRNA structure within the RIII(−) REN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). This unique characteristic allows these eIF4AIII-like RNA helicases to perform unique functions that involves the RIII(−) REN.</p>
<p>The AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases are components of the tombusvirus VRCs as demonstrated by co-purification experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g007">Fig. 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004051.s005">S5</xref>). In addition to binding to the viral RNAs, these eIF4AIII-like RNA helicases also bind to the p33/p92 replication proteins, likely facilitating the recruitment of these cellular helicases into VRCs. It is possible that additional members of the large helicase family could perform a similar function to eIF4AIII-like RNA helicases during TBSV replication. Indeed, 39 RNA helicases are present in yeast and 110–160 RNA helicases are described in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Umate1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Xu1">[68]</xref>, indicating that additional members of this large protein family could also be involved in TBSV replication.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>A new role for eIF4AIII helicases in viral asymmetrical RNA synthesis</title>
<p>One of the hallmark features of (+)RNA virus replication is the asymmetric nature of RNA synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Li1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Salonen1">[69]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Wang4">[71]</xref>. The replication process leads to the production of abundant (+)RNA progeny, while the (−)RNA templates are likely sequestered in dsRNA forms within the VRCs. The presented <italic>in vitro</italic> data based on the solubilized/purified tombusvirus replicase and the CFE assay containing the membrane-bound VRC indicate that the eIF4AIII-like RNA helicases can mainly stimulate TBSV (+)-strand synthesis, while their effects on (−)RNA synthesis have not been observed (not shown).</p>
<p>The recombinant eIF4AIII-like RNA helicases enhanced (+)-strand synthesis by the purified recombinant tombusvirus replicase, it is possible that these helicases directly affect TBSV RNA synthesis via affecting the structure of the RNA templates, including the RIII(−)REN. However, we cannot fully exclude that AtRH2, AtRH5 and the yeast Fal1p and Dbp3p helicases could also affect the activity of the VRC due to their interactions with p33 and p92 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Overall, the recruitment of eIF4AIII-like DEAD-box helicases for replication of a small RNA virus is remarkable, and we suggest that small (+)RNA viruses likely co-opt two or more different host helicases that interact with different <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in the viral RNA to aid viral replication.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>Model on the synergistic functions of co-opted host helicases in TBSV RNA replication</title>
<p>Based on their RNA binding features and their abilities to unwind dsRNA regions only locally, we propose that the helicase functions of AtRH2, AtRH5 and the yeast Fal1p and Dbp3p are likely important for unwinding of the RIII(−) REN region in the dsRNA structure formed within the VRCs during TBSV replication. Why is local unwinding of dsRNA within the RIII(−) REN stimulatory for replication? We suggest that the locally opened RIII in the dsRNA form might allow the bridge sequence within the RIII(−) REN to participate in a long-range base-pairing with the 3′end of the (−)RNA, thus bringing the 5′ and 3′ terminal sequences of the (−)RNA in close vicinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). This could facilitate (+)-strand synthesis and the reutilization of the viral replicases (VRCs) for multiple rounds (as discussed below).</p>

<title>Model on the roles of co-opted cellular helicases in asymmetrical replication of tombusviruses.</title>
<p><italic>Cis</italic>-acting replication elements present at the 3′ and 5′ ends of the viral (−)RNA are recognized by cellular helicases to locally open the viral dsRNA replication form. Namely, the eIF4AIII-like helicases unwind the dsRNA structure within the RIII(−) REN, while the DDX3-like helicases open up the dsRNA structure within RI(−) (as shown schematically). Long-range RNA-RNA interaction between the “bridge” and the cPR region (promoter sequence at the 3′ end) in the (−)RNA is proposed to lead to circularization of the viral (−)RNA, which is still part of the dsRNA. This RNA structure is suggested to facilitate the transfer of the viral p92<sup>pol</sup> from the 5′ end of the (−)RNA [after completion of the (+)RNA strand synthesis in the previous round] back to the 3′ cPR in the (−)RNA for a new round of (+)RNA strand synthesis. Another co-opted cellular protein, GAPDH (called Tdh2/3 in yeast) is likely involved in this process by facilitating the binding of p92<sup>pol</sup> to the 3′end of the (−)RNA. Altogether, the re-use of the viral p92<sup>pol</sup> multiple times on the same (−)RNA template could result in production of multiple (+)RNA progeny, resulting in the characteristic asymmetric viral RNA replication. Note that it is also possible that p92<sup>pol</sup> is standing still, while the RNA template is moved during RNA synthesis within the membrane-bound VRCs.</p>

<p>However, the long-distance base pairing between the “bridge” in RIII(−) REN and the cPR promoter in RI(−), both of which are buried in the dsRNA structure, should also depend on opening the dsRNA form within RI(−). This function is unlikely performed by eIF4AIII-like RNA helicases. Instead, we have previously demonstrated that the subverted DDX3-like AtRH20/Ded1p helicases could open up the dsRNA structure within the RI(−) sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Kovalev1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>In summary, based on this and previous publications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Wang1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Kovalev1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Kovalev2">[49]</xref>, the emerging picture with TBSV is that this virus utilizes co-opted RNA-binding host proteins to regulate asymmetric viral RNA replication. The recruited host proteins are needed for specific interactions with various <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences in the viral (−)RNA because the viral p33/p92 replication proteins bind to TBSV (−)RNA nonspecifically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Rajendran1">[72]</xref>. We propose that, first, the recruited eIF4AIII-like RNA helicase proteins bind to RIII(−) REN, while the DDX3-like AtRH20/Ded1p helicases bind to RI(−) sequence. The interactions of two groups of helicases with the viral dsRNA likely opens up the 5′ proximal RIII(−) REN and the 3′ terminal promoter region from the dsRNA structure present in the VRCs. Then, long-distance RNA-RNA interaction between the bridge sequence in the RIII(−) REN and the 3′ terminal sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Panavas4">[57]</xref> could “circularize” the (−)RNA template and bring the p92 RdRp protein from the 5′ end back to the 3′ end for a new round of (+)-strand synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). As proposed earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Kovalev1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Kovalev2">[49]</xref>, an additional function of AtRH20/Ded1p is to further unwind local secondary structure within RI(−) to promote the association of the cellular GAPDH with an AU-rich internal site and proper positioning of the GAPDH-p92 RdRp complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Huang2">[73]</xref> over the (+)-strand initiation promoter, leading to robust (+)RNA synthesis. Therefore, we propose that the synergistic effect between the two groups of subverted helicases, host GAPDH and the viral p92<sup>pol</sup> might promote efficient recycling of the viral RdRp, resulting in multiple rounds of (+)RNA synthesis on the same dsRNA template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004051-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). This strategy could be beneficial for the virus by allowing asymmetric RNA synthesis on dsRNA templates, thus leading to excess amount of progeny (+)RNAs.</p>
<p>It is currently not known if other viruses might also use two different groups of cellular helicases to aid their replication. However, HIV retrovirus, which also lacks viral-coded helicases, has been shown to recruit several cellular helicases, including DDX3, for various steps of its infection cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-YasudaInoue1">[74]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Schroder1">[76]</xref>. In addition, host DEAD-box helicases have been shown to affect virus infections, including translation of viral proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Noueiry1">[77]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Watanabe1">[79]</xref>; viral RNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Huang1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Morohashi1">[80]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Upadhyay1">[83]</xref>; subgenomic RNA synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-GimenezBarcons1">[84]</xref>; reverse transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Wang5">[85]</xref>; virus assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Xu2">[86]</xref>; virus-mediated regulation of host gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Jong1">[87]</xref>, and the activity of many anti-viral proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Ye1">[88]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004051-Fullam1">[90]</xref>.
