<abstract>
<p>Using A/J mice, which are susceptible to <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, we sought to identify genetic determinants of susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and evaluate their function with regard to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. One QTL region on chromosome 11 containing 422 genes was found to be significantly associated with susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. Of these 422 genes, whole genome transcription profiling identified five genes (<italic>Dcaf7</italic>, <italic>Dusp3</italic>, <italic>Fam134c</italic>, <italic>Psme3</italic>, and <italic>Slc4a1</italic>) that were significantly differentially expressed in a) <italic>S. aureus</italic> –infected susceptible (A/J) vs. resistant (C57BL/6J) mice and b) humans with <italic>S. aureus</italic> blood stream infection vs. healthy subjects. Three of these genes (<italic>Dcaf7, Dusp3, and Psme3</italic>) were down-regulated in susceptible vs. resistant mice at both pre- and post-infection time points by qPCR. siRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> induced significant increases of cytokine production in <italic>S. aureus</italic>-challenged RAW264.7 macrophages and bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) through enhancing NF-κB signaling activity. Similar increases in cytokine production and NF-κB activity were also seen in BMDMs from CSS11 (C57BL/6J background with chromosome 11 from A/J), but not C57BL/6J. These findings suggest that <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> contribute to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection susceptibility in A/J mice and play a role in human <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> causes life-threatening infections in humans. Host genetic determinants influence the outcome of <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, yet are poorly understood. Susceptible A/J and resistant C57BL/6J mice provide a unique platform to study the genetic difference responsible for variable host response to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. We showed that chromosome 11 in A/J was responsible for susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic>. We further identified a QTL locus on Chromosome 11 significantly associated with <italic>S. aureus</italic> susceptibility. Five genes in the QTL (<italic>Dcaf7</italic>, <italic>Dusp3</italic>, <italic>Fam134c</italic>, <italic>Psme3</italic>, and <italic>Slc4a1</italic>) were significantly differently expressed in a) susceptible vs. resistant mice, and b) humans with <italic>S. aureus</italic> blood stream infection vs. healthy human subjects. Three genes (<italic>Dusp3</italic>, <italic>Psme3</italic>, and <italic>Dcaf7</italic>) were down-regulated in susceptible A/J mice. siRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> in bone marrow derived macrophage (BMDMs) significantly enhanced cytokine responses through NF-κB activity upon <italic>S. aureus</italic> challenge in a pattern that was also present in <italic>S. aureus</italic>-challenged BMDMs from susceptible CSS11 (chr. 11 from A/J but otherwise C57BL/6J) mice, but not resistant C57BL/6J mice. These findings suggest that <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> contribute to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection susceptibility in A/J mice and play a role in human <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is an important cause of potentially lethal human infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Bayer1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Marchant1">[3]</xref>. It is generally accepted that host genetic variation influences susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic> colonization and infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Verhoef1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-vonKockritzBlickwede1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>A significant body of evidence supports the importance of human genetic variation on host susceptibility to a variety of infectious diseases. For example, TNF gene SNP rs1800629 is strongly associated with susceptibility to severe sepsis in the Chinese Han population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Song1">[6]</xref>, while genetic variants in TRAF6 are significantly associated with susceptibility to sepsis-induced acute lung injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Song2">[7]</xref>. In addition, a genetic variant of β2-adrenocepter gene increases susceptibility to bacterial meningitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Adriani1">[8]</xref>, while genetic variations in Toll-like receptors have been linked with both infectious and autoimmune diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Netea1">[9]</xref>. More interestingly, genetic variation of IL17A gene is associated with altered susceptibility to Gram-positive infection and mortality of severe sepsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Nakada1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Far less is known about the specific genes associated with host susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Our group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Ahn1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Johnson1">[12]</xref> and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-vonKockritzBlickwede1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Sugi1">[13]</xref> have shown that different inbred mouse strains exhibit variable susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. For example, A/J is highly susceptible to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, whereas C57BL/6J is resistant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-vonKockritzBlickwede1">[5]</xref>. These susceptible and resistant strains provide an attractive approach to investigate the host genetic determinants of susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection.</p>
<p>Using A/J donor to C57BL/6J host chromosomal substitution strains (CSS) we recently discovered that chromosomes 8, 11, and 18 from A/J account for its high susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Ahn1">[11]</xref>. However, the genes on chromosome 11 that influence susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic> remain unknown.</p>
<p>In the present investigation, we used a multi-step selection process to identify genes on A/J chromosome 11 contributing to susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. Because human and murine response to sepsis can differ significantly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Seok1">[14]</xref>, we used whole blood gene expression data from a cohort of patients with <italic>S. aureus</italic> blood stream infection (BSI) to verify the potential biological relevance of all candidate genes identified in mice. Genes shown to be involved in host response to <italic>S. aureus</italic> in both mice and humans were evaluated for biological function. Using this cross-species validation approach, we identified <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> as relevant in both human and murine inflammatory response to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, and demonstrated these genes were involved in NF-κB signaling.</p>

<title>Susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic> localizes to A/J Chromosome 11</title>
<p>In the peritoneal <italic>S. aureus</italic> sepsis experiment, C57BL/6J, A/J and Chromosomal Substitution Strain 11 (CSS11) (A/J chromosome 11 in C57BL6/J background) mice were infected with <italic>S. aureus</italic> by an intraperitoneal (IP) route.

<title>Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping identifies locus on chromosome 11 linked to susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic></title>
<p>To localize the determinants on A/J chromosome 11 that are responsible for susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, QTL analysis was performed. Previously, we established that the traits conferring susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic> on A/J chromosome 11 were transmitted in an autosomal recessive fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Ahn1">[11]</xref>. Thus, a total of 208 F2 intercross mice were generated by mating F1 (C11A) to F1 (C11A) and infected with methicillin susceptible <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain Sanger 476. Survival times were analyzed by J/qtl software (Jackson Labs). One significant QTL region containing 422 genes and located between 97006867 and 110713165 was significantly linked to susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004149-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Microarray gene expression data identifies genes within the QTL region that are associated with susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection</title>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) The expression of <italic>Dcaf7</italic>, <italic>Dusp3</italic>, and <italic>Psme3</italic> in A/J was significantly lower than C57BL/6J under both non-infected and <italic>S. aureus</italic> infected conditions.

The siRNAs used in this study were listed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004149.s013">Table S2</xref>). The siRNA of each candidate gene efficiently reduced gene expression in RAW 264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004149.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Knockdown of two genes, <italic>Dusp3</italic> (p&lt;0.01) and <italic>Psme3</italic> (p&lt;0.01), significantly enhanced NF-κB signaling upon stimulation with either lipoteichoic acid (LTA) or <italic>S. aureus</italic> particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004149-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Because both of these genes (<italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic>) were down-regulated in A/J at baseline and <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004149-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), siRNA-mediated knockdown mimicked the status of susceptible A/J in RAW264.7 murine macrophages. These results suggest that lower expression of <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> in A/J mice could explain the observed susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p>
<p>To better understand how <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> affect NF-κB signaling activity, phosphorylation of p65 at Ser536 and degradation of IκBα were analyzed by western blot. BMDMs from C57BL/6J were transfected with either scrambled, <italic>Dusp3</italic>, or <italic>Psme3</italic> siRNA one day before and then subjected to <italic>S. aureus</italic> challenge for 15 minutes. The knock-down efficiency was tested in a parallel experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004149.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Western blot results showed that knockdown of <italic>Dusp3</italic> or <italic>Psme3</italic> dramatically increased phosphorylation of p65 at Ser536 as compared with scrambled siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004149-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, top panel). The degradation of IκBα was also increased in either <italic>Dusp3</italic> or <italic>Psme3</italic> knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004149-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, second bottom panel). The antibodies used in this study were listed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004149.s014">Table S3</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, BMDMs from CSS11 exhibited increased phosphorylation of p65 (Ser536) and degradation of IκBα after <italic>S. aureus</italic> stimulation as compared with BMDMs from C57BL/6J (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004149-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). These data indicate that the suppressive function of <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> on NF-κB signaling happens prior to the inhibitory cytosolic complex of IκBα-p65-p50. The signaling event should happen within the cytosol or at the cell membrane rather than in the nucleus, and probably in the proximal signaling stage before IκBα degradation.</p>

<p>Next, we analyzed cytokine and chemokine production after inhibiting NF-κB signaling.

<title>Pre-exposure to <italic>S. aureus</italic> impairs phagocytosis ability</title>
<p>Since NF-κB signaling mediates host defenses generally in a positive way, we hypothesized that persistent, unbated stimulation of production of antimicrobial effectors from immune cells, such as antimicrobial peptides, would eventually lead to “immune paralysis” or “immune exhaustion” that impeded further defense against <italic>S. aureus</italic> challenge. To test this hypothesis, BMDMs from both C57BL/6J and A/J were pre-exposed to either TNF-α (100 ng/ml) or <italic>S. aureus</italic> particles (10 µg/ml), then subjected to phagocytosis analysis. Pre-exposure to TNF-α enhanced the phagocytosis capacity of BMDMs from both strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004149.s010">Figure S10</xref>). However, pre-exposure to <italic>S. aureus</italic> particles reduced phagocytosis ability of BMDMs from both strains, and the reduction was more extensively in BMDMs from A/J (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004149.s010">Figure S10</xref>). These results suggest that prolonged simultaneous activation of all pathways in the host by <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and not isolated stimulation of the TNFα-TNF receptor pathway alone, impaired the immune system's ability to further respond to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection.</p>

<title>Expression of <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> in human neutrophils and macrophages with <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection</title>
<p>Next, we analyzed the role of <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> upon <italic>S. aureus</italic> challenge in the immortalized human monocyte cell line U-937. Despite efficient knock-down of <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic> stimulation of U-937 led to cell death rather than activation of NF-κB signaling and cytokine production (data not shown). We therefore concluded that U-937 was not suitable for our current analysis, and instead evaluated function of these two genes in human samples. To do this, we used publically available datasets of various human immune cells challenged by <italic>S. aureus</italic>, including human neutrophils (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE16837" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE16837</ext-link>) and human macrophages (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE13670" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE13670</ext-link>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The genetic basis for host susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic> is largely unknown. In the current report, we have identified two genes, <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic>, which are strongly associated with <italic>S. aureus</italic> sepsis in mice and humans, and have proposed a potential biological mechanism as negative feedback components in NF-κB-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004149-g007">Figure 7</xref>). These factors are likely to contribute to host susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic> sepsis in mouse, and potentially in humans.</p>

<title>Down-regulation of <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> in A/J is associated with over-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.</title>
<p>Both <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> inhibit NF-κB activity, which is responsible for the production of inflammatory cytokines. The reduced expression of <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> in A/J mice is associated with elevated NF-κB activity, which leads to increased inflammatory cytokines. <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic>, together with other factors from murine chromosome 8 and 18, contribute to <italic>S. aureus</italic> susceptibility of A/J strain.</p>

<p>We identified a QTL locus on chromosome 11 that was significantly linked to <italic>S. aureus</italic> susceptibility in A/J mice. We found five candidate genes (<italic>Dcaf7</italic>, <italic>Dusp3</italic>, <italic>Fam134c</italic>, <italic>Psme3</italic>, and <italic>Slc4a1</italic>) within the QTL locus that were differentially expressed between susceptible and resistant mouse strains and had human orthologues with the same significant expression patterns in patients with both <italic>S. aureus</italic> BSI and <italic>E. coli</italic> BSI. The results suggest that one or more of these five genes are involved in a common host response to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection in both humans and mice. qPCR demonstrated that two of these five genes, <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic>, were down-regulated in susceptible vs. resistant mice, and exhibited a significantly enhanced inflammatory cytokine response when knocked down with siRNA in both RAW264.7 macrophages and BMDMs. The over-production of inflammatory cytokines encountered with siRNA-mediated knockdown of these two genes was consistent with that encountered in <italic>S. aureus</italic>-challenged bone marrow derived macrophages from CSS 11 (C57BL/6J background with A/J chromosome 11) mice. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> may be key genes involved in the host susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p>
<p>Previous investigations have shown inconsistencies between murine and human response to sepsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Pound1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Rice1">[23]</xref>. For example, a recent study by Seok and colleagues demonstrated significant differences between murine and human genomic responses to several acute inflammatory diseases, including burns, trauma, and endotoxemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Seok1">[14]</xref>. Our candidate gene selection approach ensured that all murine candidate genes were also relevant in humans with <italic>S. aureus</italic> BSI. In this way, almost two-thirds of the more than 1000 genes on A/J chromosome 11 were excluded from contributing to susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Using this trans-species comparative genomic approach, only <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> were identified as putative contributors to <italic>S. aureus</italic> susceptibility and both exhibited a significant biological effect on NF-κB signaling. Because NF-κB is centrally involved in the inflammatory response in both mouse and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Baltimore1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Karin1">[25]</xref>, these two genes are likely to be involved in the host inflammatory response to <italic>S. aureus</italic> in both humans and mice.</p>
<p>The diverse function of <italic>Dusp3</italic> requires further detailed investigation on its biological relevance to <italic>S. aureus</italic> susceptibility. First, it is greatly involved in signaling transduction pathways regulating protein de-phosphorylation. For example, <italic>Dusp3</italic> has been reported to be the main protein tyrosine phosphatase in macrophage mediating cellular processes, including immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Arimura1">[26]</xref>. It is a redox-sensitive and ERK-specific phosphatase. Bacterial colonization results in oxidative inactivation of <italic>Dusp3</italic> and consequently stimulation of ERK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Wentworth1">[27]</xref>. <italic>Dusp3</italic> also regulates cell death and cell proliferation, exhibiting anti-apoptotic ability in prostate cancer cells and promoting cell cycle progression in carcinoma of the cervix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Arnoldussen1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Henkens1">[29]</xref>. Perhaps most interestingly, <italic>Dusp3</italic> has been shown to affect the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Jonkam1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Ecsedi1">[32]</xref>. VEGF has been reported to increase cardiovascular collapse and vascular permeability during <italic>S. aureus</italic> sepsis pathogenesis and has been proposed as a major determinant of vascular hyperpermeability in MRSA sepsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Jonkam1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Jonkam2">[31]</xref>. In our experiment, VEGF was also significantly elevated in <italic>Dusp3</italic> siRNA transfected RAW264.7 macrophages in both non-infection and <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection condition. Finally, <italic>Dusp3</italic> homozygous mutant mice exhibited susceptibility to Gram negative bacterial infection in screening results from the Knockout Mouse Consortium program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-vanderWeyden1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-The1">[34]</xref>. Collectively, this evidence suggests the <italic>Dusp3</italic> pathway may be an important candidate pathway in resolving <italic>S. aureus</italic> related pathogenesis.</p>
<p><italic>Psme3</italic> is a subunit of a proteasome responsible for the generation of peptides loaded onto MHC class I molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Kohda1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Kanai1">[36]</xref>. MHC class I molecules are crucial components of host response to infection, contributing to host recognition of viral and bacterial infected cells by host cytotoxic CD8-T cells for the final killing and degradation of pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Chen1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-SchutzeRedelmeier1">[38]</xref>. The down-regulation of <italic>Psme3</italic> in A/J but not C57BL/6J may result in less degradation of phagocytosed <italic>S. aureus</italic>, less <italic>S. aureus</italic> antigen presented on MHC class I molecules, and ultimately less degradation of infected host cells by cytotoxic CD8-T cells. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of <italic>Psme3</italic> also dramatically increased VEGF production by RAW264.7, further suggesting that VEGF enrichment affected by down-regulation of <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> in murine chromosome 11 contributes to the <italic>S. aureus</italic> susceptible phenotype of A/J.</p>
<p>In the process of sepsis, harmful molecular mechanisms contribute to the high mortality seen in severely ill patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Rittirsch1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Sriskandan1">[40]</xref>. In these cases, a pathogenic role of excessive immunity, also known as “cytokine storm” and reduced immunity through immune paralysis are highly associated with death induced by acute bacterial infection. Referred to as “compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome” (CARS), this “immune-exhaustion” phenomenon is the consequence of counter-regulatory mechanisms initiated to limit the over-activated inflammatory response in sepsis patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-AdibConquy1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-vanderPoll1">[42]</xref>. In patients with CARS, over-activation of inflammatory response ultimately leads to changes in expression of genes associated with phagocytosis, antigen presentation, cell migration and apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Xu1">[43]</xref>. In the current investigation, downregulation of <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> in A/J increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may partially account for the cytokine storm observed in that mouse lineage when infected with <italic>S. aureus</italic>. These two genes, combined with other factors from chromosome 8 and 18, would together contribute to susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic> in A/J mice, and potentially in humans.</p>
<p>Further, our studies showed that pre-exposure of macrophages to <italic>S. aureus</italic> particles compromised their ability to further take up the bacteria. This finding suggests that persistent, unabated stimulation of the immune system by <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection can eventually lead to immune paralysis or exhaustion of antimicrobial peptides. Since the overproduction of cytokines is the major phenotype of CSS11, we hypothesize that cytokine storm could account for the increased susceptibility of A/J to dying of <italic>S. aureus</italic> sepsis. Given these findings, we hypothesize that down-regulation of <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> in A/J result in hyper-responsiveness of host immune system, which in turn leads to “immune paralysis” of the host to further defense against prolonged <italic>S. aureus</italic> challenge. Collectively, these finding also indicate that immediate bacterial clearance is important for host defense against <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p>
<p>Several of the other genes identified in our experiments were also promising candidates. <italic>Dcaf7</italic> is a scaffold protein for activating MEKK1 kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Ritterhoff1">[44]</xref> and is involved in the human TNFα/NF-κB signal transduction pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Bouwmeester1">[45]</xref>. A dominant negative mutant of MEKK1 was reported to abolish T-cell receptor activation by super-antigen staphylococcus enterotoxin E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Tao1">[46]</xref> while NF-κB mediated innate immune defense against <italic>S. aureus</italic> through TLR2 and NOD2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Karrasch1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-OviedoBoyso1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Li1">[48]</xref>. <italic>Fam134c</italic> is a family with sequence similarity to 134, member C. Little is known of the putative function of <italic>Fam134c</italic> or related family members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Kurth1">[49]</xref>. However, mice with <italic>Fam134c</italic> homozygous mutations have demonstrated bacterial susceptible phenotype based on the screening results from the Knockout Mouse Consortium program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-vanderWeyden1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-The1">[34]</xref>. <italic>Slc4a1</italic> is a membrane protein or protein of membrane related organelles mediating small molecule transporting and intracellular metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-AlSamir1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Haitina1">[52]</xref>.</p>
<p>The current study has limitations. First, our cohort of patients did not include subjects who were colonized, but not infected, with <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Second, the two model systems used in this manuscript (intraperitoneal sepsis, tail vein sepsis) fail to fully represent the diversity of human infections caused by <italic>S. aureus</italic> (e.g., endocarditis, osteomyelitis, visceral abscesses, pneumonia, soft tissue infection). Our approach does not consider the impact of post-translational modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Yan2">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Yan3">[54]</xref> and single nucleotide polymorphisms on genes and their products. Thus, there may be additional candidate genes on chromosome 11 beyond <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic>. Moreover, our approach may have missed genes that contribute to the susceptible phenotype by way of a joint or additive effect. In support of this possibility is the fact that our original discovery found that three chromosomes, 8, 11, and 18, were each independently associated with susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004149-Ahn1">[11]</xref>. Thus, additional experiments are underway in our lab, including QTL mapping analysis for A/J chromosome 8, defining the pathogenesis of <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> using knockout mice, and evaluating the impact of <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> on host susceptibility to different pathogens.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this study makes several key observations. First, we have identified one QTL on chromosome 11 that is significantly linked to survival time after infection with <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Eleven differentially expressed genes mapped to the significant- or suggestive- threshold of this QTL. Five of these 11 genes exhibited significant evidence of involvement in patients with <italic>S. aureus</italic> BSI that was consistent with the pattern encountered in the murine model. Two of these five genes, <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic>, responded to <italic>S. aureus</italic> challenge by negatively regulating NF-κB signaling, leading to enhanced cytokine response (GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα). Consistent with the hypothesis of enhanced A/J susceptibility caused by unchecked inflammatory response, <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> were less expressed in susceptible A/J as compared with resistant C57BL/6J. All of our results support a potential role of these two genes in host response to <italic>S. aureus</italic>. <italic>Dusp3</italic> and <italic>Psme3</italic> represent promising candidates for the genetic basis of host susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p>

For murine intravenous sepsis, 8-week-old male mice (n = 10) in each strain of C57BL/6J, A/J, and CSS11 were i.v. injected with 2×10<sup>6</sup> CFU/g <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Sanger 476) and observed every 6 hours for morbidity continuously for 3 days. For bacterial load quantification, kidneys were collected from euthanized mice at 24 hours post-infection, then homogenized in DPBS and serially diluted (10 fold). The dilutions were plated in Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) plates and incubated at 37°C overnight for counting colony forming units (CFU).</p>

<title>QTL linkage analysis</title>
<p>Polymorphic microsatellite markers on chromosome 11 between C57BL/6J and A/J were chosen from a database maintained by Mouse Genomic Informatics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.informatics.jax.org/</ext-link>). Twelve microsatellite markers were selected with an average inter-marker distance of 3.1 cM covering chromosome 11. A total of 208 F2 intercross were generated, all of which were genotyped for each microsatellite marker by PCR amplification and gel electrophoresis. J/qtl software was used to analyze phenotype and genotype data for linkage of survival time after infection with <italic>S. aureus</italic> Sanger 476 and marker location. Phenotypes were defined as either sensitive or resistant based on the dichotomization of survival data (survival of less than 2 day is “0” and survival of longer than 2 days is “1”, respectively). All linkage analysis results were expressed as LOD scores. LOD score was considered “suggestive” if &gt; = 1.6 (p = 0.63) and “significant” if &gt; = 3.55 (p = 0.05). Threshold values for linkage were determined by a 1,000 permutation test by using J/qtl.</p>

<title>Small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments</title>
<p>To test the role of each candidate gene on cytokine production by host defense cells, we transfected siRNAs into the mouse macrophages. All siRNAs were purchased from Invitrogen. RAW264.7 cells or bone-marrow derived macrophages from C57BL/6J were transfected with 50 nM siRNA by Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were treated with <italic>S. aureus</italic> Bioparticles (Invitrogen) to a final concentration of 10 µg/ml. At 24 hours post-infection, supernatants were collected and stored at −80°C for Luminex-multiplex cytokine assay. In parallel experiments, cells at 3 hours post-infection were harvested for RNA extraction by RNeasy (QIAGEN), RT-PCR by SuperScript II (Invitrogen) and SYBR Green qPCR analysis (ABI) respectively.
