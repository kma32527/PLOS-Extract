<abstract>
<p>Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT/A-G), the most potent toxins known, act by cleaving three SNARE proteins required for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Previous studies on BoNTs have generally utilized the major SNARE homologues expressed in brain (VAMP2, syntaxin 1, and SNAP-25). However, BoNTs target peripheral motor neurons and cause death by paralyzing respiratory muscles such as the diaphragm. Here we report that VAMP1, but not VAMP2, is the SNARE homologue predominantly expressed in adult rodent diaphragm motor nerve terminals and in differentiated human motor neurons. In contrast to the highly conserved VAMP2, BoNT-resistant variations in VAMP1 are widespread across vertebrates. In particular, we identified a polymorphism at position 48 of VAMP1 in rats, which renders VAMP1 either resistant (I48) or sensitive (M48) to BoNT/D. Taking advantage of this finding, we showed that rat diaphragms with I48 in VAMP1 are insensitive to BoNT/D compared to rat diaphragms with M48 in VAMP1. This unique intra-species comparison establishes VAMP1 as a physiological toxin target in diaphragm motor nerve terminals, and demonstrates that the resistance of VAMP1 to BoNTs can underlie the insensitivity of a species to members of BoNTs. Consistently, human VAMP1 contains I48, which may explain why humans are insensitive to BoNT/D. Finally, we report that residue 48 of VAMP1 varies frequently between M and I across seventeen closely related primate species, suggesting a potential selective pressure from members of BoNTs for resistance in vertebrates.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) target peripheral motor neurons and act by cleaving SNARE proteins, which are essential for neurotransmitter release from nerve terminals. SNARE proteins occur in multiple homologues and it has been difficult to determine which one is the physiologically relevant toxin target in motor nerve terminals among closely related SNARE homologues such as VAMP1 and VAMP2. Here we report that, in contrast to the highly conserved VAMP2, sequence variations in VAMP1 that confer resistance to BoNTs are widespread across vertebrates. In particular, residue 48 of VAMP1 is polymorphic between BoNT/D-sensitive residue M and BoNT/D-resistant residue I in rats. Taking advantage of this finding, we carried out an intra-species comparison, which showed that diaphragm motor nerve terminals from rats with I48 in VAMP1 were insensitive to BoNT/D as compared to those with M48. Since VAMP2 is conserved in rats, these data demonstrate that VAMP1 is the physiologically relevant toxin target in motor neurons. Interestingly, human VAMP1 encodes the BoNT/D-resistant residue I48, which may explain why humans are insensitive to BoNT/D. Finally, we found that residue 48 of VAMP1 switches frequently between M and I among 17 primate species, suggesting a potential selective pressure from BoNT/D for resistance in primates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are a family of protein toxins produced by diverse species of <italic>Clostridia</italic>, a genus of anaerobic spore-forming bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Schiavo1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Montal1">[2]</xref>. These toxins paralyze humans and animals by blocking neurotransmitter release primarily from motor nerve terminals, causing death when respiratory muscles are paralyzed. Adult humans and animals are usually exposed to BoNTs by ingesting preformed toxins in food sources. The disease caused by BoNTs is known as botulism, which has become rare in humans due to improvements in food processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Shapiro1">[3]</xref>. However, botulism still accounts for large numbers of deaths in both wild and domesticated animals, partly because the clostridia that produce BoNTs are widespread in soils and water sediments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Collins1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>There are seven major serotypes of BoNTs (types A-G) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Schiavo1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Montal1">[2]</xref>. An eighth serotype (type H) has also been reported recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Dover1">[5]</xref>. These toxins target and enter peripheral nerve terminals via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Once inside neurons, BoNTs translocate across endosomal membranes and act as proteases cleaving one of three proteins essential for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Specifically, BoNT/B, D, F, and G cleave different sites on the synaptic vesicle protein VAMP (also known as synaptobrevin); BoNT/A, C, and E cleave different sites on the peripheral membrane protein SNAP-25; and BoNT/C also cleaves the plasma membrane protein syntaxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Schiavo1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Montal1">[2]</xref>. These three proteins, known as SNARE proteins, form a complex that is the core machinery mediating fusion of synaptic vesicle membranes to plasma membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Jahn1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>For each of the three SNARE proteins, there are several homologous genes in vertebrate genomes that encode closely related proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Jahn1">[6]</xref>. Previous studies of BoNTs mainly utilized VAMP2, syntaxin 1, and SNAP-25. They are the predominant forms expressed in brain and have been widely used as model SNARE proteins. However, BoNTs cannot cross the blood-brain barrier at concentrations generally encountered during botulism outbreaks. Rather, BoNTs act mainly on peripheral motor neurons and cause death by paralyzing respiratory muscles such as the diaphragm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Dolly1">[7]</xref>. Therefore, the specific SNARE isoforms expressed in diaphragm motor nerve terminals are the physiological targets that determine the sensitivity of different animal species to BoNTs. SNAP-25 and syntaxin 1 are expressed in motor nerve terminals, and are likely the authentic physiological targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Aguado1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Meunier1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Rozas1">[10]</xref>. However, recent data have raised doubts as to whether VAMP2 is a physiologically relevant toxin target in diaphragm motor neurons.</p>
<p>It has been reported that VAMP2 was not detected in rat sciatic motor nerve terminals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Li1">[11]</xref>. Instead, these nerve terminals express VAMP1, another VAMP homologue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Li1">[11]</xref>. It was also recently reported that both VAMP1 and VAMP2 are co-expressed in motor nerve terminals of triangularis sterni muscles in juvenile mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Liu1">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, the lack of VAMP1 expression in a spontaneous VAMP1-null mutant mouse line results in a ∼50% reduction of synaptic transmission in the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) of juvenile mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Liu1">[12]</xref>. These VAMP1-null mice exhibit severe motor dysfunction and usually die within 15 days after birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Nystuen1">[13]</xref>. These phenotypes suggest a possibility that VAMP2 is co-expressed in motor neurons and can partially compensate for the loss of VAMP1 during development, but VAMP1 gradually becomes the dominant form that is essential for survival after 15 days. The expression of VAMP1 relative to VAMP2 in adult rat/mouse diaphragm NMJs has not been examined, and the relative contribution of VAMP1 versus VAMP2 at diaphragm NMJs in adult animals remains unknown.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it has been shown that rat VAMP1 is resistant to BoNT/B in vitro due to a single residue change (Q78V) from the conserved VAMP1 sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Schiavo2">[14]</xref>, whereas human VAMP1 is a poor substrate for BoNT/D in vitro due to another residue change (M48I) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Yamamoto1">[15]</xref>. These in vitro data appear to correlate with the toxicity data in vivo, as it has been a long-standing observation that rats are insensitive to BoNT/B, with a median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) that is ∼10,000 times the value in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Burgen1">[16]</xref>. Furthermore, it has also been reported that synaptic transmission in isolated human nerve-muscle biopsy tissues was not blocked by BoNT/D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Coffield1">[17]</xref>. In addition, there is no confirmed human botulism case caused by BoNT/D, despite the prevalence of its association with botulism in domesticated animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Shapiro1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Sobel1">[18]</xref>. Finally, a recent study of injecting low levels of BoNT/D into the extensor digitorum brevis muscle (EDB) in human volunteers showed no significant paralysis, indicating that humans are indeed insensitive to BoNT/D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Eleopra1">[19]</xref>. Despite these apparent correlations, it is not clear whether the residue changes in VAMP1 underlie the resistance of a species to BoNTs in vivo, and numerous potential confounding factors must be considered when comparing the toxicity of BoNTs in different species.</p>
<p>Here we demonstrate that VAMP1, but not VAMP2, is the predominant form expressed at diaphragm NMJs in adult mice/rats and in human motor neurons differentiated from embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, we found that residue 48 of VAMP1 is polymorphic between M and I in rats. Taking advantage of this finding, we demonstrated that diaphragms from rats homozygous for I48 are insensitive to BoNT/D as compared to diaphragms from rats homozygous for M48. This direct comparison within the same species demonstrates that VAMP1 determines the sensitivity of a species to BoNT/D, and indicates that I48 in human VAMP1 is likely the reason for the insensitivity of humans to BoNT/D. Finally, we report that residue 48 of VAMP1 varies between M and I across seventeen closely related primate species, suggesting a potential selective pressure from BoNT/D.</p>

<title>VAMP1, but not VAMP2, is expressed in diaphragm motor nerve terminals in adult rats/mice and in human motor neurons</title>
<p>Diaphragm motor nerve terminals are the physiological targets that determine species susceptibility to BoNTs. We first examined expression of VAMP1 versus VAMP2 at diaphragm tissues dissected from adult rats and mice. These tissues were fixed, permeabilized, and subjected to immunostaining assays to detect VAMP1 or VAMP2 using their specific antibodies. The diaphragm NMJs were labeled using α-bungarotoxin (α-BTX), which binds to acetylcholine receptors opposing presynaptic motor nerve terminals. We found that VAMP1 is expressed in nearly all NMJs in both rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, upper panel) and mouse diaphragms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004177.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>, upper panel). VAMP1 largely overlaps with α-BTX at NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004177.s001">S1A</xref>). In contrast, VAMP2 was not detected under our assay conditions at NMJs in adult rat/mouse diaphragms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, lower panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004177.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>, lower panel). The VAMP2 antibody utilized here has been widely used for both immunostaining and immunoblot analysis. We also confirmed that this antibody can detect VAMP2 in mouse brain slices following the same fixation and immunostaining protocol used for diaphragm tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004177.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>).</p>

<p>We next assessed whether VAMP1 is also the dominant form in human motor nerve terminals, utilizing cultured human motor neurons differentiated from embryonic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Peng1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Hu1">[21]</xref>. Primary rat hippocampal neurons were also assayed as a control. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, VAMP1 was detected in cell lysates of differentiated human motor neurons, whereas VAMP2 was not detectable under our assay conditions. In contrast, VAMP2 was readily detected in cell lysates of rat hippocampal neurons, which do not express appreciable levels of VAMP1. These results suggest that VAMP1 is likely the dominant form expressed in human motor neurons.</p>

<title>Rat VAMP1 is resistant to BoNT/B due to a residue change at the toxin cleavage site</title>
<p>It has been a long-held observation that BoNT/B cannot cleave rat VAMP1 in vitro, likely due to a single residue change at the BoNT/B cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Schiavo2">[14]</xref>.

<p>Because previous reports on the resistance of rat VAMP1 to BoNT/B are based on in vitro studies using either cell lysates or recombinant proteins, we first examined whether rat VAMP1 is indeed resistant to BoNT/B in live neurons. To do so, we utilized primary rat hippocampal neurons as a model. These neurons express VAMP2, but not VAMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), thus serving as a convenient VAMP1-null neuron model, which allows us to express different versions of VAMP1 exogenously via lentiviral transduction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, neurons expressing human (h-), mouse (m-), or rat (r-) VAMP1 were incubated with a gradient of BoNT/B. These neurons were subsequently harvested and subjected to immunoblot analysis to detect cleavage of VAMP2 and VAMP1. Cleavage of VAMP1 and VAMP2 resulted in the loss of their immunoblot signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). The remaining VAMP immunoblot signals were normalized to the signal of actin, and subsequently plotted versus the BoNT/B concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). We found that BoNT/B cleaved VAMP2, h-VAMP1, and m-VAMP1 with similar efficiency, whereas r-VAMP1 was resistant to BoNT/B in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g002">Fig. 2B, C</xref>).</p>
<p>We next determined whether the resistance of r-VAMP1 is due to the Q78V residue change at the BoNT/B cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). This has been suggested to be the reason, but has not been examined experimentally in neurons. We created a mutated r-VAMP1 in which the V residue at the toxin cleavage site was mutated to Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g002">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). This r-VAMP1 mutant was cleaved by BoNT/B in neurons at a rate similar to m-VAMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, lower panel), demonstrating that the Q to V change is indeed responsible for the insensitivity of r-VAMP1 to BoNT/B in neurons.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Differential sensitivities of rat and mouse diaphragm motor nerves to BoNT/B</title>
<p>We next examined whether the difference between rat and mouse VAMP1 may lead to differential sensitivities of their diaphragm motor neurons to BoNT/B. Here we utilized the well-established phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparation, in which the phrenic nerve can be stimulated electrically to trigger muscle contractions. Cleavage of VAMP in phrenic nerve terminals leads to inhibition of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, which blocks muscle contraction.</p>
<p>Using this assay, we found that incubation with 300 pM BoNT/B caused a steep reduction of twitch tension in mouse diaphragm muscles, culminating in nearly complete paralysis within 2 hours (hrs) of toxin addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, red line). In contrast, twitch tension in rat diaphragms exposed to a 10-fold higher concentration of BoNT/B (3 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>, black line) showed no significant reduction within 2 hrs. The slight reduction observed for rat diaphragms is likely due to a natural run-down of the isolated diaphragm tissues in the bath, since the same level of run-down was observed in control rat diaphragms that were not exposed to BoNT/B.</p>
<p>We further evaluated the sensitivity of rat versus mouse diaphragms to BoNT/B by comparing the time required to produce a 50% reduction of muscle twitch tensions (half-paralysis time) under a series of BoNT/B concentrations. As listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>, 10 pM of BoNT/B caused a 50% reduction of muscle twitch tension within 201.2±39.1 min on mouse diaphragms. In contrast, rat diaphragms exposed to 1000 pM and 3000 pM concentrations of BoNT/B showed similar rates of reduction of twitch tension as control diaphragms that were not exposed to BoNT/B (∼6 hrs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>), suggesting that rat diaphragm motor nerves are essentially resistant to these levels of BoNT/B. Because VAMP2 is conserved between rats and mice, the dramatically different sensitivities between mouse and rat diaphragms to BoNT/B are consistent with the hypothesis that VAMP1, rather than VAMP2, is the physiologically relevant toxin target in diaphragm motor nerve terminals in adult rats/mice.</p>

Neurons were exposed to the indicated concentrations of BoNT/D for 24 hrs. Cell lysates were collected and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Both wild type h-VAMP1 and a mutant m-VAMP1 (M48I) were poorly cleaved by BoNT/D, whereas wild type m-VAMP1 and a mutant h-VAMP1 (I48M) were efficiently cleaved by BoNT/D. (C) Immunoblot results from panel B were quantified and plotted (N = 3, error bars represent SEM).

Cleavage of endogenous VAMP2 serves as an internal control to demonstrate the activity of toxins.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, primary rat hippocampal neurons expressing human or mouse VAMP1 were incubated with BoNT/D. Cleavage of VAMP1 and VAMP2 was determined via immunoblot analysis of the neuron lysates. We found that human VAMP1 was much less sensitive to BoNT/D than mouse VAMP1 in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g003">Fig. 3B, C</xref>). Furthermore, mutation of M48I in m-VAMP1 caused it to become insensitive to BoNT/D, whereas mutation of I48M in h-VAMP1 allowed it to be cleaved at a rate similar to wild type m-VAMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g003">Fig. 3B, C</xref>).

<title>Widespread residue changes in VAMP1 at BoNT cleavage sites across vertebrates</title>
<p>We next evaluated whether toxin-resistant residue changes occur in other species, by examining VAMP1 sequences available in public databases. We found that the same residue change as in rats (Q78V) also occurs in chickens and finches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004177.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). The M48I residue change is even more widespread, including in several primates, as well as in the rat, torpedo, wild boar, Tasmanian devil, and elephant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004177.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>

<title>Position 48 of VAMP1 is polymorphic between M and I residues in rats</title>
<p>The finding that human VAMP1 is insensitive to BoNT/D is consistent with previous observations that humans are less sensitive to BoNT/D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Eleopra1">[19]</xref>. However, whether the former is the reason for the latter has not been established. As rat VAMP1 has been reported to also contain residue I at position 48 and is resistant to BoNT/D in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Yamasaki1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Nakamura1">[24]</xref>, rats may serve as a model to investigate whether VAMP1 with I48 can confer resistance to BoNT/D in diaphragm motor nerve terminals. Surprisingly, our search of public sequence databases revealed an additional rat VAMP1 sequence with residue M at position 48. Further analysis revealed that residue M was reported from the genome sequence of Norway rats, whereas residue I was reported for VAMP1 cloned from Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), and this is the only difference in VAMP1 between these two types of rats. Therefore, residue 48 can be either M or I among different rat species. The SD rat is a widely utilized laboratory strain. As this is an outbred strain, we next examined whether residue 48 could be polymorphic even within SD rats. To answer this question, we sequenced VAMP1 from a total of 35 adult SD rats purchased from a commercial vendor (Charles River). The results revealed that position 48 is the only polymorphic residue, with 34% of SD rats homozygous with I residue and 28% homozygous with M, while the rest were M/I heterozygous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>

<title>An intra-species comparison demonstrates that VAMP1 determines the sensitivity of rat diaphragm motor nerves to BoNT/D</title>
<p>The finding that VAMP1 in the SD rat can have either M or I at position 48 provides an ideal opportunity to address the question of whether the M/I residue change in VAMP1 underlies species sensitivity to BoNT/D. By comparing SD rats with different genotypes in VAMP1, we can significantly reduce, if not eliminate, any potential confounding factors that are always a concern when comparing different species.</p>
<p>We thus examined the sensitivity of diaphragms from SD rats to BoNT/D, using the phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm tissue preparation described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>. These rats were ordered without foreknowledge of their genotypes, subjected to our assay, and then genotyped afterwards. Thus, the experimenter who measured the sensitivity of each rat diaphragm to BoNT/D was blind to the specific genotype of that rat. As the assay was done blindly, we only compared the sensitivity of rat diaphragms to a fixed BoNT/D concentration, 300 pM. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, rats that were homozygous with residue M exhibited a half-paralysis time of 169±21 min; whereas rats that were homozygous with residue I had a half-paralysis time of 307±8 min. The heterozygous rats with M/I exhibited the same level of insensitivity as the homozygous rats with residue I (with a half-paralysis time of 343±37 min). These data demonstrate that M/I residues at position 48 of VAMP1 largely determine the sensitivity of the diaphragm motor nerve terminals to BoNT/D.</p>

<title>Frequent M/I switches at position 48 of VAMP1 among different primate species</title>
<p>The diversity of primate species provides an ideal model for us to further survey toxin-resistant residue changes in VAMP1 among closely related species. For this purpose, we selected seventeen major primate species from four primate groups, which represent ∼87 million years (MYA) in primate evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). For several of the primates, VAMP1 sequences were available from previous genomic studies. For the ones that were not available, we sequenced the first four exons of their VAMP1 gene, encoding residues 1–113.</p>
<p>All but 4 of these 113 amino acid positions in VAMP1 were perfectly conserved across these seventeen primates. Two of the variable amino acid positions, positions 7 and 106, differed in only a single species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004177.s004">Fig. S4</xref>, P7L in Titi Monkey, and A106T in Colobus). In contrast, the other two positions, residues 28 and 48, changed multiple times among primates. Residue 28 varies among three amino acids: M/L/T (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004177.s004">Fig. S4</xref>), while residue 48 toggles between M and I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). As a control, we also analyzed VAMP2 sequences (residues 1–116) in nine major primate species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004177.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). In contrast to VAMP1, VAMP2 is 100% conserved in all nine primate species.</p>
<p>The functional significance of changes at residue 28 of VAMP1 is unknown, but it is unlikely to be related to BoNT sensitivity since residue 28 is outside of both toxin recognition and cleavage sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Pellizzari1">[22]</xref>. Residues at position 48, however, would determine the susceptibility of a particular primate species to BoNT/D as we demonstrated using the SD rat model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004177-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). The distribution of M/I at position 48 shows a tentative link to the geographic distribution of primates. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004177.s006">Fig. S6</xref>, all three primates tested from the Americas encode the toxin-sensitive M residue, whereas almost all African primates encode the toxin resistant I residue. Primates sampled from Asia encode a mixture of the two. Humans encode the toxin-resistant I, as do the majority of African primates, which is in line with human emergence from the African continent.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>VAMP1 and VAMP2 are two highly homologous synaptic vesicle SNARE proteins. They exhibit largely distinct expression patterns in the central and peripheral nervous systems, but also overlap in many regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Li1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Baumert1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Sudhof1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Trimble1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Raptis1">[28]</xref>. Both are substrates for BoNT/B/D/F/G <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Schiavo1">[1]</xref>, but VAMP2 has been the prevalent homologue utilized in the majority of studies on BoNT action. This is partly because VAMP2 has been widely utilized as a model VAMP protein. However, the specific VAMP isoform that is the physiologically relevant toxin target in diaphragm motor nerve terminals has not been established.</p>
<p>Here we examined the expression of VAMP1 versus VAMP2 using their specific antibodies, which showed that VAMP1 is the predominant isoform expressed in diaphragm NMJs in adult mice/rats. We further examined the role of VAMP1/VAMP2 in diaphragms at functional levels. First, we confirmed that rat diaphragms are insensitive to BoNT/B. This is consistent with a dominant role for VAMP1 at diaphragms, since rat VAMP1 is resistant to BoNT/B, whereas rat VAMP2 is readily cleaved by BoNT/B. Second, we found that rats are polymorphic at residue 48 of VAMP1 between M that is sensitive to cleavage by BoNT/D, and I that is a poor substrate for BoNT/D. Taking advantage of this finding, we demonstrated that the sensitivity of rat diaphragm motor nerves to BoNT/D correlates with the specific residue 48 in VAMP1: diaphragms from rats with I48 were much less sensitive to BoNT/D than diaphragms from rats with M48. This unique intra-species comparison provides strong evidence that VAMP1 is the dominant form in adult rat diaphragm motor nerve terminals. This is likely also the case in humans, as we showed that cultured human motor neurons differentiated from embryonic stem cells mainly express VAMP1, but not VAMP2.</p>
<p>Our mutagenesis studies further validated in neurons that the resistance of rat VAMP1 to BoNT/B is due to the presence of residue V at position 78, whereas the resistance of human VAMP1 to BoNT/D is due to residue I at position 48. Interestingly, these residue changes occur in multiple vertebrate species. In particular, residue 48 is a hot spot that switches frequently between BoNT/D-sensitive residue M and BoNT/D-insensitive residue I across closely related primate species. Residue 48 is one of the key residues within the highly conserved SNARE domain of VAMP1/2, directly participating in the formation of the SNARE helix bundle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Sutton1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Fasshauer1">[30]</xref>. It is also a key position critical for endocytosis of VAMP2 and its localization onto vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Koo1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Miller1">[32]</xref>. Because this M/I switch occurs within closely related primate species, it is not likely due to an evolutionary selection for any cellular functions. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the M/I switch is a random and neutral event, the finding that this single change determines the sensitivity of the species to BoNT/D suggests that BoNT/D might have exerted a selective pressure on primates.</p>
<p>We were surprised to find that the M/I residue change also occurs within the commonly utilized SD rats. It is a remarkable example that a single residue polymorphism in animal models exhibits a dramatic impact on their susceptibility to toxins/pathogens. Consequently, it is essential to determine the specific VAMP1 genotype of each SD rat when using this animal model for studying BoNT/D action. Whether similar polymorphisms exist in other species and humans remains to be resolved.</p>
<p>As low levels of BoNT/D selectively cleave human VAMP2, but not VAMP1, it might be a unique toxin that can attenuate synaptic transmission in VAMP2-expressing neurons in humans, without the danger of causing muscle paralysis. Therefore, it will be interesting to establish the distribution of VAMP1 versus VAMP2 in neurons other than motor neurons, such as sensory neurons involved in pain pathways. It has been reported that both VAMP1 and VAMP2 are expressed in trigeminal ganglion neurons involved in migraine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Meng1">[33]</xref>. VAMP2 is also reported to be expressed in the dorsal horn nerve terminals and in small- and medium-sized dorsal root ganglion neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004177-Li1">[11]</xref>. The population of SD rats with I48 may provide a convenient model to explore the therapeutic potential of using BoNT/D to target VAMP2-expressing cells. Finally, our findings of frequent M/I changes among primate species also provide crucial guidance for selecting appropriate primate models for understanding the toxicity and therapeutic effects of BoNT/D in humans.</p>

<title>Immunostaining of diaphragm NMJs</title>
<p>Diaphragms were dissected from adult rats/mice (2-months-old) and fixed overnight with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Tissues were incubated with α-BTX (1 µg/ml for 60 min) and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Tissues were further incubated with the blocking buffer (PBS with 3% BSA, 0.5 M NaCl and 0.3% Triton X-100) for 30 min, and then treated with 0.2% citric acid for 30 min, washed with PBS, and incubated with primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer (anti-VAMP1: 1∶300; anti-VAMP2: 1∶200) overnight at 4°C, rinsed and further incubated with Alexa-488 conjugated secondary antibody for 2 hrs at room temperature. Samples were washed and mounted. Images were acquired using a confocal microscope (Leica SP5, 10× objective), and presented as maximum projections from Z-stack acquisitions.</p>

<title>Muscle tension recording</title>
<p>Muscles were stimulated by application of supramaximal volleys to the phrenic nerve via bipolar stainless steel electrodes (6.0–9.0 V, 0.2 millisecond duration) at 0.033 Hz. Muscle tensions were measured using Grass FT03 force displacement transducers (Astro-Med, Inc., West Warwick, RI), digitized and analyzed offline using pClamp software V10 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Tissues were maintained at 36°C and exposed to BoNTs by adding toxins directly to the incubation solution.</p>

<p><bold>VAMP2 expression can be detected in mouse brain slices, but not in diaphragm motor nerve terminals in adult mice.</bold> (A) Diaphragms dissected from adult mice were subjected to immunostaining analysis to detect VAMP1 (upper panel) and VAMP2 (lower panel) at motor nerve terminals using their specific antibodies. NMJs were labeled with α-BTX. Scale bars represent 20 µm. (B) Mice were fixed by perfusion with 4% PFA. Coronal brain slices were subjected to immunostaining analysis with the same VAMP2 antibody as used in panel A. Synapsin served as a marker for presynaptic terminals. VAMP2 was detected in brain slices and was largely co-localized with synapsin. The scale bar represents 10 µm.</p>
