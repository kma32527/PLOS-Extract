<abstract>
<p>Numerous bacterial pathogens secrete multiple effectors to modulate host cellular functions. These effectors may interfere with each other to efficiently control the infection process. <italic>Bartonellae</italic> are Gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacteria using a VirB type IV secretion system to translocate a cocktail of <italic><underline>B</underline>artonella</italic> <underline>e</underline>ffector <underline>p</underline>roteins (Beps) into host cells. Based on <italic>in vitro</italic> infection models we demonstrate here that BepE protects infected migratory cells from injurious effects triggered by BepC and is required for <italic>in vivo</italic> dissemination of bacteria from the dermal site of inoculation to blood. Human endothelial cells (HUVECs) infected with a Δ<italic>bepE</italic> mutant of <italic>B. henselae</italic> (<italic>Bhe</italic>) displayed a cell fragmentation phenotype resulting from Bep-dependent disturbance of rear edge detachment during migration. A Δ<italic>bepCE</italic> mutant did not show cell fragmentation, indicating that BepC is critical for triggering this deleterious phenotype. Complementation of Δ<italic>bepE</italic> with BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> or its homologues from other <italic>Bartonella</italic> species abolished cell fragmentation. This cyto-protective activity is confined to the C-terminal <italic><underline>B</underline>artonella</italic> <underline>i</underline>ntracellular <underline>d</underline>elivery (BID) domain of BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> (BID2.E<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic>). Ectopic expression of BID2.E<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> impeded the disruption of actin stress fibers by Rho Inhibitor 1, indicating that BepE restores normal cell migration via the RhoA signaling pathway, a major regulator of rear edge retraction. An <italic>intradermal</italic> (<italic>i.d.</italic>) model for <italic>B. tribocorum (Btr)</italic> infection in the rat reservoir host mimicking the natural route of infection by blood sucking arthropods allowed demonstrating a vital role for BepE in bacterial dissemination from derma to blood. While the <italic>Btr</italic> mutant Δ<italic>bepDE</italic> was abacteremic following <italic>i.d.</italic> inoculation, complementation with BepE<italic><sub>Btr</sub></italic>, BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> or BIDs.E<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> restored bacteremia. Given that we observed a similar protective effect of BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> on infected bone marrow-derived dendritic cells migrating through a monolayer of lymphatic endothelial cells we propose that infected dermal dendritic cells may be involved in disseminating <italic>Bartonella</italic> towards the blood stream in a BepE-dependent manner.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cell migration, a fundamental feature of eukaryotic cells, plays a crucial role in mounting an effective immune response. However, several pathogens subvert the migratory properties of infected host cells to their benefit, such as using them as Trojan horses to disseminate within the host. <italic>Bartonella</italic> effector proteins (Beps) are <italic>bona fide</italic> virulence factors indispensable for the colonization of mammalian target cells. However, their multiple interferences with host cellular signaling processes might culminate in deleterious secondary effects that require additional effectors to maintain the host cell integrity. A striking example is BepE, which is shown here to preserve endothelial cells (ECs) from fragmentation and to inhibit the defects of dendritic cell (DCs) migration caused by BepC and possibly other Beps. Moreover, BepE is essential for <italic>Bartonella</italic> dissemination from the dermal site of inoculation to the blood stream where bacteria establish long-lasting intraerythrocytic bacteremia as a hallmark of infection in the mammalian reservoir host. Migration of <italic>Bartonella</italic>-infected DCs through a monolayer of lymphatic ECs was also found to be dependent of BepE, suggesting that BepE is required to preserve the migratory capability of DCs, a candidate cell type for systemic dissemination from the dermal site of inoculation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pathogenic bacteria have evolved a multitude of virulence factors in order to manipulate the host to evade immune responses and to reach their replicative niche - a safe compartment to proliferate that is also a prerequisite for transmissibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Monack1">[1]</xref>. Translocation of bacterial effector proteins into host cells is one of the mechanisms to manipulate the host by interfering with its signaling pathways. A prominent example is CagA, a multifunctional effector protein of the <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<italic>Hpy</italic>) type IV secretion system (T4SS). CagA modulates both innate and adaptive immune responses of the host and assists <italic>Hpy</italic> to infect the gastric mucosa in about half of the world population for their lifetime <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Lee1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Kido1">[3]</xref>. Numerous effector proteins of <italic>Salmonella</italic> type III secretion systems (T3SS) SPI1 and SPI2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Monack1">[1]</xref> and <italic>Shigella</italic> T3SS play a critical role in invasion of non-phagocytic intestinal cells, for further dissemination and modulation of the host inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Schroeder1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Diacovich1">[5]</xref>. In addition to targeting the host cellular components, some bacteria have evolved effectors that regulate an activity of each other at a specific stage of the host invasion; like <italic>Legionella</italic> Dot/Icm “metaeffector” LubX mediates the degradation of SidH. Or this interplay may happen in an indirect fashion as for many cases of T4SS/T3SS effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Shames1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>Bartonella</italic> species are fastidious, Gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacteria that are highly adapted to a distinct mammalian reservoir host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Chomel1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Boulouis1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Chomel2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Breitschwerdt1">[10]</xref>. Infections in the reservoir host range from asymptomatic or sub-clinical (for most animal-specific species) to clinical manifestations with low morbidity and limited mortality, such as human-specific <italic>B. quintana (Bqu)</italic> infections, or even to life-threatening disease, such as human infection by <italic>B. bacilliformis (Bba)</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Chomel2">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Dehio1">[11]</xref>. <italic>Bartonellae</italic> transmission is mediated by blood-sucking arthropod vectors. The strategy involves replication of bacteria in the gut of the arthropod vector and excretion in the feces, with subsequent survival in the environment for several days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Foil1">[12]</xref>. The arthropods usually defecate when feeding on mammals and provide a source of local irritation that results in itching, followed by scratching and inoculation of <italic>Bartonella</italic>-containing feces into the derma of the skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Raoult1">[13]</xref>. Later, <italic>Bartonella</italic> is known to appear in the blood of the reservoir host, invades erythrocytes as immune-privileged niche and develops long-lasting persistent infections for more than a year for some species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Dehio1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Schulein1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>Bartonellae</italic> evolved two T4SSs (Trw and VirB) while adapting to a wide range of mammalian hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Engel1">[15]</xref>. Both of them are essential for the interaction with the host but at different stages of the infection cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Schulein1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Engel1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Seubert1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Schulein2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Dehio2">[18]</xref>. The Trw system seems to mediate host-specific adhesion of <italic>Bartonella</italic> to erythrocytes by binding to the cell surface with its manifold variants of pilus subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-VayssierTaussat1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Nystedt1">[20]</xref>, while the VirB system translocates a cocktail of evolutionarily related <italic><underline>B</underline>artonella</italic> <underline>e</underline>ffector <underline>p</underline>roteins (Beps) into nucleated host cells. The Beps (named BepA-G in <italic>Bhe</italic>) evolved by duplication of an ancestral <italic>bep</italic> gene followed by their functional diversification and conservation of certain domains and motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Engel1">[15]</xref>. All Beps have at least one <italic><underline>B</underline>artonella</italic> <underline>i</underline>ntracellular <underline>d</underline>elivery (BID) domain and a positively-charged tail in the C-terminus as a signal for translocation through the T4SS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Schulein3">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>BepE is one of the effector proteins that is conserved within lineage 4, the largest clade within the <italic>Bartonella</italic> genus comprising 11 species, e.g. <italic>B. henselae, B. quintana, B. tribocorum</italic> and <italic>B. grahamii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Engel1">[15]</xref>. <italic>Bhe</italic> BepE (BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic>) consists of 464 amino acids (aa). The N-terminus of BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic>, similarly to BepD<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> and BepF<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic>, contains short repeated peptide sequences (EPLYA) with conserved putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites, similar to the EPIYA motif of <italic>Hpy</italic> effector CagA. BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> has two BID domains in the C-terminal part <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Schulein3">[21]</xref>. The domains and the motifs but not the spacing in between is well preserved in BepE homologues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Engel1">[15]</xref>. Mass spectrometric analysis of BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> pull-downs revealed several SH2 domain-containing eukaryotic signaling proteins that interact either with an individual phosphotyrosine of BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> within a Csk-like binding motif or two ITIM/ITSM (immunotyrosine inhibitory motif/immunotyrosine switch motif) tandems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Selbach1">[22]</xref>. Conservation of these specific motifs of BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> and the described interaction partners suggest a molecular mimicry of ITIM-containing receptors by bacterial proteins and a potency to interfere with host signaling pathways.</p>
<p>In this study, we identified BepE as an essential bacterial factor for <italic>Bartonella</italic> reservoir host infection via the <italic>intradermal</italic> route resembling natural infection by arthropod vectors, but not for the <italic>intravenous</italic> route. This specific function was assigned to the C-terminal part of BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> including the two BID domains. The same BID domains were interfering with a prominent cell fragmentation phenotype in migrating endothelial cell induced by BepC and possibly other Beps as a secondary effect. Further, we show that <italic>Bartonella</italic> translocates an effector-fusion protein (Bla-BID) into dendritic cells and affects cell migration in the absence of BepE, suggesting that DCs may be involved in the BepE-dependent dissemination of <italic>Bartonella</italic> to the blood.</p>

<title>BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> is sufficient to abolish a cell fragmentation phenotype induced by the <italic>Bhe</italic> Δ<italic>bepDEF</italic> mutant</title>
<p>A previous study on the interactome of <italic>Bartonella</italic> effector protein BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> revealed several SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins that interact with BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> upon phosphorylation of specific tyrosines within the motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Selbach1">[22]</xref>. Based on these data, we hypothesized that BepE might be a factor impacting multiple cellular signaling pathways to promote the establishment of a successful <italic>Bartonella</italic> infection. To acquire first insights into the cellular phenotypes and uncover the molecular bases of BepE we used the well-established human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) infection model for <italic>Bhe</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Schmid1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Rhomberg1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Schmid2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Dehio3">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Truttmann1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>BepE, together with BepD and BepF, belongs to the class of the Beps harboring tyrosine-containing motifs in their N-termini. In order to reduce the complexity of potential redundant functional effects by any of these three tyrosinephosphorylated effectors we infected HUVECs with a <italic>Bhe</italic> mutant carrying an in-frame deletion of the chromosomal region encoding <italic>bepD</italic>, <italic>bepE</italic> and <italic>bepF (Bhe</italic> Δ<italic>bepDEF)</italic>. The infection was studied by means of microscopy of either fixed samples or by time-lapse imaging over 72 h. Starting about 20–24 hours post infection (hpi) the <italic>Bhe</italic> Δ<italic>bepDEF</italic> mutant showed a drastic phenotype of cell fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004187-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004187.s010">Movie S1</xref>) which was hardly detected in cells infected with wild-type bacteria at this early stage of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004187-g001">Fig. 1B, C</xref>), but became more apparent at later time points, beyond 48 hpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004187.s011">Movie S2</xref>). Fragmenting cells were apparently normally moving forward but displayed pronounced difficulties in rear end retraction - such cells became more and more elongated and at some point the thin connection between a given cell body and the attached rear broke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004187-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The fragment left behind migrated on the substrate for a few hours and then came to a halt, while the cell body containing the nucleus got smaller with each fragmentation. Eventually, this process led also to a decreased number of cells within the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004187-g001">Fig. 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004187.s010">Movie S1</xref>).</p>

Images were acquired in 96 well-plate format by MD ImageXpress Micro automated microscopes with 10× magnification. The number of fragmented cells (cells with thin and multipolar elongations) were defined by eye and counted manually. The percentage of fragmented cells is normalized to <italic>Bhe</italic> wild-type infection. In each condition triplicate wells with each 10 randomly picked fields were imaged and presented as mean +/− SD. Statistical significance was determined using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test. <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

<p>We next delineated the functional domain responsible for the abrogation of cell fragmentation in BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic>. As indicated earlier, BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> has two BID domains at its C-terminus plus a positively charged C-tail. These domains (BID1.E<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> and BID2.E<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic>) show high similarity (pair-wise aa identity of 53.3%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004187.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>) and thus seem to be originated from a duplication event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Engel1">[15]</xref>. To understand which part of BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> was responsible for the effect observed during the infection of HUVECs, BIDs.E<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> and BID2.E<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> were expressed in <italic>Bhe</italic> Δ<italic>bepE</italic> as they both contain an intact C-term required for translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004187-g002">Fig. 2B–E</xref>) and then used to infect HUVECs. The two BID domains (BIDs.E<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic>) do overcome the <italic>Bhe</italic> Δ<italic>bepE</italic>-induced cell fragmentation phenotype. Even more, BID2.E<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> is able to complement with almost the same efficiency as full length BepE.</p>
<p>In summary, these data indicate that the inhibition of cell fragmentation by BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> was mediated by the BID domains of BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> and more specifically, the BID2.E<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> was sufficient.</p>

<p>In order to avoid that BepE translocation interferes with BepC and possibly other Beps contributing to the cell fragmentation phenotype, we performed a mixed infection experiment with the strain <italic>Bhe</italic> Δ<italic>bepE</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004187-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>) that triggers cell fragmentation and strain expressing BepE in an effector-free mutant background (<italic>Bhe</italic> Δ<italic>bepA-G</italic>-p<italic>BepE</italic>). The results showed that BepE translocated by one strain can suppress the cell fragmentation phenotype mediated by the effectors translocated by the other strain.

<p>Next we expressed BepE ectopically in HUVECs in order to complement the data obtained for inhibition of cell fragmentation by VirB-translocated BepE.

<p>Observing that BepE interferes with deleterious secondary effects of other Beps on migrating cells during <italic>Bartonella</italic> infection <italic>in vitro</italic> we became interested to examine the role of BepE in the establishment of infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>Bhe</italic> causes intraerythrocytic bacteremia as hallmark of infection in its feline natural reservoir host only, which for ethical reasons is not an accessible experimental model. However, as we have noted functional conservation among BepE homologues (including <italic>Btr</italic>) in protecting the <italic>Bhe</italic> Δ<italic>bepDEF</italic>-mediated fragmentation of HUVECs we reasoned that we can switch to <italic>Btr</italic> as appropriate species for experimental infection of rats as its natural host. Initially we employed the well-described <italic>intravenous</italic> (<italic>i.v.</italic>) infection by <italic>Btr</italic> that leads to the onset of intraerythrocytic bacteremia at 5 days post infection (dpi) following colonization of the so called “primary niche” that is considered to include vascular endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Schulein1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Schulein2">[17]</xref>. <italic>Btr</italic> encodes the BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> homologues BepD<italic><sub>Btr</sub></italic> and BepE<italic><sub>Btr</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004187-g009">Fig. 9A</xref>) that both cause partial protection of HUVECs from <italic>Bhe</italic> Δ<italic>bepDEF</italic>–mediated cell fragmentation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004187-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).

We thus adapted <italic>i.d.</italic> inoculation to our rat model to test for a possible role of BepE at the very early dermal stage of natural infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004187-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004187.s006">Fig. S6A</xref>).

<p><italic>In vivo</italic> experimental data from rat <italic>i.d.</italic> infections suggests a role for BepE in the establishment of infection at very early stages, prior to the invasion of the blood system. In addition, the <italic>in vitro</italic> model demonstrates that BepE is essential to inhibit fragmentation of infected HUVECs by interfering with the effect of other Beps. To better understand the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of BepE and based on our <italic>in vitro</italic> data, we decided to further explore the impact of BepE on cell migration for a cell type potentially relevant to the very early infection process. Assuming that the initial site of <italic>Bartonella</italic> infection is in derma, we speculate that innate immune cells represent the yet unidentified primary infection niche and consider resident dendritic cells (DCs) as a candidate cell type. These cells have high potency of phagocytosis and the property to migrate towards lymph nodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Savina1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Shortman1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Skinner1">[39]</xref>.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004187-g010">Fig. 10B</xref>, BMDCs infected prior with <italic>Bhe</italic> Δ<italic>bepDEF</italic> revealed less efficiency in 3D trans-well migration compared to uninfected or <italic>Bhe</italic> wild-type infection conditions.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Various bacterial pathogens secrete multiple effectors that act in concert to modulate different host cellular functions during the course of infection. Often these effectors may interfere with the activity of each other – either directly or indirectly – in order to orchestrate their multi-pronged interactions with the host in a spatially and temporally controlled manner. We have discovered a particularly striking example in <italic>Bartonella</italic>. We found that BepE acts via BID2.E<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> on the RhoA signaling pathway, thereby alleviating deleterious secondary effects of BepC and possibly other Beps. These Beps have distinct functions within the host cell; however, in the absence of BepE, they result in an impaired cell migration and subsequent fragmentation of the infected ECs. Moreover, the rat model of <italic>Btr i.d.</italic> infection, which recapitulates the natural way of <italic>Bartonella</italic> infection by an arthropod, revealed the role of BepE and its BID domains on the dermal stage of infection, thus showing its essential role in establishing reservoir host infection.</p>
<p><italic>Bartonella</italic> effectors are known to exhibit functional redundancy, i.e. the ability of structurally different elements to perform a similar function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Edelman1">[42]</xref>. As an example, the F-actin-dependent uptake of <italic>Bhe</italic> via the invasome structure is triggered by distinct Bep-dependent pathways, either by BepC<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> and BepF<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic>, or by BepG<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Truttmann1">[27]</xref>. All Beps harbor at their C-terminus a bipartite T4SS signal composed of a BID domain and a positively-charged tail sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Schulein3">[21]</xref>, while only BepD<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic>, BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> and BepF<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> contain multiple tyrosinephosphorylation motifs (ITIM/ITSM) in their N-terminal domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Selbach1">[22]</xref>. Assuming functional redundancy among this class of effectors we initially focused on the <italic>Bhe</italic> Δ<italic>bepDEF</italic> mutant in infection experiments in HUVECs, the latter representing a well-established <italic>in vitro</italic> model for <italic>Bhe</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Schmid1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Rhomberg1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Schmid2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Dehio3">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Truttmann1">[27]</xref>. HUVEC infection with <italic>Bhe</italic> Δ<italic>bepDEF</italic> resulted in a prominently impaired cell migration phenotype. Cell migration is a complex process that requires a series of repetitive but highly coordinated processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Larsen1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Lamalice1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Insall1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Ponti1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-ZaidelBar1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Wood1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Miao1">[49]</xref>. The first step of forward protrusion of lamellipodia and filopodia involves extensive remodeling of the F-actin cytoskeleton. Next, attachment at the leading edge occurs via focal adhesion complexes. After the formation of new adhesions, cells undergo actomyosin-dependent contraction to pull the cell body forward. Coincidently, cell adhesions at the rear of the cell are released such that the cell can move forward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Larsen1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Lamalice1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Insall1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Ponti1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-ZaidelBar1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Wood1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Miao1">[49]</xref>. <italic>Bhe</italic> Δ<italic>bepDEF</italic>-infected cells were deficient in rear end detachment and thus underwent fragmentation. Despite the similarity in domain architecture of BepD<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic>, BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> and BepF<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic>, only BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> and its homologues in other <italic>bartonellae</italic> were able to suppress cell fragmentation, which was shown both by bacterial mutant complementation and by ectopic expression of GFP-BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> within HUVECs.</p>
<p>The cell fragmentation phenotype is T4SS-dependent and strictly requires translocation of BepC<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic>, while we have not tested whether other Beps not encoded in the cell fragmentation-inducing strain <italic>Bhe</italic> Δ<italic>bepDEF</italic> (i.e. BepA, BepB or BepG) may also contribute to the cell fragmentation phenotype. As already mentioned, BepC<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic>, BepF<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> and BepG<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic>, are involved in invasome formation via massive F-actin rearrangements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Rhomberg1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Truttmann1">[27]</xref>. While this process enables <italic>Bartonella</italic> to be taken up efficiently as large aggregates it is tempting to speculate that the action of BepC and possibly BepG on cell cytoskeleton could affect rear end detachment during cell migration and thereby trigger the cell fragmentation phenotype. Although, by ectopic co-expression with BepC in HUVECs we demonstrated that BepE is reducing the stark influence on a cell cytoskeleton, future studies should address whether BepE acts as a “metaeffector” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Jermy1">[50]</xref>, which acts directly on BepC to modulate its function inside host cells, or rather indirectly tempering its activity at a different level.</p>
<p>GFP-tagged BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> was found to be transiently enriched at the rear edge of migrating cells. This localization is consistent with a potential role of BepE in modulating focal adhesion turnover at the rear edge of the cell as a possible mechanism to counteract the cell fragmentation phenotype triggered by other Bep(s). Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), GEFs for Rho and the Rho effectors ROCK and mDia are crucial for the regulation of the adhesion turnover and rear edge retraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Iwanicki1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Rid1">[29]</xref>. mDia is a formin that produces F-actin filaments by nucleation and polymerization, while ROCK activates myosin to cross-link to F-actin for induction of actomyosin bundles and contractility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Chaturvedi1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Narumiya1">[52]</xref>. Functional interferences with any of these components would disturb normal cell migration. Small GTPases are targeted by numerous bacterial effectors and several examples are known for pairs of effectors secreted by a given pathogen that have opposing effects on their regulation. <italic>Salmonella</italic> SopE and SptP have adopted GEF and GAP functions for CDC42 and RAC1, respectively, that allow to temporally switch between their active and inactive forms; first to induce membrane ruffle-mediated uptake of bacteria, which is followed by stabilization of the remodeled F-actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Kubori1">[53]</xref>. Another example is the <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> effectors Drra/SidM and LepB that are known to regulate the Rab1 activity and dynamic membrane remodeling of the <italic>Legionella</italic>-containing phagosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Ingmundson1">[54]</xref>. The Bep-dependent cell fragmentation phenotype, observed in the absence of BepE, might be related to the inhibition of RhoA. Inhibition of RhoA activity by its inhibitor, C3 (<italic>C. botulinum</italic> exoenzyme), leads to marked morphological changes of migrating monocytes, with frequent polarization and long tails trailed behind the cell body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Worthylake1">[30]</xref> - a phenotype reminiscent to an early stage of cell fragmentation. A counteraction of BepE on the RhoA signaling pathway is supported by the fact that ectopic expression of GFP-BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> interferes with the inhibitory effect of the C3-based Rho inhibitor 1, as shown by stress fiber preservation in GFP-BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic>-expressing cells. However, BepE was not able to potentiate any stress fibers when using the ROCK inhibitor Y27632. Based on these observations, BepE could be a factor that directly (or indirectly) activates RhoA independently of Rho inhibitor 1-mediated ADP-ribosylation at asparagine 41 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Kim1">[33]</xref>.</p>

The prominent activity of BepE homologues in restoring cell migration raised our interest to decipher the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of this effector protein. <italic>Bartonella</italic>-reservoir host interaction has been studied in a rat model developed by Schulein <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Schulein1">[14]</xref>. In this model, intravenously (<italic>i.v.</italic>) injected <italic>Btr</italic> wild-type are rapidly cleared from the blood stream, which remains sterile for at least three days. On day four, the bacteria re-appear in the blood where they adhere to and invade erythrocytes. Approximately every five days, a new wave of bacteria is seeded into the blood stream and invades erythrocytes, sustaining the bacteremia for about ten weeks. This is in accordance with other animal models, such as <italic>B. grahamii</italic> (<italic>Bgr</italic>) <italic>i.v.</italic> infection of mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Koesling1">[56]</xref>.

Upon <italic>i.v.</italic> infection the course of bacteremia was similar in cases of wild-type and <italic>Btr</italic> Δ<italic>bepDE</italic> mutant bacteria. In an <italic>i.d.</italic> infection model that reflects much better the initial dermal stage of <italic>Bartonella</italic> infection, wild-type bacteria still caused bacteremia, yet with a 4–5 day time delay compared to the <italic>i.v.</italic> model. In contrast, animals infected with the <italic>Btr</italic> Δ<italic>bepDE</italic> mutant remained abacteremic, while complementation with BepE restored bacteremia. This data suggests (i) that <italic>Bartonella</italic> presumably initially infects some cell type(s) in the derma, and (ii) that spreading the infection to the blood stream (possibly via the lymphatic system) is BepE-dependent. Previous studies based on the <italic>i.v.</italic> infection model describe components of <italic>Btr</italic> VirB T4SS to be essential for colonization of the “primary niche”, while those were dispensable for the subsequent stage of intraerythrocytic infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Schulein2">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-VayssierTaussat1">[19]</xref>. Addressing an earlier stage of vector-borne infection, our results in the <italic>i.d.</italic> model demonstrate that the VirB T4SS and specifically BepE are already required at the dermal stage of infection. This revisits our understanding of intracellular niches of <italic>Bartonella</italic>. We suggest replacing the old term “primary niche” by “blood seeding niche” and introducing “dermal niche” as a new term describing the preceding dermal stage of arthropod-borne infection.</p>
<p>The BepE-dependent phenotypes <italic>in vivo</italic> (progression from dermal to blood stage infection in the <italic>i.d.</italic> model) and <italic>in vitro</italic> (suppression of cell fragmentation and stress fiber disassembly by Rho inhibitor 1 activity) were consistently mediated by the BID domains of BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic>. In fact, most phenotypes mediated by Beps of <italic>Bhe</italic> are attributed to a BID domain – further to the essential role of the most C-terminal BID domain as part of the bi-partite secretion signal for T4SS-dependent effector translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Schulein3">[21]</xref> this domain has thus adopted diverse effector functions within host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Engel1">[15]</xref>. The anti-apoptotic activity of BepA<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> is confined to its single BID domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Truttmann1">[27]</xref>, and the F-actin remodeling activity of BepF is mediated by its multiple BID domains. Surprisingly, the phosphotyrosine-containing motifs in the N-terminal part of BepE that were shown to recruit multiple SH2-domain containing signaling proteins of the host cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Selbach1">[22]</xref> revealed no essential role in the here described BepE-dependent <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes. However, we suggest that investigation of these motifs may be relevant in cells infected in the “dermal niche”, e.g. to modulate immune responses. DCs represent one of the candidate cell types for <italic>Bartonella</italic> infection in this “dermal niche”. In steady state skin DCs include immature epidermal DCs, Langerhans cells (LCs) and immature dermal DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-LopezBravo1">[57]</xref>. Those have a high phagocytic activity and constantly sample the environment as sentinels for foreign antigens (Ag) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Randolph1">[58]</xref>. Ag uptake induces the activation/maturation of DCs by starting a directional migration towards the draining lymph nodes and up-regulation of MHC class II/co-stimulatory molecules. Finally, in the lymph nodes DCs form an immune synapse with naive T cells and present Ags, and as a consequence initiate effective adaptive immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Alvarez1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Gorvel1">[60]</xref>. Considering that BepE is recruited to cell-to-cell contacts, the phosphotyrosine motifs and their proposed mimickry of immune inhibitory receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Selbach1">[22]</xref> could be a valid tool to modulate signaling pathways within the immune synapse and thus altering the initiation of an adaptive immunity. On the way to lymph nodes DCs may serve as transporters of bacterial cargo. This strategy is considered to be used by other bacterial pathogens, such as <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Salcedo1">[61]</xref> or <italic>Bordetella bronchiseptica</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004187-Skinner1">[39]</xref>, to disseminate within their mammalian hosts. When <italic>Btr</italic> Δ<italic>bepDE</italic> infects the rat reservoir host we think that at the dermal stage fragmentation or impaired migration of yet unknown infected cells may occur that would prevent further dissemination of bacteria and colonization of the blood stream. This is further supported by our finding that migration of BMDCs in a trans-well migration assay is blocked by infection with <italic>Bhe</italic> Δ<italic>bepDEF</italic>, while expression of BepE<italic><sub>Bhe</sub></italic> in this mutant background restores it. Albeit it is difficult to compare directly the phenotypic changes in DC (altered cell migration) and HUVECs (fragmentation) upon <italic>Bartonella</italic> infection, yet considering dermal DCs as “dermal niche” for <italic>Bartonella</italic> represents a valid hypothesis to be investigated <italic>in vivo</italic>. Future work should also address how exactly the complex <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotype of cell fragmentation translates into the striking <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype - lack of spreading from derma to blood.</p>
<p>In summary, this study builds on extending the “primary niche” of <italic>Bartonella</italic> infection that precedes blood stage infection in the mammalian reservoir host to a dermal stage reflecting natural infection by blood-sucking arthropods. Using this <italic>i.d.</italic> model we describe for the first time a specific role for a <italic>Bartonella</italic> effector protein <italic>in vivo</italic>, i.e. BepE is required to spread infection from the dermal site of inoculation to the blood, possibly via promoting normal migration of infected DCs by alleviating deleterious secondary effects mediated by other Beps targeting the RhoA pathway. As a result, this functional crosstalk between Beps could facilitate that <italic>Bartonella</italic> reaches its replicative niche in the blood, where it multiplies and persists within the immune-privileged intracellular compartment of erythrocytes, from where it is picked up by blood-sucking arthropods for transmission to naive hosts.</p>
