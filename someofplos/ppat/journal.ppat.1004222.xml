<abstract>
<p>The Dot/Icm system of the intracellular pathogen <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> has the capacity to deliver over 270 effector proteins into host cells during infection. Important questions remain as to spatial and temporal mechanisms used to regulate such a large array of virulence determinants after they have been delivered into host cells. Here we investigated several <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effector proteins that contain a conserved phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P)-binding domain first described in the effector DrrA (SidM). This PI4P binding domain was essential for the localization of effectors to the early <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-containing vacuole (LCV), and DrrA-mediated recruitment of Rab1 to the LCV required PI4P-binding activity. It was found that the host cell machinery that regulates sites of contact between the plasma membrane (PM) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) modulates PI4P dynamics on the LCV to control localization of these effectors. Specifically, phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase IIIα (PI4KIIIα) was important for generating a PI4P signature that enabled <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effectors to localize to the PM-derived vacuole, and the ER-associated phosphatase Sac1 was involved in metabolizing the PI4P on the vacuole to promote the dissociation of effectors. A defect in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> replication in macrophages deficient in PI4KIIIα was observed, highlighting that a PM-derived PI4P signature is critical for biogenesis of a vacuole that supports intracellular multiplication of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>. These data indicate that PI4P metabolism by enzymes controlling PM-ER contact sites regulate the association of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effectors to coordinate early stages of vacuole biogenesis.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The intracellular pathogen <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> encodes at least 270 effectors that modulate trafficking of the pathogen-occupied vacuole. The mechanisms by which effectors are controlled in host cells are of key interest. Spatial and temporal regulation of effector function has been proposed to involve effector binding to host phosphoinositides. We present results showing that <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> utilizes the host kinase PI4KIIIα to generate PI4P on the bacterial vacuole and this signature mediates the localization of DrrA and subsequent recruitment of the GTPase Rab1. Additionally, it was found that the host PI4P phosphatase Sac1 was involved in consuming PI4P on the vacuole, which reduced DrrA-mediated recruitment of Rab1 to the LCV. Our data supports the recent concept that PI4KIIIα is important for generation of the plasma-membrane pool of PI4P in host cells, and demonstrates a functional consequence for PI4P-binding by an <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effector protein.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Intracellular pathogens co-opt host processes to facilitate pathogen survival and replication within the eukaryotic host. To do this, many bacterial pathogens possess secretion systems that transport bacterial proteins into host cells to orchestrate their intracellular survival. After uptake by phagocytic host cells, the gram-negative bacterium <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> prevents transport of the vacuole in which it resides through the canonical endocytic pathway, and actively transforms this vacuole into an organelle that supports bacterial replication. Specifically, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)- derived vesicles are rapidly recruited to the plasma membrane (PM) -derived vacuole in which <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> resides after uptake by host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Tilney1">[1]</xref>. These early secretory vesicles originating from the ER appear to fuse with the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> vacuole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Derre1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Kagan2">[4]</xref>. Functional interactions between PM-localized t-SNAREs present on the <italic>L. pneumophila-</italic>containing vacuole (LCV) and ER-localized SNARE Sec22b likely contribute towards this remodeling process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Arasaki1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Petkovic1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Effector proteins delivered by the Dot/Icm secretion system contribute to trafficking and remodeling of the vacuole containing <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>. The protein DrrA (also known as SidM) is an effector with guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity that directly activates the host GTPase Rab1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Machner1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Murata1">[8]</xref>. Rab1 is an important regulator of membrane transport in the early secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Stenmark1">[9]</xref>. The GEF domain of DrrA (amino acids 340–533) is necessary for recruitment of Rab1 to LCVs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Machner1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Murata1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Ingmundson1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Schoebel1">[12]</xref>. Recent data indicate that activation of Rab1 on the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-containing vacuole is sufficient for promoting the tethering and fusion of ER-derived vesicles with this plasma membrane-derived organelle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Arasaki2">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>DrrA is found associated with the LCV membrane within the first hour of infection, but dissociates from the LCV at roughly 4 hours post-infection, which is when remodeling of the LCV to an ER-like organelle is evident <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Tilney1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Ingmundson1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Neunuebel1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Robinson1">[15]</xref>. The temporal association of DrrA on the LCV membrane illustrates how the timing, localization and function of effector proteins is likely to be important for coordinating events that mediate biogenesis of the specialized vacuole in which <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> replicates. This is further demonstrated by the discovery of additional proteins that tightly regulate Rab1 recruitment and function during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection. After Rab1 is recruited onto the early LCV by the GEF activity of DrrA, Rab1 function is modulated by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effectors that posttranslationally modify the switch II region of the GTPase. Rab1 is AMPylated by an adenylyltransferase domain located in a domain at the amino terminus of DrrA protein or phosphocholinated by the effector protein AnkX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Mukherjee1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Muller1">[17]</xref>. These modifications appear to affect Rab1 function by limiting interactions with several host cell proteins that associate with Rab1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Goody1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Oesterlin1">[19]</xref>. A de-AMPylase activity associated with the effector SidD was found to remove the AMP moiety from Rab1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Neunuebel1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Rigden1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Tan1">[21]</xref> and the protein Lem3 has a dephosphocholination activity that can remove the phosphocholine moiety from Rab1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Tan2">[22]</xref>. These effectors render Rab1 susceptible to inactivation by the effector LepB, which facilitates removal of Rab1 from the mature LCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Neunuebel1">[14]</xref>. It is believed that the activities of these proteins are coordinately regulated <italic>in vivo</italic> by spatial cues that signify changes in vacuole morphology, but the cellular signaling mechanisms controlling these processes remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>Spatial localization of DrrA in host cells involves a C-terminal region of the protein that possesses phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P)-binding activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Murata1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Brombacher1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Hammond1">[26]</xref>. Phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) are negatively charged phospholipids displayed on the cytosolic face of cellular membranes. Production of specific PIP species is spatially and temporally regulated by kinases and phosphatases, and the seven different PIP species are considered markers of specific cellular compartments. Importantly, these PIPs act as regulators of cellular processes due to their ability to aid in the targeting of PIP-binding proteins to discrete membrane surfaces within cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-DiPaolo1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Vicinanza2">[30]</xref>. Numerous conserved domains have been shown to confer specific PIP binding properties to proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-DiNitto1">[31]</xref>. These include pleckstrin homology (PH), FYVE (acronym of Fab1, YOTB, Vac1 and EEA1), and phox homology (PX) domains. Domains shown to bind to PI4P include PH, Tom1 (GAT), and epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH).</p>
<p>An increasing number of bacterial pathogens possess effectors that are able to mimic host enzymes involved in generation of specific host phosphoinositides required to facilitate bacterial survival by modulation of cellular membranes utilized by the pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-PizarroCerda1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Weber1">[33]</xref>. Vacuoles containing <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> isolated from the protozoan host <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> stain positive with an anti-PI4P antibody and with a GST-FAPP1 PH domain-containing probe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Weber2">[34]</xref>, and the effector SidC that also binds to PI4P <italic>in vitro</italic> localizes to vacuoles during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Ragaz1">[35]</xref>. Thus, it is likely that PI4P is an important determinant that regulates the activities of both host and effector proteins on the LCV, including DrrA. However, the precise role PI4P plays in modulating effector localization and the origin of the PI4P residing on the LCV membrane remain unclear. The <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effector protein SidF, which has lipid phosphatase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Hsu1">[36]</xref>, is a bacterial determinant that participates in PIP metabolism. <italic>In vitro</italic> assays demonstrated that SidF can hydrolyse the D3 phosphate of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, which would facilitate PI4P production. Indeed, it was found that Δ<italic>sidF</italic> mutant <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> reside in vacuoles with reduced levels of SidC association, which supports the hypothesis that SidF has a role in maintaining PI4P levels on the LCV membrane.</p>
<p>Although the Golgi apparatus is the most prominent organelle staining positive for PI4P, the PM, ER and endosomes also contain PI4P <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-DAngelo1">[37]</xref>. Control of PI4P production is achieved by the subcellular distribution of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases, which based on sensitivities to adenosine and wortmannin are grouped as type II and type III, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Balla1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Downing1">[39]</xref>. The levels of PI4P on specific compartments is further regulated by the conversion of PI4P to PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> or PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> by specific kinases, and by dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to PI4P or PI4P to PI by phosphatases. Although progress has been made in determining the roles of PIP-metabolizing enzymes in the generation of specific pools of PI4P, most of the known PI4P-binding probes primarily localize to the Golgi-apparatus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Balla2">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Yu1">[43]</xref>. This abundant pool of PI4P is largely generated by the <italic>cis/medial</italic> Golgi-localized PI4KIIIβ (encoded by <italic>PI4KB</italic> and <italic>Pik1</italic> in mammals and yeast, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-WalchSolimena1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Wong1">[46]</xref>. Because the majority of PI4P probes target the Golgi-localized pool of PI4P it has been difficult to track the outcome of perturbation, by chemical inhibition or siRNA knockdown, of PI-phosphatases or kinases on less abundant pools of PI4P. Despite this challenge several groups have demonstrated that PI4P is an important determinant at the PM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Balla1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Hammond2">[47]</xref>, and identified the host kinase PI4KIIIα (encoded by <italic>PI4KA</italic> and <italic>Stt4</italic> in mammals and yeast, respectively) as important for generation of the PM pool of PI4P in eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Balla1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Balla2">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Nakatsu1">[48]</xref>. In yeast Stt4 has been reported to localize at phosphoinositide kinase (PIK) patches that are stable cortical membrane sites enriched in Stt4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Baird1">[49]</xref>. These sites have been proposed to reside at membrane contact sites linked to the ER to coordinate lipid transfer and signaling events between these two organelles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Baird1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Levine2">[50]</xref>. In support of this, after interaction with oxysterol-binding homology (Osh) proteins, which act as sensors of PI4P levels, the ER-localized Sac1 phosphatase acts in <italic>trans</italic> at ER-plasma membrane contact sites to reduce PM PI4P levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Stefan1">[51]</xref>. In mammalian cells ER-localization of PI4KIIIα was reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Wong1">[46]</xref>, but recent direct visualization studies have show localization of PI4KIIIα at the PM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Nakatsu1">[48]</xref>.</p>
<p>Importantly, the PI4P-binding domain of DrrA localizes to the PM when expressed ectopically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Murata1">[8]</xref>, suggesting that <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effectors may have evolved to recognize this PM-localized pool of PI4P and that this signature may be used for the localization of effectors to the LCV membrane. Thus, we set out here to investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> role for this effector-encoded PI4P binding domain in an effort to understand the origin and function of PI4P during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> vacuole transport, and to determine if <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> subverts the host machinery used to maintain PI4P levels in the cell to temporally regulate effector localization.</p>

<title>Lpg1101 and Lpg2603 have a domain that constitutes a conserved <italic>Legionella</italic> Effector PI4P-binding Region (LEPR)</title>
<p>The <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> proteins Lpg1101 and Lpg2603 were predicted to have a C-terminal region that was highly similar to the C-terminal region in DrrA, and amino terminal regions with no significant amino acid homology to proteins of known function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). A calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase (Cya) assay was used to show that both Lpg1101 and Lpg2603 could be delivered into host cells by the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> Dot/Icm system, suggesting these proteins are both effectors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). When these proteins were aligned, two regions were identified with a very high degree of amino acid identity to residues in the DrrA PI4P-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Unlike DrrA, the effector Lpg1101 did not bind to Rab1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, consistent with the homology between the two proteins being outside of any known Rab-interacting regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Consistent with the PI4P-binding activity of DrrA being contained in this region of homology, both Lpg1101 and Lpg2603 showed specific binding of PI4P using <italic>in vitro</italic> lipid binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

We confirmed that amino acids 501–647 of DrrA were sufficient for PM localization when ectopically expressed in host cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). This localization pattern was somewhat unexpected considering that many proteins with PI4P-binding domains localize primarily to the Golgi apparatus. To determine whether PM localization is a general feature of effectors containing a LEPR, the localization of Lpg1101 and Lpg2603 was examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g002">Figure 2A</xref> panel 1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s001">S1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s001">S1E</xref>). Indeed, PM localization was observed for both effectors. In addition to mediating PI4P binding, the LEPR of DrrA also mediates an interaction with PM-localized syntaxins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Arasaki2">[13]</xref>, which could contribute to DrrA localization to the PM. As shown previously, the LEPR region of DrrA co-immunoprecipitated with PM syntaxins Stx2, Stx3 and Stx4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), but Lpg1101 or Lpg2603 did not co-precipitate with PM syntaxins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Unlike DrrA, Lpg1101 and Lpg2603 did not mediate recruitment of Rab1 to the PM, consistent with Lpg1101 and Lpg2603 having no homology to the Rab1-binding region in the GEF domain of DrrA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). Mutations were introduced into highly conserved amino acids in the LEPRs to determine if these residues were critical for PM localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Conservative substitutions (D→E and K→R) corresponding to D565 and K568 in DrrA were made in DrrA, Lpg1101, and Lpg2603; and alanine substitutions were made to conserved residues found in the PI4P-binding pocket of DrrA corresponding to K568 and T619. These mutations perturbed membrane targeting for all three effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Localization to the PM as determined by fluorescence microscopy was affected by these mutations, and cell fractionation studies indicated that these mutations affected the distribution of each protein from the membrane fraction to the cytosolic fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Importantly, the D→E and K→R mutations in DrrA, Lpg1101 and Lpg2603 perturbed binding of the purified His-tagged effectors to PI4P on immobilized lipid arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, the conserved residues in the LEPR are required for PI4P binding and are important for interactions between these effector proteins and lipids on the host PM.</p>

The three left panels show the localization of the wild type (WT) protein, and the three right panels show the localization pattern observed for proteins having alanine substitutions to the conserved lysine and threonine residues in the LEPR corresponding to positions K568 and T619 in DrrA (K-A, T-A mutant). Cells were co-transfected with a plasmid producing an RFP-protein containing a palmitoylation sequence (RFP-PALM) to label the plasma membrane. (B) Fractionation of HEK293 cells expressing GFP- or EYFP-tagged effector proteins shown in (A). Note the shift in the population of effectors from the membrane fraction towards the cytosolic fraction in cells expressing the mutant versions of the effectors. A shift in the fractionation profiles is not observed in the control blots for the membrane protein calnexin or the cytosolic marker protein alpha tubulin. P = pellet, C = cytosol, M = membrane.

<p>In addition to binding PI4P, structural studies have identified a membrane insertion motif (MIM) that is comprised of conserved polar residues lining the PI4P binding pocket in the LEPR domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-DelCampo1">[52]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that upon PI4P binding the MIM region contacts acyl chains in the core of the lipid membrane, which stabilizes the interaction between the LEPR domain and liposomes displaying PI4P. To address whether membrane penetration by the MIM domain is important for PM localization <italic>in vivo</italic> we tested LEPR domain mutant proteins in which conserved leucine residues in the MIM domain were substituted for alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s005">Figure S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s006">S6</xref>). Single and double amino acid substitutions L610A, L617A and L614A/L615A in the MIM domain of DrrA retained PM localization. The triple mutant L610A/L614A/L614A was localized primarily to the cytosol, however, some peripheral localization was still detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s005">Figure S5</xref>). A second DrrA triple mutant defective in three MIM domain leucine residues L614A/L615A/L617A and a quadruple MIM mutant L610A/L614A/615A/L617A displayed cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Likewise, an Lpg1101 quadruple MIM mutant L288A/V292A/T293A/I295A displayed cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Systematic analysis of each of lysine residues within the MIM domain of Lpg2603 was not performed because it was found that a single L405A substitution was sufficient to shift the localization of the Lpg2603 LEPR domain from the PM to the cytosol. This was in contrast to the DrrA- and Lpg1101-LEPR domains with single or double substitutions in MIM domain residues, which did not result in a profound defect in PM localization. Thus, these data indicate that membrane penetration by the MIM domain contributes to PM localization of LEPR domain-containing effectors.</p>

<p>Although an important role for the LEPR can be inferred from data showing this region is sufficient for PI4P binding <italic>in vitro</italic>, it is unknown whether PI4P binding is critical for the functioning of LEPR-containing effectors <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Consistent with data in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, we observed localization of GFP-FAPP1 to vacuoles containing wild type <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> in mammalian cells at 1 hour post-infection, but not vacuoles containing a Δ<italic>dotA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s007">Figure S7A</xref>); and GFP-FAPP1R18L, which is deficient in PI4P binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Godi1">[53]</xref>, was not observed in association with LCVs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s007">Figure S7B</xref>). Thus, DrrA and PI4P are both displayed on vacuoles containing wild type <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> at 1 hour post-infection in mammalian cells.</p>
<p>Importantly, DrrA was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy on vacuoles containing wild type <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> and on vacuoles containing a Δ<italic>drrA</italic> strain complemented with wild type <italic>drrA</italic> on a plasmid; however, DrrA staining was not observed on vacuoles containing the Δ<italic>drrA</italic> strain complemented with the mutant alleles <italic>drrA</italic><sub>D565E,K568R</sub> or <italic>drrA</italic><sub>K568R,T619A</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s008">Figure S8A</xref>). Rab1 staining was conducted after infection to determine whether a defect in association of DrrA with the vacuole correlates with a defect in Rab1 recruitment to the vacuole. At 1 hr post-infection, &gt;60% of the vacuoles containing wild type <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> stained positive for Rab1 by a process that was dependent on Dot/Icm function and on DrrA function. Rab1 recruitment to vacuoles was restored when a plasmid-encoded allele of wild type <italic>drrA</italic> was used to complement the Δ<italic>drrA</italic> strain. By contrast, Rab1 recruitment was not detected on vacuoles when plasmids encoding the <italic>drrA</italic><sub>D565E/K568R</sub> or <italic>drrA</italic><sub>K568A/T619A</sub> alleles were used to complement the Δ<italic>drrA</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s008">Figure S8B</xref>). These substitutions confirm that PI4P-binding is required for DrrA function <italic>in vivo</italic>.

<title>Effectors with a LEPR localize to the early LCV</title>
<p>The presence of PI4P on vacuolar membranes and the shared targeting of the LEPR effectors to the plasma membrane suggest that Lpg1101 and Lpg2603 will target the early LCV after uptake by mammalian cells. To address this question, we first assessed LCV localization of LEPR-containing effectors expressed ectopically in host cells. Although PM localization was apparent in transfected cells, we did not detect robust localization of 3X-FLAG-DrrA or 3X-FLAG-Lpg2603 produced ectopically to LCVs containing wild type <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (data not shown), however in cells producing 3X-FLAG-Lpg1101 we detected circumferential staining around vacuoles containing <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> at early time points post-infection and this staining dissipated as the LCVs matured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Similar staining patterns were observed in a stable HEK293 cell line producing 3X-FLAG-Lpg1101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and during transient transfection of HeLa cells with a plasmid producing YFP-Lpg1101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Using the strong localization signal of Lpg1101 on early LCVs, the importance of the PI4P-binding pocket and MIM regions for vacuolar targeting of Lpg1101 was examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g005">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Mutation of residues in both the PI4P-binding pocket and the MIM domain disrupted the localization of Lpg1101 to the LCV. These data confirm that the LEPR domain in Lpg1101 mediates effector localization to the early LCV.</p>

<p>Localization of Lpg1101 and Lpg2603 produced endogenously and translocated during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection was examined by indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies generated against purified recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s009">Figure S9</xref>).

A limited number of Lpg1101-positive LCVs were observed 30 minutes after infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s009">Figure S9B</xref>), however, staining was weak and could not be confirmed to be specific. Thus, Lpg1101 may be produced at low levels or regulated differently than Lpg2603, and additional studies aimed at localization of Lpg1101 were not conducted.</p>
<p>Endogenously produced Lpg2603 was detected on LCVs containing wild type <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> and was not detected on vacuoles containing the Δ<italic>dotA</italic> mutant or the Δ<italic>lpg2603</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s009">Figure S9C</xref>).

<p>Although the function of Lpg2603 remains unknown, ectopic production of Lpg2603 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> interfered with yeast replication by a process that required a functional LEPR domain. A yeast growth defect was observed in cells expressing Lpg2603 and Lpg2603 G354A, which localize to the PM in mammalian cells, but not in yeast expressing the non-PM-targeting Lpg2603 D355E,K358R mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g006">Figure 6C,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Similar levels of Lpg2603 expression were observed for all Lpg2603-expressing yeast strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). The growth phenotype observed for Lpg2603 was weaker than that observed for RalF and YlfA, effectors previously found to cause growth defects in yeast.

His-DrrA<sub>D565E/K568R</sub>, which failed to bind to PI4P in immobilized lipid arrays, showed weak localization to the Golgi-apparatus in the presence or absence of functional PI4KIIIα, likely due to Rab1-binding. Diminished PM localization of His-Lpg1101 and His-Lpg2603 was also observed in TMX treated compared to ethanol control MEFs from the conditional <italic>PI4KA</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).

To test whether targeting of MBP-SidC<sub>609–776</sub> is influenced by PI4KIIIβ we used the inhibitor PIK93 at 1 µM concentration and observed a substantial reduction in the perinuclear localization of SidC<sub>609–776</sub>. The reported PIK93 IC50 values for PI3K, PI4KIIIα and PI4KIIIβ are 16 nM, 921–1620 nM, and 17.5–28 nM, respectively. A substantial change in the plasma membrane localization of the control MBP-Lpg2603<sub>134–434</sub> was not observed after PIK93 treatment. These results further indicate that PI4P at the PM is an important signature that is recognized by the LEPR in DrrA and suggest PI4KIIIα is important for generating the PI4P that mediates DrrA targeting to the PM.</p>

Full length purified His-DrrA or His-DrrA D565E,K568R (5 µg/well) was added to digitonin treated immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) containing (Z)-4-hydroxytamoxifen (TMX) inducible Cre-recombinase and f<italic>lox</italic>ed PI4KIIIα. Cells were either treated with ethanol (control) or TMX (1.5 µM) for 2 days and then used 7 days later to assess DrrA localization. After washing away unbound protein, cells were fixed with 4% PFA and His-tagged detected using a specific antibody at 1∶500 (green). GRASP65 (red) and DAPI (blue) staining were used to visualize the Golgi-apparatus and nucleus, respectively. (B) Semi-intact assay showing the effects of deletion of PI4KIIIα on localization of Lpg1101 and Lpg2603. Experiment performed as in (A) using 5 µg/well His-tagged Lpg1101 and Lpg2603. For reference, fluorescent images of PI4P staining with the anti-PI4P antibody from Echelon biosciences are shown in the lower panel.</p>

<title>Spatial control of DrrA function <italic>in vivo</italic> involves the activity of PI4P metabolizing enzymes regulating ER/PM contact sites</title>
<p>If DrrA recognizes a PI4P signature generated by PI4KIIIα, then reducing PI4KIIIα in the host cells would limit DrrA association with vacuoles containing <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> and interfere with Rab1 recruitment to the LCV. To test this hypothesis, siRNA was used to silence host PI4Ks and Rab1 recruitment to the LCV was measured. Silencing of PI4KIIIα resulted in a significant decrease in Rab1 recruitment to the LCV, whereas, silencing of PI4KIIIβ did not have a measurable effect on Rab1 recruitment to the LCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). RT-PCR to measure transcript levels indicated that PI4KIIIα and PI4KIIIβ were silenced to similar levels in these cells; however, complete silencing was not obtained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s012">Figure S12C</xref>), which could explain why Rab1 recruitment to the LCV in the PI4KIIIα-silenced cells was diminished but not eliminated. Because the lipid phosphatase activity displayed by the effector SidF generates PI4P through the hydrolysis of PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> a Δ<italic>sidF</italic> mutant was used to determine if this effector was important for generating the PI4P signature used for DrrA-mediated recruitment of Rab1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). As reported previously, we found reduced SidC localization to the LCV in cells infected with the Δ<italic>sidF</italic> mutant compared to cells infected with the isogenic control strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s012">Figure S12A</xref>). Rab1 recruitment to the LCV was reduced in cells infected with the Δ<italic>sidF</italic> mutant, which would be consistent with SidF being involved in PI4P production on LCV. However, in Δ<italic>sidF</italic>-infected cells the levels of Rab1 recruitment to the LCV was even lower when PI4KIIIα was silenced. Thus, our data indicate that PI4KIIIα and the activity of SidF can independently produce a PI4P signature on the LCV that enables DrrA to recruit Rab1 to the PM-derived organelle.</p>

<p>Recent evidence from studies in yeast indicates that PI4P is metabolized at the PM through the coordinate functions of the PI4KIIIα protein and the ER-localized PI4P phosphatase Sac1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Stefan1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Manford1">[55]</xref>. Intriguingly, previous electron microscopy studies had noted a distinct similarity between ER-PM contact sites and the intimate association of ER-derived vesicles with the LCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Tilney1">[1]</xref>, thus suggesting Sac1 on ER-derived membranes may play a role in consuming PI4P on the LCV in a manner similar to that used to control PI4P levels at the PM. Indeed, a significant reduction in the recruitment of Rab1 to the LCV was observed when the human Sac1 phosphatase was overproduced in HEK293 FcγRII cells by transient transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004222-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). These data suggest the enzymes that regulate PI4P levels at sites of interaction between the PM and ER regulate PI4P levels on the LCV, and the effector protein DrrA responds to changes in PI4P levels controlled by these enzymes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>L. pneumophila</italic> must regulate the activity of at least 270 different effector proteins to successfully coordinate distinct stages of intracellular infection. Here we show that one mechanism used to control the localization of early effectors containing PI4P-binding domains is to utilize the host machinery at ER-PM contact sites that is involved in regulating PI4P-levels on the PM. Our data indicate that the host enzyme PI4KIIIα is involved in generating a pool of PI4P that mediates the localization of multiple effectors with a conserved PI4P-binding motif, and that the ER-localized Sac1 phosphatase is capable of consuming this PI4P to stimulate the dissociation of these effectors from the early LCV.</p>
<p>We report that multiple <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> Philadelphia-1 effectors utilize a conserved LEPR domain that targets these proteins to organelles derived from the plasma membrane. Previous studies have shown that the LEPR in DrrA binds to PI4P <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Brombacher1">[23]</xref>, and structural studies have identified a PI4P-binding pocket in this region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Schoebel2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Zhu1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-DelCampo1">[52]</xref>. These structural studies revealed a positively-charged pocket in the DrrA LEPR that mediates PI4P interactions, and a negatively-charged surface patch predicted to orient the protein for PI4P-binding. Many of these residues are conserved in the LEPR of Lpg1101 and Lpg2603, and these residues were critical for effector localization, as conservative mutations in key residues shared between these proteins abrogated both PM localization and <italic>in vitro-</italic>binding of these proteins to PI4P on immobilized lipid arrays. Thus, we conclude that the PI4P-binding activity displayed by these three effectors requires a functional LEPR that mediates PM localization of the effectors.</p>
<p>Targeting of DrrA to PM-derived LCVs was dependent on PI4P-binding, and directly correlated with the ability to recruit Rab1 to this membrane. Structural data identified K568 as key for interactions with the 4-phosphate of the bound ligand, and T619 as another key residue in the PI4P-binding pocket <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Zhu1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-DelCampo1">[52]</xref>. The defect in localization of the DrrA K568A/T619A mutant to either the PM or LCVs during infection confirms the importance of PI4P-binding for the biological function of DrrA. These data supports a model whereby DrrA binds to the LCV through a process that requires recognition of PI4P on the vacuole membrane and then recruits Rab1 by stimulating GDP for GTP exchange <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Blumer1">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>Targeting of eukaryotic PI4P-binding proteins to specific cellular compartments is typically facilitated by interactions with other proteins. The proteins OSBP and FAPP are targeted to the Golgi apparatus through both PI4P-binding determinants and by interacting with the small GTPase Arf1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Levine1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Godi1">[53]</xref>. Recent data on the dual interaction of FAPP1 with Arf1 and PI4P highlights the emerging concept of coincidence detection in cell signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Liu1">[57]</xref>. How effectors containing a LEPR preferentially recognize a PM-derived PI4P over another abundant pool of PI4P at the Golgi remains an interesting question. Although the LEPR in DrrA has been shown to interact with PM-localized syntaxin proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Arasaki2">[13]</xref>, the proteins Lpg1101 and Lpg2603 did not show similar interactions, suggesting that host syntaxin proteins do not constitute a common determinant that facilitates localization of LEPR-containing effectors to the PM. It remains possible that there are other host proteins that bind to the LEPR that facilitate localization to the PM-derived organelle, or that there are other properties of this organelle that are sensed by the LEPR that confer specificity, such as membrane charge or lipid composition. One such determinant is the membrane insertion motif (MIM) region of DrrA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-DelCampo1">[52]</xref>.</p>
<p>Based on the structure of the C-terminus of DrrA in complex with dibutyl PI4P, helix 14 was predicted to penetrate phospholipid membranes. Successive mutations of four key exposed leucines in the MIM domain support this hypothesis as single L610A and L617A mutants showed a 4–6 fold reduction in affinity for PI4P-containing liposomes, and double (L614A/L615A) and triple (L610A/L614A/L615A) mutants showed 91 and 440-fold reduction in affinity, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-DelCampo1">[52]</xref>. Our data addressing the importance of these leucine residues for targeting of DrrA to the PM is consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> liposome affinity data. We observed a correlation between the decrease in affinity for PI4P-containing liposomes and the ability to target to the PM in eukaryotic cells. Despite a marked decrease in affinity of the single and double exposed leucine mutants for PI4P-containing liposomes, our <italic>in vivo</italic> data showed only the most severely affected triple and quadruple mutants failed to localize to the PM. This supports the importance of the strong PI4P-binding affinity of DrrA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Schoebel2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-DelCampo1">[52]</xref>. Although the mutant L610A/L614A/L615A showed a shift in localization towards to cytoplasm, some peripheral localization was observed. PM association was not observed in the triple mutant (L614A/L615A/L617A) or in the quadruple mutant. Structural analysis places lysine 617 in direct contact with the acyl chains of the bound PI4P molecule, our data supports the importance of this lysine for membrane association because the phenotype for the L614A/L615A/L617A mutants is more severe than the L610A/L614A/L615A triple mutant. Substitutions in residues at conserved positions within Lpg1101 and Lpg2603 that are likely exposed MIM-domain residues, were also found to be important for plasma membrane localization of these effectors supporting the importance of the MIM-domain for membrane association. The effectors Lpg1101 and Lpg2603 do not show substantial localization to the Golgi-apparatus irrespective of the presence of the MIM domain, thus the MIM region is not the sole determinant that directs these effectors to the plasma membrane rather than the Golgi pool of PI4P. Although, the precise mechanism for specific targeting of the LEPR effectors to the plasma membrane pool of PI4P remains unknown it likely requires several signals as has been observed for specific membrane targeting of eukaryotic proteins to the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Hancock1">[58]</xref>.</p>
<p>Treating cells with PIK93, which is a potent and specific inhibitor of PI4KIIIβ, had no effect on DrrA function. Similarly, no effect on DrrA function was observed when PI4KIIIβ was silenced by siRNA. These data are in contrast to what has been observed in studies examining the localization of SidC to vacuoles containing <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Brombacher1">[23]</xref>. The effector SidC also binds membranes containing PI4P, however, the region of SidC containing the predicted PI4P binding determinant has no amino acid homology or predicted structural homology with the LEPR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Weber2">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Ragaz1">[35]</xref>. This suggests that the mechanism of PI4P binding may be different. Consistent with this hypothesis, it has been shown that DrrA dissociates from the LCV shortly after bacterial replication begins, whereas, the protein SidC remains localized to the mature LCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Weber2">[34]</xref>. When PI4KIIIβ levels were reduced in Drosophila Kc167 cells the amount of SidC associated with the LCV was reduced, suggesting a role for this host protein in mediating SidC localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Brombacher1">[23]</xref>. The effector phosphatase SidF is one candidate bacterial protein that could maintain a pool of PI4P recognized by SidC during infection, which would be consistent with data showing that an LCV formed by the Δ<italic>sidF</italic> mutant displays reduced levels of SidC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Hsu1">[36]</xref>. However, we found that the Δ<italic>sidF</italic> mutant also reduced vacuolar levels of Rab1 suggesting both PI4KIIIα and SidF function at early stages of infection to ensure that the LCV membrane has a PI4P signature. These data could indicate that LEPR effectors and SidC have different PI4P-binding modalities, but there is some overlap in the proteins used to generate and maintain the PI4P pools recognized by these effectors.</p>
<p>In addition to generation of vacuolar PI4P by host kinases and SidF, other mechanisms may further modulate PI on the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> phagosome. Whether other effector proteins exist with PI-kinase or phosphatase activity is unknown, but the host phosphatase OCRL has been reported to localize to the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> phagosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Weber3">[59]</xref>. OCRL normally localizes to the Golgi-apparatus, endosomes and the PM (after specific stimulation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Choudhury1">[60]</xref>. It possesses multiple protein-protein interaction domains as well as a PH domain, and is proposed to function in multiple membrane trafficking pathways, including between early endosomes and the Golgi and clathrin-mediated endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Choudhury1">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Choudhury2">[64]</xref>. The complexity of OCRL function is highlighted by the multiple defects observed in patients with Lowe's syndrome, which have mutations in OCRL. Association of OCRL with membranes occurs through interaction of active GTP-bound GTPases Rab1, Rab5, Rab6 and Rab8, with the minimal Rab-binding domain defined as amino acids 555–678 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Hou1">[65]</xref>. Although a mechanism for recruitment of OCRL to LCVs through activated Rab GTPases is possible, an N-terminal LVA (<italic><underline>L</underline>egionella</italic> <underline>v</underline>acuole <underline>a</underline>ssociation) domain of OCRL, which includes amino acids 1–236, is sufficient for vacuolar association of OCRL. In <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> deletion of the homologue of human OCRL Dd5P4 was reported to show a number of phenotypes including reduced uptake, enhanced trafficking and replication, as well as a reduction in SidC recruitment to LCVs. This data suggests that the function of OCRL is somehow deleterious for <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, but the molecular mechanisms behind these phenotypes are unknown. Clearly, vacuolar PI4P-levels must be tightly controlled during infection and mechanisms may be required to reduce vacuolar PI4P-levels or remove OCRL from vacuoles at later stages of infection. We found that the ER-localized PI4P phosphatase protein Sac1 interfered with the association of LEPR effectors with the LCV, supporting a role for these proteins in regulating the PI4P signal detected by the LEPR to signal when the PM-derived vacuoles have successfully been remodeled by ER-derived membranes. Alternatively, the role of OCRL on LCVs may not be simply PI4P production, but rather it may function in concert with its other binding partners to mediate other processes that influence vacuolar remodeling.</p>
<p>Pharmacological and genetic inhibitors indicated an important role for PI4KIIIα in generating PI4P used for localization of these effectors to the plasma membrane. These data provide support to previous studies indicating a role for PI4KIIIα in generating PI4P at the PM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Balla2">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Nakatsu1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Balla3">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Roy1">[67]</xref>. Our finding that PI4KIIIα is important to generate the vacuolar PI4P recognized by the LEPR-containing effectors supports a role for PI4KIIIα at the PM, but our results cannot distinguish the subcellular localization of the kinase during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection. Contact between cortical ER and the PM is reported to be less common in mammalian cells compared to yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Giordano1">[68]</xref>, however, although recruitment of the LEPR-containing proteins occurs before the LCV becomes positive for luminal ER proteins, ER-derived vesicles associate with the LCV shortly after uptake of the bacteria into the PM-derived phagosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Tilney1">[1]</xref>. It is also possible that PI4KIIIα is directly co-opted by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> to enhance vacuolar PI4P levels.</p>
<p>Although we did not detect a defect in intracellular replication in strains lacking all three of the LEPR-containing effectors, this lack of growth defect is expected due to the redundant mechanisms utilized by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> to survive within host cells. Our kinetic analysis suggests that Lpg1101 acts very early during infection whereas Lpg2603 may function at several stages of the infection process. The yeast growth defect observed upon expression of Lpg2603 is consistent with a previously reported yeast lethality phenotype for this effector, which may be due to interference with the yeast secretory pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004222-Heidtman1">[69]</xref>. The lack of a growth defect for yeast expressing the Lpg2603 PI4P-binding mutant suggests PI4P-targeting by Lpg2603 is functionally important during infection. Determination of the host targets of these effectors will allow future analysis of the importance of PI4-binding in modulating the activities of these effectors.</p>
<p>These data suggest a model for spatial and temporal regulation of effectors with a LEPR region. Upon <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> uptake, LEPR-containing effectors would localize to the LCV membrane through interactions with PI4P generated at the PM by PI4KIIIα. For DrrA, this localization to the LCV membrane enables the effector to recruit and activate Rab1 on the pathogen-occupied organelle. Similarly, other LEPR-containing effectors are predicted to have effector activities that are spatially regulated on the early LCV. Shortly after formation, the LCV begins to recruit ER-derived vesicles and the lipid composition of the PM-derived organelle changes to become more similar to that of the host ER. Our data indicate that the presence of the Sac1 phosphatase on these ER-derived vesicles consumes the PI4P that is used for binding of LEPR-containing effectors, and provides a signal to indicate successful remodeling of the early LCV by ER-derived vesicles. This would lead to dissociation of LEPR-containing effectors from the LCV. When DrrA binding to the LCV is abrogated, the balance in Rab1 dynamics would be shifted greatly towards a pathway of Rab1 dissociation through the activity of the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> GAP protein LepB, an effector that has a hydrophobic membrane spanning domain that anchors the protein to the LCV membrane throughout the infection cycle. Thus, these data highlight how spatial and temporal regulation of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effectors is a sophisticated process controlled by both intrinsic determinants such as PI4P-binding regions, and extrinsic determinants such as host factors that generate the organelle-specific signatures and the activity of other bacterial effectors that have additional determinants that mediate spatial regulation.</p>

<p>HEK293 FcγII cells were seeded onto poly-L-lysine (MW 75,000–150,000; Sigma Aldrich) treated coverslips 24 h prior to infection with opsonized bacteria at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 2. The bacteria were pre-complexed with a rabbit anti-<italic>Legionella</italic> antibody (1∶1000 or 1∶2000) at 37°C for 20 min prior to infection. Studies assessing localization of DrrA and Rab1 were assessed a times indicated in figure legends or at 1 hour post-infection. Infections were synchronized by spinning cells at 1000 rpm for 5 min, incubating for 30 min at 37°C and then washing three times with warm PBS. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min at 37°C. To ensure only internalized bacteria were analyzed for recruitment of DrrA or Rab1, external <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> were stained with rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1∶3000) and then washed extensively before cells were permeabilized using cold methanol. After antibody staining with antibodies against effector proteins or host-proteins and secondary Alexa Fluor 594 or Rhodamine Red-X antibodies, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining (DAPI) was used to identify all bacteria. In experiments using the HEK293 FcγII YFP-Rab1 stable cell line infections were performed with dsRed expressing <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> strains and inside/out staining was not performed. For infection experiments assessing the effect of transiently expressed Sac1 on Rab1 recruitment to LCVs, Rab1 was detected by indirect immunofluorescence and the percentage of FLAG-Sac1 transfected cells was assessed in each experiment by staining separate coverslips with an anti-FLAG antibody. Only experiments that achieved at least 75% transfection of Sac1 were used to assess Rab1 recruitment. Analysis of endogenous Rab1 recruitment to vacuoles formed by wild type versus Δ<italic>sidF</italic> mutants was performed using bacteria constitutively expressing GFP from plasmid pAM239C, and Rab1 was detected by indirect immunofluorescence.

DrrA containing the GEF and PI4P-binding domains (amino acids 201–647) localizes to both the Golgi and PM. However, the GEF domain alone (201–500) is sufficient for Golgi localization.

(B) Micrographs showing localization of HisDrrA D565E/K568R, and HisDrrA K568A/T619A in semi-permeabilized cell system as in (A). Note that purified DrrA, with mutations that perturb PI4P-binding, show Golgi-localization. This is consistent with targeting due to Rab1-binding (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004222.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). (C) Fractionation of HEK293 cells after addition of His-DrrA, HisDrrA D565E/K568R, K568A/T619A in the semi-permeabilized cell system. The lower blot shows detection of Syntaxin 3 (Stx3) as a membrane fraction control. (D) Representative micrographs showing results of semi-permeabilized assay to assess the influence of ionomycin on localization of purified His-DrrA, His-Lpg1101, and His-Lpg2603.</p>

After washing away non-bound protein, proteins were detected using an anti-MBP antibody. When indicated cells were preincubated with 1 µM PIK93 for 30 min prior to digitonin treatment. PIK93 was also maintained throughout the protein binding step. PIK93 causes a change in the localization of the Golgi-localized PI4P-binding probe from SidC but not the PM-localized Lpg2603 probe.</p>

(C) Western-blot showing protein levels of PI4KIIIα at day 7 after TMX (tamoxifen) treatment or EtOH (ethanol vehicle control) treatment. Also shown is the level of the protein p115. (D) The extent of knockdown of PI4KIIIα and PI4KIIIβ mRNA by siRNA in HEK293 FcγRII cells was assessed by RT-PCR on cDNA obtained from mRNA extracted from cells on day 3. For each sample, transcript levels of genes targeted for silencing were compared to transcript levels of GAPDH. Results shown are the average of three independent experiments, and are presented as the percent of transcript detected relative to mock controls.
