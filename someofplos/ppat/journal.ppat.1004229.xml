<abstract>
<p>Many pathogens, particularly those that require their host for survival, have devised mechanisms to subvert the host immune response in order to survive and replicate intracellularly. <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, promotes intracellular growth by translocating proteins into its host cytosol through its type IV protein secretion machinery. At least 5 of the bacterial translocated effectors interfere with the function of host cell elongation factors, blocking translation and causing the induction of a unique host cell transcriptional profile. In addition, <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> also interferes with translation initiation, by preventing cap-dependent translation in host cells. We demonstrate here that protein translation inhibition by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> leads to a frustrated host MAP kinase response, where genes involved in the pathway are transcribed but fail to be translated due to the bacterium-induced protein synthesis inhibition. Surprisingly, few pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1α and IL-1β, bypass this inhibition and get synthesized in the presence of <italic>Legionella</italic> effectors. We show that the selective synthesis of these genes requires MyD88 signaling and takes place in both infected cells that harbor bacteria and neighboring bystander cells. Our findings offer a perspective of how host cells are able to cope with pathogen-encoded activities that disrupt normal cellular process and initiate a successful inflammatory response.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Translation inhibition is a common virulence mechanism used by a number of pathogens (e.g. Diphtheria Toxin, Shiga Toxin and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> Exotoxin A). It has been a mystery how host cells mount a pathogen-specific response and clear infection under conditions where protein synthesis is blocked by pathogens. Using <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> as a model, a bacterium that efficiently blocks the host protein translation machinery, we show here that the innate immune system has devised a mechanism to cope with translation inhibition by selectively synthesizing proteins that are required for inflammation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) hypothesis has been developed to explain how the innate immune system recognizes foreign microbial invaders. By this model, germline-encoded receptors recognize conserved foreign ligands associated with microbes, such as nucleic acids, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan or flagellin to generate a response directed at clearing the microorganism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Akira1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Medzhitov1">[2]</xref>. More recently, it has become clear that pattern recognition alone does not explain how multicellular organisms are able to differentiate virulent pathogens from harmless commensals and mount a response. It has been proposed that the host immune system can sense the presence of danger and respond to pathogen-encoded enzymatic activities that disrupt normal cellular processes. This mode of recognition, referred to as “effector triggered immunity” has been shown to play a significant role in pathogen clearance both in plants and mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Jones1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Dangl1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Ausubel1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Matzinger1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Dunbar1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-McEwan1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Shin1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Tattoli1">[12]</xref>. Such recognition may be sufficient to activate a host response, but because it occurs simultaneously with PAMP recognition, host cell detection of pathogens likely results from integrating the recognition of microbial patterns together with pathogen-specific activities.</p>
<p><italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, promotes intracellular growth by translocating proteins into its host cytosol through its type IV (Dot/Icm) protein secretion machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Horwitz1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Vogel1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Brand1">[15]</xref>. These translocated effectors serve various purposes, including recruitment of ER-derived membrane to the <italic>Legionella</italic> containing vacuole, inhibition of cell death pathways and manipulation of host lipid metabolism and regulatory pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Hubber1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Losick1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Kagan1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Kagan2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Banga1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Heidtman1">[21]</xref>. Most importantly for the innate immune response, after contact with macrophages, the bacterium stimulates a pathogen-specific response that is the consequence of simultaneous recognition of PAMPs and pathogen-translocated proteins that results in a unique response to this microorganism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> is a pathogen for a broad range of fresh water amoebae, which provide the natural environmental niche for the microorganism and the source of exposure for humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Rowbotham1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Vance1">[23]</xref>. After aspiration by a susceptible mammalian host, the bacterium is engulfed by alveolar macrophages in the lungs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Nash1">[24]</xref>. In cultured macrophages, <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> provokes signaling through various pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytosolic NOD-like receptors (NLRs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Shin1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Shin2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Massis1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Archer1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Archer2">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Archer3">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Newton1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Barry1">[31]</xref>. This response is critical for clearance of the microorganism, because mouse mutants defective in these two responses succumb to lethal pneumonia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Archer1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, macrophage challenge with wild type <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (Dot/Icm<sup>+</sup>) triggers a unique transcriptional response in host cells compared to mutants that lack a functional type IV secretion system, supporting the model that there is a pathogen-specific response involved in innate immune recognition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Shin1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Losick1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana3">[32]</xref>. Microarray studies have identified many of these transcriptional targets as being genes controlled by the NF-κB and mitogen-associated protein kinases (MAPKs) transcriptional regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Shin1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Losick1">[17]</xref>, including downstream dual specificity phosphatases (<italic>Dusp1</italic> and <italic>Dusp2</italic>), stress response genes (<italic>Hsp70</italic>, <italic>Gadd45a</italic>, <italic>Egr1</italic>) and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (<italic>Il1α</italic>, <italic>Il1β</italic>, <italic>Tnfα</italic>, <italic>Il23a</italic>, <italic>Csf1</italic>, <italic>Csf2</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Shin1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana2">[11]</xref>, .</p>
<p>It was recently demonstrated that the pathogen-specific response to <italic>Legionella</italic> is triggered by the action of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> translocated effectors that interfere with host protein translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana2">[11]</xref>. Disruption of the host translation machinery serves as a second signal (in concert with signaling from PRRs) to constitute the full innate immune response against <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana1">[10]</xref>. The elimination of five of these effectors is sufficient to block this response, even though it is clear that they are part of a much larger pool of translocated substrates that impinge on host protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Barry1">[31]</xref>. These inhibitors (the products of the <italic>lgt1</italic>, <italic>lgt2</italic>, <italic>lgt3</italic>, <italic>sidI</italic>, and <italic>sidL</italic> genes) modify eukaryotic elongation factor eEF1A and eEF1Bγ of mammalian cells and block protein synthesis both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Shen1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Belyi1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Belyi2">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to blocking elongation, there is evidence that suggests wild type <italic>Legionella</italic> can also inhibit cap-dependent translation initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Ivanov1">[36]</xref>. Recognition of pathogenic <italic>Legionella</italic> leads to ubiquitination of the mTOR pathway, which in turn suppresses the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and prevents the synthesis of various genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Ivanov1">[36]</xref>. This mode of translation inhibition was shown to induce translational biasing of host cells towards a more pro-inflammatory state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Ivanov1">[36]</xref>. However, it is currently not clear how host cells would be able to mount an inflammatory response when protein translation is blocked by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> both at the initiation and elongation stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Shin1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Losick1">[17]</xref>. It is likely that pattern-recognition would play a role under conditions of intoxication, but the mechanism by which this is regulated is also unclear.</p>
<p>A strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response is crucial for clearance of <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Shin1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Barry1">[31]</xref>. The importance of cytokines can be seen in IL-1α, IL-12, IFN-γ and TNF knockout mouse strains that show increased susceptibility to <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Barry1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Friedman1">[37]</xref>. Moreover, patients treated with TNF-α blockers are at high risk of developing severe Legionnaires' disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-LiGobbi1">[38]</xref>. Given the key role that this innate immune response plays in clearance of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, we examined how cytokines and other immune mediators are synthesized under conditions in which the bacterium effectively blocks the host protein translation machinery. We find that although protein synthesis inhibitors induce the transcriptional response and block the translation of most genes, pro-inflammatory cytokine genes can bypass this blockade in a fashion that requires the TLR-adaptor protein MyD88.</p>

<title><italic>L. pneumophila</italic> translation inhibitors induce a frustrated MAPK response</title>
<p>We hypothesized that <italic>Legionella-</italic>induced inflammatory gene transcription will be largely inconsequential, as the transcribed genes cannot be translated to proteins due to the bacterium-derived translation inhibitors. To test this hypothesis, we examined mammalian host protein synthesis predicted to be downstream of MAPK activation following exposure to <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>.</p>
<p>Bone marrow-derived macrophages challenged with wild type <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> showed phosphorylation of MAPK members shortly after exposure to the bacterium, with the activation kinetics being almost identical to previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Shin1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Welsh1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Li1">[40]</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004229.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In the first hour after <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> challenge, activation of JNK and P38 was independent of the Icm/Dot system, consistent with phosphorylation being the result of Tlr engagement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Shin1">[9]</xref>. A second wave of activation was observed beginning at two hours after challenge. This was dependent on the presence of the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> type IV secretion system, as the levels of MAPK phosphorylation decayed when macrophages were challenged with the <italic>dotA3</italic> mutant that lacks the Icm/Dot system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004229.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This two-wave activation, reflecting an early Tlr-dependent and a later <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-specific response, mirrors our previous observations with NF-KB activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Losick2">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>Cultured macrophages challenged with wild type <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> transcriptionally activate a number of dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) genes, dependent on an intact Icm/Dot system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Losick1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Li1">[40]</xref>. Bone marrow-derived macrophages challenged with wild type <italic>Legionella</italic> for 4 hrs showed significant induction of the <italic>Dusp1</italic> transcript compared to <italic>dotA3</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The transcriptional induction was much higher (over 60 fold) in U937 human monocytes, the cell lines in which <italic>dusp1</italic> induction in response to wild type <italic>Legionella</italic> was first characterized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004229.s002">Figure S2A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Losick1">[17]</xref>. This transcriptional response, however, was not accompanied by translation either in bone marrow-derived macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) or U937 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004229.s002">Figure S2B</xref>) as DUSP-1 protein levels remained unchanged over the course of infection. Our inability to observe enhanced protein synthesis was not due to limitations with our detection system, because we observed a robust increase in DUSP-1 protein levels in response to the addition of LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Presumably the multiple translocated substrates that inhibit translation elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana1">[10]</xref> frustrate the transcriptional response, preventing translation of induced genes. To test this hypothesis, we challenged cells with an <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> mutant missing five of the translation inhibitors (Δ<italic>5</italic>) to determine if the absence of these proteins could allow translation to proceed. Instead, we observed no transcriptional activation of the <italic>Dusp1</italic> gene in response to this mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004229.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Therefore, induction of genes in the MAPK pathway and frustration of the response are tightly coupled.</p>

<p>To determine if the transcribed cytokine mRNAs were efficiently translated and secreted during infection, WT and MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> macrophages were challenged with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> and cytokine protein levels were measured by western blot and ELISA. Contrary to what we saw for DUSP-1, challenge with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> Dot<sup>+</sup> led to a significant increase in cell-associated pro-IL-1β levels after 4 hrs of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). IL-1α and IL-1β mature forms could also be detected in culture supernatants after 24 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g002">Figure 2C &amp; 2D</xref>). Interestingly, challenge of macrophages with <italic>L. pneumophila dotA3</italic> mutants accumulated pro-IL-1β transiently, with steady state levels reduced by 12 hr post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g002">Figure 2B</xref> densitometry), but this was not sufficient to induce the release of mature IL-1β. This is consistent with the hypothesis that in addition to TLR signaling, Icm/Dot translocated substrates are required for persistent pro-inflammatory cytokine activation and secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana3">[32]</xref>. Surprisingly, cytokine translation was severely diminished in MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> macrophages in response to wild type <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) despite the presence of large amounts of transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

<title>Intracellular cytokine accumulates in infected, translation-blocked macrophages</title>
<p>There is no clear model for why the presence of MyD88 allowed bypass of the translation block.

Alternatively, translation of cytokine transcripts could largely occur in neighboring uninfected cells that have not been directly injected with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> translocated proteins, but which have been activated by bacterial fragments liberated by infected cells. We therefore asked if the observed cytokine translation was derived from neighboring bystander cells.</p>

<p>The presence of persistent cytokine synthesis in infected cells was confirmed by intracellular cytokine staining. B6 WT and MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> macrophages were challenged with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>-GFP strains and intracellular cytokine levels were measured by flow cytometry. TNF-α was produced by both macrophages bearing bacteria (GFP<sup>+</sup>) and bystander cells (GFP<sup>−</sup>) after challenge with <italic>L. pneumophila Δfla</italic>, while the <italic>dotAΔfla</italic> strain induced much lower levels of this cytokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, top panel 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> boxes). Cells harboring bacteria (GFP<sup>+</sup>) were a significant source of IL-1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, bottom panel, 2<sup>nd</sup> box). Approximately 50% of the cells harboring bacteria showed detectable accumulation of IL-1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, bottom panels, 2<sup>nd</sup> box), while bacteria were associated with approximately 33% of the IL-1α-producing cells.

<title>Cytokine response to chemical inhibitors of protein translation</title>
<p>The two signals that are received by mammalian cells during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection (1<sup>st</sup> signal from TLR activation and 2<sup>nd</sup> signal from protein translation inhibition) synergize to induce the full cytokine response against the bacterium. It was previously reported that pharmacological inhibitors of host protein translation induce transcription of various stress response genes and cytokines such as IL-6, IL-23, IL-α and IL-1β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Barry1">[31]</xref>. We wanted to confirm that translation and secretion of these cytokines could always bypass translation inhibition using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). CHX interferes with protein translation elongation by binding to the E-site of the 60S ribosomal subunit and preventing tRNA translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-SchneiderPoetsch1">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>Macrophages were treated with heat-killed <italic>Yersinia</italic> (HKY) to induce TLR signaling, together with 10 µg/mL of cycloheximide. Addition of the chemical inhibitor at the same time as HKY led to a complete inhibition of TNF-α and IL-1α production in bone-marrow macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Contrary to what we observed during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection, addition of CHX dampened the signal received from TLR stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g004">Figure 4 A,B</xref>). Surprisingly, even at low concentrations of CHX that permit significant levels of protein translation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004229.s003">Figure S3</xref>), CHX was still able to inhibit IL-1β translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>To rule out the possibility that the reduction in IL-1β levels during CHX treatment was due to cell death, we lowered the CHX dose to 0.5 µg/mL (inhibits less than 50% of total host protein synthesis) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004229.s003">Figure S3</xref>) and also incubated the cells with the apoptotic inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (pan-caspase inhibitor). CHX was still able to inhibit IL-1β under these conditions, although it was clear that increased survival of cells was accompanied by higher accumulation of HKY-induced cytokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>MyD88-dependent stimulation of mouse macrophages in response to <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> primarily occurs via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Archer3">[29]</xref>. A recent report was able to reconstruct the cytokine induction seen during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection by using the synthetic TLR-2 ligand Pam3CSK4 in combination with Exotoxin A (Exo A), a toxin from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> that interferes with translation elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Barry1">[31]</xref>. Based on this observation, we wanted to determine if specific activation of TLR2 is what leads to cytokine translation in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. Macrophages were treated with the TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4 and pro-IL-1β levels were measured in the presence or absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). Drug treatment after addition of the TLR2 agonist led to a large reduction in pro-IL-1β levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). We also observed a failure to hyperstimulate pro-IL-1b in the presence of another protein elongation inhibitor, puromycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004229.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Similar results were obtained when macrophages were stimulated with another TLR2 agonist lipoteichoic acid (LTA), or a TLR4 agonist LPS, followed by addition of CHX (data not shown). This indicates that the selective synthesis of cytokines may result from host cells sensing a specific mode of protein synthesis inhibition. It is also possible that the selective synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines is triggered by a block in translation initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Ivanov1">[36]</xref> instead of translation elongation, which would explain why the elongation inhibitors cycloheximide or puromycin were not able to induce the response.</p>

<title>Translation of IL-1 takes place in the presence of highly depressed host cell translation</title>
<p>We considered two possible explanations for how cytokines were translated in the presence of the bacterium-derived protein synthesis inhibitors: (1) translation inhibition by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> is not efficient, allowing most of the cytokine to be synthesized prior to a complete block; or (2) the host preferentially translates a subset of genes after protein synthesis is shutdown by pathogens.</p>
<p>To distinguish between these possibilities, relative levels of protein synthesis were measured in bone-marrow macrophages at various times following <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> challenge, using an immunofluorescence readout. B6 macrophages were challenged with <italic>L. pneumophila flaA<sup>−</sup></italic>-GFP at MOI = 10 for 2 hrs and translation of proteins was measured by incorporation of a methionine analog (L-azidohomoalanine, AHA) for an additional 4 hrs. Incorporated AHA was detected by reaction with a fluorescent-labeled phosphine reagent (phosphine-APC), which covalently links to the azido-functional group on AHA (Staudinger ligation reaction) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Agard1">[47]</xref>.</p>
<p>Protein translation was significantly inhibited in macrophages harboring <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (Δ<italic>flaA</italic>) compared to bacteria lacking the Icm/Dot system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

To determine the time point at which the protein synthesis inhibitors fully shut down global protein translation, pulse-chase experiments were performed in which the methionine analog (AHA) was added for 1 hr intervals starting at 2 hrs post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Between 2–3 hrs post-infection, approximately 40% of the cells harboring <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> were found in the population that has high levels of protein synthesis. Between 3–4 hrs post infection, we observed a major shift where almost 90% of cells harboring Δ<italic>flaA</italic> were found in the population having highly depressed protein synthesis. Later time points showed no further blockage in translation, perhaps reflecting the fact that there is a small fraction of wild type bacteria that fail to form replication compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Roy1">[48]</xref>.

<p>It had been previously reported that in the absence of most known pathways of pattern recognition (MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> Nod1<sup>−/−</sup> Nod2<sup>−/−</sup> macrophages), the cytokine transcriptional response to <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> was primarily due to the presence of the translocated protein synthesis inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana2">[11]</xref>. Using macrophages that are only defective for MyD88, this dependence on the translation inhibitors could be clearly observed for the <italic>Il1α</italic>, <italic>Il1β</italic> and <italic>Tnfα</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, MyD88<sup>−/−</sup>, gray vs. black bars). Consistent with our previous data, the transcriptional response in MyD88 knockout macrophages was unproductive, with no evidence that these highly induced transcripts are translated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g006">Figure 6E</xref>).</p>
<p>In the case of wild type macrophages, Dot<sup>+</sup> and Δ<italic>5</italic> infections induced comparable levels of MyD88-dependent cytokine transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g006">Figure 6C and E</xref>), and this could be observed in macrophages that were sorted by flow cytometry, as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). This result is in contrast with macrophages lacking MyD88 signaling, in which it is clear that there is protein synthesis inhibitor-dependent induction of cytokine transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), but this induction produces no apparent cytokine translation products. Interestingly, unlike what we see for <italic>dotA</italic> mutants, infection with Δ<italic>5</italic> was still able to induce secretion of mature IL-1α at 24 hrs after infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Barry1">[31]</xref>, even though it was to a lesser extent than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, although the protein synthesis inhibitors are responsible for the transcriptional response that occurs in the absence of pattern recognition receptors, the production of cytokine proteins associated with infections by fully virulent strains is not dependent on these translocated substrates.</p>

<title>MyD88-mediated bypass of translation inhibition of the <italic>il1β</italic> gene is independent of mRNA stability</title>
<p>Cytokine expression is regulated at various stages, including transcription, post-transcriptional processing, translation and secretion. One of the main regulatory steps for IL-1 and TNF production is their transcript stability, which is controlled by their AU-rich elements (ARE) in their 3′-noncoding regions and by various ARE-binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Lu1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Radwan1">[51]</xref>. To determine if lack of cytokine translation in MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> macrophages was due to mRNA instability, the half-life of <italic>Il1β</italic> and <italic>Tnfα</italic> transcripts were compared in WT and MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> macrophages after <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> challenge. Macrophages were first infected with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> for 2.5 hrs, actinomycin D was added to the medium to block further transcription, and the amount of transcript remaining was measured by qRT-PCR at various time points after the addition of the drug. <italic>Tnfα</italic> mRNA was highly unstable in the absence of MyD88 when compared to MyD88<sup>+/+</sup> macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). However, <italic>Il1β</italic> transcripts were relatively stable in the absence of MyD88, and the amount of mRNA remaining after 2 hrs was similar to control macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). This indicates that the translation inhibition bypass of <italic>Il1β</italic> was independent of mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

<title>Pre-activation of NF-kB in MyD88-deficient macrophages is not sufficient to bypass translation inhibition</title>
<p>Another possible explanation for why few pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1α and IL-1β, bypass translation inhibition could be mRNA abundance. A recent study has shown that these cytokines are the most abundant transcripts within macrophages after challenge with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Ivanov1">[36]</xref>. Although there was significant transcription of these genes in MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> macrophages, the total mRNA abundance of IL-1α, IL-1β and TNF was still significantly lower compared to wild type macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g002">Figure 2</xref>). To address if mRNA abundance plays a role in bypass of translation inhibition during <italic>Legionella</italic> infection, WT and MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> macrophages were pre-activated with the TLR3 agonist poly(I∶C) for 2 hrs to induce NF-kB signaling. We also used heat-killed <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> (HKY) to activate NF-kB via TLR4.</p>
<p>2 hr pre-stimulation with 50 µg/mL poly(I∶C) was sufficient to trigger IL-1β transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, left graph, white bars) both in wild type and MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> macrophages. Pre-stimulation with poly(I∶C) followed by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection increased <italic>Il1β</italic> transcription initially (after 2 hrs of infection) in wild type macrophages compared to cells that were untreated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, compare black bars with grey bars). Surprisingly, this was reversed by 6 hrs post infection and cells that were pre-treated with poly(I∶C) down regulated their <italic>Il1β</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, right graph). This was more pronounced in MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, compare black and grey bars). We observed a very similar phenomenon when cells were pre-treated with heat-killed <italic>Yersinia</italic> followed by <italic>Legionella</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g007">Figure 7D</xref>).</p>
<p>As expected, pro-IL-1β translation was robust in wild type macrophages that were pre-treated with poly(I∶C) or with HKY followed by <italic>Legionella</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g007">Figure 7C and 7E</xref>). Interestingly, pro-IL-1β was detected by Western blots in MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> macrophages after pre-stimulation with poly(I∶C) but the protein level was reduced when the pre-activated cells were challenged with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). MyD88<sup>−/−</sup> macrophages that were infected with <italic>Legionella</italic> alone on the other hand, showed little detectable translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g007">Figure 7C</xref>) despite having higher levels of <italic>Il1β</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, right graph, compare black and grey bars). This phenotype was more obvious during pre-treatment with HKY. 2 hr HKY pre-stimulation led to a robust pro-IL-1β translation initially, which was significantly reduced when cells were challenged with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). Therefore, in the absence of MyD88 signaling, macrophages were unable to overcome the translation inhibition induced by <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> even in the presence of external stimuli.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Inhibition of protein translation is a common virulence mechanism used by many viruses and bacteria. In this study, we showed that host cells have evolved mechanisms to cope with translation inhibition by selectively translating a subset of cytokine genes, including pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α and IL-1β in response to <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> challenge. The ability to bypass <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> translational inhibition is an important determinant of host protection, as mice defective in the IL-1α/IL-1β response and humans exposed to TNF-α inhibitors are highly susceptible to <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Barry1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-LiGobbi1">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>L. pneumophila</italic> challenge of bone-marrow macrophages leads to a dramatic reduction in global protein translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The bacterium interferes with protein translation both at the initiation step <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Ivanov1">[36]</xref> and elongation step <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana1">[10]</xref>. It has been shown previously that this inhibition triggers the transcription of various stress response genes including NF-kB- and MAPK-regulated genes, heat shock proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Shin1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana2">[11]</xref>. We show here that <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> translocated effectors prevent the translation of these genes, resulting in a “frustrated response,” in which there is accumulation of transcripts but no increase in protein levels. A subset of cytokine genes, and potentially other genes that have not been identified yet, are insensitive to this inhibition and get translated in cells that show the highest level of protein synthesis inhibition.</p>
<p>We observed bypass of translational inhibition as an orderly series of events resulting in the accumulation of IL-1α in cells harboring bacteria as well as in bystanders, followed by release of the cytokine into culture supernatants. Initial transcriptional induction and translation of IL-1a occurred independently of the Icm/Dot system, and was associated with TLR-signaling, consistent with the TLR-dependent activation of the NF-κB response known to occur at early time points after <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Losick2">[41]</xref>. This was followed by persistent accumulation of pro-IL-1α protein in a process that required both the presence of the Icm/Dot system and MyD88-dependent signaling, indicating collaborative signaling between the two pathways. Surprisingly, accumulation of pro-IL-1α was equally robust in both cells harboring bacteria and in bystander cells, in spite of the translocated protein synthesis inhibitors that are deposited by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>. This observation is particularly striking, in that time points showing the strongest inhibition of protein synthesis also resulted in the fastest rate of pro-IL-1α accumulation, arguing that there is selective ribosomal loading of cytokine transcripts in intoxicated cells. In the absence of MyD88 signaling, no such bypass could be observed in either infected or uninfected cells, either because translation requires the extremely high levels of transcription that occur in the presence of MyD88, or there is pattern recognition-dependent bypass of translational inhibition. Accumulation of pro-IL-1α was then followed by its release, which required both the Icm/Dot system and MyD88.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> translational inhibitors could be responsible for the induction of pro-IL-1α. Arguing against this model is the fact that a strain that lacks 5 of the known translation inhibitors (Δ5) still induced considerable pro-IL-α accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g006">Figure 6E, F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Barry1">[31]</xref>. The accumulation of cytokine in response to this strain could have resulted from residual translation inhibition that was observed, but it should be noted that MAPK and NF-κB activation resulting from macrophage challenge by this strain is due to a pattern recognition response and is not due to Icm/Dot signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana2">[11]</xref>. The initial MyD88-dependent activation that occurs after contact with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> may be amplified by unknown Icm/Dot-signals or due to inhibition of translation initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Ivanov1">[36]</xref>. A recent study proposed that infection of macrophages with virulent <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> strains (both Dot+ and Δ5) leads to downregulation of mTOR activity, which is sufficient to suppress cap-dependent protein translation initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Ivanov1">[36]</xref>. The second signal that is required for amplifying pattern-recognition could be generated from such translational suppression, and could be the trigger for induction of pro-IL-1α.</p>
<p>Challenge of macrophages that lack MyD88 with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> induces cytokine gene transcription, but the transcribed genes fail to be translated. In the absence of MyD88, therefore, the protein translation inhibition takes on global dimensions. The MyD88-dependent bypass of the translation inhibition was independent of transcript stability in the case of <italic>Il1β</italic> transcript, which is a known strategy for post-transcriptional regulation of cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Shaw1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Palanisamy1">[53]</xref>. This surprising result indicates that there may be a previously unrecognized MyD88-dependent signaling pathway that mediates post-transcriptional regulation of cytokine transcripts. It has previously been reported that separate transcriptional and translational signals are required for IL-1β expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Dinarello1">[54]</xref>. Although it is not clear what these translational signals could be, it is possible that MyD88-dependent signals could result in either enhanced ribosome loading, or could regulate translation via action at the 3′ or 5′ untranslated regions. Alternatively, the role of MyD88 could be totally passive, and merely a consequence of enhancing expression of cytokine gene transcripts. Although <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection causes a large induction of cytokine transcription in the absence of MyD88, these levels are still lower than what is seen when pattern recognition is intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004229-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This added boost in cytokine gene transcription by MyD88 may be sufficient to push the concentrations of these transcripts above the minimum threshold necessary to support selective translation of these genes under conditions of intoxication. Consistent with this model are previous results from nanostring analysis of macrophage transcripts that are induced in response to <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Ivanov1">[36]</xref>. In this work, it is argued that the primary determinant of translation in cells challenged with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> is the relative abundance of a particular transcript. Translation was most likely to occur from transcripts that were the most abundantly expressed after bacterial challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Ivanov1">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>A similar phenomenon to that reported here has been observed in the model organism <italic>C. elegans</italic> upon infection with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestinal cells endocytose <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Exotoxin A, which shuts down protein translation by inhibiting elongation factor 2 (EF2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-McEwan1">[8]</xref>. This inhibition leads to the selective translation of ZIP-2, which is required for activation of defense pathways and pathogen clearance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Dunbar1">[7]</xref>. It was proposed that the 5′ UTR of zip-2, which contains several untranslated ORFs (uORFs), was required for the selective translation. Even so, there is no explanation for how ribosome loading and translation can selectively occur in this transcript. Interestingly, there are a few other examples from mammalian cells and yeast, where protein translation inhibition leads to selective translation of few genes that have uORFs at their 5′ UTR. The mammalian stress response transcription factor ATF4 and the yeast transcription factor GCN4 respond similarly to amino acid starvation and protein synthesis inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Hinnebusch1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Vattem1">[56]</xref>. The 5′ UTR or 3′ UTR of cytokines could potentially be functioning the same way to allow selective protein translation when initiation and/or elongation is blocked by <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, pharmacological inhibitors of host protein translation induce transcription of various stress response genes, including pro-inflammatory cytokines such as <italic>Il6</italic>, <italic>Il23</italic>, <italic>Il1α</italic> and <italic>Il1β</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana2">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Barry1">[31]</xref>. Secretion of these genes can take place when the highly conserved host elongation machinery is targeted by toxins such as <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Exotoxin A or <italic>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</italic> encoded diptheria toxins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Fontana1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Barry1">[31]</xref>. <italic>Diphtheria</italic> toxin and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> ExoA inhibit eukaryotic elongation factor similar to the mechanism used by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effectors. They modify elongation factor 2 (EF2) of eukaryotic cells by ADP-ribosylation, which has been shown to trigger a strong host immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Barry1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Jorgensen1">[57]</xref>. This suggests the presence of a conserved surveillance mechanism the host uses to detect and respond to inhibition of the translation elongation machinery.</p>
<p>A previous study has shown that the cytokine induction seen during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> can be mimicked by the addition of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Exo A in combination with the synthetic PAMP ligand Pam3Csk4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-Barry1">[31]</xref>. It seems likely that macrophages are able to selectively bypass the translation block of this toxin in a fashion that is similar to that described in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Interestingly, we cannot reproduce this result using a variety of concentrations of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, which instead reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to PAMP challenge. The mechanism by which cycloheximide inhibits protein synthesis is sufficiently different from these toxins to explain why we see differences in the innate immune response against CHX. CHX binds to the E-site of the 60S ribosomal subunit and freezes all translating ribosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004229-SchneiderPoetsch1">[46]</xref>.The RNA/ribosome complex remains stabilized and does not dissociate, a phenomenon that may not be perceived as danger by eukaryotic cells. In contrast, both <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> and ExoA interfere with elongation factor function. There may be a set of modified elongation factors in the host cell that resist action of these effectors, or there may be a population that is sequestered from modification, allowing them to selectively act on cytokine transcripts. In either case, there must be some special property to the cytokine transcript that allows this selective utilization of these active elongation factors. Future work will focus on the nature of these transcripts that allows bypass of translation inhibition.</p>

Lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min, centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatants were used for ELISA. The protein concentration in each sample was determined by Bradford assay.</p>
<p>ELISA plates were prepared by coating 96 well Nunc MaxiSorp plates with the desired antibody. Polyclonal Goat anti-IL-1α and IL-1β (R&amp;D systems), Rabbit anti-DUSP-1 (Santa Cruz) and Rabbit anti-RhoGDI (Santa Cruz) antibodies were diluted in Carbonate/Bicarbonate buffer (PH = 9.6) to 10 µg/mL and 100 µL was used per well. Plates were incubated overnight at 4°. The following day, plates were brought to room temperature and blocked with 0.5% BSA/PBS for 1 hr. Cell lysates that have incorporated puromycin were incubated on the ELISA plates for 2 hrs, washed with 0.05% Tween-20/PBS three times and incubated with monoclonal mouse-anti-Puromycin (12D10, Millipore) for 1 hr. Unbound antibody was washed exhaustively with 0.05% Tween-20/PBS and plates were incubated with Donkey anti-mouse-HRP secondary antibody. Unbound antibody was washed again with Tween-20/PBS four times and 100 µL of HRP substrate (TMB solution) was added to each well for 5–10 mins. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 µL of stop-solution (2N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), and absorbance was measured at 450 nm.</p>
