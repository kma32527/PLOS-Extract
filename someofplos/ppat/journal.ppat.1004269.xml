<abstract>
<p>Murid γ-herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4) promotes polyclonal B cell activation and establishes latency in memory B cells via unclear mechanisms. We aimed at exploring whether B cell receptor specificity plays a role in B cell susceptibility to viral latency and how this is related to B cell activation. We first observed that MuHV-4-specific B cells represent a minority of the latent population, and to better understand the influence of the virus on non-MuHV-4 specific B cells we used the SW<sub>HEL</sub> mouse model, which produce hen egg lysozyme (HEL)-specific B cells. By tracking HEL<sup>+</sup> and HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells, we showed that in vivo latency was restricted to HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells while the two populations were equally sensitive to the virus in vitro. Moreover, MuHV-4 induced two waves of B cell activation. While the first wave was characterized by a general B cell activation, as shown by HEL<sup>+</sup> and HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells expansion and upregulation of CD69 expression, the second wave was restricted to the HEL<sup>−</sup> population, which acquired germinal center (GC) and plasma cell phenotypes. Antigenic stimulation of HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells led to the development of HEL<sup>+</sup> GC B cells where latent infection remained undetectable, indicating that MuHV-4 does not benefit from acute B cell responses to establish latency in non-virus specific B cells but relies on other mechanisms of the humoral response. These data support a model in which the establishment of latency in B cells by γ-herpesviruses is not stochastic in terms of BCR specificity and is tightly linked to the formation of GCs.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Murid γ-herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4) is a good model to study infectious mononucleosis in mice, in which the virus ultimately establishes life-long latency in B cells. Whereas several viral proteins have been shown to modulate B cell behavior, in the present study we aimed at clarifying the parameters that dictate the establishment of viral latency from the B cell perspective. Indeed, the B cell repertoire is highly diverse and it remains unknown whether latency takes place randomly in B cells. To study this question, we isolated latently infected B cells in which we observed a low frequency of virus-specific B cells, suggesting that viral latency is not restricted to this population. To better understand MuHV-4 influence on non-virus specific B cells, we then followed the fate of B cells specific for a foreign antigen, hen egg lysozyme (HEL). While in vitro experiments showed that HEL-specific B cells could be acutely infected by MuHV-4, these cells were resistant to MuHV-4 latent infection in vivo. These results suggest that while establishment of γ-herpesvirus latency is not restricted to virus-specific B cells, it does not take place randomly in B cells and relies on mechanisms that remain to be identified.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The murid γ-herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4, also known as MHV-68 or γHV-68) has led to valuable insights in understanding human γ-herpesvirus related diseases caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Barton1">[1]</xref>. Whereas primo infection by γ-herpesviruses can be responsible for lymphoproliferative disorders in immune competent hosts, they are usually well controlled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-ThorleyLawson1">[2]</xref>. As with EBV, MuHV-4 is mainly lymphotropic and establishes latency in class-switched and germinal center (GC) B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Marques1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Collins1">[4]</xref>. The course of the infection in mice is now well described (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Stevenson1">[5]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Barton1">[1]</xref>). Upon intranasal inoculation, infection starts with an acute lung infection controlled by the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response. The virus then disseminates to secondary lymph organs via serial events of lymphoid/myeloid cellular exchanges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Frederico1">[6]</xref> where it promotes a CD4-dependent polyclonal B cell response and finally establishes latency in long-lived memory B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Barton1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Stevenson1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Stevenson2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Sangster1">[8]</xref>. This polyclonal B cell activation can lead to the emergence of auto-antibodies but MuHV-4 infection is usually not associated with the development of auto-immune diseases or lymphomas in immune competent mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-SunilChandra1">[9]</xref>. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and in particular follicular helper T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Collins2">[10]</xref>, have been shown to be essential for the establishment of MuHV-4 latency. Antibody-mediated depletion experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Ehtisham1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Dutia1">[12]</xref> as well as work performed on MHC class II deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Cardin1">[13]</xref> (which are CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells deficient) have led to similar observations, that the absence of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells leads to lower latency levels.</p>
<p>On the virus side, few proteins have been shown to be involved in the establishment of latency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Barton1">[1]</xref>. Among them, M2 has received particular interest for its ability to interfere with B cell activation. Studies performed with M2-deficient MuHV-4 have shown its essential role in the establishment of latency, although it is not required for acute lung infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Simas1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Jacoby1">[15]</xref>. Biochemical analysis have established that M2 is able to interact with the Fyn/Vav, Plcγ2 and PI3K pathways, involved in BCR signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-PiresdeMiranda1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-PiresdeMiranda2">[18]</xref>. In vivo, B cells infected by M2-deficient MuHV-4 have been shown to acquire a GC phenotype comparable with the WT virus, but were unable to class-switch and differentiate into plasma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Liang1">[19]</xref>. MuHV-4 LANA has recently been shown to stabilize cellular Myc and promotes its activity, leading to B cell proliferation, a process required for GC formation and viral latency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Rodrigues2">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>The lower level of viral latency observed in mice deprived of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as well as with M2-deficient MuHV-4 are good examples showing that the establishment of MuHV-4 latency relies on mechanisms that mix the physiologic B cell response and the intervention of viral modulators. Several questions remain to be explored to better understand this complex interaction: How does MuHV-4 trigger a polyclonal B cell activation? Are latently infected B cells also polyclonal, or is latency restricted to MuHV-4 specific B cells? Finally, what are the respective roles for the virus and the B cells in the establishment of latency?</p>
<p>Until recently, those were difficult questions to address experimentally because of two major hurdles on the virus and the B cell sides. At peak of latency (∼14 days post-infection in C57BL/6 mice), latently infected B cells represent a low percentage of total B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Marques1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Collins1">[4]</xref> and tracking these cells was impossible until the development of a YFP expressing MuHV-4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Collins1">[4]</xref>. On the B cell side, questions concerning BCR specificity are delicate to address due to the enormous diversity of the B cell repertoire and to the difficulty to trace one clonal population, but major improvement was made with the development of the switch hen egg lysozyme mice (SW<sub>HEL</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Phan1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Chan1">[24]</xref>. Based on the MD4 model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Goodnow1">[25]</xref>, SW<sub>HEL</sub> mice have been engineered to contain up to ∼10% of HEL-specific B cells. But contrary to MD4 mice, SW<sub>HEL</sub> HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells can perform GC reactions in a competitive environment, class-switch and differentiate in long-lived memory B cells. Moreover, HEL-specific (HEL<sup>+</sup>) and non-specific (HEL<sup>−</sup>) populations can easily be distinguished by direct staining of the BCR with fluorescently labeled HEL.</p>
<p>In the present study, we aimed at clarifying the role of BCR specificity in the establishment of MuHV-4 latency in B cells. Taking advantage of the SW<sub>HEL</sub> mice and the YFP-MuHV-4 we designed experiments to study in parallel how MuHV-4 influences a normal B cell repertoire (HEL<sup>−</sup>) and a clonal population of non-virus specific B cells (HEL<sup>+</sup>) in order to determine in which population latency is established and how this relates with B cell activation.</p>

<title>MuHV-4 latency is not restricted to virus-specific B cells</title>
<p>To evaluate the frequency of MuHV-4 specific B cells in infected and non-infected populations, we challenged C57BL/6 mice with YFP-MuHV-4. Infected and non-infected CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells were sorted at 14 dpi based on their YFP expression and used in an ELISPOT assay to evaluate the number of total IgGs and anti-MuHV-4 IgGs secreting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Both YFP<sup>−</sup> and YFP<sup>+</sup> B cells showed a low frequency of virus-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC) cells when compared to the total ASC. That is, ∼10% of total ASC for the YFP<sup>−</sup>, and ∼1% for the YFP<sup>+</sup> populations, showing that in both populations the majority of ASC are not MuHV-4 specific. As the frequency of GC B cells (GL-7<sup>+</sup>, CD95<sup>+</sup>) is significantly different between YFP<sup>+</sup> and YFP<sup>−</sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), we tried to refine our analysis by sorting infected and non-infected GC cells based on GL-7 and CD95 expression. Yet, purified cells died quickly and could not be used for ELISPOT assays, probably due to anti-CD95 induced apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Wang1">[26]</xref>. Our ELISPOT assay did not include the monitoring of IgGs specific for non-structural proteins. However, it would be unlikely if they accounted for the 90 to 99% of the ASC not detected in our anti-MuHV-4 IgGs assay. These data indicate that latent infection is not restricted to MuHV-4 specific B cells and that the virus is able to promote the activation of non-virus-specific B cells independently of their infection status. In order to explore these two points, we next used the SW<sub>HEL</sub> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Phan1">[21]</xref>, which allowed us to monitor MuHV-4 influence on non-virus-specific HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells.</p>

<title>MuHV-4 specific B cells represent a minor part of infected and non-infected cells.</title>
<p>(A) As presented in the FACS plot, infected (CD19<sup>+</sup> YFP<sup>+</sup>, black bars) and non-infected (CD19<sup>+</sup> YFP<sup>−</sup>, grey bars) B cells were sorted from C57BL/6 mice 14 dpi. Cells were used to assess the frequency of total (left) and MuHV-4 specific (right) antibody-secreting cells (ASC) by ELISPOT. These data are from 3 independent experiments, in each experiment spleens from 3 to 4 mice where pooled before performing the sorts. Post-sorts purities were systematically &gt;95% for YFP<sup>+</sup> B cells and &gt;98% for YFP<sup>−</sup> B cells. (B) To monitor the frequency of GC cells in YFP<sup>−</sup> and YFP<sup>+</sup> B cells, spleens from YFP-MuHV-4 infected C57BL/6 mice (n = 9) were isolated at 14 dpi for FACS analysis. All the mice harbored a frequency of infected B cells &gt;0,05%, with at least 500 events in the YFP<sup>+</sup> gate. A representative FACS plot showing the frequency of CD95<sup>+</sup> GL-7<sup>+</sup> cells is shown on top and compiled data obtained from 4 independent experiments is shown below. Bars represent the average percentage.</p>

<title>HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells are not latently infected by MuHV-4</title>
<p>SW<sub>HEL</sub> mice were infected with YFP-MuHV-4 and we monitored YFP expression in HEL<sup>+</sup> and HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells 14 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). While we did not detect YFP expression in the HEL<sup>+</sup> population, HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells harbored a frequency of YFP<sup>+</sup> cells comparable with what has been previously reported in WT B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Collins1">[4]</xref>. We confirmed that HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells are solely latently infected by sorting HEL<sup>+</sup> and HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells on which we monitored reactivation of latent virus by ex vivo explant co-culture assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and the presence of viral DNA by limiting dilution PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). It is important to note that HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells emerge from a spontaneous replacement of the Vh10 exon encoding for the HEL-specific heavy chain leading to the reconstitution of a polyclonal repertoire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Phan1">[21]</xref>, minimizing the impact of genetic differences between these two populations. However, HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells only belong to the B-2 lineage, while HEL<sup>−</sup> differentiate into both B-1 and B-2 B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Phan1">[21]</xref>. It is unknown in which population of B cells MuHV-4 latency is established. To evaluate if the B-2 bias of the HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells would account for their resistance to latent infection, we phenotyped latently infected cells in C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004269.s001">Figure S1</xref>). B-2 B cells represented the vast majority of YFP<sup>+</sup> B cells, but a small fraction of latently infected cells was also detected in B-1a and B-1b B cells. The proportion of B-2, B-1a and B-1b in YFP<sup>+</sup> and YFP<sup>−</sup> B cells corresponded to what has been described for naïve animals, with the B-2 lineage being dominant in splenic B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Baumgarth1">[27]</xref>. Overall, these data make it unlikely that the B-2 commitment of HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells would explain their resistance to MuHV-4 latency.</p>

<title>MuHV-4 latent infection is restricted to polyclonal HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells.</title>
<p>SW<sub>HEL</sub> mice were left untreated or infected for 14 days with YFP-MuHV-4 virus at 10<sup>4</sup> PFU. Splenocytes were isolated and analyzed by FACS or sorted for plaque assay and limiting dilution PCR analysis. HEL<sup>+</sup> and HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells were identified based on HEL-A647 binding and CD19 expression. (A) On top are representative FACS plots showing the percentage of YFP<sup>+</sup> cells in both populations at 0 and 14 dpi. Data are compiled in the graphics below showing percentage of YFP<sup>+</sup> cells in HEL<sup>+</sup> (grey circles) and HEL<sup>−</sup> (white circles) B cells at day 0 (n = 12) and 14 (n = 16) dpi. The bar represents the average percentage. (B) To detect presence of latent MuHV-4, a plaque assay was performed on sorted HEL<sup>+</sup> and HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells 14 dpi (n = 8). # indicates that no plaques were detected in HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells and based on the average number of HEL+ B cells plated, we estimate the level of latent infection to be &lt;1 PFU/382000 in this population. The analysis of lysed cells showed an absence of preformed viral particles in both populations. (C) Limiting dilution PCR was performed to detect viral genome in sorted HEL<sup>+</sup> and HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells from day 14 infected SW<sub>HEL</sub> mice. Data are representative of two independent experiments in which splenocytes were pooled before sorting (n = 3 &amp; n = 2). The frequency of cells harboring MuHV-4 DNA is shown, # indicates signal below the assay's limit of detection. We evaluated the frequency of MuHV-4 DNA<sup>+</sup> cells in HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells to be ≤1/36770 and ≤1/102891 for the two experiments we performed. Error bars indicate the 95% confidence interval. Purity of sorted cells was systematically above 90%.</p>

<p>Finally, to monitor that MuHV-4 latency in SW<sub>HEL</sub> HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells reproduces what has been described in a normal repertoire, we determined the phenotype of YFP<sup>+</sup> HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g003">Figure 3</xref>). As for WT B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), ∼75% of YFP<sup>+</sup> HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells harbored a GL-7<sup>+</sup> CD95<sup>+</sup> phenotype, with a minor fraction harboring a plasma cell phenotype and ongoing class-switch (CD138<sup>+</sup> IgM<sup>−</sup>). Together these data show that HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells are not latently infected by MuHV-4 while latency takes place normally in HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells.</p>

<title>HEL<sup>+</sup> and HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells are both sensitive to MuHV-4 infection in vitro</title>
<p>MuHV-4 poorly infects B cells in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Dutia2">[28]</xref>, but work by Frederico et al overcame this hurdle by developing an in vitro co-culture assay, and showed that MuHV-4 transits by myeloid cells in order to get access to B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Frederico2">[29]</xref>. Taking advantage of this experimental setting we investigated whether the absence of latently infected HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells in vivo was due to an intrinsic resistance of these cells to the virus. As the YFP-MuHV-4 used for in vivo experiments allows the detection of latently infected cells we used in this experiment an EF1α-eGFP<sup>+</sup> MuHV-4, in which GFP expression can be detected 48 h post infection. We used in parallel gp150<sup>+</sup> and a gp150<sup>−</sup> viruses, the later leading to a better B cell infection in co-culture assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Frederico2">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>We co-cultured freshly isolated SW<sub>HEL</sub> splenocytes with infected RAW-264 or BHK-21 cells, or exposed the splenocytes to free viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g004">Figure 4</xref>). 48 h post co-culture, cells were harvested and GFP expression was monitored in both HEL<sup>+</sup> and HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells. Contrasting with our in vivo observations, we observed that both populations were equally sensitive to MuHV-4 infection when co-cultured with infected RAW-264, while they remained not infected with exposed to free virions or co-cultured with infected BHK-21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Fitting with previous observations, percentages of infection were greater with a gp150-deficient virus. Overall, these in vitro data show that the absence of latently infected HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells in vivo is not due to an intrinsic resistance of these cells to the virus.</p>

<title>MuHV-4 induces transient B cell activation, but HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells are excluded from late phases of the humoral response</title>
<p>MuHV-4 is known to induce proliferation of both T cells and B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Usherwood1">[30]</xref>. To evaluate the influence of MuHV-4 on early B cell activation, we performed a kinetic analysis monitoring the number and CD69 expression of HEL<sup>+</sup> and HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells isolated from spleen and cervical lymph nodes (CLN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g005">Figure 5</xref>). We observed an increased number of both HEL<sup>+</sup> and HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells in the spleen and CLN, which peaked at 14 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), suggesting that MuHV-4-driven B cell proliferation does not rely on the infection status. We monitored CD69 expression by two complementary methods: measuring the intensity of CD69 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) and by evaluating the percentage of CD69<sup>high</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). In the spleen, beside a small population of CD69<sup>high</sup> cells observed on HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells at 7 and 14 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), we did not detect a significant increase of CD69 expression on HEL<sup>+</sup> and HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells. On the opposite, in the CLN we observed a peak of CD69 expression on both HEL<sup>+</sup> and HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells at 7 dpi, which disappeared at 14 dpi. In both organs, YFP<sup>+</sup> B cells were restricted to the HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells indicating that this transient activation of HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells is not sufficient to allow viral latency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004269.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

<p>Spatial organization of the GC is an essential component of the B cell response as it dictates the interaction between B cells and the other cellular players such as follicular helper T cells and dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Phan2">[31]</xref>. To have an insight into the organization of the HEL<sup>+</sup> and HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells in infected mice, we performed immunofluorescent staining on spleen sections from naïve and 14 dpi SW<sub>HEL</sub> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g007">Figure 7</xref>). As natural YFP signal was lost during fixation, infected cells were revealed with an Alexa-488 anti-GFP antibody. In naïve mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g007">Figure 7A</xref>), HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells were homogeneously spread in the B cell area of the follicle, and no GFP<sup>+</sup> or GC cells were observed.

<title>SW<sub>HEL</sub> mice develop an anti-MuHV-4 IgG response but fail to secrete long-lasting anti-HEL IgGs</title>

<title>MuHV-4 does not benefit from acute B cell responses to establish latency in non-virus-specific B cells</title>
<p>Our data show that HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells are not latently infected and do not participate in the GC response induced by MuHV-4 while they are equally sensitive to infection in vitro. Moreover, our ELISPOT data show that viral latency is not restricted to virus-specific B cells, indicating that latency is established in B cells of other specificities. This set of observations leads us to propose that the establishment of latency is not a stochastic event and takes place in a restricted population of polyclonal B cells. This model implies that MuHV-4 does not overcome the stimulatory signals provided by the BCR stimulation and the cognate CD4 help, but manages to benefit from it in order to settle in long-lived memory B cells.</p>
<p>To test if MuHV-4 could benefit from acute CD4-dependent B cell responses, we stimulated a physiological number of adoptively transferred HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells in C57BL/6 mice with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) conjugated to recombinant HEL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Paus1">[23]</xref>. We used an adoptive transfer assay in order to avoid competition between HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells in SW<sub>HEL</sub> mice, in particular from being in too great an excess over the available SRBC-specific CD4 help. Indeed, SW<sub>HEL</sub> immunized with SRBC-HEL showed a poor GC response (∼1% of GC HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004269.s003">Figure S3A</xref>) when compared to C57BL/6 adoptively transferred with HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells (∼70% of GC HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004269.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). We controlled that SRBC-HEL could not induce an endogenous HEL-specific B cell response in C57BL/6 mice by co-transferring SRBC-HEL with or without HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells and showed that transferred HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells were required for the emergence of HEL<sup>+</sup> GC B cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004269.s003">Figure S3B</xref>).</p>
<p>As schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g009">Figure 9A</xref>, we transferred HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells 24 h before infection and immunized the infected mice with SRBC+/−HEL at 0, 4, 7 or 10 dpi. We decided to test different time of immunization, as it is currently unknown when the virus/B cell encounter happens and whether it infects naïve or activated B cells in vivo. At 14 dpi, we monitored the GC differentiation and percentage of infection in HEL<sup>+</sup> and HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Immunization with SRBC-HEL at either of the time point tested triggered the GC differentiation of HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells when compared to mice immunized with SRBC alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g009">Figure 9B</xref>, top left) while it did not affect the GC phenotype of HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g009">Figure 9B</xref>, bottom left). The magnitude of the GC response observed in HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells was different between the time of immunization, certainly due to a mixed influence of the GC dynamic and survival of the transferred cells. While we could detect for the first time a HEL<sup>+</sup> GC response in the context of MuHV-4 infection, these cells remained YFP<sup>−</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g009">Figure 9B</xref>, top right), YFP<sup>+</sup> cells being restricted to the HEL<sup>−</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g009">Figure 9B</xref>, bottom right), in which frequency of infection was not affected by SRBC-HEL immunization. We verified that adoptively transferred B cells could get latently infected by transferring WT CD45.1<sup>+</sup> splenocytes into WT CD45.2<sup>+</sup> recipient mice and showed that frequency of infection and GC differentiation was equivalent between donor and recipient cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004269.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we attempted at better understanding how γ-herpesviruses establish latency in B cells with a particular focus on the role of the BCR specificity. By following HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells in MuHV-4 infected SW<sub>HEL</sub> mice, we were able to monitor the behavior of non-virus specific B cells during the establishment of MuHV-4 latency and showed that those cells were excluded from the latently infected population.</p>
<p>Previous studies have established that MuHV-4 latency depends on B cell activation and proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Moser1">[33]</xref>, but it is still not clear whether MuHV-4 can drive such activation independently of BCR specificity. When we compared the proliferation and CD69 expression of HEL<sup>+</sup> and HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells, we observed that both populations behave in a similar manner, with proliferation in both spleen and CLN and a transient CD69 upregulation in the CLN. This confirms previous work that showed CD69 upregulation on B cells exposed to MuHV-4 in vitro and a temporary B cell proliferation in MHC-II-deficient I-A<sup>b</sup>−/− mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Stevenson2">[7]</xref>. However, HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells did not participate to the long-term humoral response, as they did not differentiate into GC or plasma cells. We think we observed here two distinct waves of activatory signals. The first wave triggering a non-specific activation of the global B cell population, followed by a second wave that promotes the differentiation into GC of a restricted pool of B cells. The respective role of these two waves in the establishment of latency is not completely clear, but the first wave of activation is not sufficient to allow the establishment of latency in B cells, as supported by the fact that HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells do not get latently infected. While we do not identify the mechanism driving the first wave of activation, it has been shown that both T cells and B cells are responsible for the MuHV-4 driven splenomegaly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Usherwood1">[30]</xref>, suggesting that the first wave of activation is not due to factors specific of the B cell response, and is probably cytokine mediated.</p>
<p>Concerning the second wave of activation, correlation analysis performed on our dataset showed that frequency of YFP<sup>+</sup> cells in HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells correlates positively with the magnitude of the GC response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004269-g010">Figure 10</xref>). This is in accordance with recent observations by Collins et al who observed a positive correlation between the frequency of YFP<sup>+</sup> cells and the frequency of follicular helper T cells, an essential player of the GC response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Collins2">[10]</xref>. That said, the fact that HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells are sensitive to the virus in vitro but do not get latently infected and are excluded from the GC reaction go against a model where MuHV-4 could drive a stochastic manipulation of the B cells and would instead rely on BCR specificity.</p>

<p>One previous study looked at the influence of MuHV-4 on non-virus specific B cells by reconstituting μMT B cell −/− mice with B cells from MD4 mice (designated HELMET mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-McClellan1">[34]</xref>). In MuHV-4 infected HELMET, HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells expressed CD69 and proliferated but contrary to our results, MuHV-4 latency was detected in HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells by PCR. The absence of competition in HELMET mice, where B cells are all HEL-specific could account for these discrepancies. Indeed, in SW<sub>HEL</sub> mice, HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells coexist with a majority of polyclonal B cells. Our in vitro infection by co-culture assay supports the fact that HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells are sensitive to MuHV-4, suggesting that a selection mechanism might occur in vivo, leading to the disappearance of these infected cells. In HELMET mice, the absence of competition could allow for the survival of latently infected HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells. This role for competition is supported by the work of Kim et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Kim1">[35]</xref> who studied how latency evolved in mice containing CD40<sup>+</sup> and CD40<sup>−</sup> B cells. Although the two populations got latently infected, latency was ultimately lost in CD40<sup>−</sup> B cells and GC differentiation was restricted to CD40<sup>+</sup> B cells.</p>
<p>To explore whether the presence of CD4 T cell dependent antigens could be involved in the selection of latently infected cells, we triggered an endogenous anti-HEL response concomitantly with MuHV-4 infection. Although we were able to induce the emergence of HEL<sup>+</sup> GC B cells, these cells remained refractory to latent infection. These data support that, at least in our experimental setting, MuHV-4 cannot hitchhike an acute humoral response to gain access to GC B cells and might instead benefit from other antigen/BCR interactions. In humans, it is estimated that up to 20% of a normal B cell repertoire is made of self-reactive B cells that need to be constantly kept under control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Wardemann1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Koelsch1">[37]</xref>. One of the tolerance mechanism is the induction of a functional unresponsive state known as anergy, which requires endogenous BCR signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Cambier1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Zikherman1">[39]</xref>. The high prevalence of self-reactive B cells offers a good opportunity for γ-herpesviruses to manipulate these processes in order to retrieve B cells from their anergic state and promote polyclonal B cells activation in an antigen-dependent manner. Supporting this point, recent studies performed in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Tracy1">[40]</xref> and mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Larson1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Getahun1">[42]</xref> have shown that γ-herpesviruses are found in self-reactive B cells. Two studies have explored MuHV-4 impact on anergic B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Getahun1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Gauld1">[43]</xref>, but it is still not clear how MuHV-4 can modulate this processes. SW<sub>HEL</sub>×ML5 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Phan1">[21]</xref>, in which HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells are anergic due to the presence of soluble HEL, could be an alternative model to study the influence of the virus on competent anergic B cells.</p>
<p>Further work will be required to elucidate how MuHV-4 promotes GC B cells differentiation independently of their infection status, and how this event is linked to the establishment of latently infected B cells in memory B cells. γ-herpesviruses are known to be mildly pathogenic in immune-competent hosts and it has been shown that MuHV-4 latent infection does not induce autoimmune disorders and actually confers protection in lupus-prone animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Larson1">[41]</xref>. This highlights the fact that the interrelationship between MuHV-4 and B cells is complex and that co-evolution between γ-herpesviruses and their host as allowed for the emergence of subtle mechanisms that promote B cell activation but limits associated immune disorders in order to establish life-long latency.</p>

<title>Mice</title>
<p>SW<sub>HEL</sub> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Phan1">[21]</xref> were obtained from Dr Antonio Freitas, Institut Pasteur, Paris, in accordance with Dr Robert Brink, Garvan Institute, Melbourne. To screen for expression of the V<sub>H</sub>10<sub>tar</sub> heavy chain and the V<sub>κ</sub>10-κ light chain genotyping was performed on DNA isolated from mouse-tails using DirectPCR solution (Viagen). Mice heterozygous for both genes were used for experiments. HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells were identified by FACS and confocal microscopy (see details below) by direct labeling with recombinant HEL (Sigma-Aldrich) conjugated with Alexa 647 (noted HEL-A647). This conjugation was made with the Alexa Fluor Antibody Labeling Kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer instructions. A Bio-Gel P-6 (Biorad) loaded column was used to separate HEL-A647 conjugates from free dye. C57BL/6, CD45.1 and CD45.2 mice and were purchased from Charles Rivers Laboratories. Mice were between 7 and 15 weeks old at time of infection and were sacrificed by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation or cervical dislocation.</p>

<title>IgGs secreting cells ELISPOT assay</title>
<p>ELISPOT assay to enumerate MuHV-4 specific B cells was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Sangster1">[8]</xref>. Briefly, purified MuHV-4 were disrupted for 10 min in PBS+0.05% Triton X-100 and plated at 5×10<sup>6</sup> PFU/well in 96-well MultiScreen HA mixed cellulose filter plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Plates were incubated overnight at 4°C, washed with PBS and blocked for 1 h at 37°C with complete medium (RPMI-1640+10% heat inactivated FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin and 1 mM sodium pyruvate). Latently infected (CD19<sup>+</sup> YFP<sup>+</sup>) and non-infected (CD19<sup>+</sup> YFP<sup>−</sup>) B cells were sorted from spleens on a FACS Aria (BD Biosciences). Serial four-fold dilutions of sorted cells were prepared in complete medium and added under 100 ul/well in four replicate wells per cell amount. Cells were incubated overnight at 37°C in a humid 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Plates were washed with PBS and incubated for 2 h at room-temperature with Alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibodies (Southern Biotech) diluted 1/500 in PBS+0.5% FBS. After thorough washes spots were revealed at room temperature with 1 mg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma) in diethanolamine buffer. Upon optimal spot development plates were washed and dried. Blue spots representing single antibody-secreting cells (ASC) were counted under an Olympus SZ51 microscope. Total number of ASC were determined as described above except that plates were coated with 0.5 µg/well of a goat anti-mouse κ antibodies (Southern Biotech) diluted in PBS.</p>

<title>In vitro infection by co-culture assay</title>
<p>In vitro infection by co-culture assay was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004269-Frederico2">[29]</xref>. 24 h prior co-culture, 3.10<sup>5</sup> RAW-264 and BHK-21 cells were seeded in 24-well plate. After cell adhesion (4–6 h), media was removed and cell infected overnight with indicated MuHV-4 at 9.10<sup>5</sup> pfu per condition. The next day, spleens were harvested and single cell suspensions were prepared by spleen disruption, filtration on 100 µm cell strainer and red blood cells removal by centrifugation on ficoll gradient (Biowest). Splenocytes were washed and added to cells at 10<sup>6</sup>/well. As a negative control, splenocytes were exposed to free viruses. In order to have enough cells to work with, spleens from two SW<sub>HEL</sub> mice were pooled. For each experiments, two suspensions were analysed in parallel. After 48 h of co-culture, cells were harvested and stained with CD11b (to exclude RAW-264 cells), CD19 and HEL. Infection of RAW-264 was systematically evaluated 24 h post infection by monitoring GFP expression in cells not co-cultured with splenocytes (data not shown).</p>

<title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>Single cell suspensions were prepared from spleens. Red blood cells were lysed in hypotonic NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and stainings were performed at 4°C in PBS+4% FCS and 1 mM EDTA. Briefly, cells were blocked by 10 min incubation with FcBlock (anti-CD16/32, 2.4G2, BD bioscience), washed, and stained for 20 min. For biotinilated antibodies, extra 20 min incubation with streptavidin was performed. MuHV-4 infected cells were monitored based on their endogenous YFP expression. The following antibodies were used: anti-CD69 PE (H1.2F3), anti-CD95 PE (Jo2), anti-CD19 APC-Cy7 or APC-H7 (1D3), anti-IgM PE (R6-60.2), anti-IgD Biotin (11-26c.2a), CD11b PE or v450 (M1/70) (BD Biosciences); CD45.2 Brilliant Violet 510 (104) (BioLegend); anti-CD45.1 PeCy7 (A20), and anti-GL-7 Biotin (Ebioscience). Streptavidin-Cy5 (BD Biosciences) was used to reveal biotinilated antibodies. HEL specific B cells were identified with the HEL-A647 conjugate described above. Samples were acquired on a FACS Canto or on a LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences), using DIVA software (BD Biosciences) for acquisition and Flowjo v.6.4.7 (Tree Star) for analysis. Cells were gated on live cells based on FSC/SSC parameters and cell doublets were excluded based on FSC-W signal.</p>

Spleens were then embedded in OCT (Tissue Tek), frozen and sectioned (40 µm). For immunofluorescence staining, sections were encircled with a Fatpen and rehydrated 10 min in phosphate buffer. All incubations were made in humid chamber, protected from light. Sections were permeabilized for 1 h at room temperature in 1% triton and blocked 1 h in 1% BSA+FcBlock (anti-CD16/32, 2.4G2, BD bioscience). Stainings were performed using the following reagents: anti-GFP Alexa 488 (Invitrogen), anti-GL-7 Biotin (GL-7, Ebioscience), HEL-A647 (described above) and Hoechst 33343 (Invitrogen). Streptavidin Alexa568 (Invitrogen) was used for biotinilated antibodies, incubated 1 h at room temperature. Slides were washed, mounted in Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech) and kept at 4°C.

<title>Cell sorting and in vitro reactivation assay</title>
<p>HEL<sup>+</sup> B cells (CD19<sup>+</sup>, HEL<sup>+</sup>) and HEL<sup>−</sup> B cells (CD19<sup>+</sup>, HEL<sup>−</sup>) were sorted using a FACS Aria (BD Biosciences) and used for in vitro reactivation assay to quantify latent infection. Serial dilutions of freshly isolated cells were co-cultured with BHK-21 in complete media supplemented with 50 µg/ml of Gentamycin (Invitrogen). Lysing half of the sorted cells by a quick freeze/thaw cycle before coculture allowed us to assess the presence of preformed viral particles, indicative of lytic infection. After 5 days, BHK-21 were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with toluidine blue for plaque counting.
