<abstract>
<p>Infection-related development of phytopathogenic fungi is initiated by sensing and responding to plant surface cues. This response can result in the formation of specialized infection structures, so-called appressoria. To unravel the program inducing filaments and appressoria in the biotrophic smut fungus <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>, we exposed cells to a hydrophobic surface and the cutin monomer 16-hydroxy hexadecanoic acid. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling at the pre-penetration stage documented dramatic transcriptional changes in almost 20% of the genes. Comparisons with the <italic>U. maydis sho1 msb2</italic> double mutant, lacking two putative sensors for plant surface cues, revealed that these plasma membrane receptors regulate a small subset of the surface cue-induced genes comprising mainly secreted proteins including potential plant cell wall degrading enzymes. Targeted gene deletion analysis ascribed a role to up-regulated GH51 and GH62 arabinofuranosidases during plant penetration. Among the <italic>sho1</italic>/<italic>msb2</italic>-dependently expressed genes were several secreted effectors that are essential for virulence. Our data also demonstrate specific effects on two transcription factors that redirect the transcriptional regulatory network towards appressorium formation and plant penetration. This shows that plant surface cues prime <italic>U. maydis</italic> for biotrophic development.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>A basic requirement for pathogens to infect their hosts and to cause disease is to detect that they are in contact with the host surface. Plant pathogenic fungi typically respond to leaf surface contact with the development of specialized infection structures enabling the fungus to penetrate the leaf cuticle and to enter the plant tissue. In this study we analyzed the response of the corn smut fungus <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> to two plant surface cues, such as hydrophobic surface and cutin monomers. Based on genome-wide gene expression analysis we found that these cues trigger the production of secreted plant cell wall degrading enzymes helping the fungus to penetrate the plant surface. In addition, genes were activated that code for a group of secreted proteins, so-called effectors, that affect virulence after penetration. These results demonstrate that plant surface cues trigger fungal penetration of the plant surface and also prime the fungus for later development inside plant tissue. These specific responses required two cell surface proteins that likely function as plant surface sensors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plant pathogenic fungi have developed sophisticated strategies to attach to and subsequently invade their host, often by undergoing distinct morphological changes during this part of the life cycle. These include filament formation upon recognition of the host surface and development of specialized infection structures. Such structures, appressoria or hyphopodia, facilitate penetration of the host surface either by localized secretion of lytic enzymes or mechanical force. The host surface provides a variety of physical and chemical stimuli that are perceived by fungi and that induce differentiation and appressorium formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Kolattukudy1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Kumamoto1">[3]</xref>. Appressorium formation is a complex, highly regulated process involving cell wall modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Abramovitch1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Xu1">[8]</xref> changes in gene regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Both1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Leroch1">[14]</xref> and in cytoskeletal organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Kwon1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Ryder1">[18]</xref>. Learning about the molecular mechanisms that are required for perception and integration of these stimuli is crucial to understand how plant pathogens enter their host.</p>
<p>The <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> – <italic>Zea mays</italic> pathosystem has emerged as the current model for plant pathogenic basidiomycetes and as one of the few models for a true biotrophic interaction that persists throughout fungal development inside the host plant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Brefort1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Kamper1">[21]</xref>. For colonization of its host plant maize, <italic>U. maydis</italic> is equipped with a large set of novel secreted effectors which are needed to suppress plant defense responses and to reprogram the host metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Doehlemann1">[22]</xref>. Pathogenic development of <italic>U. maydis</italic> is initiated by the filamentous dikaryon that is generated after pheromone-induced fusion of two compatible haploid <italic>U. maydis</italic> cells. Filamentation requires the heterodimeric bE/bW transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Brefort1">[19]</xref>. The dikaryotic filament grows unipolar, and retraction septa delimit the cytoplasm-filled tip compartment from the older parts of the filament <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Snetselaar2">[23]</xref>. On the plant surface, the tip cell eventually differentiates an appressorium, which facilitates penetration of the plant cuticle and cell wall. In contrast to the dome-shaped melanized appressoria of <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> or <italic>Colletotrichum spp.</italic> that penetrate mainly by high turgor pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Bechinger1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Howard1">[25]</xref>, appressoria of <italic>U. maydis</italic> are non-melanized and are proposed to penetrate the cuticle by secretion of plant cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Schirawski1">[26]</xref>. Knowledge on how non-melanized appressoria penetrate the plant surface is sparse and comes from studies on the maize pathogen <italic>Cochliobolus carbonum</italic>, where many of the CWDE genes are subject to catabolite repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Tonukari1">[27]</xref>. After deletion of <italic>snf1</italic>, the activator of catabolite-repressed genes, a strong reduction in virulence is observed in <italic>C. carbonum</italic>, which could be attributed to reduced penetration efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Tonukari1">[27]</xref>. In <italic>U. maydis</italic> catabolite repression is largely independent from <italic>snf1</italic> and deletion of <italic>snf1</italic> did not profoundly affect virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Nadal1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>In fungal pathogens, appressorium formation is regulated by a conserved MAP kinase cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Zhao1">[29]</xref>. In <italic>U. maydis</italic>, this MAP kinase cascade signals in both, pheromone response and appressorium formation. The pheromone signal is perceived by a pheromone receptor and is further transmitted via the MAPKKK Kpp4, the MAPKK Fuz7 and the MAPK Kpp2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Muller1">[30]</xref>. Kpp2 phosphorylates the pheromone response factor Prf1, which regulates the expression of the <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> mating type genes, encoding the pheromone/pheromone receptor system and the heterodimeric transcription factor, respectively. After cell fusion, the active bE/bW heterodimer triggers the hierarchical expression of downstream transcription factors that together regulate 345 genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Heimel1">[31]</xref>. More than 90% of the <italic>b</italic>-regulated genes are regulated by Rbf1, a direct bE/bW target <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Heimel1">[31]</xref>. Rbf1 induces among others the expression of the transcription factors <italic>hdp1</italic> and <italic>biz1</italic> that are involved in filament formation and virulence, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Heimel1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Pothiratana1">[33]</xref>. While pheromone signaling alone can induce cell fusion and filamentous growth, it does not induce appressorium formation. The major stimulus for inducing appressorium formation in <italic>U. maydis</italic> is a hard, hydrophobic surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-MendozaMendoza1">[34]</xref>. In addition, chemical signals such as the cutin monomer 16-hydroxy hexadecanoid acid strongly enhance appressorium formation efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-MendozaMendoza1">[34]</xref>. While the MAP-kinase Kpp2 is crucial for filament and appressorium formation on a hydrophobic surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-MendozaMendoza1">[34]</xref>, a second MAP-kinase, Kpp6, is needed for appressorium function, i.e. penetration of the plant surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Brachmann1">[35]</xref>. Furthermore, two plasma membrane proteins, Sho1 and Msb2, that act upstream of the MAP-kinases Kpp2 and Kpp6, specifically regulate appressorium formation in response to the hydrophobic surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Lanver1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-FernandezAlvarez1">[37]</xref>. Sho1 and Msb2 are conserved proteins in fungi that regulate host penetration via MAP kinase signaling also in the phytopathogenic fungi <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> and <italic>M. oryzae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-PerezNadales1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Liu1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>A thorough analysis of the transcriptome at the stage of appressorium formation in phytopathogenic fungi has been carried out for the ascomycete fungi <italic>M. oryzae</italic> and <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, a hemibiotrophic pathogen of rice and a necrotrophic pathogen with a broad host range, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Oh1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Soanes1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Leroch1">[14]</xref>. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional changes during early pathogenic development of the biotroph <italic>U. maydis</italic>. We used the previously established <italic>in vitro</italic> system for infection-related development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-MendozaMendoza1">[34]</xref>, which allowed us to monitor transcriptional changes at the pre-penetration stage, i.e. during filamentation and appressorium formation. We could show that sensing of plant surface cues induces the expression of genes encoding plant cell wall degrading enzymes that contribute to the ability of <italic>U. maydis</italic> to penetrate the plant surface. On the other hand, plant surface cues induced expression of known secreted effectors that are needed specifically for biotrophic development after penetration. These responses were dependent on the putative sensors for hydrophobic surface Sho1 and Msb2. Thus, perception of plant surface cues primes <italic>U. maydis</italic> for biotrophic development.</p>

<title>Hydrophobic surface and hydroxy fatty acids induce major changes in the transcriptome of <italic>U. maydis</italic></title>
<p>Transcriptional profiling during early pathogenic development of <italic>U. maydis</italic> was performed using custom Affymetrix arrays (MPIUstilagoA) covering 5823 of the predicted 6849 <italic>U. maydis</italic> genes. To induce appressoria the solopathogenic AM1 strain was used. This solopathogenic strain does not require a mating partner for inducing filaments and appressoria, and carries an appressorium specific GFP-reporter construct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-MendozaMendoza1">[34]</xref>. The transcriptional response of <italic>U. maydis</italic> to a hydrophobic surface (HS) was monitored, by spraying AM1 in low nutrient medium on ParafilmM and incubating for 12 h (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). This time point was chosen as the transition from yeast-like cells to filaments had occurred efficiently and about 5% of the filaments had started to develop appressoria. This number did not increase upon prolonged incubation but resulted in re-growth of hyphae from appressoria (not shown), i.e. the 12 h time point represents the pre-penetration time point. To investigate the transcriptional response to the combination of hydrophobic surface and hydroxy fatty acids (HS+FA), the AM1 culture was supplemented with 100 µM 16-hydroxy hexadecanoid acid (HDA) prior to spray-inoculation of ParafilmM. After 12 h incubation 20% of the filaments had started to develop appressoria. To create a reference data set for the experiment, cells of the AM1 strain were sprayed on a hydrophilic glass surface and incubated for 2 h (glass control, GC). This time point was chosen to allow cell sedimentation and the adaption to the low nutrient medium. In addition, this time point allowed to avoid nutrient depletion stress which would have occurred if undifferentiated cells had been incubated for 12 h, the time needed to observe differentiated cells on the hydrophobic surface. The comparison of three biological replicates generated under the three conditions (HS, HS+FA, GC) allowed us to monitor the transcriptional response of <italic>U. maydis</italic> to the physical and chemical plant-derived surface cues.</p>
<p>We compared the transcriptional changes between filaments and sporidia (HS vs GC), between appressoria and yeast-like cells (HS+FA vs GC), and between appressoria and filaments (HS+FA vs HS). Genes that showed a fold-change ≥2 (p-value ≤0.05 with FDR of 0.01) were considered to be differentially expressed. By this analysis, 725 genes were found to be induced either by the hydrophobic surface or by the combination of hydrophobic surface and fatty acid signal, and 629 genes were found to be repressed by these cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004272-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s010">Table S1</xref>). For 6 of the surface-cue induced genes the microarray data was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Based on the expression pattern, we categorized the identified 1223 differentially regulated genes in 8 different groups: 1) HS- and FA-induced (170 genes); 2) HS-induced (264 genes); 3) FA-induced (92 genes); 4) HS-induced, FA-repressed (166 genes); 5) HS-repressed, FA-induced (71 genes); 6) FA-repressed (69 genes); 7) HS-repressed (246 genes); 8) HS- and FA-repressed (145 genes; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s010">Table S1</xref>). Thus, the plant surface cues induce major changes in the transcriptome of <italic>U. maydis</italic>, reflecting the switch from saprophytic growth to pathogenic development. Of the 526 HS and FA induced genes (group 1, 2 and 3) 137 have been previously identified to be up-regulated in tumors of infected maize plants when compared to <italic>U. maydis</italic> grown in axenic culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Kamper1">[21]</xref>. Only 62 of the HS and FA-induced genes were found repressed in tumors. In accordance with that, 173 of the 460 HS and FA-repressed genes (group 6, 7 and 8) are also repressed in tumors while only 51 of the HS and/or FA-repressed genes are induced in tumor tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Kamper1">[21]</xref>. This correlation suggests that sensing and responding to plant surface cues induces an adaption that is to a significant extent maintained during subsequent biotrophic development.</p>

<title>The plasma membrane proteins Sho1 and Msb2 are responsible for the expression of a subset of the surface cue-induced genes</title>
<p>We were particularly interested in genes that are specifically expressed at the appressorial stage. Therefore we included in our microarray experiment the AM1Δsho1Δmsb2 strain, a mutant that is unable to form appressoria in response to the hydrophobic surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Lanver1">[36]</xref>. Only 6 genes were found to be differentially regulated in the mutant compared to AM1 when grown on the hydrophobic surface without addition of hydroxy fatty acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s011">Table S2</xref>). Under efficient appressorium-inducing conditions (HS+FA), 61 differentially regulated genes were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s011">Table S2</xref>). Of these genes 60 were down-regulated in the Δ<italic>sho1</italic>Δ<italic>msb2</italic> mutant, including the 6 genes that were identified as <italic>sho1/msb2</italic> dependently expressed on the hydrophobic surface alone. Interestingly, 58 of these 60 genes belong to the HS and/or FA-induced genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004272-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s011">Table S2</xref>), demonstrating that Sho1 and Msb2 are necessary for the induction of a subset of the surface-cue induced genes. Given that on the hydrophobic surface only 5% of the filaments develop appressoria, the minor difference between the transcriptome of the Δ<italic>sho1</italic>Δ<italic>msb2</italic> mutant compared to the AM1 strain under this condition is likely due to those few AM1 hyphae that have differentiated an appressorium. Since the difference in the transcriptome of the Δ<italic>sho1</italic>Δ<italic>msb2</italic> mutant and the AM1 strain was much more evident under efficient appressorium inducing conditions (HS+FA), this suggests that the <italic>sho1 msb2</italic> double mutant arrests at a stage before appressorium formation.</p>

<title>Plant surface cues induce the expression of secreted effector proteins needed for biotrophic development</title>
<p>To establish compatibility, biotrophic pathogens need to overcome the PAMP (pathogen-associated molecular pattern)-triggered plant defense mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Jones1">[40]</xref>. To achieve this, microbial pathogens secrete so-called effectors, various secreted proteins, that interfere with the plant immune response and facilitates compatibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Jones1">[40]</xref>. A hypergeometric enrichment test revealed that during filament- and appressorium formation genes encoding secreted proteins were significantly over-represented among the induced genes and under-represented among the repressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004272-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Of the 554 <italic>U. maydis</italic> genes predicted to encode secreted proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Muller2">[41]</xref>, 139 genes were induced during filament- and appressorium formation. Remarkably, of the 60 genes that require <italic>sho1</italic> and <italic>msb2</italic> for their induction 46 encode proteins predicted to be secreted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004272-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s011">Table S2</xref>). This indicates a link between plant surface cue perception and expression of secreted proteins. By hierarchical clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Eisen1">[42]</xref> the 139 surface cue-induced genes predicted to encode secreted proteins were categorized into three major groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004272-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s012">Table S3</xref>). Group A includes 47 genes that were HS-induced and predominantly FA-repressed. Group B includes 48 genes that were HS and FA-induced. In group C, which comprises 42 genes, genes were <italic>sho1</italic>/<italic>msb2</italic>-dependently induced by HS and/or FA. In this latter group we found important virulence factors like <italic>cmu1</italic> (<italic>um05731</italic>), <italic>pit2</italic> (<italic>um01375</italic>) and <italic>stp1</italic> (<italic>um02475</italic>). Cmu1 is a secreted chorismate mutase that is taken up by plant cells where it suppresses salicylic acid synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Djamei2">[43]</xref>. Pit2 is a secreted effector with protease inhibitor activity that is proposed to function in conjunction with the transmembrane protein Pit1 to maintain biotrophy during late stages of plant infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Doehlemann2">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Mueller1">[45]</xref>. Interestingly, <italic>pit1</italic> shows a similar expression profile as <italic>pit2</italic>, i.e. is induced by the surface cues and requires <italic>sho1</italic> and <italic>msb2</italic> for induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s011">Table S2</xref>). <italic>stp1</italic> encodes a secreted effector that is essential for the initial establishment of hyphae in the epidermal cell layer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Schipper1">[46]</xref>. All these effectors have in common that they have their specific function after penetration of the plant surface and are not involved in saprophytic growth or in the penetration process itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Djamei2">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Doehlemann2">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Schipper1">[46]</xref>. Many <italic>U. maydis</italic> effectors are organized in gene clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Kamper1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Schirawski2">[47]</xref>, e.g. <italic>stp1</italic> resides in cluster 5B. Besides <italic>stp1</italic>, group C contained all three genes of cluster 8A (<italic>um03201, um03202, um10403</italic>), 4 of 6 cluster 2B genes (<italic>um01297, um01299, um01300, um01301</italic>), two genes (<italic>um06180, um06181</italic>) of the <italic>mig2</italic> cluster and the paralog mig2-6 (<italic>um06126</italic>) located elsewhere in the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Farfsing1">[48]</xref>, two genes of cluster 12-15 (<italic>um10418, um12258</italic>), as well as single genes of cluster 11-16 (<italic>um11062</italic>), 17-15 (<italic>um04816</italic>) and 1-32 (<italic>um00792</italic>). Although for these genes a virulence function has not yet been demonstrated, it is tempting to speculate that many of the surface-cue induced genes predicted to encode secreted proteins function as effectors and contribute to the establishment of biotrophy. While most of the effectors were present in group C, another characterized effector, <italic>pep1</italic> (<italic>um01987</italic>) was found in group A of the HS-induced, FA-repressed genes. Pep1 is needed to suppress the oxidative burst during penetration of the plant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Hemetsberger1">[49]</xref>. <italic>pep1</italic> expression is induced during colonization and stays on during all stages of biotrophic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Doehlemann3">[50]</xref>. The fact that we detect a down-regulation by FA suggests that additional factors present on the plant surface or during penetration but absent in the <italic>in vitro</italic> system contribute to the expression of this gene. Little is known about the signals that trigger effector gene expression in eukaryotic plant pathogens. Nitrogen limitation can induce the expression of some fungal effectors <italic>in vitro</italic> though it is unlikely that nitrogen limitation is the major trigger inside plant tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Bolton1">[51]</xref>. Our results clearly show that expression of secreted effectors is a key response to sensing plant surface cues. With Sho1 and Msb2 being the receptors for perceiving the surface signals we could identify for the first time membrane-bound receptors that trigger effector gene expression in a plant pathogen. During appressorium formation of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genes predicted to encode secreted proteins were also found to be enriched among the induced genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Oh1">[11]</xref>. However, it remains to be shown whether any of these effectors are required for the hemibiotrophic lifestyle of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. In <italic>B. cinerea</italic> the cerato-platanin family protein SPL1 is transcriptionally induced during appressorium formation on apple wax surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Leroch1">[14]</xref>. This protein contributes to the necrotrophic lifestyle of the fungus by inducing a hypersensitive response in plant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Frias1">[52]</xref>. Overall, the results suggest that fungal plant pathogens become primed for their specific mode of development already prior to penetration when they are growing on the plant surface.</p>

<title>Plant surface cues induce the expression of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes</title>
<p>For phytopathogenic fungi the first obstacle to overcome is the plant cuticle and the plant cell wall. It is generally assumed that non-melanized appressoria penetrate the plant surface through local enzymatic digestion of the plant cell wall. However, in <italic>U. maydis</italic>, attempts to identify CWDEs with a virulence function have not yet been successful, most likely due to gene redundancy. We expected that during appressorium formation genes encoding potential CWDEs are transcriptionally induced. Of 81 secreted carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZy) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Cantarel1">[53]</xref> encoded by the <italic>U. maydis</italic> genome, 38 are potentially involved in the modification of the plant cell wall (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s013">Table S4</xref>). Of those genes 15 were found to be differentially expressed during filament and appressorium formation and 7 of them belong to group C (<italic>um11211</italic>, <italic>um12233</italic>, <italic>um04422</italic>, <italic>um02523</italic>, <italic>um04816</italic>, <italic>um00876</italic>, <italic>um01829</italic>). <italic>um11211</italic> encodes a putative cutinase that could be involved in the initial digestion of the plant cuticle. <italic>um12233</italic> encodes a pectin methylesterase. However, pectin is only a minor component of the maize cell wall and pectinolytic enzymes of <italic>U. maydis</italic>, including <italic>um12233</italic> have been shown previously to be not involved in pathogenicity of <italic>U. maydis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Doehlemann4">[54]</xref>. Two genes encoding GH128 β-1,3-glucanases (<italic>um05528</italic>, <italic>um05704</italic>) were highly induced during filament and appressorium formation. These enzymes could either modify the fungal cell wall, or degrade callose depositions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Stone1">[55]</xref>.</p>
<p>The cell wall of maize epidermal cells consists mainly of cellulose (60%) and hemicellulose (30%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Carpita1">[56]</xref>. Strikingly, all three cellulases of the GH45 family in <italic>U. maydis</italic>, <italic>um06332</italic> (<italic>egl1</italic>), <italic>um02523</italic> (<italic>egl2</italic>) and <italic>um04816</italic> (<italic>egl3</italic>), were highly induced during filament and appressorium formation and the latter two belong to group C, i.e. were <italic>sho1</italic>/<italic>msb2</italic>-dependently expressed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s013">Table S4</xref>). The endoglucanase <italic>egl1</italic> (<italic>um06332</italic>) has been identified previously as filament-specifically expressed gene but its deletion did not affect virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Schauwecker1">[57]</xref>. To assess redundancy of GH45 enzymes, all three genes were co-deleted in the solopathogenic SG200 strain. Maize plants were infected with the triple mutant and the disease symptoms were scored according to severity as illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s002">Figure S2</xref>. However, in such infections SG200Δ3egl was as virulent as the SG200 strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Likewise, appressorium and filament formation were not affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The role of cellulases for plant pathogenic fungi is subject of controversial debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Gibson1">[58]</xref>. While the biotroph <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> lacks canonical enzymes for cellulose degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Spanu1">[59]</xref>, the hemibiotroph <italic>M. oryzae</italic> has a large diversity of cellulases, and enzymes of the GH6 and GH7 family have been demonstrated to be involved in penetration and virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-VanVu1">[60]</xref>. In <italic>U. maydis</italic> the repertoire of cellulases is limited to GH45, GH3 and GH5 family members of which only the GH45 enzymes were up-regulated by the surface cues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s013">Table S4</xref>). However, this does not exclude the possibility that GH5 and GH3 enzymes can substitute for GH45 enzymes during pathogenic development of <italic>U. maydis</italic>. Alternatively, cellulose degradation plays no role during plant colonization by <italic>U. maydis</italic>.</p>
<p>The main component of hemicellulose in maize cell walls is arabinoxylan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Carpita1">[56]</xref>. Efficient degradation of arabinoxylan requires release of arabinofuranose side chains by α-L-arabinofuranosidases, as this makes the polymer more accessible to xylanases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-deVries1">[61]</xref>. <italic>U. maydis</italic> has two GH51 α-L-arabinofuranosidases (<italic>um01829, um00837</italic>). The GH51 arabinofuranosidase <italic>um01829</italic> (<italic>afg1</italic>) was 12-fold induced during appressorium formation and required <italic>sho1</italic> and <italic>msb2</italic> for induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s011">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s013">S4</xref>). GH51 arabinofuranosidases have been shown to share their enzymatic activity against arabinoxylan with GH62 enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Beylot1">[62]</xref> and <italic>U. maydis</italic> encodes one member of GH62 (<italic>um04309</italic>). The arabinofuranosidase genes <italic>um00837</italic> (<italic>afg2</italic>) and <italic>um04309</italic> (<italic>afg3</italic>) were not represented on the Affymetrix array. Therefore, we performed quantitative real-time PCR which revealed that <italic>afg3</italic> is 4-fold induced during appressorium formation while <italic>afg2</italic> is not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Single deletions of <italic>afg1</italic>, <italic>afg2</italic> and <italic>afg3</italic> did not affect virulence but a triple deletion strain (SG200Δ3afg) caused significantly less severe symptoms (tumors and heavy tumors) on infected maize plants than the SG200 control strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004272-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). We observed partial complementation when either <italic>afg1</italic>, <italic>afg2</italic> or <italic>afg3</italic> were re-integrated into the genome of SG200Δ3afg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004272-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). While filament and appressorium formation were not affected by the triple deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004272-g003">Figure 3B and C</xref>), appressoria of the mutant strain had a reduced penetration efficiency on maize plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004272-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), which most likely explains the reduced virulence. In <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic> a GH54 arabinofuranosidase, Ssaxp, is required for full virulence on canola plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Yajima1">[63]</xref> and in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> a GH51 as well as a GH62 enzyme are induced during appressorium formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Soanes1">[12]</xref>.

<p>Notably, some GH families were differentially expressed. For example one GH16 xyloglucanase (<italic>um01898</italic>) was induced during development on the hydrophobic surface while two GH16 members (<italic>um04368, um05036</italic>) were repressed. Likewise one GH10 β-1,4-endoglucanase (<italic>um04422</italic>) was induced during appressorium formation and another one (<italic>um03411</italic>) was repressed at this stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s013">Table S4</xref>).</p>
<p>During infection, plant cell wall components can act as DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) and trigger plant defense responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Albert1">[64]</xref>. It is possible that specific CWDEs are down-regulated during appressorium formation to lower the potential to trigger plant defence responses, i.e. the release of elicitors produced by these enzymes. A differentially controlled expression of CWDEs might therefore be necessary to facilitate covert penetration of the plant surface.</p>
<p>In summary, our observation that hydrophobicity and cutin monomers induce the expression of genes encoding plant cell wall degrading enzymes like pectinases, cellulases and arabinofuranosidases demonstrates that the very first contact with the plant surface is already sufficient to prepare the fungus for penetration of the cell wall. Whether hyphal exposure to the respective substrates of these enzymes, i.e. pectin, cellulose and hemicellulose leads to an additional enhancement of expression during the penetration process is currently unknown.</p>

<title>Changes in the fungal cell wall during <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of filaments and appressoria</title>
<p>Chitin synthases are crucial for hyphal growth, cell wall integrity and appressorium formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Werner1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Odenbach1">[66]</xref>. During filamentation (HS vs GC) we identified 4 induced chitin synthases (CHS), <italic>chs1</italic> (<italic>um10718</italic>), <italic>chs6</italic> (<italic>um10367</italic>), <italic>chs7</italic> (<italic>um05480</italic>) and <italic>mcs1</italic> (<italic>um03204</italic>). The latter three are important for pathogenic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-GarceraTeruel1">[67]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Weber1">[69]</xref>. Interestingly, we also could identify a SKT5 like gene (<italic>um10641</italic>) as being up-regulated during filament formation (HS vs GC; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s010">Table S1</xref>). SKT5 acts as CHS activator in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-DeMarini1">[70]</xref>, consistent with strong chitin synthase activity during filamentous growth. During appressorium formation (HS+FA vs GC) no significant changes in expression of the CHSs could be detected compared with cells forming filaments. Even though chitin is an important structural component of the fungal cell wall, it also acts as elicitor for the plant defense system and is degraded by chitinases further enhancing elicitation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Benhamou1">[71]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Tanaka1">[73]</xref>. Since chitosan, the N-deacetylated form of chitin, is a poor substrate for chitinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Ride1">[74]</xref>, conversion of chitin to chitosan may protect the fungal cell wall from degradation by extracellular plant chitinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-ElGueddari1">[75]</xref>. This conversion is facilitated by chitin deacetylases (CDA) and synthesis of these enzymes correlates with a lack of surface exposed chitin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Deising1">[76]</xref>. Two CDAs were induced (<italic>um11922, um01788</italic>) during appressorium formation, one CDA was HS-induced and FA-repressed (<italic>um01143</italic>) and another one (<italic>um00638</italic>) was HS-repressed and FA-induced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s013">Table S4</xref>). This suggests that during filament and appressorium formation chitin is converted to chitosan to mask the growing hyphae. Extensive modification of the fungal cell wall during the morphological transition from yeast-like cells to filaments and appressoria is further supported by induced expression of a chitin binding protein (<italic>um00330</italic>), a chitinase (<italic>um05290</italic>), an α-mannosidase (<italic>um01957</italic>) and two β-1,3-glucanases (<italic>um05528</italic>, <italic>um05704</italic>).</p>
<p>One conserved signalling cascade that regulates cell morphology and cell wall integrity in fungi is the MOR/RAM pathway with its central NDR kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Maerz1">[77]</xref>. The central NDR kinase in <italic>U. maydis</italic> is Ukc1 (Um04956).

In <italic>U. maydis</italic> the β-oxidation pathway was down-regulated during filament formation and even more repressed during appressorium formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s014">Table S5</xref>). We observed instead that the two key enzymes of glycolysis, 6-phosphofructokinase (<italic>um11409</italic>) and pyruvate kinasae (<italic>um00157</italic>) were transcriptionally induced during filament and appressorium formation (HS vs GC and HS+FA vs GC) while the gluconeogenesis-driving fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (<italic>um02703</italic>) was repressed under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s014">Table S5</xref>). In addition, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (<italic>um05275</italic>), the negative regulator of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, was transcriptionally repressed. This suggests that during appressorium formation of <italic>U. maydis</italic> generation of energy and acetyl-CoA are mainly derived from glycolysis. Similar observations have been made for the powdery mildew fungus <italic>B. graminis</italic>, where genes for glycolytic enzymes were induced during appressorium formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Both1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>While genes for enzymes of the TCA cycle were moderately down-regulated during appressorium formation of <italic>U. maydis</italic>, we found that two enzymes of the GABA (γ-aminobutyrate)-shunt, i.e. glutamate decarboxylase (<italic>gad1</italic>, <italic>um06063</italic>) and GABA transaminase (<italic>gatA</italic>, <italic>um01080</italic>), were up-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s014">Table S5</xref>). The GABA-shunt bypasses two enzymatic steps of the TCA cycle, resulting in one less molecule of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) for each molecule of α-ketoglutarate traversing the shunt. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> GAD and the downstream components of the GABA shunt are required for oxidative stress response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Coleman1">[84]</xref>. We take this and the fact that <italic>U. maydis gad1</italic> is induced during oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Molina1">[85]</xref> as indication that the observed up-regulation of <italic>gad1</italic> and <italic>gatA</italic> during appressorium formation might prime <italic>U. maydis</italic> against oxidative burst during penetration. However, deletion of <italic>gad1</italic> and <italic>gatA</italic> did not affect virulence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s003">Figure S3</xref>), and growth of the mutants under oxidative stress was not altered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s007">Figure S7</xref>). In addition, the mutants were able to grow on medium with glutamate or GABA as sole carbon source (not shown). Since the genome of <italic>U. maydis</italic> encodes in total three glutamate decarboxylases and two putative GABA transaminases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s014">Table S5</xref>), gene redundancy is the likely cause for the lack of mutant phenotypes.</p>
<p>Under nitrogen starvation <italic>U. maydis</italic> produces and secretes large amounts of the biosurfactants ustilagic acid and mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Hewald1">[86]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Teichmann1">[87]</xref>. While ustilagic acid has antimicrobial activity, the role of MELs for <italic>U. maydis</italic> is unclear. MELs are secreted by many microorganisms and they are generally involved in the attachment and detachment to and from solid surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Ron1">[88]</xref>. Interestingly, we found that the genes for two key enzymes of MEL biosynthesis, <italic>emt1</italic> and <italic>mac1</italic>, encoding a glycosyltransferase and acyltransferase, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Hewald1">[86]</xref>, are specifically induced during appressorium formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s010">Table S1</xref>) while another gene of the MEL biosynthesis cluster, <italic>mat1</italic>, encoding an acetyltransferase was down-regulated during appressorium formation. This suggests that <italic>U. maydis</italic> secretes deacetylated MELs during appressorium formation. Whether this contributes to surface attachment at the site of penetration, needs to be investigated.</p>

<title>Differential regulation of transport processes during <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of filaments and appressoria</title>
<p>Based on our finding that plant surface cues induce the expression of effectors genes that are needed inside the plant to establish biotrophy, we also expected to find genes that facilitate nutrient uptake during biotrophic growth. Two oligo peptide transporters of the OPT superfamily (<italic>um11057, um04347</italic>) were highly up-regulated during appressorium formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s015">Table S6</xref>) and remained induced during tumor formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Kamper1">[21]</xref>. In plants, members of this family function as transporters of small peptides, glutathione, and metal-chelates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Lubkowitz1">[89]</xref>. Besides peptide transporters, 8 amino acid transporters were up-regulated during appressorium formation and three were down-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s015">Table S6</xref>). Induction of amino acid and peptide transporters during development has also been described in other plant pathogenic fungi, e.g. <italic>Uromyces fabae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Hahn1">[90]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Struck1">[91]</xref>, <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Divon1">[92]</xref> and <italic>M. oryzae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Oh1">[11]</xref>. This indicates that amino acids and peptides contribute to nutrition of <italic>U. maydis</italic> during its biotrophic phase. Five sugar transporters were down-regulated during filament and appressorium formation and two (<italic>um03034</italic> and <italic>srt1</italic>) were up-regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s015">Table S6</xref>). Of these latter ones Srt1, a high affinity sucrose transporter, has been shown to be an important virulence factor needed for biotrophic growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Wahl1">[93]</xref>. By relying on the import of sucrose for biotrophic growth, the plant immune response that could be elicited by invertase-generated free monosaccharides in the apoplast, is likely to be circumvented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Wahl1">[93]</xref>. The up-regulation of <italic>srt1</italic> already on the hydrophobic surface suggests that uptake of sucrose may already be important during the early stages of colonization.</p>
<p>Remarkably, two P-type ATPases (<italic>acu1</italic> and <italic>acu2</italic>) were also highly induced during filament and appressorium formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s015">Table S6</xref>) and also in tumor tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Kamper1">[21]</xref>. Acu1 and Acu2 of <italic>U. maydis</italic> are high affinity potassium and sodium transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Benito1">[94]</xref>. We hypothesized that Acu1 and Acu2 might play a role in potassium and/or sodium supply during pathogenic development and deleted the genes in the solopathogenic AN1 strain. The Δ<italic>acu1</italic> single mutant and the Δ<italic>acu1</italic>Δ<italic>acu2</italic> double mutant were unable to grow on sodium/potassium starvation media while Δ<italic>acu2</italic> single mutants showed normal growth under those conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s008">Figure S8</xref>). The growth defect of the Δ<italic>acu1</italic> and Δ<italic>acu1</italic>Δ<italic>acu2</italic> strains was fully suppressed by adding potassium to the medium but not by adding sodium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s008">Figure S8</xref>). This demonstrates that <italic>acu1</italic> is essential for potassium supply under starvation conditions. However, neither the <italic>acu1</italic> and <italic>acu2</italic> single deletion mutants nor the double mutant were affected in their ability to form filaments and appressoria, and their virulence was comparable to the AN1 strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This indicates that at least under our laboratory conditions, high affinity potassium uptake of <italic>U. maydis</italic> is dispensable for the biotrophic interaction.</p>
<p>The genes for putative mechano-sensitive ion channel transporters (<italic>um10559</italic>, <italic>um04550</italic> and <italic>um02237</italic>) were also up-regulated during filament formation.

<title>Transcription factors act as key regulators of differentiation</title>
<p>The switch from saprophytic growth to pathogenic development requires a precise regulation of cellular and developmental processes. The key elements in such processes are transcription factors (TFs). Of a total of 55 differentially regulated TFs, 28 were induced during filament and appressorium formation and 9 of them showed a particularly high expression in appressoria compared to filaments (HS+FA vs GC; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s016">Table S7</xref>).

To prove that the generated deletion construct is functional we performed the gene replacement in the diploid strain FBD11 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Banuett1">[98]</xref>.

The bE/bW complex serves as molecular switch for pathogenic development and induces a hierarchical network of downstream TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004272-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This was uncovered by studying in a time-resolved manner the consequences of induced over-expression of a bE/bW heterodimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Heimel1">[31]</xref>. From the 206 <italic>b</italic>-dependently induced genes identified in this study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Heimel1">[31]</xref>, 145 genes were found induced by the surface cues, and from the 139 <italic>b</italic>-dependently repressed genes, 78 genes were repressed by the plant-derived surface signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004272.s010">Table S1</xref>).

Preliminary analysis showed that deletion mutants for <italic>hdp2</italic> were nonpathogenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Heimel1">[31]</xref> and we now demonstrated that such mutants are unable to form appressoria, while filamentous growth was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004272-g004">Figure 4B–E</xref>). Both defects could be fully complemented by introducing a single copy of <italic>hdp2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004272-g004">Figure 4B and E</xref>). <italic>hdp2</italic> mutants thus resemble <italic>sho1 msb2</italic> double mutants with respect to appressorium formation and virulence.

<p>Another known transcriptional target of the <italic>b</italic>-cascade is the MAP kinase <italic>kpp6</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Heimel1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Brachmann1">[35]</xref>. This MAP kinase regulates the ability of appressoria to successfully penetrate. Our data showed that also <italic>kpp6</italic> is <italic>sho1</italic> and <italic>msb2</italic>-dependently expressed. This induction is likely to constitute a positive feedback loop to enhance MAP kinase activity and finally force plant penetration.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the induction of <italic>hdp2</italic>, <italic>biz1</italic> and <italic>kpp6</italic> was not completely abolished in the Δ<italic>sho1</italic>Δ<italic>msb2</italic> mutant. We consider it likely that this remaining induction is caused by <italic>b</italic>-cascade activity stimulated by pheromone signaling. This is supported by the up-regulation of the pheromone response factor <italic>prf1</italic> during filament formation. Pheromone signaling has been previously shown to be part of the response to the hydrophobic surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-MendozaMendoza1">[34]</xref>. Thus, the role of Sho1 and Msb2 is to feed into the <italic>b</italic>-cascade downstream of bE/bW to specifically enhance the expression of those genes that are responsible for the formation and function of appressoria. One possibility is that the <italic>b</italic>-cascade is redirected at the level of the Rbf1 regulator. However, this is unlikely because mutation of all six putative MAP kinase phosphorylation sites in Rbf1 does not influence virulence (D. Lanver and R. Kahmann, unpublished). Therefore, we speculate that the link between Sho1 and Msb2 and induction of the TFs is established by a yet unidentified TF that works in parallel with Rbf1 to induce expression of <italic>hdp2</italic>, <italic>biz1</italic>, and <italic>kpp6</italic>.</p>

<title>Summary and Conclusions</title>
<p>Our study has highlighted that almost 20% of all <italic>U. maydis</italic> genes are differentially regulated under the <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions that induce appressoria. Among the surface cue-induced genes we detected a strong over-representation of genes encoding secreted proteins, e.g. CWDEs that facilitate plant penetration. Furthermore, secreted effectors that are specifically needed for the establishment of biotrophy after entering the plant were transcriptionally induced. This expression pattern demonstrates that <italic>U. maydis</italic> becomes prepared to suppress plant defense responses already before penetration. Given the narrow host range of <italic>U. maydis</italic> establishing a compatible interaction only with maize and its ancestor teosinte, it is intriguing that compatibility factors such as effector genes are induced by the unspecific plant surface cues hydrophobicity and hydroxy fatty acid. This suggests that under natural conditions <italic>U. maydis</italic> and probably other smut fungi use trial and error to find a compatible host plant. This idea is supported by a recent study that demonstrates efficient appressorium formation of <italic>U. maydis</italic> on the non-host plant barley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004272-Hof1">[101]</xref>.</p>
<p>Compared to the extensive transcriptional response induced by the plant surface cues hydrophobicity and hydroxy fatty acids, two putative sensors of these cues, Sho1 and Msb2, are involved in the induction of only a subset of those genes. While it is not exactly clear what Sho1 and Msb2 sense, our transcriptomic data now provides evidence that Sho1 and Msb2 in <italic>U. maydis</italic> are required specifically for the expression of essential virulence factors. It is conceivable that during growth on a hydrophobic leaf surface the function of Sho1 and Msb2 is to determine the site for penetration and to trigger at this stage the local expression of plant cell wall degrading enzymes and effectors. Sho1 and Msb2 are likely to exert their effects on these genes via the <italic>b</italic>-cascade. They contribute specifically to full induction of the transcriptional <italic>b</italic>-network by regulating only those TFs that have their function during appressorium development. Thus, Sho1 and Msb2 direct the central transcriptional network towards penetration.</p>

<title>RNA isolation from filaments and appressoria</title>
<p>AM1 and AM1Δsho1Δmsb2 strains were grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.8 in YEPSL, concentrated to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.0 in low nutrient medium (2% YEPSL) and supplemented with or without 100 µM (f.c.) 16-hydroxy hexadecanoic acid (HDA, Sigma, Germany). 2 ml cell suspensions were sprayed (EcoSpray, Roth, Germany) on 100 cm<sup>2</sup> ParafilmM and incubated at 100% humidity at 28°C for 12 h. As control 2 ml cell suspensions were sprayed on glass plates and incubated for 2 h at 28°C. Cells that were not attached to the hydrophobic surface were washed away with water. Attached filaments and appressoria were harvested using a cell scraper (Greiner, Germany) and 1 ml of a 1∶1 mixture of aqua-phenol/chloroform and AE-buffer (50 mM NaAc, 10 mM EDTA, pH 5.3). From glass plates, where cells do not attach, cells were directly transferred to the aqua-phenol/chloroform/AE-buffer mixture. Samples were vortexed for 15 min with glass beads and incubated for 10 min at 60°C. Samples were centrifuged (15 min, 16,000 g) and the supernatant was washed with aqua-phenol. After additional centrifugation, RNA was precipitated with 300 mM (f.c.) sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol. RNA was pelleted (10 min, 16,000 g), washed in ethanol, air-dried and dissolved in water. Finally, RNA was purified by using Ambion Turbo DNA free Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad/USA) and RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden/Germany). The RNA quality was controlled using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.</p>
