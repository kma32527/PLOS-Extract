<abstract>
<p><italic>Paenibacillus larvae</italic>, the etiological agent of the globally occurring epizootic American Foulbrood (AFB) of honey bees, causes intestinal infections in honey bee larvae which develop into systemic infections inevitably leading to larval death. Massive brood mortality might eventually lead to collapse of the entire colony. Molecular mechanisms of host-microbe interactions in this system and of differences in virulence between <italic>P. larvae</italic> genotypes are poorly understood. Recently, it was demonstrated that the degradation of the peritrophic matrix lining the midgut epithelium is a key step in pathogenesis of <italic>P. larvae</italic> infections. Here, we present the isolation and identification of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49, a modular, chitin-degrading protein of <italic>P. larvae</italic> and demonstrate that this enzyme is crucial for the degradation of the larval peritrophic matrix during infection. <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 contains a module belonging to the auxiliary activity 10 (AA10, formerly CBM33) family of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) which are able to degrade recalcitrant polysaccharides. Using chitin-affinity purified <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49, we provide evidence that <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 degrades chitin via a metal ion-dependent, oxidative mechanism, as already described for members of the AA10 family. Using <italic>P. larvae</italic> mutants lacking <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 expression, we analyzed <italic>in vivo</italic> biological functions of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49. In the absence of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 expression, peritrophic matrix degradation was markedly reduced and <italic>P. larvae</italic> virulence was nearly abolished. This indicated that <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 is a key virulence factor for the species <italic>P. larvae</italic>. The identification of the functional role of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 in AFB pathogenesis broadens our understanding of this important family of chitin-binding and -degrading proteins, especially in those bacteria that can also act as entomopathogens.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>American Foulbrood and its etiological agent, <italic>Paenibacillus larvae</italic>, pose a serious threat to global honey bee health. So far, molecular mechanisms of host-microbe interactions are poorly understood in this system and no key virulence factor for the entire species has been identified. Here, we demonstrate that <italic>P. larvae</italic> expresses a chitin-binding and -degrading protein <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 harboring one module that belongs to the auxiliary activity 10 (AA10) family of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs). We provide evidence that <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 degrades chitin via a metal ion-dependent, oxidative mechanism, as already described for other members of the AA10 enzyme family. Using <italic>P. larvae</italic> mutants lacking <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 expression, we demonstrate that <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 is crucial for the degradation of the chitin-rich peritrophic matrix, a key step in pathogenesis of <italic>P. larvae</italic> infections. In the absence of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 expression the peritrophic matrix remained nearly intact and about 95% of the infected larvae survived infection. This clearly indicated that <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 is a key virulence factor of <italic>P. larvae</italic>. These results constitute important progress in our understanding of both <italic>P. larvae</italic> pathogenesis and the biological role of LPMOs in entomopathogens. Furthermore, knowing <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 and its role in pathogenesis opens new possibilities to develop curative measures for this disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vertebrates and invertebrates alike need to protect their intestinal epithelia against various chemical, physical and biological challenges while the transport of nutrients and water must remain uninterrupted to aid in digestion. For this purpose, mucosal secretions line the digestive tract of vertebrates, while in most invertebrates the midgut epithelium is lined by the peritrophic membrane or peritrophic matrix (PM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Richards1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Terra1">[2]</xref>, an organized layer made of secreted chitin and (glyco)proteins. Chitin, an insoluble linear β-(1,4)-linked polymer of <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), is considered the major structural component of the PM where it forms chitin fibrils. These fibrils are held together by chitin-binding proteins, while the interstitial spaces are filled by glycans (for a recent review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Hegedus1">[3]</xref>). The resulting lattice acts as a molecular sieve with a large range of pore sizes. The functions attributed to the PM include (i) compartmentalization of digestive processes, (ii) protection from ingested xenobiotics, and (iii) acting as mechanical barrier against abrasive foodstuffs and pathogens (for a recent review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Terra1">[2]</xref>). The latter function makes the PM a first-line defense against ingested pathogens and, hence, an important part of the invertebrates' complex system to combat infections. Accordingly, insect-pathogenic bacteria infectious <italic>per os</italic> must breach the PM before they can attack and invade or cross the epithelium. To this end, hydrolytic enzymes such as proteases and, most importantly, chitin-degrading proteins enabling PM degradation are produced and secreted by these pathogens.</p>
<p>Most of the chitin-degrading proteins are chitinases belonging to the family of glycosyl hydrolases (GH). To date, 133 different GH families classified on the basis of sequence similarities and forming 14 clans (GH-A – GH-N) of related families based on similarities in protein folds can be found in the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZy) database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Cantarel1">[4]</xref>. Another family of bacterial chitin-degrading proteins comprises proteins with a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) and belong to the auxiliary activities 10 (AA10) family (formerly chitin binding module 33 (CBM33) family) of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) as defined in the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZy) database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Cantarel1">[4]</xref>. These proteins were originally thought to lack any catalytic activity of their own <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Cantarel1">[4]</xref>, although they had been shown to be involved in chitin degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-VaajeKolstad1">[5]</xref>. However, it was recently demonstrated that CBP21, an AA10 (formerly CBM33) family member expressed by the Gram-negative soil bacterium <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Grimont1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Julian1">[7]</xref>, as well as <italic>Ef</italic>CBM33A, expressed by the Gram-positive, opportunistic pathogen <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, are capable of degrading crystalline chitin via a novel, copper-dependent, oxidative enzymatic mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-VaajeKolstad2">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Aachmann1">[10]</xref>. LPMOs comprise only two families, (i) the AA10 (formerly CBM33) family with bacterial, viral, and some eukaryotic members and (ii) the AA9 (formerly glycoside hydrolase 61 (GH61)) family with only fungal members so far. Both families are monooxygenases and target recalcitrant polysaccharides.</p>
<p>Bacterial chitin-degrading proteins are produced mainly to meet nutritional needs of the bacteria because chitin-degradation products, once transported into the bacterial cell, can be used as carbon sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Bolognesi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Bhattacharya1">[12]</xref>. Because, in addition, many insect pathogens need to overcome chitin-containing structures (e.g., cuticula or peritrophic membranes) to enter a host and establish an infection, degradation of the PM by bacterial pathogens might be a process serving two purposes: nutrition and invasion.</p>
<p><italic>Paenibacillus larvae</italic> is a bacterial pathogen of honey bee larvae which causes a notifiable disease called American Foulbrood (AFB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Genersch1">[13]</xref>. AFB is a highly contagious disease and is fatal for the entire colony when detected in too late a stage of disease. However, since most authorities consider burning of diseased colonies and contaminated hive material the only workable control measure, diseased colonies are inevitably lost in most cases. Hence, AFB causes considerable economic losses in apiculture worldwide. The etiological agent, <italic>P. larvae</italic>, is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium forming tenacious spores under adverse environmental conditions like lack of nutrients. These spores are the infectious form of <italic>P. larvae</italic> and they initiate a fatal infectious process in bee larvae once ingested with contaminated larval food. Honey bee larvae become less susceptible to infection with increasing age and as soon as two days after egg hatching they can be considered “resistant” (for recent reviews: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Genersch2">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Genersch4">[16]</xref>). This phenomenon has been attributed to the growing PM already in the early days of AFB research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Davidson1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Davidson2">[18]</xref>. Recently, we demonstrated that the honey bee larval gut is lined by a chitin-containing PM which is degraded during <italic>P. larvae</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-GarciaGonzalez1">[19]</xref>, confirming earlier results showing that the PM is the first barrier the bacteria have to overcome when trying to breach the epithelium and to enter the haemocoel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Yue1">[20]</xref>. Proteases and chitin-degrading proteins are most likely involved in this process. For <italic>P. larvae</italic> it is long since known that an impressive number of proteases is expressed and secreted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Holst1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Holst2">[22]</xref>. These proteases, although poorly characterized, have already been implicated as virulence factors as they might aid in degrading the PM, breaching the epithelium and converting larval into bacterial biomass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Dancer1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Antunez1">[25]</xref>. In contrast, little is known so far about the nature and expression of <italic>P. larvae</italic> chitin-degrading proteins and their role in the pathogenesis of AFB. Recently, the genomes of representatives of two <italic>P. larvae</italic> genotypes, ERIC I and ERIC II, were sequenced, annotated and used for comparative genome analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Djukic1">[26]</xref>. Surprisingly, no complete, uninterrupted and, hence, putatively functional gene coding for a classical chitinase could be detected in any of the genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Djukic1">[26]</xref> posing the intriguing question: how is the described chitin-degradation by <italic>P. larvae</italic> during infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-GarciaGonzalez1">[19]</xref> achieved? We are now answering this question by describing the identification and functional characterization of <italic>P. larvae Pl</italic>CBP49, a novel member of the AA10 (formerly CBM33) family of chitin-binding and –degrading LPMOs. <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 was confirmed in the genome and secretome of <italic>P. larvae</italic>. Chitin-affinity purified <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 was used to demonstrate chitinolytic activity both on soluble and insoluble substrates as well as to confirm that chitin degradation was metal ion-dependent and involved an oxidative step. Furthermore, we studied the biological role of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 in <italic>P. larvae</italic> infected larvae and were able to demonstrate that <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 is involved in PM degradation during infection and is a key virulence factor of <italic>P. larvae</italic>.</p>

<p>Recently, degradation of the larval midgut PM by <italic>P. larvae</italic> was demonstrated to be a key step in the pathogenesis of <italic>P. larvae</italic> infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-GarciaGonzalez1">[19]</xref>. In order to identify proteins which might be involved in this process, we isolated and analyzed chitin-binding proteins from <italic>P. larvae</italic> culture supernatants using chitin-coated beads. SDS-PAGE analysis of the chitin-binding fractions revealed two chitin-binding proteins (CBP) migrating around 60 kD (CBP60) and 49 kD (<italic>Pl</italic>CBP49<sub>I</sub>) secreted by ATCC9545 (<italic>P. larvae</italic> ERIC I), while only one band migrating around 49 kD (<italic>Pl</italic>CBP49<sub>II</sub>) was visible in the supernatant of DSM25430 (<italic>P. larvae</italic> ERIC II) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004284-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine the chitinolytic activity of the isolated proteins, the chitin-binding fractions were subjected to zymography performed with denaturing gels containing ethylene glycol chitin (EGC) as the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004284-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). The chitin binding fractions of both isolates produced a clear zone in the range of 49 kD suggesting that in both strains a protein migrating around 49 kD was able to degrade the chitin analogue EGC. We hypothesized that these bands corresponded to <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49<sub>I</sub> and <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49<sub>II</sub> identified in SDS-PAGE analysis of the chitin-binding fractions of ATCC9545 and DSM25430, respectively. In addition, chitinolytic activity could also be detected around 42 kD in the chitin-binding fraction of ATCC9545 and a similar activity was weakly but not reproducibly detectable in the chitin-binding fraction of DSM25430. These activities could not be related to any proteins detectable in the Coomassie-stained gels of the chitin-binding fractions hampering their further characterization. This phenomenon was not surprising because zymography is a highly sensitive method of detecting enzymatically active proteins even when present in such low amounts that they cannot be visualized with common staining procedures. In the chitin-binding fraction of ATCC9545, no chitinolytic activity could be observed around 60 kD indicating that CBP60, although binding to chitin, was not able to degrade EGC.</p>

<title><italic>Pl</italic>CBP49, the major chitin-degrading enzyme of <italic>P. larvae</italic>, is a member of the AA10 family of LPMOs</title>
<p>To further substantiate that <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49<sub>I</sub> and <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49<sub>II</sub> are not only chitin-binding but also chitin-degrading proteins, we determined their protein sequences via mass spectrometry analysis after separation of the bead-bound proteins by SDS-PAGE.

<p>To analyze whether ATCC9545 and DSM25430 harbor a common gene putatively coding for <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 we determined the sequences of the corresponding genes <italic>cbp49</italic><sub>I</sub> and <italic>cbp</italic>49<sub>II</sub> in ATCC9545 and DSM25430, respectively, by comparing the obtained peptide fragment sequences with the genomic sequences of <italic>P. larvae</italic> BRL 230010 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Qin1">[27]</xref> via TBLASTN analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Altschul1">[28]</xref>. Nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed the presence of the same functional open reading frame (ORF) in both strains (Genbank accession numbers JX185746 for ATCC9545, JX185745 for DSM25430) indicating that both strains harbor the gene <italic>cbp</italic>49 coding for the protein <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 with 443 amino acids.

<p>Protein BLAST alignment of the translated genomic sequence of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 followed by domain analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence using the Conserved Domain Database (CDD; NCBI) revealed a modular protein with an N-terminal domain homologous to AA10 (formerly CBM33) family members of LPMOs followed by two fibronectin type III-like domains, which are often found in bacterial glycosyl hydrolases, and a second small chitin-binding domain (CBM 5/12) at the C-terminus, which is also found in many different glycosyl hydrolase enzymes and presumed to have a carbohydrate binding function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004284-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).

<title><italic>P. larvae Pl</italic>CBP49 is involved in PM degradation</title>
<p>We recently showed that <italic>P. larvae</italic> is able to metabolize insoluble, colloidal chitin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-GarciaGonzalez1">[19]</xref>. However, the data related to the chitin-degrading activity of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 obtained so far were based on using EGC as a soluble substrate in zymograms. To further verify that degradation of insoluble recalcitrant polysaccharides is mediated by <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49, as it is described for members of the AA10 family of LPMOs, we tested whether or not <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 might be able to degrade chitin-containing structures like an insect PM. To this aim, we used an Ussing chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004284-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>) to perform permeability assays with PMs which were isolated from <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> last instar larvae and subjected to the chitin bound fractions of the knock-out <italic>P. larvae</italic> strains (ATCC9545 Δ<italic>cbp</italic>, DSM25430 Δ<italic>cbp</italic>) and of the corresponding parent wild-type strains (ATCC9545, DSM25430). This comparative approach allows differences in PM permeabilization between mutant and wild-type bacteria to be linked with differences in <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 expression. Permeability of the PMs was measured as methylene blue (MB) efflux and was significantly higher after incubation with the chitin-binding fractions of the wild-type bacteria than after incubation with the chitin-binding fractions of the corresponding mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004284-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). For <italic>P. larvae</italic> ATCC9545 MB efflux significantly (student's t-test, p-value = 0.0125) decreased from 0.0429±0.006 µg/ml/mm<sup>2</sup>/h in the presence of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 expression (ATCC9545, mean values ± SEM) to 0.021±0.0016 µg/ml/mm<sup>2</sup>/h in the absence of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 expression (ATCC9545 Δ<italic>cbp</italic>, mean values ± SEM). Similar results were obtained for <italic>P. larvae</italic> DSM25430 (0.02418±0.002 µg/ml/mm<sup>2</sup>/h, mean values ± SEM) compared to <italic>P. larvae</italic> DSM25430 Δ<italic>cbp</italic> (0.0094±0.0013 µg/ml/mm<sup>2</sup>/h, mean values ± SEM) which were also significantly different (student's t-test, p-value = 0.004). Remarkably, exposure of PMs to chitin-bound fractions of DSM25430 Δ<italic>cbp</italic> resulted in PM permeability not significantly different from the negative control (student's t-test, p-value = 0.983) indicating that in the absence of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 expression no PM degrading activity was active in these fractions. In contrast, chitin-bound fractions of ATCC9545 Δ<italic>cbp</italic> resulted in PM permeability that was significantly higher than the negative control (student's t-test, p-value = 0.006) although also significantly reduced when compared to the effect achieved with ATCC9545 wild-type, meaning in the presence of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 expression.

While control larvae at the age of six days after egg hatching contained intact PMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004284-g006">Figs. 6A, B</xref>), the PM in ATCC9545-infected larvae of the same age appeared almost totally degraded with only small patches of stainable structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004284-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>).

<p>PM degradation in <italic>P. larvae</italic> infected larvae has been shown to be a key step in AFB pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-GarciaGonzalez1">[19]</xref>. Therefore, we hypothesized that <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 involved in PM degradation in infected larvae should be a key virulence factor of this pathogen. To test this, we performed laboratory infection assays by feeding first instar honey bee larvae larval diet containing spores of the knock-out <italic>P. larvae</italic> strains (ATCC9545 Δ<italic>cbp</italic>, DSM25430 Δ<italic>cbp</italic>) and of the corresponding parent wild-type strains (ATCC9545, DSM25430).

While 500 cfu/ml of ATCC9545 resulted in a total mortality of 75.5%±5.0% (mean values ± SEM), the same spore concentration killed only 4.4%±1.1% (mean values ± SEM) in the group infected with the mutant strain ATCC9545 Δ<italic>cbp</italic> (student's t-test, p-value = 0.0001).

In other words, lack of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 activity resulted in about 94% reduction in mortality for ATCC9545 and nearly 96% reduction in mortality for DSM25430. Therefore, the lack of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 expression nearly abolished the virulence of both <italic>P. larvae</italic> strains.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Attempts to understand the pathogenesis of <italic>P. larvae</italic> infections of honey bee larvae have been undertaken since the early days of AFB research. It was suggested that the PM acts as a protective shield against <italic>P. larvae</italic> infections because it might hamper vegetative bacteria in their attempts to cross the gut wall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Davidson1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Bamrick1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Bamrick2">[35]</xref>. Recently, we demonstrated that the PM indeed is the first barrier vegetative <italic>P. larvae</italic> bacteria have to overcome before attacking and breaching the epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Yue1">[20]</xref>. In addition, we recently showed that <italic>P. larvae</italic> is able to metabolize colloidal chitin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-GarciaGonzalez1">[19]</xref> and that the larval midgut PM contains chitin which is degraded during <italic>P. larvae</italic> infection, leading to loss of PM integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-GarciaGonzalez1">[19]</xref>. We now describe the identification and functional analysis of <italic>P. larvae Pl</italic>CBP49, a new member of the AA10 (formerly CBM33) family of chitinolytic LPMOs which were recently shown to be able to degrade crystalline chitin via a novel, oxidative mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-VaajeKolstad2">[8]</xref>. We demonstrate that <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 is involved in PM degradation in infected honey bee larvae and that it is a key virulence factor for both <italic>P. larvae</italic> genotypes, as in the absence of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 expression <italic>P. larvae</italic> virulence was almost lost (for a definition of the term virulence please see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-ShapiroIlan1">[36]</xref>).</p>
<p>When invading the infected larva, <italic>P. larvae</italic> faces two physical barriers: first the peritrophic membrane and second the epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Yue1">[20]</xref>. Although the destruction of the epithelial cell layer by <italic>P. larvae</italic> is still poorly understood, the identification and characterization of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 now allows the biochemical mechanism by which <italic>P. larvae</italic> penetrates and traverses the PM to be unravelled. <italic>Cbp</italic>49 encodes a chitin-binding and –degrading protein belonging to the AA10 (formerly CBM33) family of chitin-degrading LPMOs. The best analyzed member of this family is CBP21 expressed by <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, a Gram-negative soil bacterium described as an insect pathogen but which is also an opportunistic pathogen of mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Grimont1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Flyg1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Hejazi1">[38]</xref>. CBP21 was originally described as lacking any catalytic activity of its own despite its essential role in chitin-degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-VaajeKolstad1">[5]</xref>. However, it was recently shown to possess chitin-degrading activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-VaajeKolstad2">[8]</xref> and it was demonstrated that CBP21 degrades crystalline chitin through a novel copper-dependent oxidative mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-VaajeKolstad2">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Aachmann1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>So far, the only function attributed to CBP21 is that of a food-scavenging enzyme allowing <italic>S. marcescens</italic> to use chitin as carbon source. However, <italic>S. marcescens</italic> is pathogenic to many invertebrates including insects where it causes intestinal infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Flyg1">[37]</xref>. Based on our results we now propose that the biological role of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> CBP21 is not only to enable these bacteria to use chitin as carbon source but also to allow them to degrade the protective PM as part of the pathogenic process when <italic>S. marcescens</italic> acts as insect pathogen. This assumption is further substantiated by recent findings showing that <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> deficient in forming a proper PM due to a loss-of-function mutation in the gene <italic>dcy</italic> coding for Drosocrystallin, an integral component of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> PM, are more susceptible to oral infection by <italic>S. marcescens</italic> than wild-type flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Kuraishi1">[39]</xref>. Furthermore, for <italic>Ef</italic>CBM33A it was recently speculated that it is involved in host-microbe interactions based on the observed gene regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-VaajeKolstad3">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 is 443 amino acids in length and in addition to the AA10 module also contained two fibronectin type III-like domains and another chitin-binding module, CBM5/12. The latter domain has often been found in proteins expressed by bacteria thriving in the digestive tract of invertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Nakjang1">[40]</xref>. For instance, CBP50 expressed by <italic>B. thuringiensis</italic> has a similar domain architecture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Mehmood1">[30]</xref> and it was demonstrated that the FN III-like domains and the CBM5/12 domain are involved in substrate binding. Future experiments should address the question of the function of these domains for <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 activity. According to our results, <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 not only degraded insoluble chitin structures but also acted on EGC, a soluble analog of chitin. Further biochemical and molecular studies are needed to unravel the function of these additional modules in the context of LPMO activity and to analyze whether these modules are involved in cleavage of soluble chitin, a capability not yet described for other members of the AA10 family of LPMOs.</p>
<p>Normally, <italic>Bacilli</italic> and <italic>Paenibacilli</italic> express a wide range of classical chitinases. However, recent evidence suggests that the situation is totally different for <italic>P. larvae</italic>. When the entire genomes of two <italic>P. larvae</italic> strains representing the genotypes ERIC I (DSM25719) and ERIC II (DSM25430) were sequenced, manually curated, annotated, and searched for putative virulence factors, in both genomes only a pseudogene containing a chitinase A (GH18 family) N-terminal domain was identified. While the <italic>P. larvae</italic> genomes harbored more than 100 protease genes, genes coding for classical chitinases were missing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Djukic1">[26]</xref>. These most recent <italic>in silico</italic> results further support our finding that <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 is a key chitin-degrading protein of <italic>P. larvae</italic>.</p>
<p>By using a chitin-binding activity based approach, we identified <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 as chitin-degrading protein and we demonstrated that <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 is able to degrade both soluble and insoluble chitin and is essential for PM degradation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, while in the Ussing chamber experiment gene disruption of <italic>cbp</italic>49 in DSM25430 resulted in loss of <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> PM degradation by DSM25430 Δ<italic>cbp</italic>, the chitin bound fraction of ATCC9545 Δ<italic>cbp</italic> still seemed to contain some activity affecting PM integrity. We speculate that this activity might be due to CBP60, present only in ATCC9545 and ATCC9545 Δ<italic>cbp</italic> chitin bound fractions but absent in the corresponding DSM25430 fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004284-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Although CBP60 is a chitin-binding protein, it did not show any chitin-degrading activity. However, CBP60 might have protease activity targeting non-chitin components of the PM like insect intestinal mucin (IIM) or other proteins thereby affecting PM integrity. More than hundred putatively functional protease genes were present in the <italic>P. larvae</italic> genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Djukic1">[26]</xref> leaving abundant CBP60-candidates which might contribute to PM degradation in ATCC9545. Obviously, much further work is needed to unravel and understand the entire PM degrading system of ATCC9545, to identify CBP60, and to analyze whether it plays a role in PM degradation. Identification and characterization of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 presented here is a first and important step towards this end.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was impossible to construct complementation mutants to provide the final control for the assays performed with mutant <italic>P. larvae</italic>. However, our data (i) on PM degradation during <italic>P. larvae</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-GarciaGonzalez1">[19]</xref>, (ii) on the lack of classical chitinase genes in the genome of <italic>P. larvae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Djukic1">[26]</xref>, and (iii) the combination of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data presented here provide a convincing body of evidence for our interpretation of the role and relevance of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 in AFB pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Weakening or even destroying the larval PM allows more ready access of bacteria or bacterial toxins to gut epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Hegedus1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Kuraishi1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Hayakawa1">[41]</xref>. We recently described the identification of several putative toxin genes in the genome of <italic>P. larvae</italic> ERIC I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Fnfhaus1">[42]</xref> and the detailed analysis of two of these toxins, Plx1 and Plx2, which belong to the family of AB-toxins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Fnfhaus2">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Holbourn1">[45]</xref>. Binding of <italic>P. larvae</italic> AB-toxins to their cognate cell surface receptors of the midgut epithelial cells might be accomplished more easily or even only when the epithelium is no longer protected by a PM like already shown in other insect systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Hegedus1">[3]</xref>. We, therefore, suggest that degradation of the PM is a prerequisite for <italic>P. larvae</italic> AB-toxins Plx1 and Plx2 to act on the epithelial cells.</p>
<p>We recently identified SplA, a <italic>P. larvae</italic> ERIC II-specific surface-layer (S-layer) protein which presumably mediates bacterial adhesion to midgut epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Poppinga1">[46]</xref>. Direct adhesion of <italic>P. larvae</italic> ERIC II to host cells via SplA might only be possible if the cells are no longer protected by a PM. We, therefore, suggest that in the case of <italic>P. larvae</italic> ERIC II, degradation of the PM is a prerequisite for the bacteria to directly approach the epithelial layer.</p>
<p>Based on these scenarios we propose the following model for pathogenesis of <italic>P. larvae</italic> infections: during the initial, non-invasive phase of infection, degradation of the PM serves nutritional needs and enables <italic>P. larvae</italic> to use chitin as an additional carbon source. However, at some time point the PM is totally degraded and bacteria (e.g. via SplA for <italic>P. larvae</italic> ERIC II) and/or bacterial toxins (Plx1 and Plx2 for <italic>P. larvae</italic> ERIC I) can directly approach and act on the host cells leading to bacterial breaching of the epithelium and initiation of the invasive phase. According to this model, blocking PM degradation blocks the transition from the non-invasive phase to the invasive phase explaining the impressive loss of virulence connected with the inactivation of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 activity. This makes <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 a key virulence factor of <italic>P. larvae</italic>.</p>

Each larva was anesthetized shortly on ice; midgut was extracted and longwise opened. PM was carefully pulled out, disposed on a cotton film and opened. The film was cut again to adjust PM containing area and gently washed with 1XPBS to remove food content. Cotton film was then assembled in an Ussing chamber. A suitably sized piece of the PM was used to cover the hole (12.6 mm<sup>2</sup>) in the Ussing chamber separating the two compartments. The ectoperitrophic side of the PM faced the compartment filled up with 400 µl of 0.2 mg/ml methylene blue solution, and the endoperitrophic side faced the second compartment with 400 µl of 1XPBS. Optical density at 661 nm (OD<sub>661</sub>) was measured at the beginning of the experiment and after 30 min to ensure the integrity of the PM. To test the activity of <italic>Pl</italic>CBP49 against the PM, 100 µl of the buffer solution in the endoperitrophic compartment was replaced with an equivalent volume of chitin binding fraction of each <italic>P. larvae</italic> strain (ATCC9545, ATCC9545 Δ<italic>cbp</italic>, DSM25430 and DSM25430 Δ<italic>cbp</italic>).

The MB flux was expressed as µg of dye that passed through the 12.6-mm<sup>2</sup> portion of mounted PM in 1 h. The flux measured at 30 min was subtracted from the final flux, to normalize the initial permeability of the PMs. Negative controls were performed with mock incubated chitin beads to rule out any influence of the beads or the buffers used on the PM. At least three independent replicates were performed for each data collection. Data represent mean values ± SEM. Data were statistically analyzed by student's t-test.</p>

The final spore concentrations corresponded to the LC<sub>80</sub> of the wild-type strains and resulted in 75.5%±5.0% and 77.8%±8.7% mortality in the larvae infected with <italic>P. larvae</italic> ATCC9545 and <italic>P. larvae</italic> DSM25430, respectively, corroborating previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Genersch1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004284-Genersch6">[48]</xref>. Taking the LC<sub>80</sub> ensured that observation of both decrease and increase in mortality would be possible. Larval health status and mortality were monitored daily over 15 d. Larvae were only considered to have died from AFB if they contained a high number of vegetative <italic>P. larvae</italic> bacteria after overnight-cultivation of larval remains on CSA plates. <italic>P. larvae</italic> infection was never detected in control animals or in surviving pupae at day 15 post-infection of any of the infection groups. However, vegetative <italic>P. larvae</italic> entrapped in non-degraded PM could be demonstrated in engorged larvae of the <italic>P. larvae</italic> knockout mutant infected groups shortly before defecation. <italic>Cbp</italic>49 knockout stability (presence of the targetron insertion) in <italic>P. larvae</italic> cultivated from larval remains of the knock-out-infected groups was confirmed by PCR with the gene specific primer pair cbp_F and cbp_R (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1004284-t001">Table 1</xref>), flanking the intron insertion site 573/574. PCR amplicons were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and visualised by UV light.</p>
<p>Total mortality of the <italic>P. larvae</italic> wild-type strains and the <italic>P. larvae</italic> knockout mutants was calculated for each replicate as the proportion of larvae that died from AFB compared to the total number of exposed larvae. For each strain, three biological replicates were performed with thirty larvae each. Data represent mean values ± SEM. Data were statistically analyzed by student's t-test.</p>
