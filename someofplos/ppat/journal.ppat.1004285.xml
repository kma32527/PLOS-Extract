<abstract>
<p>Ongoing <italic>Cryptococcus gattii</italic> outbreaks in the Western United States and Canada illustrate the impact of environmental reservoirs and both clonal and recombining propagation in driving emergence and expansion of microbial pathogens. <italic>C. gattii</italic> comprises four distinct molecular types: VGI, VGII, VGIII, and VGIV, with no evidence of nuclear genetic exchange, indicating these represent distinct species. <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGII isolates are causing the Pacific Northwest outbreak, whereas VGIII isolates frequently infect HIV/AIDS patients in Southern California. VGI, VGII, and VGIII have been isolated from patients and animals in the Western US, suggesting these molecular types occur in the environment. However, only two environmental isolates of <italic>C. gattii</italic> have ever been reported from California: CBS7750 (VGII) and WM161 (VGIII). The incongruence of frequent clinical presence and uncommon environmental isolation suggests an unknown <italic>C. gattii</italic> reservoir in California. Here we report frequent isolation of <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIII <italic>MAT</italic>α and <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> isolates and infrequent isolation of VGI <italic>MAT</italic>α from environmental sources in Southern California. VGIII isolates were obtained from soil debris associated with tree species not previously reported as hosts from sites near residences of infected patients. These isolates are fertile under laboratory conditions, produce abundant spores, and are part of both locally and more distantly recombining populations. MLST and whole genome sequence analysis provide compelling evidence that these environmental isolates are the source of human infections. Isolates displayed wide-ranging virulence in macrophage and animal models. When clinical and environmental isolates with indistinguishable MLST profiles were compared, environmental isolates were less virulent. Taken together, our studies reveal an environmental source and risk of <italic>C. gattii</italic> to HIV/AIDS patients with implications for the &gt;1,000,000 cryptococcal infections occurring annually for which the causative isolate is rarely assigned species status. Thus, the <italic>C. gattii</italic> global health burden could be more substantial than currently appreciated.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The environmentally-acquired human pathogen <italic>C. gattii</italic> is responsible for ongoing and expanding outbreaks in the Western United States and Canada. <italic>C. gattii</italic> comprises four distinct molecular types: VGI, VGII, VGIII, and VGIV. Molecular types VGI, VGII, and VGIII have been isolated from patients and animals throughout the Western US. The Pacific Northwest and Canadian outbreak is primarily caused by <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGII. VGIII is responsible for ongoing infections in HIV/AIDS patients in Southern California. However, only two environmental <italic>C. gattii</italic> isolates have ever been identified from the Californian environment: CBS7750 (VGII) and WM161 (VGIII). We sought to collect environmental samples from areas that had confirmed reports of clinical or veterinary infections. Here we report the isolation of <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGI and VGIII from environmental soil and tree samples. <italic>C. gattii</italic> isolates were obtained from three novel tree species: Canary Island pine, American sweetgum, and a Pohutukawa tree. Genetic analysis provides robust evidence that these environmental isolates are the source of human infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Outbreaks of infectious diseases caused by all major classes of microbial pathogens occur globally, annually, and these outbreaks pose public health challenges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Reed1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Christian1">[4]</xref>. Advancing understanding of forces driving outbreaks to enhance our ability to predict, contain, and blunt their impact include: 1) identification of environmental sources and vectors, and 2) defining genetic mechanisms that give rise to infectious microbes with altered virulence or transmissibility.</p>
<p>Over 200 species of fungi are recognized as human/animal pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-deHoog1">[5]</xref>. Fungal pathogens also cause outbreaks of disease. This includes clusters of infections caused by <italic>Coccidioides immitis/posadasii</italic>, <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic>, or <italic>Apophysomyces trapeziformis</italic> following soil perturbations (earthquakes, tornadoes, dust storms, construction, landscaping) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Fisher1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Brown1">[13]</xref>. The <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> pathogenic species complex includes the globally distributed human pathogens <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and <italic>C. gattii</italic>, which cause significant fungal disease burden and increasing public health costs in immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Hagen1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Dixon1">[19]</xref>. <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> is annually responsible for &gt;1,000,000 infections, &gt;620,000 deaths, and one-third of all AIDS related deaths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Park1">[17]</xref>. <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> and <italic>C. gattii</italic> have been isolated from various environmental sources (soil, trees, bird guano) but reports genetically linking specific environmental reservoirs to individual cases are limited because: 1) infections often take considerable time to diagnose, 2) are not reportable diseases in the USA and abroad, 3) <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and <italic>C. gattii</italic> are not often distinguished by species or by molecular type, and 4) retrospective environmental surveys are rare and scattered, may lack molecular analysis and corresponding clinical isolates, and/or follow many years after reported clinical infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Brown1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Springer1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>Cryptococcus gattii</italic> comprises four distinct molecular types: VGI, VGII, VGIII, and VGIV, without evidence of genetic exchange of nuclear genomes, providing evidence the four molecular types represent distinct, related species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Cogliati1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Fraser1">[25]</xref>. <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGII and VGIII are associated with two distinct expanding outbreaks in the Western US <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes3">[26]</xref>. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that <italic>C. gattii</italic> and <italic>C. neoformans</italic> diverged ∼40 million years ago and VGII is the ancestral molecular type to the <italic>C. gattii</italic> clade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Meyer2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Ngamskulrungroj1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Hagen2">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Xu1">[30]</xref>. Genetic rearrangement between the VG types could actively suppress recombination, acting as reproductive barriers, and limiting productive recombination. However, analysis of the mitochondrial genomes of <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGI and VGII lineages indicates a highly clonal mitochondrial genome within each lineage consistent with uniparental mitochondrial inheritance but different genealogies support the hypothesis that examples of mitochondrial genome transmission from VGII into VGI isolates have occurred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Xu2">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Bovers2">[32]</xref>. Furthermore, transmission of hypervirulence traits within and between different molecular types was recently demonstrated in laboratory crosses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Voelz1">[33]</xref>. Thus, given evidence linking mitochondrial function to enhanced intracellular proliferation of VGII outbreak isolates in macrophages, and previous studies linking mitochondria to virulence of plant fungal pathogens, these findings illustrate how genetic exchange can impact virulence of pathogenic fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Voelz1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Olson1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>C. gattii</italic> molecular type VGII, which is highly virulent and has a predilection for infecting apparently healthy hosts, is causing an outbreak on Vancouver Island that has expanded to the Canadian mainland and also Washington, Oregon, and possibly California <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes4">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Walraven1">[37]</xref>. As a result of increased sampling and molecular analysis, three sub-molecular types are now recognized: VGIIa, VGIIb, and VGIIc. The Vancouver, BC and Pacific Northwest (PNW) outbreak is characterized by infections caused predominantly by VGIIa, the major genotype, with a lower frequency of incidence of the VGIIb minor genotype. A novel, distinct, highly virulent molecular type designated as VGIIc is presently restricted to Oregon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes3">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-MacDougall1">[38]</xref>. Prior to the now recognized outbreak in the Pacific Northwest, <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIIa was isolated in 1970 from a human sputum sample (Seattle, Washington, NIH444) and in 1992 a closely related VGII isolate was obtained from an environmental sample from San Francisco, California (CBS7750) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Upton1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Chaturvedi1">[40]</xref>. Sporadic isolates possibly related to the PNW VGIIa major genotype at a limited number of MLST loci have been reported outside the USA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Fraser1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Okamoto1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Ngamskulrungroj2">[42]</xref>. Due to the scarcity of these VGIIa related genotypes outside the USA, the environmental reservoir and source has not been established. On the other hand, while isolates related to the VGIIb minor genotype at a limited number of MLST loci have been reported from several geographical regions, VGIIb isolates that are indistinguishable across 30 MLST loci have only been reported from Australia, thus providing robust evidence that this is the likely geographic source of the VGIIb outbreak isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Fraser1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Hagen2">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Ngamskulrungroj2">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Kaocharoen1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>In contrast, <italic>C. gattii</italic> molecular type VGIII is responsible for ongoing infections in immunocompromised HIV/AIDS patients in Southern California and the Southwestern US <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Pyrgos1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Walraven1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Chaturvedi2">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Lockhart1">[45]</xref>. Outside the US VGIII has been associated with sporadic infections in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, India, Germany, and Korea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Hagen1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Meyer2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Walraven1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Trilles1">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Grosse1">[51]</xref>. Despite the high preponderance of infections caused by <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIII in the HIV/AIDS population of California and the Southwestern USA, only one environmental VGIII isolate (WM161) has ever been recovered from California <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Meyer2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Walraven1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Chaturvedi2">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes5">[52]</xref>. On the other hand, in Colombia and Argentina VGIII isolates have been isolated from the environment, yet clinical prevalence appears low in those localities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Firacative1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Escandon1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Callejas1">[55]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIII has been further classified into two groups, VGIIIa and VGIIIb, based on MLST analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes2">[22]</xref>. Analysis of the Californian VGIII clinical population indicated that VGIIIa is more clonal with only one identified <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> isolate in comparison to VGIIIb, in which both <italic>MAT</italic>α and <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> isolates were frequently identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Lockhart1">[45]</xref>. Unlike other VG molecular types or <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> isolates are frequently isolated from both clinical and environmental populations of VGIIIb, suggesting that the VGIIIb population may be fertile and actively undergoing <bold>a</bold>-α sexual recombination in nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Halliday1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Montagna1">[58]</xref>. VGIII environmental isolates have been reported from <italic>Tipuana tipu</italic> trees in Argentina, <italic>Terminalia catappa</italic>, <italic>Corymbia ficifolia</italic>, <italic>Eucalyptus sp</italic>, and <italic>Ficus sp.</italic> in Colombia, and <italic>Manilkara hexandra</italic> in India <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Firacative1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Chowdhary1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Escandon1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Callejas1">[55]</xref>. Analysis of 60 VGIII isolates from California resulted in the identification of only four alleles shared between VGIIIa and VGIIIb in four independent isolates, <italic>CAP10</italic> and <italic>TEF1</italic> appear to be ancestral, while the shared <italic>PLB1</italic> allele appears to have been introgressed between VGIIIa and VGIIIb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes2">[22]</xref>. The MLST analysis, haplotype analysis, paired allele graphs, percentages of compatible loci, and indices of association all support the divergence of the VGIIIa and VGIIIb subtypes, limited recombination within VGIIIa, and more frequent recombination in VGIIIb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes2">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Prior to the Pacific Northwest outbreak caused by <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGII, California was historically recognized as the oldest known region associated with the occurrence of cryptococcosis within the USA. Early studies denoted California as the most prominent site of serotype C infections, later identified as <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIII. Byrnes et al. 2011 was the first to establish the prevalence of <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIII within the HIV/AIDS clinical population of California but did not obtain nor identify any VGIII isolates directly from the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes2">[22]</xref>. Of note, the MLST profile of the historically identified environmental isolate WM161 did not match the MLST profiles of any of the reported clinical isolates obtained from California; therefore, the infectious environmental reservoir of <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIII remained unknown. Previous environmental surveys within the Pacific Northwest, USA have identified the environmental niche of <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Kidd1">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Kidd2">[60]</xref>. The lack of genetic exchange between the molecular types, genomic rearrangements confined within molecular types, and differences in host predilection strongly suggest that the molecular types recognized within <italic>C. gattii</italic> comprise cryptic species. We therefore sought to identify the environmental reservoir of <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIII in California by sampling plants and soil in areas near residents with confirmed <italic>C. gattii</italic> infections.</p>
<p>As a result of this study we have identified the local environmental source of <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGI and VGIII associated with trees and soil debris in the greater Los Angeles area of California. Molecular typing and whole genome analysis of the Californian <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIII environmental isolates indicates a high amount of molecular diversity exists in this region, VGIIIa and VGIIIb can colonize similar and overlapping niches, and some environmental isolates are closely related to clinical isolates and the likely source of previously reported human infections, and a potential reservoir for inciting new infections. Furthermore, our results suggest that many of these isolates are sexually competent and capable of intra- and inter-molecular mating which might facilitate dispersal and propagate altered infectious characteristics such as virulence or transmissibility. Further work is needed to fully elucidate the links between <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> molecular types, environmental distributions, and the propensity to initiate disease in exposed hosts.</p>

<title>Identification of the environmental source of <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIII in Southern California</title>
<p>The long term and extensive clinical prevalence of <italic>C. gattii</italic> in California has implicated a local endogenous reservoir but even with increased environmental sampling the environmental source of infections has remained undefined. We therefore sought to collect environmental samples from areas that had confirmed reports of clinical and/or veterinary infections. From soil and swab samples collected at 24 locations throughout the greater Los Angeles area over a two year period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004285.s001">Figure S1</xref>), we screened 146 environmental (n = 107) and clinical (n = 39) isolates utilizing canavanine glycine bromothymol blue (CGB) and niger seed (NGS) indicator media.

<title>MLST analysis indicates a diverse population of <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIII are endemic to Southern California</title>
<p>To characterize the molecular types prevalent in the Californian isolates, MLST analysis was performed on 11 unlinked loci for the 11 clinical and 19 environmental <italic>C. gattii</italic> strains obtained from Los Angeles, California USA. The data were compared to previously reported VGIII isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes2">[22]</xref> to determine the presence of novel or shared MLST profiles between environmental and clinical isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004285-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004285.s010">Table S4</xref>). Isolates primarily clustered into three previously recognized molecular types: VGI, VGIIIa, and VGIIIb. The VGI molecular type found in California shares the most common MLST type observed worldwide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004285.s011">Table S5</xref>). Both VGIIIb <italic>MAT</italic>α (5/14, 36%) and <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> (9/14, 64%) mating types were obtained from clinical and environmental isolates, suggesting the potential for an actively sexually recombining population in Southern California within this molecular type subgroup. In contrast, all of the VGIIIa isolates characterized were found to be <italic>MAT</italic>α, suggesting that opposite sex mating may be rare among isolates of this subtype. Overall, nine isolates typed as VGIIIb <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> (2 clinical and 7 environmental), five as VGIIIb <italic>MAT</italic>α (4 clinical and 1 environmental), 12 as VGIIIa <italic>MAT</italic>α (4 clinical and 8 environmental), and three isolates typed as VGI <italic>MAT</italic>α (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004285.s010">Tables S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004285.s011">S5</xref>). These results reveal a, widespread reservoir of <italic>C. gattii</italic> in the greater Los Angeles area as the likely source of frequent cryptococcal infections in HIV/AIDS patients in Southern California.</p>
<p>Sixteen isolates, 14 environmental (7 VGIIIa and 7 VGIIIb) and 2 clinical (1 VGIIIa and 1 VGIIIb), shared four different MLST profiles (designated groups G1 to G4, represented with brackets) with previously reported clinical isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004285-g001">Figure 1</xref>), indicating shared descent between recently identified environmental isolates and previously reported clinical isolates spanning an isolation period of up to 12 years. Six new MLST sequence types were identified: five VGIIIb (4 clinical and 1 environmental) and one uncategorized VGIII type (7685027) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004285-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Additional analysis of the <italic>CAP59</italic>, <italic>TOR1</italic>, <italic>SOD1</italic>, and <italic>URA5</italic> loci did not improve resolution of isolates that shared an indistinguishable 8-locus MLST profile. Thus, there was a high level of diversity in these environmental isolates reflected by the recovery of a multitude of distinct MLST profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004285-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004285.s010">Table S4</xref>). Furthermore, we obtained both VGIIIa and VGIIIb molecular sub-types from the same sample (BHPP1 designation) or environmental location (MCP/MCPR or BHPP1/BHPP3 designations) suggesting that both molecular types can colonize the same ecological niche in California fostering the potential for hybridization. Thus, their lack of frequent genetic exchange suggests that the two molecular types could represent distinct species in which mating is limited by genetic and/or temporal barriers limiting productive introgressions between the molecular types.</p>
<p>One clinical isolate (7685027) did not align with either of the two previously recognized VGIIIa or VGIIIb molecular types and either represents a novel VGIII subgroup that has been undersampled or a novel hypermutator isolate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Magditch1">[62]</xref>. This isolate contains many completely novel MLST alleles (<italic>URA5</italic>, <italic>TOR1</italic>, <italic>PLB1</italic>, <italic>MPD1</italic>, <italic>LAC1</italic>, <italic>CAP10</italic>, <italic>GPD1</italic>, and <italic>IGS1</italic>) not observed previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004285-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004285-g002">2</xref>), consistent with a possible origin via action of a hypermutator phenotype strain resulting in the rapid emergence of novel MLST alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Magditch1">[62]</xref>. On the other hand, other MLST alleles (<italic>SOD1</italic>, <italic>CAP59</italic>, and <italic>TEF1</italic>) are shared with two additional isolates (IHEM14941S and IHEM14941W) obtained from a Mexican immigrant diagnosed in Spain and thus they may represent a novel VGIIIc sub-molecular type.</p>

<p>Haplotype network analysis indicates that for two loci, <italic>PLB1</italic> and <italic>CAP10</italic>, the alleles shared between VGIIIa and VGIIIb isolates represent recent introgression events because the shared allele occupies a position other than the ancestral haplotype network allele (represented within the rectangle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004285-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast haplotype network analysis of the <italic>TEF1</italic> share allele 21 represents the origin of the allele as ancestral. Additional haplotype network analysis of the evolutionary history of 9 additional MLST loci not shared between VGIIIa and VGIIIb robustly supports genetic isolation and provides evidence for cryptic speciation although evidence of additional shared alleles may emerge in the VGIII population with increased sampling and analysis of a broader set of nuclear loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004285.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>

<title>Whole genome sequences of MLST matched isolates indicates that environmental <italic>C. gattii</italic> isolates were the likely reservoirs associated with historical clinical infections</title>
<p>We next determined that the newly isolated environmental strains are extremely closely related to the previously reported clinical strains based on whole genome sequencing. We sequenced matched clinical and environmental isolates representing 3 of 4 matched MLST groups, VGIIIa (group 1, CA1308, MCP-1A, 78-1-S3A and group 2, CA1053 and BHPP3-S1A) and VGIIIb (group 3, CA1508 and MCPR1-S1B) to determine whether environmental isolates could represent the source population for previously reported clinical infections. Whole genome sequence analysis of MLST matched clinical and environmental strains indicates that the genomes of grouped isolates are remarkably similar and very closely related (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004285-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004285.s012">Table S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004285.s013">S7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004285.s014">S8</xref>). The genomic sequences for these strains were aligned to the closest reference genome available, the VGII outbreak strain R265. SNP calling indicated a very high level of diversity in the total set of sequenced strains with a total of 773,900 polymorphic sites relative to the VGII isolate R265 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-DSouza1">[67]</xref>. This corresponds to approximately 4.4% of the genome. Within the VGIII sequenced set, there was ∼10-fold less diversity with 87,219 polymorphic sites corresponding to 0.49% of the ∼20 MB genome, which is still substantial. However, in spite of this diversity, the MLST matched isolates were remarkably similar to each other, ranging from a minimum of 46 differentiating sites (0.00026%) between VGIIIa isolates CA1053 (clinical) and BHPP3-S1A (environmental) to a maximum of 183 (0.0010%) between VGIIIb isolates CA1508 (clinical) and MCPR1-S1B (environmental, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004285-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

Variants altered three splice sites and introduced a moderate number of nonsynonymous SNPs.

<title>Intracellular proliferation and mitochondrial tubularization appear decoupled in VGIII isolates</title>
<p>Virulence attributes of clinical and environmental <italic>C. gattii</italic> isolates were ascertained based on intracellular proliferation rates (IPR) and percent mitochondrial tubularization within J774 BALB/c macrophage cell lines. An IPR≥2 indicates a high replication rate within macrophages and is frequently correlated with higher virulence. An IPR score &lt;1 indicates low proliferation levels were observed in macrophages, which have been correlated with a lower potential for virulence in whole animal models in previous studies. An IPR between 1 and 2 indicates moderate proliferation in macrophages and moderate virulence attributes.

The coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.2593 is &lt;1, p = 0.0155) indicates a weak positive linear correlation exists between IPR and the presence of tubular mitochondria in all VGIII isolates. A positive but weakly linear correlation is observed for VGIIIa (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.3692 is &lt;1, p = 0.0624) but not for VGIIIb (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.001 is &lt;1, p = 0.9226) suggesting differences in IPR and mitochondrial regulation may be associated with different molecular sub-types. Our results demonstrate that survival and replication in macrophages (IPR) is similar between environmental and clinical VGIIIa and VGIIIb isolates of both mating types. Notably some VGIII strains have high rates of tubularization prior to a known encounter with the macrophage niche (environmental isolates) while others do not display increased tubularization after encountering the macrophage niche (clinical isolates). The presence of tubular mitochondria did not appear to be strongly correlated with IPR in VGIII isolates, in contrast with previous studies on VGII Pacific northwest outbreak isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Ma1">[34]</xref>. These data may reflect that VGIII isolates commonly infect HIV/AIDS patients versus VGII isolates that rarely occur in HIV/AIDS patients, and hence VGIII isolates may be in general less virulent than VGII isolates.</p>

<title><italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIII isolates are virulent in the murine model</title>
<p>The virulence attributes of VGIII <italic>C. gattii</italic> isolates were further addressed in vivo utilizing the murine intranasal model. The first two environmental isolates, MCP-1A and 78-1-S3C (both identified in late 2011), were assessed for virulence in the BALB/c mouse model and the average length of survival ranged from 56 to more than 250 days post infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004285.s006">Figure S6a and S6b</xref>). Mean survival ranked from shortest to longest is as follows: CA1232 (84 days), CA1053 (90.5 days), CA1308 (96 days), CA1508 (136 days), BHPP1-S2B (149 days), NIH191 (173.5 days), BHPP3-S1A (197 days) and all others were undetermined because some mice were still surviving at the termination of the experiment. MCP-1A and 78-1-S3A were less virulent than the VGIII clinical isolates RR and VV (p&lt;0.002, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004285.s006">Figure S6b</xref>). Environmental isolate 78-1-S3A was similar in virulence to clinical isolate CA1089 (p = 0.6409) and somewhat more virulent than the historical NIH312 isolate (p = 0.034) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004285.s006">Figure S6b</xref>). Our results indicate that environmental isolate MCP-1A is less virulent than environmental isolate 78-1-S3A (p = 0.0083) with which it shares an indistinguishable MLST profile, IPR, and differs by less than 90 SNPs at the whole genome level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004285-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004285.s014">Table S8</xref>), suggesting that relatively few genetic differences could be responsible for differences in virulence between two very closely related isolates. At a minimum, no more than 46 SNPs seemed to be necessary to confer a phenotypic difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004285-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004285.s013">Table S7</xref>). Additionally, differences in epigenetic or transcriptional modifications could contribute to phenotypic differences observed between matched MLST isolates. <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIII environmental isolates exhibited attenuated virulence in comparison to VGIII clinical isolates in the intranasal murine mouse model. Virulence observed in the mouse model correlated with previously determined moderate IPR and was decoupled from mitochondrial phenotype suggesting roles of intracellular proliferation and mitochondrial program in the divergence in virulence of <italic>C. gattii</italic> molecular types.</p>
<p>Virulence attributes of closely related environmental versus clinical genotypes were further examined in A/JCr mice, which are typically more permissive to cryptococcal infection than BALB/c mice. Four groups of MLST matched strains representing VGIIIa (group 2, CA1308, CA1574, and MCP-1A; group 3, CA1053 and BHPP3-S1A) and VGIIIb (group 1, CA1232 and BHPP1-S3A; group 4, CA1508, MCPR1-S1B, NIH191/ATCC32608) were compared in the A/JCr murine model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004285-g008">Figure 8a</xref>). Clinical isolates exhibited reduced survival time and higher virulence in comparison to MLST matched environmental isolates. More virulent clinical isolates were associated with more virulent environmental isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004285-g008">Figure 8a</xref>). MCP-1A and BHPP1-S3A were severely attenuated for virulence in comparison to other virulent strains with 9 of 10 infected animals surviving to the conclusion of the study. Two isolates, one environmental (MCPR1-S1B) and one clinical (CA1574), were avirulent for the duration of study (250+ days post infection) in A/JCr mice (all 10 of 10 animals infected surviving). Tissue burdens ranged from 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> cells/gram tissue in the lungs, 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> cells/gram tissue in the spleen, and 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> cells/gram tissue in the brain and varied greatly between isolates. Consistently, and in agreement with previously published studies, higher organ loads were observed in the lung tissue in comparison to the brain tissues and may suggest that pulmonary cryptococcosis could contribute to the observed mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Springer2">[68]</xref>. Granulomas were observed macroscopically in the lungs post necropsy and microscopically in histopathological sections for both VGIIIa and VGIIIb isolates (data not shown). Although we observed differences in mean survival time between VGIII strains, high tissue burdens were observed for all strains (of both high and low virulence) post mortem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004285-g008">Figure 8b</xref>). This suggests that determination of virulence is not just a static predetermined trait but also dependent on duration of exposure and host status, which could play a more prominent role in disease development in longer-lived human and animal populations.</p>

<title>Response of <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIIIa and VGIIIb molecular types to antifungal drugs</title>
<p><italic>Cryptococcus</italic> is an environmentally acquired fungal pathogen of humans and infections caused by differing molecular types may result in differences in clinical presentations, treatment, and therapeutic outcomes. In this study, the antifungal susceptibilities to amphotericin B, fluconazole, flucytosine, and ketoconazole were assessed for <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIII isolates to examine if differences in antifungal susceptibility might be associated with molecular type and/or origin of the isolates (environmental or clinical). Our results provide evidence that the MIC of VGIIIa isolates can be higher than VGIIIb for recommended drug therapies, amphotericin B (p = 0.0178, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004285-g009">Figure 9a</xref>) and flucytosine (p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004285-g009">Figure 9b</xref>), but not for the maintenance antifungal drug fluconazole (p = 0.1059, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004285-g009">Figure 9c</xref>), or the second line drug ketoconazole (p = 0.0685, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004285-g009">Figure 9d</xref>). No significant differences were observed between clinical and environmental isolates within VGIIIa or VGIIIb isolates suggesting the genetic propensity for antifungal resistance may exist in environmental populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004285-g009">Figure 9e–h</xref>, p&gt;0.05). However, resistance was observed in response to exposure to fluconazole and/or flucytosine in VGIIIb clinical (HM-1, 7180567, 7618666, CA1508) and environmental isolates (MCPR1-S1B, MCPR1-S2B, MCPR1-S2A, BHPP1-S2A, BHPP1-S3A) as well as VGIIIa clinical (KB-1, CA1308) and environmental (MCP-1A, BHPP1-S2B, BHPP3-S2A) isolates suggesting some isolates may have a greater propensity for the microevolution of drug resistance within the host, possibly influencing long term treatment outcomes. In summary, we observed the emergence of resistance (fluconazole and flucytosine) and higher MICs (amphotericin B and flucytosine) among different subsets of the <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIII population for the recommended first line treatment drugs, amphotericin B and flucytosine, suggesting molecular type and the genetic propensity for resistance could possibly impact treatment and long-term outcomes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The clinical and veterinary prevalence of cryptococcosis and the identification of <italic>C. gattii</italic> as the causative agent in the PNW outbreak stimulated increased environmental sampling that resulted in the identification of the ecological niche of <italic>C. gattii</italic> in the environment in association with native trees on Vancouver Island and in the Pacific Northwest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Kidd1">[59]</xref>. Increased molecular typing has resulted in the identification of both <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIIa and VGIIb molecular types with shared MLST profiles between clinical and environmental isolates, indicating the endogenous environmental reservoir for the ongoing <italic>C. gattii</italic> PNW outbreak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes3">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Kidd2">[60]</xref>. The outbreak is caused by three largely clonal lineages: VGIIa/major, VGIIb/minor, and VGIIc/novel which are members of a global, fertile, recombining population that gave rise to the hypervirulent outbreak strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated the presence and molecular diversity of <italic>C. gattii</italic> in the clinical population of Southern California but only one historical environmental VGIII isolate (WM161) had been reported from this region, even with increased sampling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Lockhart1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-KwonChung1">[69]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Pfeiffer1">[71]</xref>. The historical VGIII environmental isolate (WM161) differed in MLST profile (due to unique <italic>IGS</italic> and <italic>GPD1</italic> alleles) compared to all known VGIII clinical isolates from California. Ongoing epidemic incidences of <italic>C. gattii</italic> that have emerged in the Western USA are cause for concern due to clinical infections in both immunocompetent individuals and populations with immunocompromised status, including HIV/AIDS. <italic>C. gattii</italic> is an environmentally acquired pathogen and thus the paucity of environmental isolates is incongruent with its known presence in the clinical population in California. The identification and environmental isolation reported herein of <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGI and VGIII from four independent sampling sites in the greater Los Angeles area mimics the patchy and often sporadic isolation reported for other environmentally acquired fungal pathogens (<italic>Blastomyces</italic>, <italic>Coccidioides</italic>) associated with periodic outbreaks in the USA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Fisher1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Reed2">[72]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Mandel1">[74]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study we report the environmental isolation of 19 <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIIIa, VGIIIb, and VGI isolates from Los Angeles, California from samples obtained from three novel tree species <italic>Pinus canariensis</italic> (Canary Island pine), <italic>Liquidamar styraciflua</italic> (American sweetgum), and <italic>Metrosideros excels</italic> (Pohutukawa tree). These environmental isolates were obtained from areas in close proximity to the residences of patients. We have identified an environmental source of the most common <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGI molecular type, which constitutes a smaller proportion of <italic>C. gattii</italic> infections in California and elsewhere in the US <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Lockhart1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes7">[75]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Sellers1">[76]</xref>. Of the 19 environmental isolates, 16 share indistinguishable MLST profiles with previously reported clinical isolates from the Southern California region identifying endogenous environmental reservoirs for both VGIIIa and VGIIIb infections in the Los Angeles, metropolitan area, USA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes2">[22]</xref>. Therefore, we have the rare opportunity to identify and genetically link known environmental reservoirs to individual cases in Southern California.</p>
<p>In this study we report the presence of fertile <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> and <italic>MAT</italic>α environmental isolates and demonstrate evidence of recombination within the VGIIIb population in the Southern California region. This is notable, at least in part, because <bold>a</bold>-α mating is relatively rare in the <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> species complex, with a few notable exceptions, because of the paucity of <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Halliday1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Montagna1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Litvintseva1">[77]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-LoperenaAlvarez1">[78]</xref>. In the case of <italic>C. neoformans</italic> var. <italic>grubii</italic>, the majority of <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> isolates are part of a specific population restricted to Botswana that is also hypothesized to be the origin of the species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Litvintseva2">[79]</xref>. The population of VGIIIb <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> isolates could similarly represent a locally restricted founder population in California. It is also possible that the paucity of <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> isolates within the VGIIIa population, may be indicative of a high frequency of α-α mating in the population. As in VGIIIb, there is evidence for recombination within the VGIIIa population, but in this case may be occurring without the involvement of <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> isolates. While we cannot rule out the existence of <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> isolates that have remained unsampled, our current evidence suggests this population may reassort without bisexual mating. Further sampling will increase the power of this analysis Sex within <italic>C. gattii</italic> populations is important for two reasons. First, the sexual cycle produces spores that can be aerosolized as potential infectious propagules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Velagapudi1">[80]</xref>. Second, sex can aid in the evolution of virulence. Same-sex mating has been proposed as a factor in the development of the VGIIa major outbreak strain in the Pacific Northwest, while <bold>a</bold>-α sexual reproduction aids in the transmission of hypervirulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Fraser1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Voelz1">[33]</xref>. Through both routes, sex can contribute to the development and persistence of an outbreak. In addition, sexual reproduction led to the emergence of the modern pathogenic lineage for the common human parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> and selfing has recently been shown to drive outbreaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Su1">[81]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Wendte1">[82]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIII clinical and environmental isolates share similar in vitro IPR and mitochondrial phenotypes. Moderate ranges of IPR appear unrelated to the extent of mitochondrial tubularization in contrast to <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGII isolates, suggesting these VGIII isolates have reduced virulence in comparison to the VGII outbreak strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Voelz1">[33]</xref>. We observed reduced virulence of VGIII in comparison to VGII in the murine model, consistent with the observed predilection of VGIII to infect immunocompromised individuals with HIV/AIDS compared to VGII that commonly infects otherwise healthy patients. An alternative explanation is that <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIII causes dormant infections that can be reactivated at the time of immunosuppression whereas VGII causes primary infections. However, this alternative explanation seems less likely because VGII has also been associated with the potential to cause dormant infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Hagen1">[14]</xref>. We tested paired clinical and environmental isolates that shared indistinguishable MLST profiles, and although WGS indicated relatively few genetic differences, all clinical isolates were more virulent in comparison to the environmentally isolated paired MLST strains except for VGIIIa CA1574. Furthermore, in the paired MLST matched isolates that were analyzed in murine virulence assays we found that all VGIIIa strains were more virulent than VGIIIb strains, in agreement with previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes2">[22]</xref>. Tissue burden and histopathological analyses indicated significantly higher fungal burdens in the lungs in comparison to the spleen or brain, consistent with previous reports of a predilection of VGIII to initiate prolonged pulmonary infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Byrnes2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Bovers2">[32]</xref>. Thus, although clinical and environmental isolates shared indistinguishable MLST profiles, IPR, and &gt;99.9% sequence identity, their virulence potential differed in the murine model.</p>
<p>Whole genome sequencing of three different MLST matched groups representing both VGIIIa and VGIIIb populations indicated that previously reported clinical isolates (circa 2000–2005) and newly identified environmental isolates (2011–2012) are extremely similar, differing at only 46 SNPs between VGIIIa clinical isolate CA1053 and environmental isolate BHPP3-S1A, and 183 SNPs between the VGIIIb clinical isolate CA1508 and the environmental isolate MCPR1-S1B. This is all the more poignant given that the clinical and environmental isolates were ascertained over an isolation period spanning 5 to 12 years, further forging a link between the environmental isolates and clinical infections in Southern California. This can be compared to H99 lab passaged isolates obtained over a ten year period, which are distinguished by 11 SNPs and 11 indels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Janbon1">[83]</xref>. Furthermore, a recent report on <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (genome size 2.4 Mb) used a cutoff of 40 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) to decide whether two strains were indistinguishable or different <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Price1">[84]</xref>. We aligned our sequences to R265 with a total genome size of 17.5 Mb, which would allow for 6.2-fold more variants and up to 249 SNVs. Thus, by even this strict comparison the VGIIIa/b clinical and environmental isolates are closely related than bacterial isolates concluded to be causally related in chains of transmission.</p>
<p>Whole genome sequencing allows new approaches to pathogenesis. However, comparative genomic approaches have limitations. When comparing highly pathogenic and less pathogenic isolates, finding a genetic change important for pathogenesis is challenging because of unrelated incidental genetic diversity. One method to avoid this is use strains that have a common, recent origin. This reduces genomic differences that could obscure causative genotypic changes and increases the probability of linking genotype to phenotype. In this study, environmental isolates that we propose directly gave rise to the infectious isolate were chosen via MLST matching; however, similar approaches could be used for longitudinal studies of individuals with recurrent fungal infections or for other environmental infections where a source population is readily available. While beyond the scope of this study, resource populations established through MLST matching of isolates with disparate phenotypes will provide an avenue for linkage between genotype and phenotype. Substantial differences in virulence were observed in our studies between two very similar isolates. At a minimum, no more than 46 SNPs seems necessary to confer a phenotypic difference between the clinical isolate CA1053 and the environmental isolate BHPP3-S1A; only 15 of these SNPs result in nonsynonymous changes. We sequenced three closely related VGIIIa isolates from group 2, representing two independent environmental isolates obtained from different locations and a previously identified clinical isolate. The three isolates differ by only 90 SNPs but exhibit differences in pathogenicity and antifungal sensitivity. Furthermore this genotype is noteworthy because it is represented in the current clinical population by isolate 7489719. This suggests that adaptation from an environmental lifestyle to a pathogenic lifestyle may be a very rapid event, involving epigenetic modification, changes in transcriptional regulation, or requiring few genetic changes. Passage of <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> through amoeba, nematodes, slime molds, plants, and animals yields passaged strains with enhanced virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Springer2">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Steenbergen1">[85]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Currie1">[89]</xref>. Prolonged lab culture without host exposure can attenuate virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Franzot1">[90]</xref>. Passage of strain H99 resulted in a lineage with enhanced or attenuated virulence with only 4 associated SNPs, two of which could contribute to attenuated virulence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004285-Janbon1">[83]</xref>. Also notable is that none of the SNPs from our three matched sets was shared between sets or in common genes. This suggests that either there are multiple independent routes of adaptation to produce a more virulent organism, or that transcriptional and epigenetic changes may also contribute.</p>
<p><italic>C. gattii</italic> is an environmentally acquired opportunistic fungal pathogen that can cause acute or latent infections in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts and increased recognition of ongoing outbreaks in humans, pets, and wildlife is emerging as a serious public health concern and financial burden. We report the isolation of fertile <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIIIa, and VGIIIb isolates from environmental soil and swab samples from non-<italic>Eucalyptus</italic> host trees in the greater Los Angeles area of Southern California. MLST and WGS analysis coupled with mating and virulence studies demonstrate that environmental <italic>C. gattii</italic> VGIII isolates are actively recombining and the likely source of human acquired infections in this region and can further contribute to ongoing infections in Southern California. There is now a substantial body of accumulated data that suggest that <italic>C. gattii</italic> is associated in the environment with many tree species (native and non-native) worldwide and these hosts function as environmental reservoirs for disease outbreaks. Future environmental and epidemiological studies can further incorporate molecular and whole genome analysis to connect known clinical/veterinary incidences of cryptococcosis with newly identified ecological niches to further address the link between genotype, risk of exposure, and propensity for initiating disease.</p>

<title>Environmental sampling and isolates utilized in this study</title>
<p>Swabs of individual tree trunks and soil samples from around the base of trees were collected during the summers of 2011 and 2012 utilizing BD BBL Single application CultureSwabs with Liquid Amies (VWR#90001-036). In summary, over two years 24 sites were sampled to obtain 109 tree swabs of over 30 tree species and 58 soil samples from collected from the greater Los Angeles area. In 2011 samples were obtained from 9 locations, 64 trees (30 different species, including 10 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> trees from four independent sites.), and 25 soil samples in the greater Los Angeles area. In 2012 the two sites that had previously yielded <italic>C. gattii</italic> were resampled and 15 additional sites were sampled focusing on <italic>Pinus canariensis</italic> and <italic>Liquidambar styraciflua</italic>. From these trees 45 trees were swabbed and 33 soil samples were collected. The swabs were streaked onto Niger seed (NGS) agar containing chloramphenicol (0.5 g/L, Sigma C0378-100G) Two grams of soil were suspended in 10 mL of sterile ddH<sub>2</sub>0 and allowed to settle. Three 100 µl aliquots were plated on NGS agar. Plates were incubated at 30°C for 1 to 3 days. Yeast colonies producing brown pigmentation were selected and colony purified. All clinical and environmental isolates were streaked onto NGS and canavanine-glycine bromothymol blue (CGB) agar and incubated for 1 to 3 days to identify <italic>C. gattii</italic> isolates. Clinical isolates were obtained from 48 patients who were treated at the University of Southern California, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, or Kaiser Permanente Downey Hospital between February 2008 and January 2013. Of these patients, 32 were considered to be immunocompromised due to HIV/AIDS or other causes. The clinical isolates were de-identified and linked to major cross streets near the patients' homes.

Wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) four times to remove excess extracellular yeast cells and 1 ml of fresh serum-free DMEM was then added. For the control time point T = 0, the DMEM was discarded and 200 µl of sterile ddH<sub>2</sub>O was added to lyse the macrophages. After 30 minutes, lysed macrophages released intracellular yeast cells, which were then collected in an additional 200 µl ddH<sub>2</sub>O.

<p>The IPR assay was replicated at least three times for each strain tested using independently propagated batches of macrophages. The IPR value was calculated by dividing the maximum intracellular yeast number by the initial intracellular yeast number at T = 0. We confirmed that Trypan Blue stains 100% of the cryptococcal cells in a heat-killed culture, but only approximately 5% of cells from a standard overnight culture.
