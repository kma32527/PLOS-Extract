<abstract>
<p>HIV causes rapid CD4+ T cell depletion in the gut mucosa, resulting in immune deficiency and defects in the intestinal epithelial barrier. Breakdown in gut barrier integrity is linked to chronic inflammation and disease progression. However, the early effects of HIV on the gut epithelium, prior to the CD4+ T cell depletion, are not known. Further, the impact of early viral infection on mucosal responses to pathogenic and commensal microbes has not been investigated. We utilized the SIV model of AIDS to assess the earliest host-virus interactions and mechanisms of inflammation and dysfunction in the gut, prior to CD4+ T cell depletion. An intestinal loop model was used to interrogate the effects of SIV infection on gut mucosal immune sensing and response to pathogens and commensal bacteria <italic>in vivo</italic>. At 2.5 days post-SIV infection, low viral loads were detected in peripheral blood and gut mucosa without CD4+ T cell loss. However, immunohistological analysis revealed the disruption of the gut epithelium manifested by decreased expression and mislocalization of tight junction proteins. Correlating with epithelial disruption was a significant induction of IL-1β expression by Paneth cells, which were in close proximity to SIV-infected cells in the intestinal crypts. The IL-1β response preceded the induction of the antiviral interferon response. Despite the disruption of the gut epithelium, no aberrant responses to pathogenic or commensal bacteria were observed. In fact, inoculation of commensal <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> in intestinal loops led to rapid anti-inflammatory response and epithelial tight junction repair in SIV infected macaques. Thus, intestinal Paneth cells are the earliest responders to viral infection and induce gut inflammation through IL-1β signaling. Reversal of the IL-1β induced gut epithelial damage by <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> suggests synergistic host-commensal interactions during early viral infection and identify these mechanisms as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The loss of intestinal CD4+ T cells in chronic HIV infection is associated with impaired immune responses to pathogens, aberrant immune activation, and defects in the gut epithelial barrier. While much is known about the pathogenesis of HIV in chronic disease, less is known about the defects that occur prior to gut CD4+ T cell depletion and whether these defects alter host interactions with pathogenic and commensal bacteria. Using a non-human primate model of HIV infection, we examined the immune and structural changes in the gastrointestinal tract 2.5 days following SIV infection. Paneth cells, in immediate proximity of SIV infected immune cells, generated a robust IL-1β response. This IL-1β response correlated with defects in epithelial tight junctions and preceded the IFN-α response, which is characteristic of innate antiviral immune responses. Despite this inflammatory environment, we did not observe defects in mucosal immune responses to pathogenic or commensal bacteria. In fact, commensal bacteria were able to dampen the IL-1β response and ameliorate tight junction defects. Our study highlights the importance of the gut epithelium in HIV infection, not just as a target of pathogenesis but also the initiator of immune responses to viral infection, which can be strongly influenced by commensal bacteria.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic inflammation and disease progression in HIV infection is attributed to dysfunction in the structure of the intestinal epithelial barrier as well as impairment of the mucosal immune response resulting in increased microbial translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Gaulke1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Estes1">[3]</xref>, dysbiosis of the gut microbiome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-McHardy1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Gori1">[6]</xref>, and enteric opportunistic infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Gordon1">[7]</xref>. Incomplete recovery of gut homeostasis, despite antiretroviral therapy, contributes to the persistence of immune activation in HIV infected patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Hunt1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Moir1">[10]</xref>. Studies in HIV infected patients and SIV infected non-human primates have shown massive dissemination of viral infection in the gut mucosa during the primary acute stage of infection leading to severe and rapid CD4+ T cell depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Heise1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Li1">[14]</xref>, which persists through all stages of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Guadalupe2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Dandekar1">[16]</xref>. In contrast, CD4+ T cell loss is progressive in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Loss of mucosal Th17 CD4+ T cell subset coincides with epithelial barrier disruption and is linked to increased microbial translocation and chronic immune activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Raffatellu1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Brenchley2">[18]</xref>. Although immune dysfunction following mucosal CD4+ T cell loss is well described, it is not known whether HIV can alter mucosal function and epithelial integrity prior to and independent of CD4+ T cell depletion <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further, our understanding of mucosal resident cells that are early responders to the virus and their inflammatory signaling networks is limited.</p>
<p>The intestinal epithelium is functionally diverse. In addition to the digestive and absorptive functions, it plays a critical role in microbial sensing and innate antimicrobial response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Peterson1">[19]</xref>. Secretory lineages of the intestinal epithelium produce antimicrobial products such as mucins by Goblet cells and defensins and inflammatory cytokines by Paneth cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Bevins1">[20]</xref>. Expansion of Paneth cells during chronic SIV infection has highlighted its important role in imparting innate defense in gut mucosa during chronic SIV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Zaragoza1">[21]</xref>. Although the Paneth cell response to microbial pathogens is well investigated, there is no information about their response to pathogens during early HIV and SIV infections and viral pathogenesis.</p>
<p>There is increasing evidence that viral infections can alter the host-commensal relationship <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Hand1">[22]</xref>. HIV and SIV induced changes in the gut microenvironment may have a profound effect on the mucosal response to incoming enteric pathogens as well as local commensal bacteria. To assess the early changes in mucosal responses induced by SIV infection, use of an <italic>in vivo</italic> intestinal model is essential, as <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture studies fail to replicate the complex cellular interactions and anaerobic microenvironment of the gut. We developed the simian ligated intestinal loop model, which most closely recapitulates the anaerobic gut microenvironment. By directly injecting bacteria into the intestinal lumen, this model facilitates the capture of the <italic>in vivo</italic> dynamics between microbes, the gut epithelium, and immune cell populations during the viral infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Raffatellu1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the present study, we investigated the earliest effects of SIV, prior to acute mucosal CD4+ T cell depletion, on epithelial barrier integrity and mucosal immune response to pathogenic (<italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium, <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium) and non-pathogenic (<italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic>, <italic>L. plantarum</italic>) bacteria <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our findings showed that the gut epithelium was the initial target of viral pathogenesis, as evidenced by impaired expression and disorganization of epithelial tight junction proteins, which were correlated to increased expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). We identified Paneth cells as the dominant source of the early innate IL-1β immune response. At this time-point, no defects in mucosal immune response to either pathogenic or commensal bacteria were observed. In fact, mucosal exposure to <italic>L. plantarum</italic> rapidly dampened SIV-induced inflammation through the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. Our study identified, for the first time, Paneth cells as an initial source of gut inflammation and IL-1β signaling during early viral infection. In addition, anti-inflammatory and epithelial repair effects of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> suggest the potential role of commensal bacteria in reversing the early effects of viral pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Defects in the intestinal epithelium precede mucosal CD4+ T cell depletion in early SIV infection</title>
<p>To identify the earliest targets of the pathogenic effects of SIV infection in the gut mucosa, prior to CD4+ T cell depletion, we examined rhesus macaques at 2.5 days following SIV infection (SIV+). Viral RNA was readily detected in plasma and intestinal tissue, indicating that productive viral infection was established in both mucosal and peripheral blood compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). Plasma viral loads ranged from 188–1106 RNA copies/ml (502.4±166.3 copies/ml) while viral loads in intestinal tissue ranged from 86–562 SIV copies/µg total RNA (249.7±86.44 SIV copies/µg total RNA). The localization and phenotype of SIV infected cells in intestinal tissues was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref><bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004311.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>). A small number of SIV-positive cells were detected, mostly in clusters near the lower crypt regions of the intestinal mucosa, and were either CD3+ T cells or CD68+ macrophages. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref><bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004311.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>). There was no detectable loss of CD4+ T cells, either in the peripheral blood (baseline uninfected: 1063±262.5 and SIV+: 952.5±322.4 cells/µl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g001"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>) or in the gut mucosa (percentage range 40.99–52.72%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g001"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref>). Further, no significant changes were observed in CD4+ T cell activation, in either peripheral blood or gut mucosa, as determined by HLA-DR expression (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004311.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>The rapid depletion of mucosal CD4+ T cells has been implicated in dysfunction of epithelial barriers and immune response during chronic HIV and SIV infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Dandekar1">[16]</xref>. Despite the lack of detectable gut CD4+ T cell depletion at 2.5 days of SIV infection, we observed the onset of early defects in the gut epithelium by electron microscopy (EM). Epithelial tight junction structures were significantly shorter in SIV+ animals (253±10.73 nm) compared to uninfected controls (443.5±17.38 nm) (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, Mann-Whitney) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). Analysis of tight junction proteins by confocal microscopy confirmed that SIV infection also caused a significant reduction in the expression of tight junction proteins, ZO-1 and Claudin-1 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.027 and 0.015, respectively, Mann-Whitney) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g002"><bold>Figure 2B–D</bold></xref>). In addition, the distribution of ZO-1 was discontinuous in SIV+ animals; which may suggest an impairment of epithelial structure and organization since ZO-1 is an intracellular scaffolding protein integral to the organized assembly of epithelial tight junction complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g002"><bold>Figure 2E</bold></xref>). However, the reduction and restructuring of tight junction proteins during early SIV infection did not result in increased systemic microbial translocation, as determined by the levels of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the plasma (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004311.s003">Figure S3</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Induction of IL-1β production by Paneth cells precedes the type 1 IFN response in the gut mucosa</title>
<p>To identify the earliest immune responses to viral infection in the gut mucosa, we performed transcriptome analysis of the intestinal tissues at 2.5 days following SIV infection using rhesus macaque specific DNA microarrays. There was no detectable increase in the expression of several known innate immune pathways or antiviral interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISG) in the intestinal tissues of SIV infected macaques compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). In contrast, a striking induction of IL-1β expression and increased expression of IL-1β regulated genes was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). Evaluation of intestinal tissues by immunostaining confirmed a significant increase of IL-1β protein mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in early SIV infection (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>To localize, and identify the major IL-1β expressing cells in response to SIV infection in the gut mucosa, immunohistochemical analysis was performed. The phenotype of IL-1β expressing cells was determined by the co-localization of IL-1β protein with several specific cellular markers. IL-1β was detected in the crypt epithelium as well as in lamina propria immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>). However, IL-1β expression in the crypt epithelium was approximately ten-fold higher than that observed in the lamina propria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g003"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>). Macrophages are known to produce IL-1β following activation of the inflammasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Lamkanfi1">[23]</xref>. We found that some of the IL-1β–expressing cells were positive for CD68, CD163 and CD206 expression, which served as the macrophage specific cell surface markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref><bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004311.s004">Figure S4</xref></bold>). Paneth cells are differentiated, secretory cells that release defensins and antimicrobial enzymes into the intestinal lumen. Paneth cells in the intestinal tissues were identified based on their location at the base of the crypt epithelium, detectable secretory granules, absence of Ki67 cell proliferation marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g003"><bold>Figure 3E</bold></xref>) and the presence of anti-microbial lysozyme protein in the granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g003"><bold>Figure 3F</bold></xref>) by confocal microscopy. When we examined the localization of SIV infected cells by immunostaining for the SIV p27 antigen, we observed that the infected cells were localized in close proximity to Paneth cells in the intestinal crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g003"><bold>Figure 3G</bold></xref>). These findings suggested epithelial-immune cell interactions in the initial mucosal response to the virus.</p>

<title><italic>L. plantarum</italic> reduces SIV-induced gut inflammation</title>
<p>In contrast to the effects of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium, inoculation with <italic>L. plantarum</italic> in the intestinal loops of SIV-negative control animals had a minimal effect on the mucosal gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g005"><bold>Figure 5D</bold></xref>). However, intestinal loops from SIV+ animals had a significant change in the gene expression profiles in response to <italic>L. plantarum</italic> compared to control loops without <italic>L. plantarum</italic>. This included striking downregulation of genes involved in inflammation and cell trafficking of monocytes and neutrophils (CD86, TREM1 and CXCL8) and upregulation of genes associated with epithelial repair and tissue remodeling.</p>
<p>An exception to the general downregulation of chemokines in the intestinal loops following <italic>L. plantarum</italic> inoculation was the increased expression of CXCR4, CXCL12 and CCL20. The CXCR4-CXCL12 axis has been utilized by several pathogens, including HIV, for entry and invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Arnolds1">[24]</xref>. CCL20 is a chemokine involved in the recruitment of Th17 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Esplugues1">[25]</xref>. We found that there was a significant increase in IL-17 transcript levels (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03, Mann-Whitney) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g005"><bold>Figure 5E</bold></xref>) as well as a marked increase in the frequency of Th17 cells in intestinal loops of SIV+ animals compared to SIV-negative controls (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02, Mann-Whitney) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g005"><bold>Figure 5F</bold></xref>). In comparison, no changes were observed in inflammatory cytokine expression or Th1 cells between these two groups.</p>
<p><italic>L. plantarum</italic> inoculation also resulted in the decreased expression of IL-1β and other genes involved in IL-1β production and signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g006"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>). There was a similar reduction in IL-1β protein levels in both SIV+ and SIV-negative animals in response to <italic>L. plantarum</italic> (<italic>P</italic> = 0.087 and 0.061, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004311-g006"><bold>Figure 6B</bold></xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study, for the first time, reports that Paneth cells are early sensors of virally infected immune cells in the intestinal mucosa. Their inflammatory response is mediated through robust IL-1β signaling, with profound implications on early tissue damage. Thus, Paneth cells play a critical role in the induction of gut inflammation during the early stages of viral infection, prior to the depletion of CD4+ T cells. To our knowledge, this is the first description of IL-1β production by Paneth cells.</p>
<p>While the mechanism by which Paneth cells sense and respond to pathogenic bacteria is well characterized, our understanding of their response to HIV infection is limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Bevins1">[20]</xref>. We found that SIV infected cells were localized in close proximity of the crypt epithelium, potentially exposing Paneth cells to viral antigens or inflammatory cytokines released by the infected cells. In HIV infection, virus has been shown to induce NLRP3-inflammasome expression and IL-1β production in myeloid cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Pontillo1">[27]</xref>. Though we cannot definitively attribute the induction of IL-1β to a specific stimulus, NLRP3 expression was increased in the gut mucosa suggesting potential involvement of an NLRP3-inflammasome mediated pathway in Paneth cells during SIV infection. Our findings highlight the need for future investigations to determine the mechanisms of Paneth cell sensing and response to viral infections and their role in the induction of host innate response to HIV.</p>
<p>We previously reported an increased expression of enteric defensins in Paneth cells during primary and chronic SIV infection that correlated with viral loads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Zaragoza1">[21]</xref>. The loss of defensin accumulation in these cells correlated with disease progression and opportunistic infections. In the present study, we did not observe an increase in enteric defensin gene expression at 2.5 days of SIV infection. This suggests that the IL-1β response precedes the upregulation of defensin expression in Paneth cells. Similarly, we did not detect a significant increase in the expression of IFN-α or IFN stimulated genes (ISG). The type 1 IFN response is critical in the early containment of viral replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Jacquelin1">[28]</xref>. However, this involves the recruitment of plasmacytoid dendritic cells to the gut mucosa and may require higher levels of viral replication than occurs at 2.5 days following SIV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Jacquelin1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Bosinger1">[30]</xref>. Thus, IL-1β production by Paneth cells represents a local response to SIV infection at a time point when viral presence is low in the intestinal mucosa, and may critically impact innate immune cell subsets such as macrophages and innate lymphoid cells (ILC), which express IL-1β receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Kurashima1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-McGettrick1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>Inflammatory cytokines have been shown to disrupt epithelial barrier integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Suzuki1">[33]</xref>. Exposure to IL-1β increased permeability in intestinal epithelial cell cultures by decreasing epithelial tight junction protein expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-AlSadi1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-AlSadi3">[36]</xref>. Increased IL-1β expression at 2.5 days of SIV infection negatively correlations with expression of tight junction components in our study, suggesting that IL-1β initiates intestinal epithelial barrier defects. Other inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, have also been shown to cause disruption of epithelial cell tight junctions <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Wang1">[37]</xref>. However, we did not detect an upregulation of IFN-γ or TNF-α expression by transcriptome analysis <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting that these cytokines might not contribute significantly towards intestinal epithelial changes during early infection. HIV envelope protein gp120 was shown to induce defects in epithelial tight junctions, only when added apically to epithelial cell cultures. No effects were observed when gp120 was added basolaterally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Nazli1">[38]</xref>. This mechanism is unlikely to play a role in epithelial integrity defects observed in our study, given that the few SIV infected immune cells detected were localized to the basolateral side of the intestinal epithelium.</p>
<p>In chronic SIV disease, epithelial barrier disruption has been shown to lead to increased microbial translocation. However, the changes in the intestinal epithelial barrier that occur during early viral infection did not result in systemic dissemination of bacteria and microbial products. This discrepancy is likely due to the preservation of mucosal CD4+ T cells in early infection, as our previous study had shown that the depletion of Th17 cells, in chronic SIV infection, results in the increased dissemination of pathogenic <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Raffatellu1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>The ability of the mucosal immune system to rapidly eradicate pathogens while maintaining tolerance to commensal bacteria is critical to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. The occurrence of aberrant host immune responses to commensal bacteria has been reported during chronic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Duchmann1">[39]</xref> and recently in acute <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Hand1">[22]</xref>. Aberrant inflammatory response to commensal bacteria by peripheral monocytes of individuals with chronic HIV infection has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Nagy1">[40]</xref>. It is not known whether acute HIV infection might obfuscate the host's ability to distinguish between pathogen and commensals. Aberrant immune responses to commensal bacteria during chronic HIV infection may be attributed to increased microbial translocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Brenchley1">[2]</xref>, immune activation of antigen presenting cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Nagy1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Gekonge1">[41]</xref>, and increased TLR2 and TLR4 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Hernandez1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Heggelund1">[43]</xref>. However, there have been no known studies that have interrogated gut mucosal immune responses to commensal bacteria in the context of early HIV infection. In our study, SIV infected animals had enhanced inflammatory responses to <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium, compared to SIV-negative controls, but showed no significant changes in the response to <italic>L. plantarum</italic>. Thus, in early SIV infection, the host maintains its ability to distinguish pathogenic and commensal bacteria and mount the proper immune response.</p>
<p>We found that <italic>L. plantarum</italic> rapidly induced intestinal epithelial repair in SIV infected macaques through anti-inflammatory effects that were evident by decreased expression of IL-1β and inflammatory chemokines. Previous studies reported on the ability of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species to enhance epithelial barrier integrity via tight junction regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Karczewski1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Liu1">[46]</xref>. Lactobacilli are known to regulate the NF-κB signaling cascade in both intestinal epithelial and antigen presenting cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-vanBaarlen1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Petrof1">[48]</xref>. In the current study, significant correlations were found linking disruption of epithelial tight junctions, induction of IL-1β levels, NF-κB activation and the ability of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> to downregulate these pathologic processes. This raises a possibility of exploiting of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> to intervene the early mucosal-viral interactions that may influence gut inflammation. In addition to its anti-inflammatory effects, we observed enhanced recruitment of Th17 cells in response to <italic>L. plantarum</italic>, mostly likely due to the induction of CCL20 expression. This recruitment of Th17 cells may have a role in epithelial repair. Our findings suggest a supportive role of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> in overcoming SIV-induced gut inflammation and epithelial tight junction disruption. However, unintended consequences of an <italic>L. plantarum</italic> probiotic therapeutic adjuvant may include increased viral replication through recruitment of virus-susceptible Th17 cell targets and viral dissemination through the induction of the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis. Our findings raise an important consideration in the development of probiotic therapies for HIV infection and highlight the need for a better characterization of probiotic bacterial functions and effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Klatt1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Gori2">[50]</xref>.</p>
<p>In summary, our study has identified the gut epithelium, specifically Paneth cells, as a site of sensing and response of viral infection and an inducer of gut inflammation through IL-1β signaling during early SIV infection. The ability of <italic>L. plantarum</italic> to modulate NF-κB activation and ameliorate epithelial defects makes it an attractive therapeutic adjuvant. These results highlight the importance of the trialogue between the epithelium, immune cells, and commensal organisms in the restoration and protection of the intestinal mucosa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Shulzhenko1">[51]</xref>. By further understanding the mechanisms that underlie the host/microbiota relationship in health and HIV disease, we can capitalize on their evolved synergy while identifying gaps in mucosal defenses that can be fortified through therapy.</p>

<p>SIV RNA loads in plasma and gut tissue samples were determined by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004311-Verhoeven1">[52]</xref>. Briefly, viral RNA was isolated from 1 µg of tissue and reverse transcribed to cDNA using Supercript III. SIV gag sequences were detected using a previously published Taqman system using an Applied Biosystems ViiA 7 detection system, and data were analyzed with ViiA 7 RUO software (Applied Biosystem). The data was extrapolated against a standard curve and viral RNA copies/µg of total RNA or RNA copies/ml plasma were calculated and presented.</p>

<title>Transmission Electron Microscopic (TEM) analysis of intestinal epithelial tight junctions</title>
<p>Intestinal loop tissues were embedded in Araldite/Epon resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and 100 nm thin sections were produced using a Leica ultramicrotome. Sections were mounted on copper grids and then post-stained with 2% uranyl acetate and 1% lead citrate. Samples were imaged under a JEOL 1230 transmission electron microscope operated at 120 kV and the micrographs were digitally recorded on a TVIPS F214 CCD camera at magnification of 8000–10000×. The step size on the CCD is 14 um and the pixel size at specimen space was calculated for each micrograph according to its magnification and the post column modification in the microscope. The lengths of tight junction were measured with program GIMP, as number of pixels spanning the adhesive plasma membrane from the micrograph and then converted into nanometer by multiplying the corresponding pixel size.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence and immunocytochemistry</title>
<p>Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using either frozen OCT embedded or 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixed, paraffin embedded tissues. For Immunofluorescence: 5 µm sections were rehydrated and antigen retrieval (DAKO) was performed at 95°C for 30 min. Tissues were then blocked with 1% Fc blockers (Miltenyi Biotec) and 10% serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.) for 30 min, incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C, followed by the secondary antibody for 1 hr at room temperature. For immunocytochemistry: 5 µm sections were fixed with cold acetone and blocked with DAKO dual endogenous enzyme block. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C followed by development with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB). The primary antibodies were as follows: mouse monoclonal IgG1 anti-SIVmac251 Gag (clone: KK64) (NIH AIDS Reagents), rabbit polyclonal anti-human CD3 (DAKO), rabbit polyclonal anti-human ZO-1 and claudin-1 (Invitrogen), goat IgG anti-human IL-1β (R&amp;D Systems), mouse monoclonal IgG1a anti-human CD68 (DAKO), mouse monoclonal IgG2a anti-human CD68 (Thermo Scientific), rabbit polyclonal anti-human lysozyme (DAKO), mouse monoclonal IgG1a anti-human Ki-67 (DAKO), polyclonal rabbit anti-human NF-κB p65 (Abcam), mouse anti-CD163 (clone: 10D6) (Leica Biosystems Newcastle), rabbit polyclonal anti-CD206 (Sigma-Aldrich), mouse monoclonal IgG1 anti-LTA (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), and DifcoTM Salmonella O Antisera (BD Pharmingen). Alexa Flour 488 donkey anti-rabbit, Alex Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG2a, Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse IgG1, Alexa Flour 555 donkey anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-goat secondary antibodies were used (Invitrogen). Isotype control was performed for IL-1β using a goat IgG UNLB (Southern Biotech). Nuclei were visualized using DAPI nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen).

<title>Immunofluorescence image analysis</title>
<p>For the detection of epithelial tight junction proteins and NF-κB, gut tissues were imaged using Z-stack with 0.2 µm per section (25 sections total). These were performed in triplicate (3 slides with minimum of 30 µm distance separating tissue triplicates). An oil immersion, 60× objective (na = 1.42) was used with 2×2 binning during image acquisition. The sum of fluorescence intensity was calculated for the stack and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was determined. MFI of tight junction proteins within the epithelial regions of the tissue were quantified. For quantification of nuclear NF-κB, DAPI signal regions were selected and NF-κB signal within this region was analyzed. IL-1β localization was imaged using a 10×, 20× and 40× objectives. We utilized the 20× images to quantify the area of IL-1β within the crypts and lamina propria in the intestinal mucosa. Crypt epithelium was defined as epithelial cells most proximal to the basement membrane, as compared to protein in the lamina propria, which included regions of immune cells but not epithelial cells. Image J software (National Institute of Mental Health) was utilized for image processing and quantification.</p>

<title>Measurement of host gene expression by real-time PCR</title>
<p>Cryopreserved tissue samples were used for real-time PCR analysis. Primer-probe pairs tested, and validated to have an amplification efficiency of &gt;95%, comparable to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Primers were either obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) or were designed, optimized, and validated for use by the Lucy Whittier Molecular Core Lab (University of California, Davis) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1004311-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).
