<abstract>
<p>The blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> threatens global food security through the widespread destruction of cultivated rice. Foliar infection requires a specialized cell called an appressorium that generates turgor to force a thin penetration hypha through the rice cuticle and into the underlying epidermal cells, where the fungus grows for the first days of infection as a symptomless biotroph. Understanding what controls biotrophic growth could open new avenues for developing sustainable blast intervention programs. Here, using molecular genetics and live-cell imaging, we dismantled <italic>M. oryzae</italic> glucose-metabolizing pathways to reveal that the transketolase enzyme, encoded by <italic>TKL1</italic>, plays an essential role in facilitating host colonization during rice blast disease. In the absence of transketolase, Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> mutant strains formed functional appressoria that penetrated rice cuticles successfully and developed invasive hyphae (IH) in rice cells from primary hyphae. However, Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> could not undertake sustained biotrophic growth or cell-to-cell movement. Transcript data and observations using fluorescently labeled histone H1:RFP fusion proteins indicated Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> mutant strains were alive in host cells but were delayed in mitosis. Mitotic delay could be reversed and IH growth restored by the addition of exogenous ATP, a metabolite depleted in Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> mutant strains. We show that ATP might act via the TOR signaling pathway, and TOR is likely a downstream target of activation for <italic>TKL1</italic>. <italic>TKL1</italic> is also involved in controlling the migration of appressorial nuclei into primary hyphae in host cells. When taken together, our results indicate transketolase has a novel role in mediating - via ATP and TOR signaling - an <italic>in planta</italic>-specific metabolic checkpoint that controls nuclear migration from appressoria into primary hyphae, prevents mitotic delay in early IH and promotes biotrophic growth. This work thus provides new information about the metabolic strategies employed by <italic>M. oryzae</italic> to enable rice cell colonization.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> destroys rice and wheat harvests and could compromise global food security. Following penetration into the rice cell, <italic>M. oryzae</italic> elaborates bulbous invasive hyphae that grow in living rice cells for most of the infection cycle without causing disease symptoms. Little is known about the physiological processes governing this important biotrophic stage of fungal growth. Here, we used gene functional analysis to show how the primary metabolic enzyme transketolase is essential for hyphal growth in rice cells. Loss of transketolase did not affect the ability of the fungus to gain entry into rice cells, but invasive hyphal growth was curtailed in transketolase null mutants. Biotrophic growth was restored in transketolase mutants by the addition of exogenous ATP. We conclude that <italic>M. oryzae</italic> metabolism is dedicated to metabolizing glucose through transketolase <italic>in planta</italic> in order to provide ATP as a trigger for biotrophic growth and infection. This work is significant because it reveals important—but previously unknown—metabolic strategies employed by <italic>M. oryzae</italic> to facilitate rice infection. These strategies might be open to abrogation by chemical or biological means and are likely relevant to other rapidly proliferating intracellular pathogens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> causes the most serious disease of cultivated rice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wilson1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez1">[2]</xref> and is a significant challenge to global food security <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fisher1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Kupferschmidt1">[4]</xref>. Infection involves the elaboration of a specialized structure, the appressorium, from a germinating three-celled conidium (spore) on the surface of the leaf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wilson1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Dagdas1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Ryder1">[6]</xref>. Each cell of the conidium contains a nucleus, the most apical of which migrates into the germ tube during appressorium development where it undergoes closed mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Saunders1">[7]</xref>. One of the resulting daughter nuclei returns to the conidium to be degraded during autophagic cell-death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-VeneaultFourrey1">[8]</xref>; the other enters the incipient appressorium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Saunders1">[7]</xref> to become the source of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genetic material during host infection. Disrupting autophagy or blocking the cell cycle at three checkpoints (S-phase, mitosis and exit from mitosis) abolishes infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-VeneaultFourrey1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Saunders2">[9]</xref>. At maturation, enormous turgor is generated in the appressorium through the accumulation of glycerol and the ingress of water that becomes trapped due to a layer of melanin deposited on the wall of the appressorium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Howard1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-deJong1">[11]</xref>. This hydrostatic pressure acts on a penetration peg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Dagdas1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Ryder1">[6]</xref>, forcing it through the leaf cuticle. In the cell lumen, the penetration peg becomes a thin primary hypha that invaginates the host plasma membrane before differentiating into bulbous invasive hyphae (IH) that are sealed in the plant-derived extra-invasive hyphal membrane (EIHM) compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Kankanala1">[12]</xref>. IH moves into adjacent cells by crossing the cell wall at plasmodesmata, and the biotrophic invasion process is repeated in successive rice cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Kankanala1">[12]</xref>. After four to five days of biotrophic growth in susceptible cultivars, host cells die and <italic>M. oryzae</italic> enters its necrotrophic growth phase, causing spreading necrotic lesions on the leaf surface from which conidia are produced on aerial hyphae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wilson1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>During appressorium development, lipid and glycogen stores in the spore are mobilized and transported to the appressorium in a manner dependent on the MAP kinase- and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A-signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Thines1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wang1">[14]</xref>. Following lipolysis in the incipient appressorium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wang2">[15]</xref>, a large body of evidence indicates that organelles and biochemical pathways that metabolize fatty acids, such as mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation and the glyoxylate cycle, are essential for the development of infection-competent appressoria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wang2">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Patkar1">[20]</xref>. Thus, fatty acid β-oxidation and the distribution of the resulting acetyl-CoA subunits into cellular processes such as cell wall biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Bhambra1">[17]</xref> and pyruvate formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Bhadauria1">[19]</xref> are dominant biochemical pathways during appressorial development.</p>
<p>In contrast to appressorial function (which requires lipid catabolism through β-oxidation and the glyoxylate cycle), post-penetrative host infection is dependent on glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) sensing by trehalose-6-phosphate synthase 1 (Tps1) and the concomitant production of NADPH through the pentose phosphate pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wilson2">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez3">[24]</xref>. The binding of G6P by Tps1 leads, via an NADPH-dependent signaling pathway, to the induced expression of genes encoding NADPH-requiring enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wilson3">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez3">[24]</xref> and the repression of genes required for utilizing alternative sources of carbon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez2">[23]</xref>. At least two NADPH-requiring processes under Tps1 control, the glutathione and thioredoxin antioxidation systems, are glucose-responsive and required for biotrophic growth in rice cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez3">[24]</xref>. Taken together, we have proposed that these observations are consistent with the occurrence of a metabolic shift from lipid metabolism by <italic>M. oryzae</italic> on the host surface to glucose metabolism in the host cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez4">[25]</xref>. This metabolic reprogramming hypothesis is supported by the observations that the glyoxylate enzyme isocitrate lyase is required for appressorium function but is not required for growth <italic>in planta</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wang3">[16]</xref>. However, which glucose metabolizing pathways are active during <italic>M. oryzae</italic> growth <italic>in planta</italic>, and whether glucose metabolism contributes to appressorial development, is not known.</p>
<p>Here, we sought to bolster our understanding of the metabolic strategies governing <italic>M. oryzae in planta</italic> growth by focusing on how glucose-metabolizing pathways contribute to rice blast infection. We used gene functional analysis and live-cell imaging to show how glucose-metabolizing pathways are not required for appressorium formation and function. Instead, glucose metabolism via transketolase (encoded by <italic>TKL1</italic>) is essential for the post-invasive colonization of rice cells by <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. The loss of transketolase function resulted in Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> mutant strains that could form appressoria, penetrate host cells and elaborate IH, but were attenuated for growth and cell cycle progression <italic>in planta</italic>. Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> strains were depleted for ATP, and IH growth was restored <italic>in planta</italic> following the treatment of Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> strains with exogenous ATP, suggesting ATP acts downstream of transketolase to signal growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Coller1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Klosinska1">[27]</xref>. Moreover, evidence is provided to suggest ATP acts on the TOR signaling pathway and together our data indicate a functional connection between <italic>TKL1</italic>, ATP and the TOR signaling pathway. These results are consistent with a novel role for transketolase in mediating an <italic>in planta</italic>-specific metabolic checkpoint that regulates the cell cycle, via TOR activation, in order to permit rice cell colonization by <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. This work thus gives fresh insights into the metabolic demands of biotrophy and points to novel signaling roles for transketolase that will be important for other areas of biology.</p>

<title>Early glycolysis, late gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway are not required for appressorium formation</title>
<p>To develop a more robust understanding of the biochemical processes underlying plant infection by <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, we first sought to determine what glucose-metabolizing pathways might be important for rice infection. Following Berg and associates, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Berg1">[28]</xref>, we considered four metabolic destinations for G6P in <italic>M. oryzae</italic>: into glycolysis via the action of phosphoglucose isomerase 1 (Pgi1) if more ATP than NADPH or ribose 5-phosphate is needed (Mode 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g001">Figure 1</xref>); into early glycolysis and the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway if ribose 5-phosphate production for nucleotide biosynthetic purposes is predominant (Mode 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g001">Figure 1</xref>); into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and recycling via late gluconeogenesis until G6P is fully oxidized to CO<sub>2</sub> if NADPH production is paramount (Mode 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g001">Figure 1</xref>); into the PPP and glycolysis to form pyruvate if NADPH and ATP production is required (Mode 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Searching the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Dean1">[29]</xref>, we found single orthologues of <italic>FBP1</italic> (MGG_08895) encoding fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase in the gluconeogenic pathway, <italic>PGI1</italic> (MGG_12822) involved in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, and <italic>TKL1</italic> (MGG_02471) encoding transketolase, a non-oxidative PPP enzyme linking the PPP and glycolysis. Using our high-throughput, PCR-based split marker method for gene deletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wilson3">[22]</xref>, we replaced part of the coding regions of <italic>FBP1</italic> and <italic>PGI1</italic> with the <italic>ILV1</italic> gene conferring sulphonyl urea resistance, and the coding region of <italic>TKL1</italic> with the <italic>Bar</italic> gene conferring bialaphos resistance. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g002">Figure 2A</xref> shows that the resulting three mutant strains - Δ<italic>fbp1</italic>, Δ<italic>pgi1</italic> and Δ<italic>tkl1</italic>- grew without impediment on glucose-rich complete media (CM) compared to wild type Guy11 strains. Despite these similarities in growth, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g002">Figure 2B</xref> shows that both <italic>PGI1</italic> and <italic>TKL1</italic>, but not <italic>FBP1</italic>, contributed significantly (<italic>Student's t-test</italic> p≤0.05) to sporulation rates on CM media. This indicates nucleotide biosynthesis via Mode 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g001">Figure 1</xref>) might be important for sporulation, perhaps due to the nucleotide demands of DNA replication during spore production.</p>

<title>Potential metabolic destinations for G6P.</title>
<p>Following Berg and colleagues, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Berg1">[28]</xref>, we considered four scenarios for the fate of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) during infection-related processes. <bold>Mode 1</bold>: More ATP than NADPH is required. G6P enters glycolysis through its conversion to fructose 6-phosphate by phosphoglucose isomerase 1 (Pgi1). <bold>Mode 2</bold>: <italic>M. oryzae</italic> cells require more ribose 5-phosphate for biosynthetic purposes than NADPH. Fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in the glycolytic pathway are converted to ribose 5-phosphate in the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) by the action of transaldolase and transketolase (Tkl1). <bold>Mode 3</bold>: more NADPH than ribose 5-phosphate is required. G6P fuels NADPH production by G6P dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in the oxidative PPP and is resynthesized in the gluconeogenic pathway by fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (Fbp1) and Pgi1. G6P is completely oxidized to CO<sub>2</sub>. <bold>Mode 4</bold>: NADPH and ATP are required. G6P fluxes through the PPP and into glycolysis via Tkl1 resulting in the production of NADPH and ATP. G6P is converted into pyruvate. Dashed lines indicate steps that have been omitted for clarity. Products of genes functionally characterized in the text are indicated by black spheres.</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Radial growth on complete media (CM) was not impaired in mutant strains carrying gene deletions in <italic>FBP1</italic>, <italic>PGI1</italic> or <italic>TKL1</italic>.

<p>Interestingly, all the mutant strains in this study formed melanized appressoria on hydrophobic surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>) at rates that were indistinguishable from Guy11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>Student's t-test</italic> p&gt;0.05). This indicates that the glucose utilization pathways shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g001">Figure 1</xref> are not required for appressorium formation and is consistent with previous work emphasizing the requirement for lipid metabolism and the glyoxylate cycle, rather than sugar metabolism, during appressorium formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wang2">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Patkar1">[20]</xref>. Taken together, G6P metabolism via Mode 2 contributes to sporulation, but neither Mode described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g001">Figure 1</xref> is necessary for appressorial formation.</p>

<p>The inability of Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> strains to infect rice leaves was not due to defective appressorium formation or function on host surfaces because, like Δ<italic>pgi</italic> and Δ<italic>fbp1</italic> mutant strains, Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> formed appressoria on rice leaf surfaces at the same rates as Guy11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g003">Figure 3B</xref>; <italic>Student's t-test</italic> p = 0.64). Also, the rates of cuticle penetration on detached rice leaf sheaths were not significantly different (<italic>Student's t-test</italic> p = 0.37) for Guy11 and any of the mutant strains generated for this study, including Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>If appressorium formation and function did not depend on a functional Tkl1 enzyme, how, then, does <italic>TKL1</italic> contribute to pathogenicity? To address this question, we continued to characterize the role of the<italic>TKL1</italic> gene in pathogenicity using live-cell imaging of detached rice leaf sheaths colonized with either Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> or Guy11 strains. At 48 hr post inoculation (hpi), Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> mutant strains were found to elaborate bulbous IH from primary hyphae, but IH growth was severely restricted to the first infected cell compared to Guy11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). At 48 hpi, more than 80% of Guy11, Δ<italic>pgi</italic> and Δ<italic>fbp1</italic> primary infection sites had resulted in IH spreading to adjacent cells, but IH movement to adjacent cells by Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> mutant strains was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> strains had also not spread to adjacent cells by 65 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Growth rates in rice cells at 48 hpi was scored for 50 infected cells/strain (repeated in triplicate) using our 4 point scale (where 1 = IH length shorter than 10 µm with no branching; 2 = IH length is 10–20 µm with 0–2 branches; 3 = IH length is longer than 20 µm and/or with more than 2 branches within one cell; 4 = IH has spread to adjacent cells). The average growth rate score for Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> strains in rice cells at 48 hpi was significantly reduced compared to Guy11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g003">Figure 3G</xref>; <italic>Student's t-test</italic> p = 0.0078). Therefore, <italic>TKL1</italic> is not required for appressorium formation or function, or for IH elaboration, but is essential for strong biotrophic growth in rice cells and the movement of IH to neighboring cells.</p>

<p>Because Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> mutant strains were alive in rice cells, we next asked what molecular mechanism might account for their attenuated growth <italic>in planta</italic>.

Cellular quiescence occurs in yeast and mammals via the inactivation of the TOR signaling pathway in response to nutrient depletion. Conversely, the activated TOR signaling pathway promotes growth under favorable nutrient conditions. TOR inactivation results in, amongst other outcomes, cell cycle arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Barbet1">[32]</xref> and translation suppression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Loewith1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-DeVirgilio1">[34]</xref>.

<p>To ensure that the observed downregulation of gene expression in Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> mutants <italic>in planta</italic> was not attributable to a general decrease in <italic>MoACT1</italic> expression in Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> strains compared to Guy11, we analyzed the expression of a putative glucose transporter encoded by <italic>RGT2</italic>, previously shown to be highly and constitutively expressed during rice infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez5">[37]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g004">Figure 4D</xref> shows that the ratio of <italic>MoACT1</italic> gene expression to <italic>RGT2</italic> gene expression, <italic>in planta</italic>, is the same for both Guy11 and Δ<italic>tkl1</italic>, indicating <italic>MoACT1</italic> gene expression was not reduced in Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> strains compared to Guy11.</p>

<title>Mitotic delay in Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> mutant strains is obviated by treatment with ATP</title>
<p>Why does loss of <italic>TKL1</italic> result in mitotic delay and growth attenuation? We speculated that, considering the Tkl1 enzyme is involved in glucose metabolism, the lack of a metabolite(s) or metabolic pathway(s) downstream of Tkl1 might impact, directly or indirectly, cell cycle progression. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g003">Figure 3H</xref> we knew that Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> strains were significantly reduced in ATP production compared to Guy11, such as would be predicted from perturbations to Mode 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In the absence of evidence for other metabolic changes, we hypothesized, then, that treatment of Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> mutant strains with exogenous ATP might remediate IH growth and affect mitotic rates upon host infection.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we first needed to determine if <italic>M. oryzae</italic> was capable of acquiring or metabolizing ATP from the external milieu. In a previous study, we had shown how an adenine-requiring mutant, Δ<italic>ade1</italic>, could not grow on minimal media unless supplemented with adenosine or adenine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez5">[37]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g006">Figure 6A</xref> shows how this same Δ<italic>ade1</italic> mutant strain was remediated for growth on minimal media in the presence of ATP at a final concentration of 5 mM. This suggests that <italic>M. oryzae</italic> is capable of acquiring exogenous ATP directly from the media and, in adenine-requiring Δ<italic>ade1</italic> mutant strains, this remediates axenic growth by converting ATP to adenine through the purine salvage pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez5">[37]</xref>. In addition, because Δ<italic>ade1</italic> mutant strains can penetrate host cells but fail to establish infection, the growth tests in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g006">Figure 6A</xref> indicate plant sources of ATP, like adenine and adenosine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez5">[37]</xref>, are not available to <italic>M. oryzae</italic> during growth in rice cells.</p>

<p>The remediating effect of ATP on Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> H1:RFP IH nuclear proliferation at 32 hpi was also observed when Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> H1:RFP spores were treated with the related compound adenosine (possibly due to its conversion to ATP through the purine salvage pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez5">[37]</xref>), but not when treated with 0.4 mM of the unrelated ROS quencher diphehyleneiodonium chloride (data not shown).

<title>Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> mutant strains are not impaired in mitosis or autophagy during appressorium development</title>
<p>The preceding results demonstrated that following host penetration, nuclear division rates in the IH of Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> H1:RFP mutant strains were reduced compared to those of Guy11 H1:RFP, but this mitotic delay could be avoided by treatment with ATP prior to infection. However, untreated Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> mutant strains could still form infection-competent appressoria on the host surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g003">Figure 3B and C</xref>).

How can these observations be reconciled? To address this question, we applied spores of Guy11 H1:RFP and Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> H1:RFP strains to detached leaf surfaces and observed nuclei behaviour during appressorium development and early infection. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004354.s004">Figure S4</xref> shows that, up to 21 hpi, there was little difference in the behaviour of the nuclei of either strain, with each strain demonstrating three conidial nuclei at 13 hpi, and a punctate, appressorial nucleus at 18 hpi. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g008">Figure 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004354.s004">Figure S4</xref> shows that by 21 hpi, no nuclei remained in the conidium of either strain, indicating that appressorial development and autophagic cell death of the conidium and its contents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-VeneaultFourrey1">[8]</xref> had progressed normally in both strains. The timing of these events on rice cuticles is consistent with what has previously been demonstrated during appressorial formation on artificial hydrophobic surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Saunders2">[9]</xref>. However, at 21 hpi, whereas H1:RFP was still localized to a single, punctate appressorial nucleus in Guy11 H1:RFP strains, H1:RFP was diffused throughout the appressoria of Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> H1:RFP strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g008">Figure 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004354.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Differences were also seen at 24 hpi when, by this time, the single nucleus of each Guy11 H1:RFP appressorium had migrated from the leaf surface to primary hyphae in the host cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g008">Figure 8A</xref>), but no nuclear migration was evident for Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> H1:RFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). However, Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> H1:RFP strains treated with ATP displayed a single, punctate appressorial nucleus at 21 hpi which had migrated into primary hyphae by 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). These results suggest <italic>TKL1</italic> is not required for the cell cycle events that give rise to the single nucleus of the appressorium, or for autophagic cell death and degradation of the remaining nuclei in the conidium. Instead, the results presented here indicate <italic>TKL1</italic> acts after autophagy, via ATP, to maintain a punctate appressorial nucleus and control its migration into primary hyphae in the host cell.</p>

<p>Additional evidence that ATP acts after appressorial formation comes from the use of the non-hydrolysable analogue of ATP, adenosine 5′-adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP). Treating Guy11 spores with AMP-PNP did not prevent appressorium formation on detached leaf sheaths but did abolish appressorium penetration of host surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g008">Figure 8B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>M. oryzae</italic> is a serious threat to world rice harvests and spends most of its infection cycle as a symptomless biotroph growing cell-to-cell in rice leaves before the onset of necrosis. Compared to appressorial development on the host surface, little is known about the metabolic and physiological demands of the fungus during <italic>in planta</italic> growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez4">[25]</xref>. Improving our basic understanding of the biology of biotrophy might contribute to devising effective, long-term resistance strategies using novel chemical or biological interventions. Here, we aimed to add to our knowledge of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> by describing how some glucose-metabolizing pathways contribute to rice blast disease. In doing so, we revealed that <italic>TKL1</italic>, encoding transketolase, is essential for pathogenicity and controls biotrophic growth in rice cells via a mechanism involving ATP, TOR and the regulation of cell cycle progression.</p>
<p>This work started with the hypothesis that <italic>M. oryzae</italic> undergoes metabolic reprogramming during infection, switching from lipid metabolism on the surface of the leaf during appressorium formation to glucose metabolism in host cells. On the leaf surface, β-oxidation and the glyoxylate cycle are required for developing infection-competent appressoria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wang3">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Bhambra1">[17]</xref>, but at least the glyoxylate enzyme isocitrate lyase is not required for growth <italic>in planta</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wang3">[16]</xref>. In contrast, our genetic dissections of glucose metabolism in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> show that early glycolysis, late gluconeogenesis and the PPP are not required for appressorium formation or function on the rice leaf surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g003">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Rather, glucose utilization through transketolase (but not early glycolysis or late gluconeogenesis) is essential for growth in host cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g003">Figure 3A and D</xref>). Glucose utilization through transketolase likely occurs in the direction of glycolysis because ATP levels are reduced in the mycelia of Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> strains compared to Guy11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g003">Figure 3H</xref>). Together, the genetic and biochemical evidence point to transketolase being important in connecting the PPP with glycolysis during <italic>in planta</italic> growth (Mode 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The critical post-penetration, <italic>in planta</italic>-specific role of <italic>TKL1</italic> indicates that once in the host cell, <italic>M. oryzae</italic> metabolism might be dedicated to NADPH and ATP production from glucose. NADPH is likely important, amongst other processes, for recycling antioxidation systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Pollak1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Ying1">[41]</xref> and maintaining redox balance during biotrophic growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez3">[24]</xref>; ATP is likely required for meeting the energetic demands of the fungus <italic>in planta</italic>. A major and novel finding of this work is that ATP produced via Tkl1 can also act as a signal, likely upstream of the TOR pathway, to promote cell cycle progression and trigger the biotrophic growth of <italic>M. oryzae in planta</italic>. Delayed mitotic progression was reversed by the addition of exogenous ATP, but not unrelated compounds, to Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> spores, thus providing a functional connection between <italic>TKL1</italic>, ATP and TOR. Indeed, exogenous ATP was shown to override the specific TOR kinase inhibitor rapamycin. Although we do not know how ATP acts on TOR, these results are consistent with observations in mammalian cells, where inactivated mTOR promotes cellular quiescence while mTOR activation is dependent on the monitoring of ATP levels, either directly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Dennis1">[42]</xref> or via the AMP-sensing TOR regulator AMPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Gwinn1">[43]</xref>. Therefore, one explanation for the results presented here could be that, following the transition of the fungus into the host cell, <italic>TKL1</italic> is required to metabolize glucose and provide an ATP signal that mediates a metabolic checkpoint - via TOR - in order to control the cell cycle and promote hyphal growth <italic>in planta</italic>. Metabolic checkpoints sense metabolites to regulate cellular functions and have recently been implicated in cell cycle quiescence in hematopoietic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Takubo1">[44]</xref>. However, although TOR can control quiescence in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Loewith1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-DeVirgilio1">[34]</xref>, Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> strains are likely in a slow growing rather than quiescent state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g003">Figure 3F and 3G</xref>). Moreover, in addition to extending G<sub>1</sub>, inactivating TOR can affect the G<sub>2</sub>/M transition, resulting in G<sub>2</sub>-delay in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Loewith1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Nakashima1">[45]</xref>. Therefore, we cannot state at this time where in the cell cycle of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> the TOR pathway regulates mitosis in response to ATP, except that its abrogation results in mitotic delay.</p>
<p>Additional evidence that <italic>TKL1</italic> mediates an <italic>in planta</italic>-specific metabolic checkpoint in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> comes from the observations that outside the host plant, <italic>TKL1</italic> was not required for cell cycle regulation or autophagic cell death of the spore during appressorium formation and rice leaf penetration. Instead, <italic>TKL1</italic> (or exogenous ATP treatment of Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> strains) was required to maintain a punctate appressorial nucleus and ensure the correct timing of nuclear migration from the appressorium into the primary hyphae in the plant. H1:RFP was not localized to a punctate nuclear structure in Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> H1:RFP strains following host penetration at 21 hpi and was instead diffused throughout the appressorium. In fibroblasts, different histone H1 subtypes have different cellular localizations during cell division. For example, Histone H1.2 is associated with chromatin during prophase but cytoplasmically localized during metaphase and early anaphase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Gren1">[46]</xref>. Histone H1.5 is partitioned between chromatin and cytoplasm during metaphase and early anaphase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Gren1">[46]</xref>. In addition, histone H1 diffusion dynamics in HeLa cells are affected by ATP depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Bhattacharya1">[47]</xref>. Thus, H1:RFP might be localized throughout the appressorium in Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> H1:RFP strains at 21 hpi due to altered cell cycle progression and/or altered histone dynamics in response to ATP (compared to Guy11 H1:RFP at 21 hpi). This hypothesis remains to be tested.</p>
<p>In Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> strains in the absence exogenous ATP, at least one nucleus has migrated into the IH of Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> mutant strains by at least 32 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004354-g005">Figure 5</xref>), suggesting the <italic>TKL1</italic>-dependent metabolic checkpoint is reversible and perhaps responds to other metabolites. Reversibility is a hallmark of slow growth and quiescence and distinguishes it from other non-growing cell states such as senescence, apoptosis or terminal differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Coller2">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>Taken together, our data suggests the following testable model of infection. Appressorial formation occurs under the nutrient-starvation conditions found on the host surface and requires autophagic cell death of the spore and recycling of the spore contents into the incipient appressorium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-VeneaultFourrey1">[8]</xref>. β-oxidation and the glyoxylate cycle are the dominant metabolic pathways during this stage of development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez4">[25]</xref>. A single mitotic cell cycle event occurs in the germ tube and one daughter nucleus migrates into the incipient appressorium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Saunders2">[9]</xref>. The remaining conidial nuclei are degraded during autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-VeneaultFourrey1">[8]</xref>, resulting in a sole appressorial nucleus. Following host penetration, and perhaps in response to G6P sensing by Tps1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez4">[25]</xref>, <italic>M. oryzae</italic> metabolism switches to glucose metabolism through the PPP and transketolase, resulting in NADPH production for redox and ATP production for satisfying the energetic demands of the growing fungus. ATP is also a signal, likely acting via TOR pathway activation, to control the migration of the appressorial nucleus into primary hyphae in the host cell. Once IH have developed in the host cell, transketolase is further required to propagate the ATP signal and, via TOR pathway activation, prevent delayed mitotic progression in order to permit vigorous cell-to-cell growth <italic>in planta</italic>. Deleting <italic>TKL1</italic> or treating spores with the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue AMP-PNP does not impact appressorium development but subsequent infection steps are delayed or abolished.</p>
<p>The work presented here has highlighted mechanisms controlling the transition from appressorial development to biotrophic growth in rice cells, but important questions remain. We wish to understand 1) whether ATP affects TOR signaling due to a direct interaction of ATP and the Tor1 kinase, or indirectly due to an interaction between ATP and additional TOR interacting protein(s) or pathways; 2) how the germ tube mitotic cell cycle event occurs during autophagy when TOR signaling is presumably inactive, whereas nuclear division in IH requires an activated TOR pathway; 3) what is the relationship between autophagy in the spore, G6P sensing by Tps1 <italic>in planta</italic>, and the TOR signaling pathway; 4) how does G6P sensing by Tps1 switch carbon metabolism from β-oxidation in mitochondria and peroxisomes to glucose metabolism through the PPP in the cytoplasm. Addressing these points will require further, detailed explorations of the biology of <italic>M. oryzae</italic> biotrophy.</p>
<p>In addition to shedding new light on the metabolic strategies governing rice infection, the characterizations of <italic>TKL1</italic> function in <italic>M. oryzae</italic> might also have important clinical relevance. Metabolizing glucose through the PPP and transketolase to generate NADPH is a metabolic strategy observed in cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Schulze1">[48]</xref>, activated macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-ONeill1">[49]</xref> and the growth of T cells in response to pathogen challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Gerriets1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wang4">[51]</xref>. Similar to our observations with <italic>M. oryzae</italic>, the transition of naive T cells to actively growing T cells is accompanied by a metabolic shift from β-oxidation to glucose utilization via the PPP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Gerriets1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wang4">[51]</xref>. Moreover, transketolase, which controls the PPP along with G6PDH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-DiazMoralli1">[52]</xref>, is upregulated in certain tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Langbein1">[53]</xref> and has been implicated in metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-DiazMoralli1">[52]</xref>. Transketolase inhibitors have been shown to reduce the rate of proliferation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Boros1">[54]</xref> while, conversely, stimulating transketolase activity in cancer cells using thiamine promoted tumor growth in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-ComnAnduix1">[55]</xref>. Thus, switching to glucose utilization via transketolase might be a conserved feature of proliferating cells. Consequently, small-molecule inhibitors of transketolase, such as those developed as anti-cancer therapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Boros1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Du1">[56]</xref>, could hold promise for combating recalcitrant intracellular fungal pathogens.</p>
<p>The work presented here also contributes to our understanding of metabolic checkpoints by revealing a previously unknown functional relationship between <italic>TKL1</italic> and TOR that provides new information on the regulation of the TOR pathway. This connection might have importance beyond the field of plant pathogenicity due to the role activated TOR plays in some cancers and other serious disorders such as cardiovascular disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wullschleger1">[57]</xref>. Moreover, metabolic checkpoints are required for T cell differentiation and immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wang4">[51]</xref>, and this requires signaling through a metabolic checkpoint mediated by the mTOR pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wang4">[51]</xref>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study gives fresh insights into the metabolic strategies controlling, and committing, intracellular pathogens to biotrophic growth. This knowledge is likely applicable to a wide range of important fungal pathogens. Moreover, our characterization of transketolase as a metabolic checkpoint mediator might inform other areas of biology where this enzyme and its downstream targets are important, such as during cancer cell proliferation.</p>

<p>All strains used in this study are stored in the Wilson lab. Guy11 was used as the wild-type isolate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Talbot1">[58]</xref> and all mutant strains described in this study were generated from the Guy11 parental strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004354.s005">Table S1</xref>). <italic>M. oryzae</italic> was cultured and stored using standard procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez5">[37]</xref>. Strains were grown on complete medium (CM) or Cove's minimal media (MM), as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wilson4">[59]</xref>. Glucose was used in MM at a final concentration of 1% w/v. Nitrogen sources were used in MM at a final concentration of 10 mM. Physiological analyses were performed on media as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez3">[24]</xref>. Plates were imaged with a Sony Cyber-shot digital camera, 14.1 mega pixels, after 10 days of growth. For sporulation rates, strains were grown on at least three independent CM plates for 12 days before the spores were harvested and spore concentrations were measured using a hemocytometer (Corning). Appressorium developmental assays were performed on hydrophobic microscope coverslips (Fisherbrand). Spores were harvested and diluted into 1×10<sup>5</sup> spores ml<sup>−1</sup> in sterile distilled water. 200 µl of spore suspension was placed on three plastic coverslips per strain and placed in a plastic box with a wet paper towel on the bottom simulating a humid chamber. After 24 hr of incubation, the number of appressoria formed from 50 spores was determined for each replicate, and an average percent value generated. The non-hydrolysable ATP analogue adenosine 5′-adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) was purchased from Sigma and added to Guy11 spores to a final concentration of 5 mM. The NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphehyleneiodonium chloride was purchased from Sigma and added to Guy11 spores to a final concentration of 0.4 mM, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Chi1">[60]</xref>.</p>

<title>Homologous gene replacement strategies</title>
<p>Transformation-competent protoplasts were produced as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wilson3">[22]</xref>. Guy11 was grown in liquid CM with agitation at 150 rpm for 48 hr. Mycelia was harvested and treated with lytic enzymes (Glucanex, Sigma) for 3 hr at 29°C in order to produce protoplasts. All targeted gene deletions mentioned in this study were generated using the split marker approach in which a selectable marker replaces the native gene of interest in the Guy11 genome (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wilson3">[22]</xref>). <italic>PGI1</italic>, and <italic>FBP1</italic> genes were replaced in Guy11 with the <italic>ILV1</italic> gene conferring resistance to sulphonyl urea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wilson3">[22]</xref>. <italic>TKL1</italic> was replaced in Guy11 with the <italic>Bar</italic> gene confirming resistance to bialaphos, and replaced in Guy11 H1:RFP with the <italic>ILV1</italic> gene conferring resistance to sulphonyl urea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wilson3">[22]</xref>. In all cases, primers were designed to amplify a 1 kb sequence upstream and a 1 kb sequence downstream of the gene of interest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004354.s006">Table S2</xref>). These primers were used in a first round PCR reaction, which amplified both the right and left flanks of the gene of interest. The thermocycler conditions for the first round were 1 min at 95°C initial denaturation, followed by 34 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec denaturation, 63°C for 30 sec annealing and 68°C for 1 min extension. A second round of PCR was conducted, in which each flanking region of the gene of interest was fused to one of two overlapping pieces of the <italic>ILV1</italic> or <italic>Bar</italic> gene. For the second round PCR, similar thermocycler conditions as first round were used except for a 3 min extension time. The resulting PCR products were transformed directly into protoplasts of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>. Homologous gene replacements by the <italic>ILV1</italic> or <italic>Bar</italic> resistance markers were initially selected on the basis of sulphonyl urea or bialaphhos resistance, respectively. Strains carrying homologous gene replacement of the gene of interest were identified by PCR as described by Wilson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wilson3">[22]</xref> using the oligonucleotide primers shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004354.s006">Table S2</xref>. The conditions were 2 min at 95°C initial denaturation, followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec denaturation, 63°C for 1 min annealing and 68°C for 5 min extension. A minimum of two transformants was analyzed per gene of interest. To ensure that the observed phenotype for Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> mutant strains were solely the result of <italic>TKL1</italic> deletion, a <italic>TKL1</italic> complementation vector was constructed using the primers in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004354.s006">Table S2</xref>, following the protocol outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez3">[24]</xref>, and introduced into Δ<italic>tkl1</italic> mutant strains to restore virulence.</p>

<title>Rice blast pathogenicity assays</title>
<p>Rice blast pathogenicity assays were performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez5">[37]</xref>. Briefly, three to four week old rice seedlings from a susceptible cultivar, CO-39, were spray inoculated with spore suspensions at a rate of 1×10<sup>5</sup> spores ml<sup>−1</sup> in a 0.2% gelatin (Difco) solution. Plants were placed in a growth chamber with 12 hr light/dark periods. After five days, the infected leaves were collected and scored for disease symptoms. Images of the infected leaves were taken by using an Epson Workforce scanner at a resolution of 600 dpi.</p>

<title><italic>In planta</italic> physiological analyses</title>
    <p>Live-cell imaging of fungal colonization of rice epidermal cells was achieved using detached rice leaf sheaths from the susceptible cultivar CO-39. Leaf sheaths were inoculated with fungal spores (1×10<sup>5</sup> spores ml<sup>−1</sup> in 0.20% gelatin) in the hollow interior of the sheaths as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez5">[37]</xref>. Infected sheaths were kept horizontal in a glass container with humid conditions for up to 48 hr. Starting at 24 hpi, the rice sheaths were excised and observed under a light microscope (Zeiss AxioSkop). For each strain, appressorium development from 50 spores was measured on each of three independent leaf surfaces at 24 hpi to obtain an average rate of appressorium formation. Appressorium penetration rates at 30 hpi, and IH growth rates and movement to adjacent cells at 48 hpi, were determined from fifty appressoria per treatment, repeated in triplicate, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Wilson4">[59]</xref>. IH growth rates were determined using a 4-point scale where 1 = IH length shorter than 10 µm with no branching; 2 = IH length is 10–20 µm with 0–2 branches; 3 = IH length is longer than 20 µm and/or with more than 2 branches within one cell; 4 = IH has spread to adjacent cells. Images were taken using a Nikon A1 laser scanning confocal mounted on a Nikon 90i compound microscope (software version: NIS Elements 4.13 Build914) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Microscopy Center. A 1.5 zoom Z series step (1 µm) was used in the 60× lens. Transmitted light and fluoresce for td tomato were imaged with a 561.5 nm laser. td tomato fluoresce was detected at 570–620 nm. The number of nuclei per 10 µm of IH within infected rice cells was quantified using ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij" xlink:type="simple">rsbweb.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>). For all the images, the scale was set (<italic>Analyze-Set scale</italic>) and a 10 µm line was drawn inside the hyphae (<italic>Analyze-Measure</italic>). The number of nuclei along the 10 µm line was counted for each strain at 32, 48 and 65 hpi. For each timepoint, six independent replications were analyzed.</p>

<title>Gene transcript analysis</title>
<p>Total RNA from infected leaf tissue or fungal mycelium was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit from Qiagen. For leaf RNA extractions, deteached rice leaf sheaths were inoculated with 1×10<sup>5</sup> spores ml<sup>−1</sup> of the appropriate strain, isolated at 48 hpi, frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground in a mortar with a pestle. For mycelial RNA extraction, strains were grown in CM for 48 hr before switching to Cove's minimal media containing 5 nM rapamycin, 5 mM rapamycin +5 mM ATP, or no treatment, for 16 hr following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez2">[23]</xref>. Mycelia was harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized for 24 hr. A total of 100 mg of each mycelial sample was used to perform RNA extractions. RNA from mycelia or rice leaf tissue was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) and converted to cDNA using the qScript reagents from Quantas. The cDNA reactions were performed in 20 µl reaction volumes containing 1× of qScrip cDNA Super Mix (5×) and 1–10 µg of total treated RNA. cDNA synthesis conditions were: 5 min at 25°C, 30 min at 42°C and 5 min at 85°C. After completion of cDNA synthesis, the first reaction was diluted 5 fold for PCR amplification. The resulting cDNA was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) in an Eppendorf Mastercycler ep Realplex real-time PCR system. Reactions were performed in a 25 µl reaction containing 12.5 µl 2× Quantifast SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen), 100 nM of oligonucleotide primers and 2.5 µl (≤100 ng) of cDNA. The primer sequences are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004354.s006">Table S2</xref>. Thermocycler conditions were: 5 min at 95°C initial denaturation, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec denaturation, 63°C for 30 sec annealing and 72°C for 1 min extension. Gene expression of each gene was normalized against the expression levels of either the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> actin gene (<italic>MoACT1</italic>) for <italic>in planta</italic> analysis or the <italic>M. oryzae</italic> β-tubulin gene (<italic>TUB2</italic>) for mycelial transcript analysis, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Fernandez2">[23]</xref>.

<title>Nucleotide quantification</title>
<p>The analysis of nucleotides in mycelial samples was performed using LC-MS/MS by separation of the nucleotides using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC). Samples of ground, lyophilized mycelia were weighed at about 10 mg per sample in seal proof Eppendorf tubes and extracted at 4°C with 0.6 mL of 80% MeOH/20% H<sub>2</sub>O (both LC-grade, Fisher Scientific). The samples were subjected to extraction at room temperature using a Bullet Blender Homogenizer (Averill Park, NY) after the addition of ∼100 µL of zirconia beads. The samples were then centrifuged for 10 minutes, the supernatants were removed, and a second extraction with 0.4 mL of 50% MeOH/50% H<sub>2</sub>O was performed by the same procedure. After centrifugation of the samples, aliquots were transferred into plastic LC-vials capped with sealed septums and loaded onto the LC-MS/MS system. The latter consisted on an AbSciex 4000 Qtrap Hybrid LC-MS/MS system (Framingham, MA) operating in triple quad mode using a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method. The instrument was interfaced to an Agilent LC1200 which included an autosampler with the samples thermostated at 4°C. The nucleotides were separated using a Phenomenex (Torrance, CA) Luna-NH2 column with dimensions of 2×250 mm; 100 Å pore size and 5 µm particle size. The MRM transitions were monitored in positive mode following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004354-Bajad1">[61]</xref>. The transitions were optimized with pure nucleotide solutions by infusion of 10 µM solutions directly into the mass spectrometer, followed by final ion source optimization by loop injection of those solutions. Stock solutions of ATP were prepared and quantified by their UV/visible spectra using a Cary-100 spectrophotometer with available extinction coefficients. External calibration curves were generated for 2 transitions of the nucleotide by performing injections of serial dilutions of the stock using the HILIC column interfaced with the LC-MS/MS system. Plots of integrated areas vs. Concentration in the range from 50–1000 pmoles yielded linear fits with correlation coefficients &gt;0.99. The amounts of nucleotide was estimated from the integration of the more predominant MRM transition by comparison with the calibration curve and normalized by the total weight of the samples. Reinjection of the samples after 24 hr yielded the same areas, indicating that no significant hydrolysis of the nucleotides was occurring during LC runs. All solvents were purchased from J.T. Baker and were of LC-MS Grade Purity.</p>
