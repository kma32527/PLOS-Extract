<abstract>
<p>The central event underlying prion diseases involves conformational change of the cellular form of the prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into the disease-associated, transmissible form (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>). PrP<sup>C</sup> is a sialoglycoprotein that contains two conserved N-glycosylation sites. Among the key parameters that control prion replication identified over the years are amino acid sequence of host PrP<sup>C</sup> and the strain-specific structure of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. The current work highlights the previously unappreciated role of sialylation of PrP<sup>C</sup> glycans in prion pathogenesis, including its role in controlling prion replication rate, infectivity, cross-species barrier and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> glycoform ratio. The current study demonstrates that undersialylated PrP<sup>C</sup> is selected during prion amplification in Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCAb) at the expense of oversialylated PrP<sup>C</sup>. As a result, PMCAb-derived PrP<sup>Sc</sup> was less sialylated than brain-derived PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. A decrease in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> sialylation correlated with a drop in infectivity of PMCAb-derived material. Nevertheless, enzymatic de-sialylation of PrP<sup>C</sup> using sialidase was found to increase the rate of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> amplification in PMCAb from 10- to 10,000-fold in a strain-dependent manner. Moreover, de-sialylation of PrP<sup>C</sup> reduced or eliminated a species barrier of for prion amplification in PMCAb. These results suggest that the negative charge of sialic acid controls the energy barrier of homologous and heterologous prion replication. Surprisingly, the sialylation status of PrP<sup>C</sup> was also found to control PrP<sup>Sc</sup> glycoform ratio. A decrease in PrP<sup>C</sup> sialylation levels resulted in a higher percentage of the diglycosylated glycoform in PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. 2D analysis of charge distribution revealed that the sialylation status of brain-derived PrP<sup>C</sup> differed from that of spleen-derived PrP<sup>C</sup>. Knocking out lysosomal sialidase Neu1 did not change the sialylation status of brain-derived PrP<sup>C</sup>, suggesting that Neu1 is not responsible for desialylation of PrP<sup>C</sup>. The current work highlights previously unappreciated role of PrP<sup>C</sup> sialylation in prion diseases and opens multiple new research directions, including development of new therapeutic approaches.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The central event underlying prion diseases involves conformational change of the cellular form of the prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into disease-associated, transmissible form (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>). The amino acid sequence of PrP<sup>C</sup> and strain-specific structure of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> are among the key parameters that control prion replication and transmission. The current study showed that PrP<sup>C</sup> posttranslational modification, specifically sialylation of N-linked glycans, plays a key role in regulating prion replication rate, infectivity, cross-species barrier and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> glycoform ratio. A decrease in PrP<sup>C</sup> sialylation level increased the rate of prion replication in a strain-specific manner and reduced or eliminated a species barrier when prion replication was seeded by heterologous seeds. At the same time, a decrease in sialylation correlated with a drop in infectivity of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> material produced <italic>in vitro</italic>. The current study also demonstrated that the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> glycoform ratio, which is an important feature used for strain typing, is not only controlled by prion strain or host but also the sialylation status of PrP<sup>C</sup>. This study opens multiple new directions in prion research, including development of new therapeutic approaches.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prion disease is a family of lethal, neurodegenerative maladies that can be sporadic, inheritable or transmissible in origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Prusiner1">[1]</xref>. The key molecular event underlying prion diseases involves conformational change of the normal, cellular form of the prion protein denoted PrP<sup>C</sup> into the disease-associated, self-propagating, transmissible form denoted PrP<sup>Sc</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Cohen1">[2]</xref>. Upon expression in the endoplasmic reticulum, PrP<sup>C</sup> undergoes posttranslational modifications, including attachment of up to two N-linked carbohydrates to residues Asn-181 and Asn-197 and of glycosylinositol phospholipid anchor (GPI) to the C-terminal residue Ser-231 (residue numbers are given for hamster PrP<sup>C</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Stahl1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Turk1">[5]</xref>. These posttranslational modifications are intact upon conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> into PrP<sup>Sc</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Stahl2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Bolton1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Stahl3">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Since the discovery that the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and PrP<sup>C</sup> glycans are sialylated more than 25 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Bolton1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Endo1">[8]</xref>, the potential role of sialylation in PrP<sup>C</sup> function, prion replication or its pathogenesis remains uncertain. The two N-linked carbohydrates can carry from zero to four terminal sialic acid residues each <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Endo1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Rudd1">[9]</xref>. While the PrP polypeptide has a strong positive charge, the isoelectric points (pI) of PrP<sup>C</sup> can vary significantly in part due to variation in sialylation of the glycans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-DeArmond1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Schmitz1">[15]</xref>. In glycans sialic acid residues are linked to the galactose residues at the C-6 or C-3 positions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Endo1">[8]</xref>. The detailed site-specific characterization of mouse PrP<sup>C</sup> revealed that the majority of glycans at Ans-180 have bi- and triantennary structures and are sialylated to a lesser degree than the glycans at Ans-196, a majority of which are tri- and tetraantennary structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Stimson1">[16]</xref>. While the relative proportion of bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary glycans appears to differ slightly in PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, the relative proportions of sialylated glycans was found not to be statistically different between PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Rudd1">[9]</xref>. Due to diverse structure and composition of oligosaccharides, PrP<sup>C</sup> primary structure consists of more than 400 different glycoforms. In addition to sialylation of both glycans, a single sialic acid was also found on a GPI anchor of PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Stahl1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>The ratio of di-, mono-, and unglycosylated PrP<sup>C</sup> glycoforms was found to change in favor of di-glycosylated forms in the course of neuronal differentiation, as well as upon an increase in the density of cells cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Monnet1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Novitskaya1">[18]</xref>. While diglycosylated PrP<sup>C</sup> is the dominant glycoform in adult brain, the ratio of di-, mono-, and unglycosylated PrP<sup>C</sup> glycoforms was found to vary in different brain regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Beringue1">[19]</xref>. 2D-gel electrophoresis analysis revealed variations in isoelectric points (pI) of PrP<sup>C</sup> isoforms expressed in different brain regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-DeArmond1">[10]</xref>, a variation that could presumably be attributed, at least in part, to the region-specific differences in sialylation status of glycans. Moreover, as probed by binding of 19 lectins specific to different sugars including sialic acid residues, the composition of PrP<sup>C</sup> glycans was found to change with normal aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Goh1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the last decade, numerous studies illustrated the essential role of protein sialylation in immunity including its role in cell signaling, cell activation, differentiation, and pathogen recognition (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Varki1">[21]</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Kooyk1">[23]</xref>). While sialylation of cell surface proteins is also involved in a number of functions of central nervous system, including cell differentiation, adhesion and neuronal plasticity, a big gap in understanding the role of sialylation in the normal and pathological function of PrP<sup>C</sup> exists. Sialylation of PrP<sup>C</sup> glycans was shown to prevent binding of PrP<sup>C</sup> to selectins, a family of cell surface proteins that interact with carbohydrates in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner and participate in cell adhesion and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Li1">[24]</xref>. A recent study examined the role of Siglec-1, a sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectin, expression of which is restricted to mononuclear phagocytes, in prion diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Bradford1">[25]</xref>. While mononuclear phagocytes are known to be important for prion uptake and trafficking to/within lymphoid tissue and possibly prion clearance, no effect of Siglec-1 knockout on peripheral prion disease pathogenesis was observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Bradford1">[25]</xref>. Another study examined possible involvement of GPI sialylation in neurodegeneration and found that a dense clustering of sialic acid-containing GPI anchors in the plasma membrane resulted in alteration of membrane composition and synapse damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Bate1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Bate2">[27]</xref>. The presence of sialic acid in the GPI was a requirement for the toxic effect expressed by clustering of PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules on cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Bate1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Bate2">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the current work, we examined the role of sialylation of PrP<sup>C</sup> on prion replication, a topic that has not been addressed in previous studies. We showed that charge heterogeneity in brain-derived PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> was due to sialylation and that undersialylated PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules (sialylated less than the statistical average for PrP<sup>C</sup>) were a preferable substrate for prion amplification in PMCAb. As a result, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> produced in PMCAb was less sialylated than brain-derived PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and also showed longer incubation time to disease. Consistent with the idea that sialylation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is important for prion infectivity, PMCAb material produced using desialylated PrP<sup>C</sup> was not infectious. Nevertheless, in support of the hypothesis that PrP<sup>C</sup> sialylation controls prion replication rate, de-sialylation of PrP<sup>C</sup> was found to speed up considerably PrP<sup>Sc</sup> amplification in PMCAb, with the magnitude of this effect found to be strain-dependent. Moreover, de-sialylation of PrP<sup>C</sup> reduced or eliminated a species barrier of prion amplification in PMCAb. Furthermore, 2D analysis suggested that sialylation status of brain-derived PrP<sup>C</sup> was different from that of spleen-derived PrP<sup>C</sup>. Surprisingly, the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> glycoform ratio was found to be controlled by the sialylation status of PrP<sup>C</sup>, with a decrease in PrP<sup>C</sup> sialylation levels resulting in a higher percentage of the diglycosylated glycoform in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> presumably due to a decrease in density of negatively charged groups on PrP<sup>Sc</sup> surface. The current study exposes the previously underappreciated role of PrP<sup>C</sup> sialylation in a number of key aspects of prion diseases, including its role in controlling prion replication rate, its infectivity, species barrier and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> glycoform ratio.</p>

<title>Charge heterogeneity in brain-derived PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is due to sialylation</title>
<p>In the absence of posttranslational modifications the prion protein has a strong positive charge at physiological pH. Theoretical calculation of the isoelectric point for full-length Syrian hamster PrP predicts a value 9.58. However, due to posttranslational modifications and, primarily, sialylation of N-linked glycans and the GPI anchor, the actual isoelectric points of PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules could be substantially lower than 9.58 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Pan2">[14]</xref>. In fact, because each of the two N-linked glycans contains up to four terminal sialic acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), brain-derived PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules are heterogeneous with respect to their charge as confirmed by 2D gel-electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>To test whether sialic acid residues indeed account for broad charge heterogeneity, Syrian hamster normal brain homogenate (NBH) was treated with <italic>A. ureafaciens</italic> sialidase (sialidase-treated NBH will be referred to as dsNBH), an enzyme that cleaves off terminal α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic acid residues. While in non-treated NBH PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules are spread between pI 3 and 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, top), enzymatic desialylation resulted in a substantial shift of PrP<sup>C</sup> towards pI 10. A relatively intense spot at acidic pH in dsNBH appears to be due to aggregation of PrP<sup>C</sup> at low pH. Nevertheless, this experiment illustrates that PrP<sup>C</sup> charge heterogeneity is attributable at least in part to its variable sialylation status. Consistent with a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Goh1">[20]</xref>, the diglycosylated form of PrP<sup>C</sup> in dsNBH migrated slightly faster on a 1D gel than that in non-treated NBH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Brain-derived, proteinase K (PK)-treated scrapie material from animals infected with the strains of natural or synthetic origin 263K or SSLOW <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Makarava1">[28]</xref>, respectively, also showed broad charge heterogeneity on 2D gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g001">Figure 1B,C</xref>). When compared to the 2D profile of PrP<sup>C</sup>, the charge distributions of PK-treated 263K and SSLOW were found to shift toward pI 10, despite an expected shift toward acidic pH due to proteolytic cleavage of the positively charged N-terminal region. The reason behind such a shift is difficult to explain. There is a possibility that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is less sialylated than PrP<sup>C</sup>, although no notable differences in sialylation status of PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> were found in previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Rudd1">[9]</xref>. Alternatively, a fraction of PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules could be subjected to posttranslational modifications including deamidation of Asn and Gln to Asp and Glu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Qin1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Sandmeier1">[30]</xref>, respectively, phosphorylation of serine 43 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Schmitz1">[15]</xref>, or modification of amino groups of Lys and Arg by reducing sugars resulting in advanced glycation end-products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Turk1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Choi1">[31]</xref>. Such modification would increase PrP<sup>C</sup> charge heterogeneity and account for spreading PrP<sup>C</sup> to acidic pH on 2D. Attempts to remove sialic acid in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> by treatment with sialidase were not successful, presumably due to high aggregation status of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (data not shown).</p>

<title>Undersialylated PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules are preferable substrate for prion amplification in PMCAb</title>
<p>Because previous studies showed that properties of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> change during PMCA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-GonzalezMontalban1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Daus1">[33]</xref>, we decided to compare charge distribution of PMCAb-derived and brain-derived PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. To rule out any interference of the initial brain-derived PrP<sup>Sc</sup> seeds, twenty four serial PMCAb rounds were performed with a dilution 1∶10 between rounds to produce PMCAb-derived material. Surprisingly, both 263K and SSLOW PMCAb-derived materials showed a considerable shift towards basic pI when compared to that of brain-derived PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g001">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Moreover, consistent with the previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-GonzalezMontalban1">[32]</xref>, the percentage of monoglycosylated glycoforms decreased in PMCAb-derived material comparing to those of brain-derived PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. These results suggest that (i) undersialylated PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules are selected during <italic>in vitro</italic> amplification at the expense of overersialylated PrP<sup>C</sup> (sialylated more than the statistical average for PrP<sup>C</sup>) and (ii) a decrease in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> sialylation level reduces the negative charge on PrP<sup>Sc</sup> surfaces that might lead to an increase in percentage of diglycosyated molecules incorporated into PMCAb-derived material.</p>

<title>Desialylation of PrP<sup>C</sup> increases the rate of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> amplification in a strain-dependent manner</title>
<p>To provide independent support that undersialylated PrP<sup>C</sup> is a preferable substrate for PrP<sup>Sc</sup> amplification <italic>in vitro</italic>, we tested whether desialylation of PrP<sup>C</sup> increases the rate of amplification using two alternative PMCAb formats. dsNBH prepared by treatment of NBH with <italic>A.ureafaciens</italic> sialidase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) was used as a substrate in PMCAb along with 10% non-treated NBH. In the first format, increasing dilutions of brain-derived 263K, Hyper, Drowsy and SSLOW materials were subjected to a single round of PMCAb conducted in dsNBH or NBH. The range of seed dilutions was chosen individually for each strain according to the previously published results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-GonzalezMontalban2">[34]</xref>. For the hamster-adapted strains of natural origin (263K, Hyper (HY), Drowsy), the reactions conducted in dsNBH detected approximately 10-fold higher seed dilutions than the reactions conducted in NBH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Surprisingly, for the synthetic strain SSLOW, the reaction conducted in dsNBH detected 10<sup>4</sup>-fold higher seed dilutions than the reactions conducted in NBH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).

The amplification rate is defined operationally as the highest dilution between PMCAb rounds at which amplification was still capable of compensating for the effect of dilution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-GonzalezMontalban2">[34]</xref>.

For SSLOW, the amplification rate increased more than 5×10<sup>5</sup> fold, from approximately 100-fold in NBH to at least 5×10<sup>7</sup>-fold in dsNBH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

<p>In a reverse transmission experiment, two mouse strains 22L and ME7 were subjected to amplification in hamster NBH. No signal was observed for ten serial rounds suggesting that these two strains could not cross the barrier under the current experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

<title>The level of PrP<sup>C</sup> sialylation controls PrP<sup>Sc</sup> glycoform ratio</title>
<p>Careful comparison of mouse-adapted 263K or HY revealed that the relative ratio of diglycosylated vs. monoglycosylated glycoforms was higher in dsNBH-amplified products than in NBH-amplified products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g003">Figure 3A,C</xref>). These changes suggest that the ratio of di-, mono- and unglycosylated glycoforms is not only a function of prion strain or host, but also depends on PrP<sup>C</sup> sialylation status. Due to glycan sialylation, the surface of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> particles has a dense negative charge that creates electrostatic repulsion and, presumably, limits the percentage of diglycosylated PrP<sup>C</sup> able to be recruited by PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. We propose that desialylation of PrP<sup>C</sup> eliminates electrostatic repulsion permitting a higher percentage of the diglycosylated glycoform to be accommodated.</p>
<p>To test the hypothesis that PrP<sup>C</sup> sialylation controls the ratio of glycoforms within PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, we examined the glycosylation profile of two mouse strains 22L and ME7 after their amplification in mouse NBH or dsNBH. Mouse strains were chosen because, in contrast to hamster strains, they have equal or even slightly higher percentage of monoglycosylated form relative to that of diglycosylated form. Upon amplification in dsNBH, the glycosylation profile of both 22L and ME7 changed immediately from predominantly monoglycosylated to predominantly diglycosylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). For comparison, the glycosylation profile of NBH-amplified 22L PMCAb-derived material remained very similar to that of brain-derived 22L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Due to very low amplification efficiency of ME7 in NBH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), it was difficult to compare the glycosylation profile of ME7 NBH- versus dsNBH-amplified material directly. Nevertheless, after adjusting the amount of material loaded on a gel, ME7 amplified in dsNBH showed a considerably higher ratio of di- versus mono- or unglycosylated glycoforms than those observed in ME7 NBH-amplified or brain-derived material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Similar trend was observed for both hamster strains tested (263K and SSLOW). Monoglycosylated glycoform was well represented in brain-derived and in lower proportion in PMCAb-derived material, but absent in PMCAb-derived material produced in dsNBH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>Taken together these results indicate that (i) the glycoform ratio within PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is not only controlled by the strain or host but also by the sialylation status of PrP<sup>C</sup>; (ii) a decrease in PrP<sup>C</sup> sialylation levels results in a higher percentage of diglycosylated glycoforms in PrP<sup>Sc</sup>; (iii) a shift toward diglycosylated glycoforms appears regardless of the host species, however the extent of the shift is likely determined by the strain-specific conformation.</p>

<title>The sialylation status of PrP<sup>C</sup> in brain and spleen is different</title>

Considering that desialylation of PrP<sup>C</sup> facilitates PrP<sup>Sc</sup> replication, we were interested in comparing the sialylation pattern of brain-derived and spleen-derived PrP<sup>C</sup>.</p>
<p>The 2D analysis of spleen tissues was very challenging because the level of PrP<sup>C</sup> expression in the spleen is 20 to 50-fold lower than that in the brain. Moreover, most of spleen-derived PrP<sup>C</sup> was proteolytically processed and formed a C2 fragment (residues ∼100–231) that was immunoreactive with 3F4 (epitope 109–112) and SAF-84 (epitope 160–170) antibodies, but not Ab3531 (epitope 90–102) antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004366.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This finding was in agreement with a previous report on N-terminal trimming of spleen-derived prion protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Dron1">[45]</xref>. In addition, we found that the spleen-derived C2 fragment is highly prone to aggregation, as a significant proportion of it appeared as a dimer on SDS-gels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004366.s001">Figure S1</xref>). For the above reasons, 2D analysis of brain- and spleen-derived PrP<sup>C</sup> was performed using the SAF-84 antibody that reacts with full-length PrP<sup>C</sup> as well as C1 (residues 111–231) and C2 fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

In spleen material, the distributions of charge isoforms were shifted toward basic pH for both full-length PrP<sup>C</sup> and the C2 fragment.

For PMCAb conducted in NBH, 10<sup>3</sup>-fold diluted 263K brain material was subjected to 24 serial rounds with 1∶10 dilution between rounds that resulted in a final dilution of brain material of 10<sup>−27</sup>.

On 2D gels, the charge distribution of products generated in PMCAb with dsNBH showed substantially more significant shift toward pI 10 and very little charge heterogeneity in comparison to the brain-derived or PMCAb-derived materials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).</p>

<p>The incubation time to the clinical signs of disease was 83±2 and 106±12 days in groups inoculated with brain-derived 263K and PMCAb-derived material, respectively. Two animals inoculated with PMCAb-derived material produced in dsNBH were sacrificed at 223 days p.i., and no PK-resistant material was found in their brains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004366.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). The remaining four animals from this group did not show any clinical signs and were sacrificed at 341 days p.i. No PK-resistant products were detected in their brain using 3F4 or SAF-84 antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004366.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). This result suggests that in contrast to the material produced in PMCAb with NBH, the material produced in PMCAb with dsNBH had no detectible infectivity despite being subjected to fewer PMCAb rounds.</p>
<p>Lack of infectivity of PMCAb material produced in dsNBH could be due to changes in physical properties, particularly the high sensitivity to proteolytic clearance. To examine proteolytic resistance, PMCAb products generated in NBH or dsNBH were treated with increasing concentrations of PK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Indeed, for both strains 263K and SSLOW, the products formed using desialylated substrate were substantially less resistant than PMCAb products produced in NBH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Increased proteolytic sensitivity could lead to faster clearance of such inocula.</p>
<p>In previous studies, we showed that 263K gave rise to a novel PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conformation referred to as 263K<sup>R+</sup> after 263K brain material was subjected to 12 serial PMCAb rounds in RNA-depleted NBH and then to additional 14 PMCAb rounds in NBH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-GonzalezMontalban4">[46]</xref>. While 263K<sup>R+</sup> amplified very fast <italic>in vitro</italic>, no clinical disease was observed upon inoculation of 263K<sup>R+</sup> in first and second serial passages. We were interested in testing whether lack of infectivity could be due to changes in sialylation status of 263K<sup>R+</sup>. 2D analysis revealed that the distribution of 263K<sup>R+</sup> charge isoforms was considerably shifted to the basic pI in comparison to that of PMCAb-derived 263K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Therefore, for both 263K<sup>R+</sup> and PMCAb-derived material produced in dsNBH the lack of infectivity correlates well with their low sialylation status.</p>

The lack of effect could be because (i) Neu1 is not involved in PrP<sup>C</sup> desialylation, (ii) Neu1 deficiency is compensated by other neuraminidases, or (iii) PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules are degraded very fast in lysosomes, so the relative contribution of desialylated PrP<sup>C</sup> in the total pool of PrP<sup>C</sup> is very small. To probe the possible role of Neu1 in PrP catabolism further, we also examined the sialylation profile of PrP proteolytic fragment C1 (residues ∼111–231) using SAF-84 antibody. C1 is present in large amounts in mouse brain and similar to PrP<sup>C</sup>, C1 can be found in di-, mono- and unglycosylated forms; however, the dynamics of the cellular clearance of C1 and its cellular localization could be different from those of full-length PrP<sup>C</sup>.

<p>In the current study we showed that de-sialylation of PrP<sup>C</sup> increases PrP<sup>Sc</sup> amplification rates in PMCAb. Faster amplification of desialylated substrates was likely due to removal of electrostatic repulsion between glycan moieties, which can carry up to 4 negatively charged sialic acid residues each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g007">Fig. 7A,B</xref>). This work suggests that a dense negative charge on the surface of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> particles due to sialylated glycans prevents efficient PrP<sup>Sc</sup> replication. Previous studies revealed that partial removal of N-linked glycans from PrP<sup>C</sup> using treatment with PNGase F or replacing a mixture of di-, mono- and unglicosylated PrP<sup>C</sup> with only unglicosylated form have a negative effect on PrP<sup>Sc</sup> amplification in PMCA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Makarava4">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Nishina1">[51]</xref>.

<p>Notably, the positive effect of PrP<sup>C</sup> desialylation on the replication rate, while present in all prion strains probed in this study, differed considerably in magnitude. Approximately 10–50 fold increases in the rate for strains of natural origin (263K, HY, Drowsy) was strikingly different from the 10,000-fold increase for the strains of synthetic origin. Such drastic difference between strains of the two classes indicate that steric clashes between sialic acid residues in neighboring glycans are much more substantial in synthetic strains than in strains of natural origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g007">Figure 7A,B</xref>). The elimination of the negative charges from PrP<sup>Sc</sup> surface led to a much more significant drop in polymerization energy costs for synthetic strains than natural strains.

<p>The hypothesis that electrostatic repulsion between sialic residues controls PrP<sup>Sc</sup> amplification rate explains why undersialylated PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules are preferentially recruited during <italic>in vitro</italic> amplification at the expense of oversialylated PrP<sup>C</sup>. As a result, the sialylation status of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> changes during PMCAb becoming less sialylated in comparison to brain-derived PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. In previous studies, prion specific infectivity (the ratio of the infectivity titer to the amount of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) was found to decrease gradually during amplification in serial PMCA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Klingeborn1">[52]</xref>. A decrease in specific infectivity correlates well with a drop in sialylation status of PMCAb-derive material observed here. In support of this correlation, the current study observed longer incubation time to disease for PMCAb-derived material relative to that of brain-derived PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, and a lack of clinical signs for PMCAb-derived material produced using desialylated substrate. Recent studies reported a gradual change in strain-specific secondary structure during serial amplification in PMCAb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Daus1">[33]</xref>. The relationship between changes in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conformation and sialylation status during serial PMCAb is not clear. Nevertheless, the fact that PMCAb material produced in NBH caused prion disease after 24 PMCAb rounds, whereas PMCAb material amplified in dsNBH did not cause the disease after only 7 amplification rounds, suggests that it is the loss of sialylation rather than a number of PMCAb rounds that had deleterious effect on infectivity.</p>
<p>Progression of prion diseases is determined by a number of factors including PrP<sup>C</sup>-to-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conversion rate, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> clearance, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposition sites, and relative toxicity and size of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> aggregates. Lack of clinical disease in animals inoculated with desialylated PMCAb products can be attributed in part to their high clearance rate. Consistent with this hypothesis, PMCAb materials produced with de-sialylated substrate were more sensitive to proteolytic digestion than standard PMCAb-derived material. Alternative mechanisms that involve interaction with microglia and cells of the immune system might also contribute to the lack of infectivity of PMCAb material produced in dsNBH. The mammalian immune system uses terminal sialylation of cell surface glycoproteins to identify pathogenic microorganisms to set them apart from their own cells, as microorganisms generally lack enzymes essential for sialic acid synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Varki1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Marth1">[22]</xref>. In the absence of terminal sialic residues, galactose is exposed as the terminal residue of glycans of microbial glycoproteins and serves as a signal for activating the immune response and phagocytotic clearance by macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Varki1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Marth1">[22]</xref>. If clearance of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> involves mechanisms that are involved in clearance of microorganisms, desialylated PrP<sup>Sc</sup> should be cleared much faster than sialylated PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Notably, some microbial pathogens recruit sialic acid from the host and sialylate their own glycoproteins in order to become “invisible” to the host's immune systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Kooyk1">[23]</xref>. In addition to the clearance by macrophages, recent studies revealed that glycoclusters with terminal sialic acid were stable upon injection into mice and accumulated in the spleen, while the same clusters without sialic acid residues were rapidly excreted via the urinary tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Tanaka1">[53]</xref>. It remains to be determined whether any of the above mechanisms account for lack of infectivity of desialylated PMCAb material. Nevertheless, fast clearance of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> with low level of sialylation in a brain and luck of such clearance in PMCAb could explain why the sialylation levels of brain-derived and PMCAb-derived PrP<sup>Sc</sup> are different.</p>
<p>In previous studies, prions with high infectivity titers that lacked sialylation were generated <italic>in vitro</italic> using recombinant PrP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Wang1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Deleault1">[55]</xref>. Because entire carbohydrate groups were missing in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> produced from recombinant PrP, it is unlikely that the immune system and microglia can identify these synthetic prions as potential pathogens in the same manner as it deals with desialylated PMCAb products. Consistent with this hypothesis, scrapie brain material from transgenic mice deficient in PrP glycosylation at both sites was found to be capable of infecting wild type mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Tuzi1">[56]</xref>. Notably, transgenic mice that lacked glycosyls at both sites displayed a dramatic increase in the incubation time, incomplete attack rate or lack of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Tuzi1">[56]</xref>. These results suggest that in the absence of glycosylation/sialylation, PrP<sup>C</sup> of the host does not support well the infection or the newly formed PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is not toxic.</p>
<p>That PrP<sup>C</sup> sialylation controls PrP<sup>C</sup>-to-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conversion rate has far reaching implications. A decrease in PrP<sup>C</sup> sialylation could lead to a dramatic plunge of PrP<sup>C</sup>-to-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> barriers <italic>in vivo</italic> and provide favorable conditions for (i) lowering the energy barrier of the spontaneous PrP<sup>C</sup>-to-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conversion in sporadic prion diseases; (ii) successful infection of a host or tissues with abnormally low sialylation status by low prion doses; and (iii) crossing the species barrier. In support of the last hypothesis, the current study revealed that hamster-to-mouse or mouse-to-hamster cross-seeding barriers can be reduced or abolished entirely in PMCAb, if de-sialylated PrP<sup>C</sup> is used as a substrate. While PMCAb can not predict the outcomes of transmission species barrier effects in whole organisms, our work opens an intriguing possibility that a species barrier is not only controlled by PrP amino acid sequence and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> strain-specific structure but also by PrP<sup>C</sup> sialylation status. Noteworthy, because of an irreversible mutation in the gene encoding human N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase, humans and the rest of mammalian species use different sialyc acid residues: humans produce only N-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), while other mammals produce Neu5Ac and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Varki2">[57]</xref>. The difference in sialic acid structure affects interaction of pathogenic microbes with the immune systems of humans and other mammalian species. This difference might also contribute to a previously unappreciated mechanism that controls the prion transmission barrier between mammals and humans.</p>
<p>Lymphoid organs are targeted upon cross-species transmission and appear to be more permissive than central nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Bringue1">[42]</xref>. 2D analysis of PrP<sup>C</sup> charge distribution revealed that spleen-derived PrP<sup>C</sup> was different from that of brain-derived PrP<sup>C</sup> with respect to their sialylation pattern, although precise comparison of the two tissues was complicated because of the low expression level, high tendency for aggregation and formation of the C2 proteolytic fragment by spleen-derived PrP<sup>C</sup>. Further research is needed more sensitive and accurate tools to confirm whether hyposialylation of PrP<sup>C</sup> in spleen makes the spleen more susceptible to prion infection than brain. Noteworthy, endogenous sialidase activity was found to increase in cells of the immune system, including lymphocytes and monocytes during cell activation and differentiation leading to undersialylation of cell surface glycoproteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Stamatos1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Stamatos2">[59]</xref>. Because inflammatory conditions support prion replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Heikenwalder1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Heikenwalder2">[44]</xref>, it would be interesting to examine in future studies whether inflammation-induced activation of sialidase gives rise to undersialylated PrP<sup>C</sup> and facilitates prion infection.</p>
<p>Sialylation status of glycoproteins is controlled by sialyltransferases and sialidases (also called neuraminidases), two classes of enzymes that transfer or cleave terminal sialic acids to/from glycoproteins, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Miyagi1">[60]</xref>. In mammals, there are four sialidases (Neu1, Neu2, Neu3 and Neu4) that are expressed in a tissue-dependent manner and differ with respect to their cellular localization and enzymatic properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Miyagi1">[60]</xref>. Among the four sialidases, Neu1 is the most abundant and ubiquitously distributed. It is a part of a multi-enzyme, 1200 kDa hydrolase complex, which is localized predominantly in lysosomes and to lesser extent on the cell surfaces of many tissues and organs including brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Bonten1">[61]</xref>. To test whether Neu1 is responsible for desialylation of PrP<sup>C</sup>, brain materials from <italic>Neu1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> knockout and <italic>Neu1<sup>+/−</sup></italic> mice generated in two genetic backgrounds (FVB and BL6) were analyzed using 2D gels. No significant changes in PrP<sup>C</sup> sialylation patterns were observed in <italic>Neu1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> or <italic>Neu1<sup>+/−</sup></italic> in comparison to those of corresponding wild type mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004366.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These results indicate that either Neu1 is not involved in PrP<sup>C</sup> desialylation or Neu1 deficiency is compensated by other neuraminidases. Alternatively, PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules might be degraded so fast following desialylation, that the relative contribution of desialylated PrP<sup>C</sup> in the total pool of PrP<sup>C</sup> is too small to be detected by the current approach. In either case, Neu1 might not be the right target if one wants to alter the sialylation status of PrP<sup>C</sup> <italic>in vivo</italic> for therapeutic intervention.</p>
<p>The ratio of di-, mono- and unglycosylated glycoforms within PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is believed to be an intrinsic property of a prion strain or PrP<sup>Sc</sup> subtype (in sporadic prion diseases) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Lawson1">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Hill1">[65]</xref>. As such, the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> glycoform ratio is used widely for strain typing and classification of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> subtypes in sporadic CJD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Parchi1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Hill1">[65]</xref>, and changes in the glycoform ratio are thought to be indicative of a strain mutation or strain adaptation to a new host or environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Meyerett1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Barria1">[67]</xref>. Surprisingly, the current study revealed that the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> glycoform ratio is not only controlled by prion strain or the host, but also by the sialylation status of PrP<sup>C</sup>. A decrease in PrP<sup>C</sup> sialylation levels resulted in a shift of the glycoform ratio toward diglycosylated forms at the expenses of mono- and unglycosylated glycoforms for both mouse and hamster strains. Such a relationship is explained well by the model that postulates that electrostatic repulsion created by sialic acid residues on the surface of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> particles limits the percentage of diglycosylated molecules that can be accommodated within PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004366-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). A decrease in sialylation levels reduces electrostatic repulsion leading to an increase in the percentage of diglycosylated molecules. In previous studies, treatment of prion-infected cultured cells with swainsonine, a compound that blocks synthesis of complex N-linked glycans, was shown to select minor strain variants or “mutants” resistant to swainsonine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Li2">[68]</xref>. This process was accompanied by a change in the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> glycoform ratio in favor of diglicosylated forms at the expense of monoglycosylated PrP<sup>Sc</sup> glycoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Li2">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Browning1">[69]</xref>. The extent to which swainsonine-related selection of minor variants and changes in glycoform ratio were due to lack of sialic acid residues is unclear.</p>
<p>Recent studies established a possible link between protein sialylation and Alzheimer's diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Annunziata1">[70]</xref>. Deficiency of the lysosomal sialidase Neu1 was found to lead to the spontaneous occurrence of an Alzheimer's disease-like amyloidogenic process in mice. Loss of Neu1 resulted in accumulation of an over-sialylated amyloid precursor protein in lysosomes and excessive release of Aβ peptides by lysosomal exocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004366-Annunziata1">[70]</xref>.</p>
<p>The current study opens a new avenue in prion research that might shed new light on the mechanism of prion replication and contribute to development of new therapeutic approaches. A number of sialic acid metabolic precursors or sialidase inhibitors are currently available and approved by FDA. Nevertheless, the impact and effectiveness of pharmacological intervention that target PrP<sup>C</sup> sialylation on progression of prion diseases are difficult to predict. The sialylation status of PrP<sup>C</sup> does not only control the rate of prion replication and magnitude of the species barrier, but is also likely to affect prion uptake and transport by macrophages, prion clearance rate, toxicity of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> particles, and interaction of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> with cells of the immune system and microglia. These topics have to be investigated in future studies.</p>
<p>In summary, the current work demonstrated that hyposialylated PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules are a preferable substrate for prion amplification in PMCAb. PMCAb-derived PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is less sialylated than brain-derived PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. De-sialylation of PrP<sup>C</sup> significantly speeds up PrP<sup>Sc</sup> amplification in a strain-dependent manner and significantly reduces or eliminates the species barrier. A decrease in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> sialylation correlates with a drop in infectivity of PMCAb-derived material. The sialylation status of brain-derived PrP<sup>C</sup> appears to differ from that of spleen-derived PrP<sup>C</sup>. The sialylation status of PrP<sup>C</sup> controls the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> glycoform ratio with a decrease in PrP<sup>C</sup> sialylation levels resulting in a higher percentage of the diglycosylated glycoform in PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Knocking out lysosomal sialidase Neu1 does not change the sialylation status of PrP<sup>C</sup>. The current work highlights the previously unappreciated role of PrP<sup>C</sup> sialylation in prion diseases and opens new directions in prion research, including development of new therapeutic approaches.</p>
