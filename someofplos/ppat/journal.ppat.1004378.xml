<abstract>
<p>Hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) is the mammalian transcriptional factor that controls metabolism, survival, and innate immunity in response to inflammation and low oxygen. Previous work established that generation of hypoxic microenvironments occurs within the lung during infection with the human fungal pathogen <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>. Here we demonstrate that <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> stabilizes HIF1α protein early after pulmonary challenge that is inhibited by treatment of mice with the steroid triamcinolone. Utilizing myeloid deficient HIF1α mice, we observed that HIF1α is required for survival and fungal clearance early following pulmonary challenge with <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. Unlike previously reported research with bacterial pathogens, HIF1α deficient neutrophils and macrophages were surprisingly not defective in fungal conidial killing. The increase in susceptibility of the myeloid deficient HIF1α mice to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> was in part due to decreased early production of the chemokine CXCL1 (KC) and increased neutrophil apoptosis at the site of infection, resulting in decreased neutrophil numbers in the lung. Addition of recombinant CXCL1 restored neutrophil survival and numbers, murine survival, and fungal clearance. These results suggest that there are unique HIF1α mediated mechanisms employed by the host for protection and defense against fungal pathogen growth and invasion in the lung. Additionally, this work supports the strategy of exploring HIF1α as a therapeutic target in specific immunosuppressed populations with fungal infections.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Due to the limited treatment options and severity of invasive fungal infections, a better understanding of fungal-host interactions is needed for the development of new therapies. Recent studies have implicated a role for hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) in the regulation of inflammation and host defense responses to microbial pathogens. In this study, we discover that HIF1α is required for protection and murine survival to <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> pulmonary challenge. First, we observed that nuclear HIF1α protein levels are reduced in the murine corticosteroid immunosuppressed model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, suggesting its involvement in disease outcome. We then tested the hypothesis that HIF1α is required by innate immune effector cells to control/prevent <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> growth and invasion. Surprisingly, we observed that the role of myeloid HIF1α is not to mediate innate effector cell <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> killing directly, but rather to induce and maintain a protective immune response that ensures proper effector cell recruitment and survival at the site of infection. These findings provide a better understanding of host mechanisms involved in thwarting fungal pathogenesis, have implications for host susceptibility, and reveal the potential for novel treatment strategies involving HIF1α mediated signaling in the lung in immune suppressed patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Invasive fungal infections continue to take a toll on human health with high mortality and morbidity rates and increasing frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Brown1">[1]</xref>. The filamentous fungus <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> remains the most common cause of airborne invasive fungal infections and is the primary causal agent of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Segal1">[2]</xref>. The persistence of sub-optimal IPA clinical outcomes is in part due to a less than optimal understanding of the <italic>Aspergillus</italic>-host interaction and toxicity associated with current antifungal drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Erjavec1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Howard1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Upton1">[5]</xref>. While much effort for treatment improvement is focused on identification of new antifungal drug targets and compounds, a complementary and important area of investigation is discovering therapies that improve host defense in immunocompromised patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Segal2">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Host defense to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> challenge requires a functioning innate immune response with a strong dependence on neutrophils and other innate immune system effector cells, as their deficiency or defective function is a principal clinical risk factor for IPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Hasenberg1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Mircescu1">[8]</xref>. The timing and magnitude of neutrophil recruitment is pivotal for fungal clearance as a small delay in arrival leads to disease susceptibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Bonnett1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Mehrad1">[10]</xref>. The recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection requires a calculated interplay between multiple signaling chemoattractants and receptors that remain to be fully defined in the context of IPA. Alveolar macrophages, likely the first leukocyte exposed to conidia within the lung, induce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, IL-1α/β, IL-6, GM-CSF, CXCL2, and CXCL1 in response to engagement of fungal PAMPs by macrophage PRRs such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) and dectin-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Duong1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-LeibundGutLandmann1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Mehrad2">[13]</xref>. Whether through MyD88-dependent or –independent signaling, the expression of these cytokines is mediated through the transcription factors NFκB, NFAT, and IRF's and are indispensible for proper clearance and preventing invasive disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-LeibundGutLandmann1">[12]</xref>. In particular, the CXC chemokines defined by the amino acid sequence Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR) preceding the CXC motif, macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2, murine CXCL2) and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC, murine CXCL1) are pivotal factors for neutrophil migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Addison1">[14]</xref>. Neutrophils sense and respond to these inflammatory signals through surface expressed G-protein coupled receptors, cytokine receptors, adhesions (selectins and integrins), Fc-receptors, and innate receptors (TLRs and C-type lectins) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Futosi1">[15]</xref>. Classical chemoattractant receptors expressed on the surface of neutrophils, including leukotriene B<sub>4</sub>, platelet-activating factor, and CXCR1 and CXCR2 are required for neutrophil recruitment and migration; mice deficient in these receptors are more susceptible to IPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Mehrad1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Medoff1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Garcia1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Fan1">[18]</xref>. Once recruited to the lung and upon contact with hyphae, neutrophils induce degranulation, the respiratory burst, proteases, and antimicrobial peptides leading to both pathogen and host damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Bonnett1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Diamond1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Bruns1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Grahl1">[21]</xref>. The precise molecular mechanisms involved in neutrophil lung recruitment in response to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> infection remain to be fully defined.</p>
<p>Pathogen driven inflammation and necrosis of tissue leads to development of microenvironments deficient in oxygen and nutrients, but there is a lack of knowledge regarding how host and pathogen responses to these deficiencies affect the outcome of pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Grahl1">[21]</xref>. Studies have implicated a role for hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1α), a major regulator of the mammalian response to hypoxia, in the regulation of inflammation and host defense responses to microbial pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Cramer1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Peyssonnaux1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Rupp1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Zinkernagel1">[25]</xref>. However, the role of HIF1α in immune responses to lung microbial pathogens, and particularly fungi, is largely unknown. HIF1α is a heterodimeric protein whose α-subunit is stabilized under hypoxic conditions and translocated to the nucleus where it dimerizes with the β-subunit, referred to as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT, HIF1β) protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Bruick1">[26]</xref>. Once stabilized and in the nucleus, HIF1α binds to hypoxia response elements (HREs) of target hypoxia response genes including those involved in the processes of glucose metabolism, hypoxia, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and erythropoiesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Nizet1">[27]</xref>. HIF1α is regulated by prolyl hydroxylase's (PHD) through hydroxylation of its oxygen-dependent degradation domain and directs HIF1α for ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the von Hippel-Lindau (vHL) protein when oxygen is present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Bruick1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Jaakkola1">[28]</xref>. Activation of HIF1α requires basal levels of NFκB and in turn, NFκB activation is controlled by hypoxic inactivation of PHDs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Fitzpatrick1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Rius1">[30]</xref>. Moreover, the activation of NF-κB in normoxia leads to up-regulation of HIF1α mRNA levels contrary to hypoxia increased protein levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Rius1">[30]</xref>. This interdependence between HIF1α and NFκB supports a strong link between innate immunity and metabolism in controlling disease.</p>
<p>HIF1α plays an important role in innate immunity and host defense as myeloid cells have HIF-dependency for adaptation to hypoxic and inflamed microenvironments that develop during infection. For example, HIF1α is critical for regulating bactericidal activity of phagocytes against Group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Cramer2">[31]</xref>. In other pathogens, such as Group A <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, presence and induction of HIF1α in myeloid cells, specifically macrophages and neutrophils, increases phagocytic activity and controls systemic spread of these pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Peyssonnaux1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Zinkernagel1">[25]</xref>. HIF1α has been suggested to be involved in the suppression of the angiogenic response by <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> in murine models of IA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-BenAmi1">[32]</xref>. More recently, pulmonary HIF1α mRNA levels were observed to increase in response to the human fungal pathogen <italic>Coccidioides immitis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Woelk1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although the roles of HIF1α in myeloid cell bactericidal activity and inflammatory diseases are established, the function of HIF1α in the course of lung infections and particularly with fungi remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the role of HIF1α following pulmonary challenge with <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> using a myeloid-specific lysozyme-M cre-recombinase driven HIF1α null mouse (HIF<sup>C</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Cramer1">[22]</xref>. We observed that <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> challenge strongly induces HIF1α stabilization in wild-type immune competent murine lungs and macrophages; a process that is inhibited by administration of corticosteroids. Loss of myeloid HIF1α in otherwise immune competent mice resulted in a dramatic decrease in murine survival when challenged with <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> conidia. Surprisingly, rather than a role for HIF1α in mediating fungal killing by innate effector cells as previously observed with bacterial pathogens, the reduction in murine survival was in part mediated by a reduced number of neutrophils and innate immune effector cells early following fungal challenge. Reductions in these innate effector cells in the airways and lung in the absence of HIF1α were partially due to defective induction of the chemotactic signal CXCL1. These results support a role for HIF1α in initiating the correct inflammatory signal and immune response in order to prevent pulmonary fungal growth. Therefore, modulation of HIF1α signaling in specific immunocompromised patient populations is a potential area for therapeutic development.</p>

<title>Corticosteroid treatment reduces HIF mRNA abundance and protein nuclear localization induced by <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> pulmonary challenge</title>
<p>To determine whether HIF1α stabilization is part of the pulmonary innate defense response to pathogenic fungi, levels of HIF1α mRNA abundance and protein were analyzed in an immune competent murine model of fungal bronchopneumonia initiated by <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> challenge. Consistent with a potential role for HIF1α in defense against pulmonary fungal disease, <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> induced a three-fold increase in HIF1α mRNA abundance in the lung compared to PBS inoculated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Accordingly, stabilization of HIF1α protein and increased nuclear localization occurred in murine lungs exposed to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> conidia with greater HIF1α protein levels occurring in the cytoplasmic fraction of the PBS inoculated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These results demonstrate two distinct effects of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> challenge on HIF1α in the murine lung, the increase of HIF1α mRNA and an increase in nuclear HIF1α protein localization. In addition, HIF1α stabilization occurs <italic>in vitro</italic> with cultured macrophages exposed to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> conidia and germlings in standard tissue culture conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004378.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Taken together, in a healthy immune competent murine lung, HIF1α is stabilized in response to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> pulmonary challenge, suggesting an important role for this protein in resistance to pulmonary fungal growth and subsequent infection.</p>

<p>Consequently, we next sought to determine whether activation of HIF1α was inhibited under conditions known to enhance susceptibility to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> pulmonary growth and infection. We determined the effects of corticosteroids on HIF1α stabilization in response to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Balloy1">[34]</xref>. Although the effect of steroids on host immune cells has been focused on the role of NFκB, recently, the glucocorticoid dexamethasone was found to abrogate the activation of HIF1α in response to inflammation induced hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Gaber1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Almawi1">[36]</xref>. Intriguingly, corticosteroid treatment of mice significantly reduced mRNA induction of HIF1α two-fold when exposed to conidia of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Corticosteroid treatment also resulted in decreased levels of HIF1α protein with overall reduced levels in nuclear extracts in both <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> inoculated and uninoculated mice compared to immune competent mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g001">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Reductions in nuclear levels of the p65 subunit of NFκB in the corticosteroid treated mice were also observed, which has been reported previously, validating the chosen murine model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g001">Figure 1B–C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Beutler1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Auphan1">[38]</xref>. These results suggest that reductions in HIF1α nuclear levels may contribute to susceptibility of corticosteroid treated mice to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>.</p>

<title>Myeloid HIF1α is required for survival and clearance following <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> pulmonary challenge</title>
<p>To delineate the function of HIF1α in pulmonary host defense to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, we utilized a conditional knockout system to strongly reduce HIF1α levels in the myeloid compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Cramer1">[22]</xref>. The conditional mice (HIF<sup>C</sup>) expressed Cre recombinase under the control of the lysozyme M promoter in combination with the loxP flanked exon2 of the HIF1α gene. HIF1α levels were significantly reduced in myeloid derived cells, especially macrophages and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004378.s001">Figure S1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Cramer1">[22]</xref>.

<p>Histopathology of the lungs 8 hrs post-fungal inoculation revealed no apparent difference in the number of conidia in the lungs of HIF<sup>C</sup> and littermate control mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004378.s002">Figure S2A</xref>).

However, the difference in the cellular infiltrate and inflammation was dramatically greater in the littermate controls at 12 hrs post inoculation consistent with a self-resolving fungal bronchopneumonia in these immune competent mice. At later time points post fungal inoculation, 24 and 48 hrs, littermate control mice were able to clear and contain the infection with mostly fungal debris remaining in the lung at 48 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g002">Figure 2C–D</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004378.s002">Figure S2B</xref>), while the HIF<sup>C</sup> mice develop invasive disease with uncontrolled hyphal growth.

<title>Susceptibility of HIF<sup>C</sup> mice is not due to a defect in uptake or killing by pulmonary myeloid effector cells</title>

<p>To confirm these results <italic>in vivo</italic> in the context of appropriate inflammatory cues needed for full activation of innate effector cells, we generated a fluorescent <italic>Aspergillus</italic> reporter (FLARE) strain in the CBS144.89 (CEA10) wild-type background through ectopic insertion of TdTomato driven by the <italic>A. nidulans gpdA</italic> promoter. A single ectopic insertion of the construct by Southern blotting and FLARE based viability were confirmed as previously reported for the AF293 FLARE strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004378.s003">Figure S3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Jhingran1">[40]</xref>. <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> FLARE conidia contain two fluorophores that allow leukocytes to be distinguished based on their ability to engulf and/or kill conidia. The TdTomato fluorescence expressed by the conidia is lost upon conidia death, whereas the other fluorophore (AF633 or BV421) coating the conidia is stable even at low pH allowing for tracking of the conidia within leukocytes, whether dead or alive. Utilizing the FLARE strain, which allows real time measurement of conidial uptake and viability <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, we observed that HIF1α was not required in bone marrow derived neutrophil (BMDN) mediated uptake and killing of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> conidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g003">Figure 3C–D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Jhingran1">[40]</xref>.</p>
<p>In agreement with <italic>ex vivo</italic> observations with single cell types derived from the bone marrow, inoculation of the FLARE strain into the immune competent murine model also revealed no significant difference in the ability of neutrophils or monocytes to engulf or kill conidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g003">Figure 3E–G</xref>). These surprising results demonstrate that HIF1α is not required for innate effector cell mediated killing following challenge with a fungal pathogen, which is in contrast to what has been determined with bacterial pathogens <italic>ex vivo</italic> and in skin models where HIF1α is critical for bactericidal activity of these effector cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Peyssonnaux1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Zinkernagel1">[25]</xref>.

<p>Considering that early following fungal challenge there is precedence for the requirement of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes in terms of infection outcome, we next sought to determine how HIF1α is involved in the neutrophil response following fungal challenge. During inflammation, the absence of HIF1α in effector cells is characterized by depletion of ATP stores due to a failure to switch from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism, which also results in an increase in toxic levels of ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Zhang1">[42]</xref>.

<title>The defect in pulmonary neutrophil numbers in the HIF<sup>C</sup> mice correlates to reduced chemotactic and survival signals</title>

In the HIF<sup>C</sup> mice, we observed a decrease in the level of margination on the vessel walls compared to the littermate mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Margination is a prerequisite for neutrophil transendothelial migration (TEM) from the capillaries into pulmonary tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Wagner1">[50]</xref>. There is much controversy as to the requirement for selectin-mediated rolling in order for TEM to occur, but chemokine production due to stimulation from foreign agents is known to increase margination and TEM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Haslett1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Doerschuk1">[52]</xref>.

<p>Since HIF<sup>C</sup> neutrophils were competent to migrate in response to general chemotactic factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), we next determined if there was a defect in the production of chemotactic signals during fungal pulmonary challenge that would result in decreased migration or cell survival. Utilizing the BALFs of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> challenged HIF<sup>C</sup> and littermate mice as the source of chemotactic factors in the transwell migration assay, we observed that littermate and HIF<sup>C</sup> neutrophils were defective in migration towards the HIF<sup>C</sup> BALF, but not towards littermate control BALF. This result indicated there was a missing chemotactic component in the HIF<sup>C</sup> but not littermate control BALF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). These results support a defect in chemotactic or cell survival signal production in HIF<sup>C</sup> mice following <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> pulmonary challenge.</p>
<p>Cytokine/chemokine analysis of the 12 hr BALFs from <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> challenged mice indicated decreased production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines G-CSF, IL-1α, IL-6, and TNF with no difference in production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). There was no observed difference in the production of IL-17 and IL-12p40 between the WT and HIF<sup>C</sup> challenged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). The overall response in the HIF<sup>C</sup> mice at 12 hrs post challenge did not deviate from the usual Th1 protective response with Th2 specific cytokines either unchanged (IL-10) or undetectable (IL-4, data not shown). The production of one of the major neutrophil chemotactic cytokines CXCL1 was decreased in the HIF<sup>C</sup> inoculated mice compared to littermate controls early following fungal challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). This reduction in CXCL1 correlated directly with the quantitative neutrophil defect found during early time points following fungal challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>
<p>HIF1α is directly required for CXCL1 mRNA levels as the mRNA abundance in response to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> is significantly decreased in macrophages deficient in HIF1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Whether the HIF1α regulation of CXCL1 mRNA levels is at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels remains unclear, however, analysis of the DNA sequence upstream of the CXCL1 start codon revealed multiple potential HRE elements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004378.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Importantly, the production of CXCL2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-McColl1">[53]</xref> and CXCL5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Nouailles1">[54]</xref>, other neutrophil chemokines detected by CXCR2, was not different between the WT and HIF<sup>C</sup> inoculated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Additionally, no statistically significant difference in the mRNA abundance of the receptors CXCR2, TLR4, and Dectin-1 were observed between the WT and HIF<sup>C</sup> neutrophils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004378.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). Taken together, these results support a direct role for HIF1α in production of cytokines early in the pulmonary response to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> challenge. They also support the hypothesis that the neutrophil quantitative BALF defect in the HIF<sup>C</sup> mice is due in part to decreased levels of CXCL1 and/or other pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p>

<p>This significant restoration of neutrophil migration by CXCL1 led us to examine if the addition of recombinant CXCL1 to the HIF<sup>C</sup> <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> challenged mice could restore neutrophil levels and murine survival. Previously, kinetics of neutrophil recruitment after 4 hrs by the intratracheal instillation of varying amounts of CXCL1 to the lung was demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Ridger1">[56]</xref>. Doses of 30 ng and 100 ng of CXCL1 were demonstrated to induce ∼1.5 and ∼3.5 fold increases in neutrophil recruitment over PBS treatment, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Ridger1">[56]</xref>. Based on these previously published results, we utilized a dose of 50 ng recombinant CXCL1 for intratracheal instillation. The addition of CXCL1 to the HIF<sup>C</sup> <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> challenged mice restored neutrophil numbers in the BALF back to levels of littermate inoculated mice and this restoration correlated with a significant increase in murine survival and improved outcome of infection based on the observed decrease in fungal burden and tissue damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g007">Figure 7B–C,E,F</xref>). The addition of CXCL1 also restored the inflammatory monocyte-like levels back to littermate controls, but not the CD11c+ macrophages, which was expected, as they are known to not respond to CXCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g007">Figure 7D</xref>, &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004378.s004">Figure S4</xref>). These results demonstrate a unique requirement and mechanism for HIF1α control and induction of CXCL1 in response to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> challenge in the lung.</p>
<p>Due to the multifunctional role of some cytokines in chemotactic and angiogenic responses and the observed increase in apoptosis/necrosis in the HIF<sup>C</sup> neutrophils, we determined if the addition of recombinant CXCL1 affected survival of the HIF1α deficient neutrophils. Adding physiologically relevant levels of recombinant CXCL1 to the HIF<sup>C</sup> neutrophils decreased their time-dependent level of apoptosis and necrosis <italic>ex vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004378-g007">Figure 7G</xref>). This demonstrates that CXCL1 signaling promotes and restores HIF1α neutrophil survival providing support for the requirement of HIF1α-dependent production of CXCL1.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we uncover a novel and essential function for myeloid HIF1α in protection against pulmonary <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> challenge. We present findings that myeloid HIF1α is required for initiating protective inflammatory signals and responses to control <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> growth and host tissue damage. These data strongly suggest a role for HIF1α in providing host protection to pulmonary fungal disease, provides a deeper understanding of the fungal-host interaction in the lung, identifies a new genetic factor critical for resistance to pulmonary murine fungal infections, and argues for further investigation into the therapeutic potential of HIF1α modulation for fungal disease.</p>
<p>Importantly, our results demonstrate a requirement for myeloid HIF1α in murine survival to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> pulmonary challenge. The kinetics and final outcome of murine survival in the absence of myeloid HIF1α is striking. Mortality in HIF<sup>C</sup> mice does not appear to be due to an increased inflammatory response as there is less overall inflammation in the lung at the time points analyzed in our model. Upon examination of the lung, there appears to be no gross defects in the vasculature in the HIF<sup>C</sup> mice (also suggested by BALF albumin measurement), but as infection progresses and fungal burden increases an increase in the level of damage occurring in the lung in the absence of HIF1α occurs as evidenced by the increase in LDH levels. We cannot currently rule out systemic effects of HIF<sup>C</sup> loss on murine survival, however, there was a trend toward increased fungal dissemination to the kidneys and liver in the HIF<sup>C</sup> mice that could contribute to the rapid mortality (data not shown). The increased mortality therefore is likely due to the combination of the dysregulated host response and subsequent increased fungal burden following <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> challenge.</p>
<p>Perhaps most surprisingly, given previous studies in bacterial pathosystems, HIF1α was not required for direct killing of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> conidia <italic>ex vivo</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> by innate effector cells. This is in contrast to the requirement for HIF1α in killing of multiple gram-negative and –positive bacteria in epidermal wound models of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Cramer1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Peyssonnaux1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Zinkernagel1">[25]</xref>. As HIF<sup>C</sup> neutrophils are not defective in their ability to elicit the respiratory burst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Peyssonnaux1">[23]</xref>, it is perhaps not surprising that no difference in their ability to kill <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> conidia was observed due to the known conidial susceptibility to reactive oxygen species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Philippe1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Grimm1">[58]</xref>. Additionally, we cannot rule out that the ability to kill conidia may be due to a compensatory HIF2α mechanism, as it has distinct and overlapping biological roles with HIF1α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Carroll1">[59]</xref>. Importantly, these observations demonstrate the plasticity of HIF1α regulation between different tissue microenvironments and with fungal and bacterial organisms. As the phenotypes of innate cells differ between tissues within the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Hussell1">[60]</xref>, it will be important to determine if the findings presented here occur with other pathogens such as the bacteria examined in the epidermal model that are also potent lung pathogens.</p>
<p>Though HIF1α does not seem to regulate innate mediated killing of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> conidia per se, our data suggest a required role for HIF1α in controlling <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> infection through modulation of the infection microenvironment that drives the timing, recruitment, and survival of neutrophils at early critical time points following <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> challenge. Recruitment of myeloid cells during epidermal inflammation is known to require HIF1α and is reported to be due to decreased HIF1-dependent integrin expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Cramer1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Kong1">[49]</xref>. This may partially account for the decreased margination observed in the HIF<sup>C</sup> mice challenged with <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, however, due to the increased percentage of neutrophils in the pulmonary capillary blood and the smaller size of the capillaries, the importance of integrin and selectin binding for pulmonary TEM to occur is debated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Saverymuttu1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Peters1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Doerschuk2">[63]</xref>. Once at the site of inflammation, the ability of neutrophils to remain metabolically competent in low oxygen inflammatory environments is dependent upon the induction of the glycolytic pathway directly regulated by HIF1α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Imtiyaz1">[64]</xref>. In the absence of HIF1α and oxygen, neutrophils cannot maintain high ATP levels and as a consequence, undergo apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Berger1">[65]</xref>. The delay in the time-dependent recruitment of neutrophils and/or their apoptosis is partially responsible for the increased occurrence of conidial germination in the HIF<sup>C</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Bonnett1">[9]</xref>. The HIF<sup>C</sup> <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> challenged mice also had decreased levels of CD11b+Ly6G− inflammatory monocyte-like cells, which have recently been implicated in inflammatory conditioning for neutrophil functions in the lung and conidial killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Espinosa1">[41]</xref>, and are also likely involved in the HIF<sup>C</sup> phenotype.</p>
<p>The effects of myeloid HIF1α loss on effector cell recruitment and survival appear to be driven in part by defects in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Though our data strongly support a major role for the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1 in mediating the HIF<sup>C</sup> phenotype, other neutrophil chemoattractants/receptors that are known to be involved in neutrophil recruitment during various lung infections may be involved in the HIF1α phenotype including CCL3-CCL6-/CCR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Lionakis1">[66]</xref>, C5a/C5aR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Garcia2">[67]</xref>, and LTB4/LTB4R1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Batra1">[68]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Monteiro1">[69]</xref>. However, production of the other CXCR2 ligands CXCL2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-McColl1">[53]</xref> and CXCL5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Nouailles1">[54]</xref> that are known to have roles in neutrophil recruitment were not different within the BALF of WT and HIF<sup>C</sup> mice. Untangling the signal transduction cascades mediated by HIF1α, including how it is activated in response to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> challenge, is an important future direction of this research.</p>
<p>Downstream of pathogen recognition, regulation of CXCL1 transcription through NFκB is a known mechanism for CXCL1 induction in response to inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Feng1">[70]</xref>. Given the dual regulation of multiple genes by HIF1α and NFκB, it is perhaps not surprising that a role for HIF1α in CXCL1 regulation exists. Loss of CXCL1 mRNA levels in HIF1α macrophages and the presence of putative HREs in the CXCL1 promoter further support a direct role for HIF1α in control of CXCL1 murine lung levels in response to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> challenge. Importantly, it appears that in the context of lung infection that HIF1α may play a more dominant role in myeloid activation of CXCL1 and the amplification of the response. This is based on previous demonstration that amplification of CXCL1 levels occurred only in epithelial cells that had constitutively active HIF1α over NFκB activation alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Scortegagna1">[71]</xref>. Given the decrease in IL-1 family members in the HIF<sup>C</sup> mice, we hypothesize that IL-1 signaling may be play a critical function in these signal transduction cascades. Considering that transgenic expression of CXCL1 during the course of infection improved fungal burden and survival during infection with <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Mehrad3">[55]</xref>, understanding the exact mechanism for HIF1α regulation of CXCL1 is of great importance.</p>
<p>Another important future direction is the cell compartment primarily producing CXCL1 and the effects of paracrine and autocrine signaling to regulate the observed effector cell phenotypes. Due to the ability of CXCL1 to reduce the apoptotic phenotype of the HIF<sup>C</sup> neutrophils, we hypothesize that the HIF-induced CXCL1 responses are not only required for chemotaxis of neutrophils, but also partially involved in inhibiting apoptosis during infection, perhaps consistent with the known angiogenic responses autocrine CXCL1 signaling has in epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Ueland1">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Loukinova1">[73]</xref>. Recently, the implication for the requirement of neutrophil transmigration in the transcriptional imprinting of epithelial cells was demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Campbell1">[74]</xref>. At the sites of transmigration, the depletion of oxygen by neutrophils in response to either a pathogen or tissue injury, resulted in the stabilization of HIF1α, which was required for mucosal protection and inflammatory resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Campbell1">[74]</xref>. In addition, the release and sensing of VEGF in an autocrine and paracrine manner by monocytes, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells is required for wound healing responses to restore proper tissue homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Hoeben1">[75]</xref>. Tumors are notorious for exploiting this mechanism to aid in their growth and metastasis, as demonstrated by increased tumor growth with the paracrine signaling of CXCL1 in breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Acharyya1">[76]</xref>. The increased survival of the HIF<sup>C</sup> neutrophils with exogenous CXCL1 supports the possibility that decreases in cytokine production in the HIF<sup>C</sup> mice is due to decreased paracrine signaling responses between the deficient and less abundant myeloid cells and the epithelia/endothelia of the lung.</p>
<p>A direct translational outcome from our study that warrants further investigation is the observation that corticosteroids reduced nuclear localization and gene regulation of HIF1α. Given the phenotype of the HIF<sup>C</sup> mice, it stands to reason that steroid mediated suppression of HIF1α could contribute to aspergillosis susceptibility. Our results demonstrate that steroid treatment does not inhibit overall HIF1α protein levels, but rather reduces the nuclear levels of HIF1α and p65 NFκB. The decrease in nuclear p65 NFκB and subsequent HIF1α mRNA abundance did not cause a decrease in HIF1α protein accumulation in the cytoplasm, indicating that there may be a separate corticosteroid induced NFκB-independent mechanism that hinders the HIF1α induced response to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>. Nuclear import of HIF1α is known to rely upon interactions with the septin SEPT9_i1, a product of transcript SEPT9_v1 that encodes isoform1, and importin-α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Golan1">[77]</xref>. These interactions have been established in the context of tumor and cancer progression, but the interactions during steroid treatment are unknown to our knowledge, and a mechanism for the steroid blockage of HIF1α cytoplasm-nuclear localization is not yet understood. There may also be differential posttranslational regulation of HIF1α under corticosteroid conditions that is impacting the localization, interactions, and nuclear stability of HIF1α in myeloid cells. Interestingly, corticosteroid treated mice were demonstrated to have a two-fold reduction in CXCL1 production compared to immune competent mice following <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Herbst1">[78]</xref> further supporting a role for HIF1α in steroid induced IPA susceptibility.</p>
<p>Taken together, our data support the conclusion that myeloid derived HIF1α is required by effector cells of the innate immune system to prevent <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> pulmonary infection. As control of metabolism and production of energy in inflammatory, low oxygen infection sites is dependent upon HIF1α, it is in accord that innate inflammatory responses required for clearing and preventing infection are also tied to this important transcriptional regulator. It will be of translational importance to determine if this idea is reflected in the mechanisms underlying the susceptibility of certain patients to <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> infection. Consequently, it is a high priority to determine if this response can be targeted to reverse the inactive and suppressed effects of the innate cells during IPA in the context of corticosteroid mediated immune suppression. The success of HIF1α agonists in the context of bacterial skin infections is promising in this regard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Peyssonnaux1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Zinkernagel1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Okumura1">[79]</xref>.</p>

<title>Bone-marrow derived cells</title>
<p>Bone marrow (BM) cells were eluted from tibias and femurs of 8–12 week old Littermate or HIF<sup>C</sup> mice, lysed of red blood cells, and cultured for macrophages in RP20 (RPMI, 20% FCS, 5 mM HEPES buffer, 1.1 mM L-glutamine, 0.5 U/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin) supplemented with 30% (v/v) L929 cell supernatant (source of M-CSF) or neutrophils in murine neutrophil buffer (HBSS containing 0.1% FBS and 1% glucose). BM cells for macrophages were plated in a volume of 20 ml at a density of 2.5×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in 10 ml petri dishes. The medium was exchanged on day 3. Adherent BM-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were harvested on day 6. BM- derived cells for neutrophils (BMDNs) were suspended in 3 ml 45% percoll and isolated from a 30 min 1600× g percoll gradient (top to bottom: 3 ml 45% percoll containing BM cells, 2 ml 50%, 2 ml 55%, 2 ml 62%, and 3 ml 81%) in a Sorvall Legend Mach 1.6R benchtop centrifuge, with a BIOshield 600 rotor-75002005 (Thermo Scientific). BMDNs were collected from the 62/81% border and washed with HBSS before live cell counting (95% purity, determined by cytospin). For the cytokine mRNA abundance quantifying experiments, BMDMs were incubated with <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> conidia (strain CBS144.89) in a 10∶1 (effector∶target) ratio 8 hrs. Following the incubation, cells were directly re-suspended in Trizol reagent and chloroform to extract RNA for qRT-PCR.</p>

<title>CFU and XTT assays</title>
<p>BMDMs were incubated with <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> conidia in a 9∶1 (effector∶target) ratio 3 hrs (for CFU) and 16 hrs (for XTT). Following the 3 hr incubation, non-phagocytosed conidia were washed off the cells, serially diluted onto GMM plates in duplicate, and CFU was determined. Following the 16 hr incubation, BMDMs were cold water lysed and the percent damage was quantitated by measuring the OD at 450 nm following a 1 hr incubation with XTT as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Shepardson1">[82]</xref>.</p>

<title>Cytokine analysis</title>
<p>Collected BALFs were assayed by ELISA and luminex. Commercially available ELISA kits for CXCL1 (Assay Biotech, OK-0189), CXCL2 (R&amp;D systems, DY452), and CXCL5 (R&amp;D Systems, DY443) were used according to the manufactures' instructions. The limit of detection was 15 pg/ml. Luminex analysis was carried out using Bio-Plex Pro Mouse Cytokine immunoassay on a Bio-Plex Array Reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA) according to the manufactures' instructions. Bio-Plex Manager software with five-parametric-curve fitting was used for data analysis and procedure was carried out by the Dartmouth Immunology COBRE core. For BMDM cytokine analysis of TdTomato strain, cells were washed and plated in 0.2 ml TC medium at a density of 5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml in 96 well plates and co-incubated in a 9∶1 ratio with conidia for 8 hrs. Supernatants were collected for ELISA. A commercially available ELISA kit for TNF (eBioscience, San Diego, California, US) was used according to the manufactures' instructions. The limit of detection was 15 pg/ml for TNF.</p>

<title>Migration assay</title>
<p>BMDN migration was examined using Costar Transwell plates (6.5 mm diameter insert, 3.0 µm pore size, polycarbonate membrane, Corning Inc., Corning, NY). To determine if migration was defective, 10% FBS was added to the bottom chamber of these plates (media without FBS was used as a migration control). Isolated BMDNs were counted using trypan blue (Sigma), then placed in serum free medium (SFM). Cells were resuspended at 1×10<sup>6</sup>/ml SFM and 250 µl were allowed to migrate for 3 hr at 37°C at 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Following migration, the medium in the top chamber was aspirated and the membrane gently wiped with a cotton swab to remove the cells that did not migrate. The membranes were first rinsed with PBS, the cells were then fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS and finally stained with crystal violet (Sigma). Cells that migrated across the membrane were counted. Ten random fields at 40× were counted for each condition using light microscopy. Each experiment was repeated three times. Results are expressed as mean cell migration normalized to media control ± SEM. To determine the role for cytokine signaling in migration defects, a BALF-switch experiment using BALFs from infected HIF<sup>C</sup> and littermate mice in the bottom chamber was conducted. Briefly, 250 µl BMDNs at 1×10<sup>6</sup>/ml SFM were added to the top chamber of a transwell plate with FN coated membranes with 300 µl of BALF in the bottom chamber and were allowed to migrate for 3 hr at 37°C and 5% CO2. For add-back experiments, recombinant CXCL1 (Biolegend) was added back to the BALFs from infected HIF<sup>C</sup> mice to the concentration determined by ELISA in the infected littermate BALFs (600 pg).</p>

<title>Neutrophil apoptosis</title>
<p>Neutrophil apoptosis was measured using FACs analysis by staining BMDN's incubated at 37°, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in RP20 medium with annexin V-Pacific Blue (PB) (BioLegend, #640917) and PI (millipore). Staining was performed by following the manufacturer's instructions, with minor changes. Briefly, after isolation or incubation for the specified time points, neutrophils were washed twice with ice-cold PBS with 2% FBS and then resuspended in Annexin-V binding buffer (0.01 M HEPES, pH 7.4; 140 mM NaCl; 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). Annexin V-PB and PI were added into the culture tube and incubated for 15 min prior to direct analysis with flow cytometry. Viable neutrophils were defined as negative for annexin V-PB and PI staining; apoptotic neutrophils were defined as positive for annexin V-PB staining but negative for PI staining. Cells positive for both annexin V-PB and PI staining were considered necrotic cells. Cell survival/apoptosis was expressed as a percentage of neutrophils relative to the total number of counted neutrophils. <italic>In vivo</italic> neutrophils were quantified through analysis of BALF cytospins as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Loos1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-RodriguezMuela1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004378-Eggleton1">[47]</xref>. Briefly, apoptotic neutrophils were visualized by counting the number of neutrophils with pyknotic nuclei and karyorrhexis out of the total number of neutrophils per frame. Ruffled neutrophils were also quantified and depicted neutrophil activation. Ten random frames at 8 hrs post challenge were analyzed from four HIF<sup>C</sup> and four WT mice (analyzed two separate experiments).</p>
