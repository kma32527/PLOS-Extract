<abstract>
<p>Investigations of human parasitic diseases depend on the availability of appropriate <italic>in vivo</italic> animal models and <italic>ex vivo</italic> experimental systems, and are particularly difficult for pathogens whose exclusive natural hosts are humans, such as <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic>, the protozoan parasite responsible for amoebiasis. This common infectious human disease affects the intestine and liver. In the liver sinusoids <italic>E. histolytica</italic> crosses the endothelium and penetrates into the parenchyma, with the concomitant initiation of inflammatory foci and subsequent abscess formation. Studying factors responsible for human liver infection is hampered by the complexity of the hepatic environment and by the restrictions inherent to the use of human samples. Therefore, we built a human 3D-liver <italic>in vitro</italic> model composed of cultured liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatocytes in a 3D collagen-I matrix sandwich. We determined the presence of important hepatic markers and demonstrated that the cell layers function as a biological barrier. <italic>E. histolytica</italic> invasion was assessed using wild-type strains and amoebae with altered virulence or different adhesive properties. We showed for the first time the dependence of endothelium crossing upon amoebic Gal/GalNAc lectin. The 3D-liver model enabled the molecular analysis of human cell responses, suggesting for the first time a crucial role of human galectins in parasite adhesion to the endothelial cells, which was confirmed by siRNA knockdown of galectin-1. Levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including galectin-1 and -3, were highly increased upon contact of <italic>E. histolytica</italic> with the 3D-liver model. The presence of galectin-1 and -3 in the extracellular medium stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokine release, suggesting a further role for human galectins in the onset of the hepatic inflammatory response. These new findings are relevant for a better understanding of human liver infection by <italic>E. histolytica</italic>.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The study of liver infection is based on animal models, but the animal physiology does not always reflect the reality of the human host. This is particularly true for pathogens whose exclusive natural hosts are humans, such as <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic>, the protozoan parasite responsible for amoebiasis. Here, we constructed an experimental human 3D-liver model able to reproduce the first steps of amoebic hepatic infection (barrier crossing, tissue migration and pro-inflammatory reaction). Using this 3D-liver model we were able to decipher the first stages of hepatic invasion by <italic>E. histolytica</italic> and to unravel the role played by galectin-1 and galectin-3 during amoebic hepatic adhesion and pro-inflammatory reaction. Moreover, the model enables analysis usually not possible with <italic>in vivo</italic> samples, such as the quantification of pro-inflammatory cytokines released inside the tissue microenvironment. Our 3D-liver model has the potential to bridge the gap between animal models and the reality of the human host for the study of amoebic infection and other infectious diseases of the liver.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The protozoan parasite <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> is the etiological agent of human amoebiasis. The parasite has a simple life cycle alternating the contaminating cyst and the vegetative trophozoite form. Infection occurs upon uptake of cysts with contaminated water or food and their differentiation into trophozoites, which colonize the intestine. Amoebae may breach the intestinal barrier and disseminate through the portal vein system, mainly to the liver (approximately 1% of the carriers). Hepatic amoebiasis is characterized by the induction of an inflammatory host response, the invasion of the liver parenchyma and the subsequent formation of abscesses, and leads to 70,000 deaths per year <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-WHO1">[1]</xref>. To study hepatic amoebiasis experimentally, we previously used hamsters (<italic>Mesocricetus auratus)</italic> since these are highly susceptible to <italic>E. histolytica</italic> infection and develop amoebic liver abscesses in a few days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Tsutsumi1">[2]</xref>. With this animal model we have shown that invasion of the liver parenchyma depends on amoebic adhesion to host cells through the activity of the galactose- or N-acetyl-galactosamine-inhibitable (Gal/GalNAc) lectin, the main amoebic adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Petri1">[3]</xref>. For instance, trophozoites deficient in signalling through the Gal/GalNAc lectin (HGL-2 strain) form small foci close to the endothelium which do not progress to liver abscesses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Tavares1">[4]</xref>. We also observed endothelial cell apoptosis in the vicinity of wild-type trophozoites as shortly as 1 h after infection, whereas with HGL-2 trophozoites cell death was delayed by almost 24 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Blazquez1">[5]</xref>. However, the step in which HGL-2 trophozoites are blocked is currently not known.</p>
<p>Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and hepatocytes are the major cellular components of the liver, accounting for around 80% of the liver mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Jenne1">[6]</xref>, and LSEC constitute the first hepatic barrier during liver invasion. Little is known about the transmigration of <italic>E. histolytica</italic> through the hepatic endothelium, and the molecules required for interaction with LSEC. We have previously shown that cells of a human LSEC line respond in a localized manner to the presence of <italic>E. histolytica</italic> with changes in the integrin-mediated adhesion signalling, retraction, loss of their cytoskeleton organization and focal adhesion complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Faust1">[7]</xref>. These alterations may be relevant for the disease, by facilitating the endothelial barrier crossing or altering the immuno-modulatory function of LSEC. Further studies aiming to determine the mechanisms of amoebic adhesion to LSEC and endothelium crossing have been limited by the simplicity of two-dimensional (2D) cell culture systems and the difficulty to molecularly handle the high complexity of animal models. Moreover, animal data should be extrapolated with caution to the human disease since humans being the exclusive natural hosts for <italic>E. histolytica</italic> and rodents do not reproduce human liver physiology and immunology, in particular regarding human inflammatory diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Seok1">[8]</xref>. The development of a human 3D-liver model, consisting of cells grown in 3D-scaffolds and bridging the gap between cell cultures and tissues, would provide a new alternative for the study of human hepatic amoebiasis. While in the cell biology field the utility and advantages of <italic>in vitro</italic> tissue-like models are recognized, for infectious disease studies they have been used only rarely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-March1">[9]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Petropolis1">[10]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Sainz1">[11]</xref>. Tissue-like models allow the use of primary or immortalized human cells, the control of the non-cellular components of the microenvironment and analysis by advanced imaging techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Kim1">[12]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Liu1">[13]</xref>. Major advantages of this approach are the reduction of the complexity to a controlled but still physiologically relevant level and the possibility to define the roles of individual components at the molecular level.</p>
<p>The major objective of the present work was to analyse the early stages of hepatic sinusoid invasion by <italic>E. histolytica</italic>, in a human and physiologically relevant system. We intended to examine the mechanisms of <italic>E. histolytica</italic> adhesion to and crossing of the endothelial hepatic barrier, migration to and interaction with hepatocytes, and the induction of the immune response. To accomplish this objective we elaborated a human 3D-liver model mimicking basic features of the hepatic sinusoid environment. <italic>In vivo</italic>, LSEC form monolayers devoid of a basement membrane that are separated from hepatocytes by the Disse's space containing loosely organized extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Our 3D-liver model is thus composed of an LSEC layer co-cultivated on top of a hepatocyte layer embedded in a 3D collagen-I (COL-I) matrix. We chose to use cells from established cell lines, since primary cell cultures rapidly lose their hepatic phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Dixon1">[14]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Godoy1">[15]</xref> and show higher phenotypic variability. The LSEC line used was established from non-tumour liver endothelial cell primary cultures, and cells maintain the expression of typical markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Salmon1">[16]</xref>. Huh-7 cells, though hepatoma-derived, are widely used for their phenotypic resemblance to differentiated hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Lin1">[17]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Nakabayashi1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>By analysing several physiological aspects such as sinusoid architecture, matrix porosity and barrier permeability, the presence of cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion molecules, the expression of hepatic markers, as well as the secretion of soluble molecules, we demonstrated the value of the 3D-liver model for the study of hepatic invasion by <italic>E. histolytica.</italic> Two-photon microscopy was used to monitor interactions of <italic>E. histolytica</italic> with the 3D-liver model components. We investigated the organization of the LSEC and hepatocyte layers, as well as trophozoite cytoadhesion and matrix crossing, migration and cytotoxic effects. The data showed that LSEC efficiently function as an endothelial barrier for the parasite. Trophozoites impaired in Gal/GalNAc lectin (the major adhesin) function showed reduced ability to cross the LSEC barrier, indicating an important role for this protein in the early steps of liver invasion.</p>
<p>The 3D-liver model made possible long-term incubations with <italic>E. histolytica</italic> under serum-free conditions permitting to determine the secretome (proteome of soluble factors) composition and to identify new factors released upon amoebic interaction with the human cells. The analysis identified for the first time galectin family members participating in amoebic infection. Galectin has been reported to play a role during the innate immune response to several microbial infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Bernardes1">[19]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Dhirapong1">[20]</xref>. ELISA confirmed the presence of galectins and further indicated that the hepatic cells respond to amoebic interactions by a temporally and spatially organized pro-inflammatory reaction (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-β1). Cell adhesion and binding assays revealed the participation of galectin-1 and -3 in amoebic adhesion to cells. The role of galectins was confirmed by the striking reduction of amoeba adhesion to siRNA-treated LSEC exhibiting reduced galectin-1 levels. The data reveal a dual role of human galectin-1 and -3 and describe, for the first time, the participation of human galectins in hepatic infection with <italic>E. histolytica</italic>.</p>
<p>Taken together, the 3D-liver model we established we conclude on the combined action of amoebic Gal/GalNAc lectin and human galectins during the early steps of hepatic amoebiasis.</p>

<p>The human 3D-liver model we established is composed of a monolayer of Huh-7 hepatocytic cells embedded in a 3D COL-I matrix and an LSEC monolayer plated on top of the matrix facing the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The 3D-liver model architecture organization was evaluated by two-photon microscopy and SHG visualization of the hepatic cells layers and matrix structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The matrix structure in the absence and in the presence of the hepatic cells was compared demonstrating that without cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g001">Figure 1A–B</xref>) the COL-I fibres were homogeneously distributed throughout the matrix, which was at least 900 µm high. In the presence of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g001">Figure 1D–E</xref>), the same matrix layer had a mean height of only around 500 µm and its structure changed to a heterogeneous distribution of the COL-I fibres. The SHG signals of the fibres were more intense and the matrix porosity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g001">Figure 1C and F</xref>) was significantly smaller in the vicinity of LSEC and hepatocytes, demonstrating that the hepatic cells remodel the matrix architecture of their 3D environment.</p>
<p>To quantify the ability of <italic>E. histolytica</italic> to cross the LSEC layer and to determine the rate of migration in the 3D matrix towards the hepatocytes we used a 100 µm mean distance between LSEC and hepatocytes enabling the distinction of the compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This matrix height takes into account the size of trophozoites ranging from 25 to 50 µm and their high motility (10 µm/sec). The distance between LSEC and hepatocytes diminished progressively over culture time and the most reproducible 100 µm mean distance was obtained upon three days of culture. Furthermore, to decipher the individual contributions of LSEC and hepatocytes to the response to amoebae we compared the 3D-liver model with setups lacking either the LSEC or the hepatocyte layer (schematically represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

<title>Characterization of physiological markers of the 3D-liver model</title>
<p>Several characteristics of the 3D-liver model were analysed to determine its physiological relevance. Cell morphology, growth and the presence of cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion molecules were monitored over time. By immunofluorescence microscopy, LSEC and hepatocytes were positive for ICAM-1 and integrin-β1, and hepatocytes showed a strong E-cadherin surface labelling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004381.s001">Figure S1</xref>). To evaluate LSEC barrier function, monolayer permeability was determined through the ability of 1 µm diameter fluorescent microspheres to penetrate into the compartments of the 3D-liver model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004381.s002">Figure S2</xref>). After 3 h of incubation, only 0.14% (mean number) of the beads added on top of the LSEC layer were found in the matrix beneath. In the absence of LSEC, the proportion of beads inside the matrix was comparable to the matrix without cells (around 80%) and the beads stopped at the position of the hepatocyte layer. Data show that both the LSEC and hepatocyte layer of the 3D-liver model are efficient barriers for 1 µm particles.</p>
<p>Albumin secretion and the expression of transcripts encoding several hepatocyte-specific functions were compared between the 3D-liver model (with or without LSEC) and Huh-7 standard 2D monocultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Albumin release was significantly higher in the 3D-liver model than in 2D cultures in all time points analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The hepatic markers we chose are either involved in drug metabolism as cytochromes P-450 (CYP2C19, CYP3A4) and UDP glucuronosyltransferase-1A6 (UGT1A6) or belong to the solute carrier transporter family (SLC2A1, SLC2A2). In addition, we tested expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor-α (HNF4A), a key transcription factor for many hepatic genes. The expression of most of those genes was maintained or increased between the 3- to 14d-period tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g002">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004381.s003">S3</xref>). Moreover, transcript levels for SLS2A1, SLC2A2, CYP2C19 and UGT1A6 were higher in the 3D-liver model than in the 2D culture at the 3d time-point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g002">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004381.s003">S3</xref>).</p>
<p>Together the results demonstrate that the 3D-liver model retains hepatic barrier performance and hepatocyte functionality in a more physiological environment than standard 2D cell cultures. For the experiments described below we used the 3D-liver model 3d after having started its preparation.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Protein release by hepatic cells in the 3D-liver model</title>
<p>The 3D-liver model offers the possibility to characterize the molecules released by the cells into the culture medium on its top, since in this model LSEC have lost the strong serum dependence observed in conventional cell culture conditions, i.e. they are viable, morphologically normal and express adhesion markers ICAM-1 and integrin-β1 for at least 12 h without serum (data not shown). The compounds released were identified after 3 h in fresh serum-free medium, using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004381.s005">Table S1</xref>). From the 64 human-specific proteins identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004381.s006">Table S2</xref>), the 45 proteins known for being released were grouped according to their main functions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1004381-t001">Table 1</xref>). Several components and regulators of the blood coagulation (9 proteins), the complement cascade and the innate immune response (7 proteins) were detected. Within the group of 11 plasma transporters, all exclusively or mainly synthesized in hepatic cells, well-known hepatic markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Dixon1">[14]</xref> were present, such as serum albumin, α-fetoprotein, apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, B-100, and E. In addition to COL-I, the ECM components fibronectin, nidogen-1, and fibrinogens were found, as well as several adhesion molecules. These results reveal that a variety of hepatic functions are expressed and that the hepatic cells are capable to enrich their micro-environment in the 3D-liver model.</p>

<title>Invasion of the human 3D-liver model by virulent and virulence-attenuated <italic>E. histolytica</italic></title>
<p>The 3D-liver model was used to study initial steps of liver invasion by <italic>E. histolytica</italic>. Virulent (i.e. inducing amoebic liver abscesses in the hamster) trophozoites were added to the medium on top of the 3D-liver model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The majority of the amoebae adhered to the LSEC layer. For at least 6 h, all trophozoites localized inside the 3D-liver model were migrating and their mobility indicates that cells were likely alive. Approximately 20% to 30% of the amoebae have crossed the LSEC barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) after incubation for 1.5 h or 3 h, respectively. In the absence of hepatocytes, amoebic invasion was significantly lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting the existence of attractant molecules secreted by hepatocytes or a difference in a potentially mechanical effect of the remodelled matrix. In the absence of the LSEC layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) more than 60% of the amoebae crossed the matrix after 3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) and their migration towards the hepatocytes was significantly increased resulting in a different invasion rate profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, the LSEC monolayer behaves as an efficient barrier for trophozoite invasion. Virulence-attenuated trophozoites (unable to produce liver abscesses in the hamster) adhered to LSEC in the 3D-liver model as efficiently as virulent trophozoites. However, their capacity to invade is significantly diminished, with less than 5% of the trophozoites crossing the LSEC barrier after 1.5 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) and no significant increase after 3 h of interaction (data not shown), showing their reduced ability to efficiently leap over the first barrier of liver infection, i.e. LSEC crossing.</p>

<title>Changes in the hepatic cell monolayers upon interaction with virulent <italic>E. histolytica</italic> in the 3D-liver model</title>
<p>To characterize the morphological changes in the human cell monolayers upon interaction with <italic>E. histolytica</italic>, two-photon microscopy and SHG were used. During amoebic interaction with the LSEC, local detachment of individual cells from the COL-I matrix was frequently observed at sites of amoebae crossing the layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g003">Figure 3G and H</xref>) but areas of detachment did not obviously extend over time, suggesting the existence of a replacement or repair mechanism. Trophozoites containing vesicles labelled with the cell tracker used for the hepatic cells were frequently and specifically observed in the vicinity of the LSEC layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g003">Figure 3I</xref>). Amoebic engulfment of LSEC portions could either originate from the detachment and the subsequent uptake of portions of live LSEC by trogocytosis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Ralston1">[21]</xref>, or from phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies or dead cell debris.</p>
<p>Trophozoites rapidly migrated through the matrix in the direction of the hepatocytes (150 µm in 1.5 h). The percentage of amoebae crossing the hepatocyte layer was low and phagocytic-like structures were not frequent in trophozoites having reached the hepatocytes. No detachment or formation of gaps was observed during amoebic interaction with the hepatocyte monolayer, even after 6 h of interaction. However, immunofluorescence experiments with antibodies against E-cadherin, a marker for epithelial tight junctions, revealed a clear reduction of the signal in the presence of <italic>E. histolytica</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004381.s004">Figure S4</xref>). This reduction could reveal changes in cell-cell contacts that may ultimately increase the epithelial barrier permeability and facilitate the crossing of the hepatocyte barrier after longer incubation periods.</p>

<title>Gal/GalNAc lectin-dependent <italic>E. histolytica</italic> interaction with hepatic cells in the 3D-liver model</title>
<p>Adhesion to mammalian cells is a prerequisite for the cytotoxic effects of <italic>E. histolytica</italic> and depends upon the amoebic Gal/GalNAc lectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Petri1">[3]</xref>. To examine its role in the penetration of the 3D-liver model, the effect of galactose on trophozoite invasion was first analysed. Galactose almost completely abolished the ability of virulent trophozoites to cross the LSEC layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), the proportion of amoebae being about five times lower than for the glucose control (CTL). Amoebic crossing of the COL-I matrix (tested in the setup without LSEC) was also significantly reduced in the presence of galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>To further investigate the participation of Gal/GalNAc lectin, amoebic transfectants (HGL-2 strain) were used expressing a dominant-negative form of the lectin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Tavares1">[4]</xref>. Compared to control transfectants (CTL), HGL-2 trophozoites presented a significant reduction in the LSEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) and matrix crossing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). The less pronounced effects found with HGL-2 transfectants compared with galactose could be due to the fact that in HGL-2 trophozoites only the intracellular signalling of Gal/GalNAc lectin is blocked, while the extracellular function remains unchanged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Blazquez1">[5]</xref>.</p>

<title>Protein release by hepatic cells upon <italic>E. histolytica</italic> invasion of the 3D-liver model</title>
<p>Secretome analysis was performed to identify human proteins released during amoebic hepatic invasion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004381.s005">Table S1</xref>). Products released into the medium were determined after 3 h interaction with virulent <italic>E. histolytica</italic>. Within the 139 human-specific proteins found exclusively in response to amoebae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004381.s006">Table S2</xref>) many human cytoskeletal proteins were present that likely originate from dying cells having lost their plasma membrane integrity. Note that the induction of host cell death is a main feature of <italic>E. histolytica</italic> infection. We found 24 known released or surface-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1004381-t002">Table 2</xref>), comprising further components of the complement cascade (3 proteins) and the blood coagulation system (4 proteins), and 7 proteins involved in cell/cell or cell/ECM interactions. Among the 8 proteins with functions in antigen presentation and immune responses, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (pro-inflammatory cytokine MIF), galectin-1, and galectin-3 binding protein were present. Galectin-1 is a regulator of a variety of immune responses and inflammation in host–pathogen interactions. Interestingly, galectin-1 has not been described before in the context of amoebic liver infection.</p>

<title>Growth factor and cytokine release upon interaction with <italic>E. histolytica</italic></title>
<p>The identification of the immune-regulatory proteins MIF and galectin-1 in the secreted fraction suggests that cytokines may be released upon <italic>E. histolytica</italic> interaction with the 3D-liver model, which may not have been discovered in the secretome analysis due to their low abundance and/or degradation during the procedure. To increase the sensitivity of detection, we next performed ELISA for a selection of cytokines (IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, TGF-β1), growth factors (acidic FGF, HGF and VEGF) and in addition, galectin-1 and galectin-3. Analysis was carried out for the 3D-model without and with <italic>E. histolytica</italic>, and the setup without LSEC as control. Samples were prepared from 3 distinct compartments of the 3D-liver model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The first corresponded to the medium on top (outside) of the 3D-liver model (supernatant S1, as used for the proteome approach), the second to the medium inside the 3D-liver model (supernatant S2), and the third to the matrix- and cell-associated molecules liberated after collagenase treatment of the non-soluble fraction (S3).</p>

<p>In the presence of amoebae, the VEGF release was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), but many significant modifications in the cytokine profiles occurred, concerning different compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g005">Figure 5E–F</xref>) and showing distinct kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Liver abscesses are a fatal feature of infection with <italic>E. histolytica</italic>. Host and parasite factors leading to liver infection remain largely unknown. An important question is how this parasite adheres to and crosses the liver endothelium. Based on our previous data, we hypothesized in this work that amoebic Gal/GalNAc lectin and surface-bound (or secreted) human factors are involved in this key step of liver invasion. However, the existing experimental systems (standard cell culture and animals) did not allow the molecular analyses necessary to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>We thus established a new human 3D-liver model, reproducing main characteristics of hepatic sinusoids, designed for the study of <italic>E. histolytica</italic> infection. It is the first 3D-liver model using cells of human cell lines co-cultured in a 3D COL-I scaffold in the sandwich approach. The latter was chosen to obtain a hepatic sinusoid-like organization of the cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Kim1">[12]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Kim2">[23]</xref> in a 3D architecture, which is more physiologically relevant than strategies like 2D systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-March1">[9]</xref> or 3D cellular spheroids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Sainz1">[11]</xref>. Though our 3D-liver model was built with only a single collagen type, the hepatic cells remodelled the matrix and released further ECM components and adhesive proteins, suggesting that the cells are able to diversify the initially homogenous COL-I matrix. We showed that hepatocytes maintain several physiological functions beyond the time-point used for our analyses and LSEC express the surface receptors ICAM-1 and integrin-β1, and exhibit barrier function. Major advantages of this 3D-liver model are: it is human-relevant (uses human cells); preserves a physiological context (mimics the hepatic sinusoid architecture), presents a controlled, reproducible <italic>in vitro</italic> environment.</p>
<p>One appealing perspective is the use of the 3D-liver model for the study of other important parasitic or viral hepatic infections, but specific adaptations to each of the pathogens under investigation will be required. Notably, the inclusion of other liver-resident (stellate and Kupffer cells) and immune (monocytes, macrophages, NKT cells) cell types, blood components related to the innate immune response, variations in the oxygen concentration or the application of flow to mimic mechanical forces of the blood stream can be envisaged.</p>
<p>The 3D-liver model here described was used to analyse the initial events occurring upon <italic>E. histolytica</italic> interactions with hepatic host cells. We examined human cell responses and parasite abilities to cross the endothelial barrier. We identified new key elements of amoeba-cell interactions triggering a pro-inflammatory response (the data are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004381-g010">Figure 10</xref>). For the first time, we have discovered the role of amoebic Gal/GalNAc lectin in the amoebic crossing of the endothelial barrier and a function of human galectins in amoebic adhesion. Also for the first time, we were able to characterize the spatio-temporal distribution of the components of the pro-inflammatory response against <italic>E. histolytica</italic> in a hepatic human-relevant system.</p>

<title>The human 3D-liver model, the dual role of galectin-1 and -3 during <italic>E. histolytica</italic> invasion.</title>
<p>Schematic presentation of the <italic>E. histolytica</italic> invasion mechanisms at the 3D-liver model: the early LSEC adhesion interactions and crossing as well as the induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine release into the different compartments of the 3D-liver model. The summary highlights the involvement of amoebic Gal/GalNAc lectin in the interactions with the human cells, and the dual role of human galectin-1 and 3. First, surface-associated galectins promotes amoeba adhesion during the early stages, and second, released galectins participate in the induction of the inflammatory response later in the invasion process.</p>

<p>The better characterization of the <italic>E. histolytica</italic> liver inflammatory process in the human host is an important issue for the understanding of the disease. In fact, neutrophils, macrophages and T cells have been related to the local host immune responses in human amoebic abscesses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-VenturaJuarez1">[24]</xref>, but the human host inflammatory response during <italic>E. histolytica</italic> liver invasion is poorly known. Though it appears relatively controlled over time (i.e. restricted to areas surrounding amoebae-containing foci, mainly single abscess of restricted size in humans), it likely contributes to amoebic progression, diminished liver function, and clinical complications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Joyce1">[25]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here we showed that during amoebic invasion of the 3D-liver model several cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 as well as galectin-1) accumulated in the matrix-associated fraction. Although cytokine accumulation in ECM has been documented and their retention proposed as an essential mechanism for the establishment of gradients and compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Baker1">[26]</xref>, little is known on the functions of these ECM-associated molecules. Nonetheless, ECM-associated galectin-1 is able to trigger T cell death at lower concentrations than the soluble form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-He1">[27]</xref>. In the context of liver infection, it will be interesting to examine the hypothesis that ECM-associated galectin-1 is able to trigger cell death.</p>
<p>We also demonstrated the binding of soluble galectin-1 and -3 to amoebae and the participation of native (i.e. cell surface-associated) galectin-1 and -3 in amoebic adhesion to LSEC and hepatocytes. Moreover, incubation of the 3D-liver model with recombinant galectin-1 or -3 induced an inflammatory response, similar to the response to the presence of amoebae, though less complete. From all these data we can suggest a dual role of galectin-1 and -3 during amoebic hepatic infection. First, cell surface-linked galectin-1 and -3 promote amoebic adhesion to human liver cells, and second, released galectin-1 and -3 induce a pro-inflammatory hepatic response. It is possible that parasite binding to human cells directly facilitates the galectin release, but more data will be necessary to conclude on this.</p>
<p>Amoebic liver abscess formation based on carbohydrate-sensitive adherence mechanisms is here for the first time suggested at the molecular level, by the discovery of the simultaneous participation of both parasite and human lectins in the invasion of the 3D-liver model. We do not know if amoebic Gal/GalNAc and human galectins interact in a direct way through sugar residues. In fact, galectin-1 and -3 are released into the extracellular milieu by a non-classical secretion pathway and thus seem not to be glycosylated in the ER-Golgi trafficking pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-He2">[28]</xref>. Here we found that bacterially expressed galectins (i.e. not glycosylated) bind to <italic>E. histolytica</italic> and that binding was blocked by carbohydrates (lactose), but we did not formally demonstrate that this binding depends on the lectin function of human galectins.</p>
<p>Galectin-1 and -3 are the most ubiquitously expressed and extensively studied members of the galectin family. Several immuno-regulatory functions have been discovered for galectin-1 and -3 in acute and chronic inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Liu2">[29]</xref>. For instance and of relevance for our findings, up-regulated galectin-3 expression during <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> hepatic infection seams to exert an important role in innate immunity, including a pro-inflammatory and a dendritic cell regulatory effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Bernardes1">[19]</xref>. We conclude that both, the adhesive and the immuno-regulatory role of galectin-1 and -3 we detected are relevant for the induction of the host response during liver invasion by <italic>E. histolytica</italic>.</p>

<title>Human 3D-liver model</title>
<p>A 3D COL-I matrix was polymerized in 35 mm diameter cell culture dishes (ibidi 81156) by adding 650 µl of a bovine COL-I (Nutagen, Advanced Biomatrix) solution (1.0 mg/ml) in DMEM (31966-047 Invitrogen) and incubating for up to 1 h at 37°C in a humidified incubator at 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. A suspension of hepatocytes (4×10<sup>5</sup>) from the human Huh-7 cell line (JCRB0403, JCRB cell bank) was added on top of the polymerized matrix and incubated overnight (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) in complete DMEM medium (i.e. with 10% foetal bovine serum). The medium was replaced by 150 µl of the same COL-I solution. After polymerization (40 min, 37°C) of the new COL-I matrix layer, cells (3×10<sup>5</sup>) from the LSEC line (Salmon et al., 2000) were plated on the top and the co-cultures incubated for 48 h (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) in complete DMEM with daily medium change. The setups consisting of hepatocytes (4×10<sup>5</sup>) embedded in the 2 COL-I matrix layers without LSEC or of an LSEC layer (4×10<sup>5</sup>) on the top of the COL-I sandwich without hepatocytes were prepared identically. Note that the cell densities seeded were chosen to obtain monolayers for both cell types. Two-photon microscopy (multiphoton microscope LSM710_NLO upright) was used for visualization and acquisition of 3D images. Hepatic cells were labelled with 2.5 µM red cell tracker (CMTPX, Invitrogen C34552; 30 min pre-incubation) and the COL-I matrix fibres were detected by the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal (Chameleon laser, λ = 800 nm). To decrease background fluorescence the samples were incubated 12 h prior to analysis with complete DMEM medium without phenol red (Invitrogen 31053) with NEAA (GIBCO 1140-035), 4 mM glutamine (GIBCO 25030-024) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (GIBCO 11360-039) added and images acquired in the same medium without serum.</p>

<title>COL-I matrix porosity</title>
<p>COL-I matrix fibres were visualized by two-photon microscopy using SHG. 3D images were subjected to thresholding to convert matrix pores to white and collagen fibrils to black objects. The porosity of each focal plane (1 µm) of each image was evaluated using the “analyze particle function” of ImagePro software with the black fibres being defined as the particles. A total of 3 images of 3 independent experiments were analysed.</p>

<title>Real-time quantitative PCR</title>
<p>3D-liver models, the setup without LSEC, and Huh-7 cell standard 2D cultures, cultivated for 3–14d, were independently transferred to Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at 16000 g. The pellets (containing cells and the COL-I matrix) were lysed with lysis buffer from the RNAeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen) and total RNA was prepared with the kit. Reverse transcription was performed with Superscript II enzyme (Invitrogen-18064-022) and 3 µg RNA. Reactions without reverse transcriptase added were used as controls. Real-time quantitative PCR amplification was carried out using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems) and 2 µM of the primers and a Quantstudio 7 Flex QPCR system (Applied biosystems, life technologies). Human genes and primers used are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004381.s007">Text S1</xref>. Results were normalized to human GAPDH transcript levels.

<title>Permeability of the human 3D-liver model</title>
<p>Permeability of LSEC monolayers or the COL-I matrix was determined through the ability of 1 µm diameter fluorescent carboxylate microspheres (Polysciences, 15702) to pass through the cell layer or the matrix border. After 3 h of incubation, the beads added on top of the samples, the COL-I matrix and the cells were visualized by two-photon microscopy. For each microscopic field (0.28 mm<sup>2</sup>) the x-, y- and z-position of each fluorescent bead and the z-position of the cell layers or the upper matrix border were determined using ICY software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org" xlink:type="simple">http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org</ext-link>).

<p>3D-liver models were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min. Blocking and incubation with the first antibody was (overnight in PBS containing 1% BSA) was followed by 2 h of incubation with secondary antibodies (Cell Signalling) in the same buffer. Immunostaining was performed with antibodies specific for human integrin-β1 (Millipore, 3199Z), ICAM-1 (R&amp;D systems, 11C81) and E-cadherin (Cell Signaling, 24E10).

Strains modified for the Gal/GalNAc lectin activities CTL and HGL-2 were previously published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004381-Tavares1">[4]</xref>. For invasion experiments, amoebae were collected from exponentially growing cultures and labelled with 2.5 µM green cell tracker (CMFDA, Invitrogen C2925) for 1 h. Labelled trophozoites (6×10<sup>4</sup>) were added in 2 ml serum-free DMEM without phenol red to the top of the model, the setup without LSEC or Huh-7 or the COL-I matrix without cells. After 1.5 h or 3 h of incubation, invasion was evaluated by two-photon microscopy and SHG. For each microscopic field (0.28 mm<sup>2</sup>) the x-, y- and z-position of each amoeba and the z-position of the cell layers or the upper matrix border were determined using ICY software. The rate by which amoebae cross the LSEC layer or the matrix was calculated by the quantification of the number of amoebae having a z-position bigger than the z-position of the LSEC or the matrix border and the normalization with the total number of amoebae per field. Data were represented as the percentage of amoebae able to cross. The invasion rate (i.e. migration towards hepatocytes) was obtained by considering the amoeba position relative to the position of the LSEC and the hepatocyte layer set as 0% and 100%, respectively. For each condition, 10 fields were examined, in 5 independent experiments.</p>

<title>Growth factor and cytokine quantification</title>
<p>Samples were prepared from 3 compartments of the 3D-liver model: S1 (medium on top of, i.e. outside), S2 (medium inside) and S3 (extracted from the non-soluble fraction containing cells, matrix and matrix-associated molecules). After collecting the S1 fraction, the remaining material was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and centrifuged for 5 min at 16000 g. The supernatant corresponds to the S2 fraction. The pellet containing the non-soluble components was resuspended in DMEM and incubated with collagenase (2.5 mg/ml) for 15 min at 37°C to cleave the COL-I fibres. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used as fraction S3. Cytokines and growth factors were quantified by ELISA assays (R&amp;D systems) for human IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, HGF, acidic FGF, VEGF, galectin-1 and -3.</p>
