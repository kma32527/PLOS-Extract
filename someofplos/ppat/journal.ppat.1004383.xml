<abstract>
<p>Hospitalization of the elderly for invasive pneumococcal disease is frequently accompanied by the occurrence of an adverse cardiac event; these are primarily new or worsened heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia. Herein, we describe previously unrecognized microscopic lesions (microlesions) formed within the myocardium of mice, rhesus macaques, and humans during bacteremic <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> infection. In mice, invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) severity correlated with levels of serum troponin, a marker for cardiac damage, the development of aberrant cardiac electrophysiology, and the number and size of cardiac microlesions. Microlesions were prominent in the ventricles, vacuolar in appearance with extracellular pneumococci, and remarkable due to the absence of infiltrating immune cells. The pore-forming toxin pneumolysin was required for microlesion formation but Interleukin-1β was not detected at the microlesion site ruling out pneumolysin-mediated pyroptosis as a cause of cell death. Antibiotic treatment resulted in maturing of the lesions over one week with robust immune cell infiltration and collagen deposition suggestive of long-term cardiac scarring. Bacterial translocation into the heart tissue required the pneumococcal adhesin CbpA and the host ligands Laminin receptor (LR) and Platelet-activating factor receptor. Immunization of mice with a fusion construct of CbpA or the LR binding domain of CbpA with the pneumolysin toxoid L460D protected against microlesion formation. We conclude that microlesion formation may contribute to the acute and long-term adverse cardiac events seen in humans with IPD.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia carries a documented risk for adverse cardiac events. These occur during infection and contribute to elevated mortality rates in convalescent individuals up to 1 year thereafter. We describe a previously unrecognized pathogenic mechanism by which <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia, causes direct cardiotoxicity and forms microscopic bacteria-filled lesions within the heart. Microlesions were detected in experimentally infected mice and rhesus macaques, as well as in heart sections from humans who succumbed to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Cardiac microlesion formation required interaction of the bacterial adhesin CbpA with host Laminin receptor and bacterial cell wall with Platelet-activating factor receptor. Microlesion formation also required the pore-forming toxin pneumolysin. When infected mice were rescued with antibiotics, we observed robust signs of collagen deposition at former lesion sites. Thus, microlesions and the scarring that occurs thereafter may explain why adverse cardiac events occur during and following IPD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) carries an extensively documented risk for adverse cardiac events such as congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction. A meta-analysis of 19 observational studies determined that the pooled incidence rate for cardiac complications during hospitalization for CAP is approximately 18% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-CorralesMedina1">[1]</xref>. Risk for cardiac complications is greatest immediately following the diagnosis of pneumonia; with approximately 90% of cardiac events occurring within the first 7 days and &gt;50% occurring within the first 24 h <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-CorralesMedina2">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-CorralesMedina3">[3]</xref>. In one study by Corrales-Medina <italic>et al.</italic> of cardiac complications during pneumonia, congestive heart failure occurred in 21%, arrhythmias occurred in 10%, and myocardial infarction occurred in 3% of hospitalized adults. In contrast, these distinct complications occurred in only 1.4%, 1.0% and 0.1% of outpatients, respectively, indicating that disease severity at time of hospital presentation is a significant risk factor. Cardiac complications were implicated as a direct or underlying cause of death in 27% of the pneumonia-associated deaths. Furthermore, death within 30 days of pneumonia onset was up to five times greater in patients who experienced an adverse cardiac event than among those who did not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-CorralesMedina2">[2]</xref>. Importantly, elevated mortality risk in individuals with CAP persists long-after disease resolution. Kaplan <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that the 1-year mortality rate in CAP-convalescent individuals to be 2.69-fold higher than that of the general population and 1.93-fold higher than individuals hospitalized for all other reasons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Kaplan1">[4]</xref>. <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (the pneumococcus), is the most common cause of CAP and sepsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Kumar1">[5]</xref>, and has been directly associated with an adverse cardiac event in 19.4% of 170 admitted adult patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Musher1">[6]</xref>. Thus, adverse cardiac events contribute in a significant fashion to the overall morbidity and mortality that is associated with adult bacterial pneumonia. This includes during pneumococcal infection, the most prevalent setting for CAP.</p>
<p>Acute bacterial pneumonia stresses the heart by increasing myocardial oxygen demand at a time when oxygenation is compromised by ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Pneumonia and the resulting invasive bacterial disease also raise circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which promote thrombogenesis and suppress ventricular function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-CorralesMedina4">[7]</xref>. Notably, engagement of Toll-like receptors (TLR)-2, TLR-4 and TLR-5 on cardiomyocytes by <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> peptidoglycan, <italic>E. coli</italic> lipopolysaccharide, and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> flagellin, respectively, has been shown to result in decreased cardiomyocyte contractility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Boyd1">[8]</xref>. However, studies with flagellin demonstrated that TLR engagement did not induce myocardial cell death <italic>in vivo</italic> and that these negative effects on contractility were reversible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Rolli1">[9]</xref>. Pneumococcal cell wall has been shown to enter cardiomyocytes in a Platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) dependent and TLR-2 independent manner and negatively impact contractility of intact mouse and rat hearts without death of cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Fillon1">[10]</xref>. Thus, innate immune responses to a range of bacterial components can alter cardiac function transiently but do not appear to induce death of cardiomyocytes or explain the persistence of cardiac dysfunction following acute disease.</p>
<p>As the leading cause of bacterial meningitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Hsu1">[11]</xref>, the host-pathogen interactions for <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> occurring at the blood brain barrier have been extensively studied. It is known that bacterial translocation across cerebral vascular endothelial cells is dependent on the binding of the bacterial adhesin Choline binding protein A (CbpA) to endothelial cell Laminin receptor (LR) followed by ligation of phosphorylcholine (ChoP) on the bacterial cell wall to PAFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Cundell1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Orihuela1">[13]</xref>. These interactions result in the uptake of the bacteria in vesicles and their transport to the basolateral surface of the cell so as to translocate bacteria from the blood into the brain. In the lungs and central nervous system, host cell damage is mediated by pneumolysin, a thiol-activated cholesterol dependent pore-forming toxin that is cytolytic at high concentrations but induces apoptosis at low concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Mitchell1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Farrand1">[15]</xref>. Additional tissue damage may occur as a result of TLR-2 activation by pneumococcal cell wall, which results in profuse cytokine production, immune cell infiltration, and in some instances cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Fillon1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Braun1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Yoshimura1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Herein, we explored the possibility that <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> directly damages the heart during invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and this contributes towards the occurrence of an adverse cardiac event. We describe the novel observation of non-purulent microscopic lesions (i.e. microlesion) filled with pneumococci within the myocardium and describe the molecular basis for <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> invasion of cardiac tissue and cardiomyocyte cell death within the lesion. Our findings suggest a previously unrecognized pathological aspect of pneumococcal infection that may help to explain the greater incidence of adverse cardiac events in adults with severe IPD and is potentially vaccine preventable. Decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with pneumococcal CAP in the aged is particularly critical, as by 2050, 20% of the world population will be &gt;65 years old and as such highly susceptible to CAP and IPD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Kinsella1">[18]</xref>.</p>

<title>IPD is associated with myocardial damage and alterations in cardiac electrophysiology</title>
<p>Challenge of BALB/c mice with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strain TIGR4 via the intraperitoneal route resulted in a linear increase in bacterial burden in blood from 12 h to 30 h post-infection and led to severe IPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>). To test if myocardial tissue damage was incurred during IPD, serum samples collected at various time points were tested for cardiac troponin as a function of the density of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> in the blood. A significant positive correlation was observed between bacterial titers and this clinical marker of cardiac injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>). To assess whether alterations in cardiac electrophysiology accompanied cardiac injury, we performed limb-lead ECG analysis prior to and during experimental infection. All infected mice showed initial compensatory alterations, followed by progressive aberrant changes in cardiac electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref><bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004383.s001">Fig. S1</xref></bold>). Uninfected control mice had normal cardiac electrophysiology despite repeated exposure to anesthesia through 48 h (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004383.s001">Fig. S1</xref></bold>). Electrophysiological abnormalities observed during infection included a compensatory increased and then reduced R wave indicating stronger and then weaker contractions, the development of a bifurcated P-wave and prolonged PQ and PR interval indicating disruption of the conduction path from the sino-atrial node and suggestive of multifocal atrial rhythms, and the chaotic conduction of electrical signals indicative of a damaged conduction system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C–D</bold></xref>). Of note, considerable variability in regards to the specific electrophysiological abnormality observed for each mouse was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g001"><bold>Fig. 1D</bold></xref><bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004383.s001">Fig. S1</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Cardiac microlesions form as the result of IPD</title>
<p>When the hearts from BALB/c mice with IPD were examined for pathology, we observed the presence of microscopic lesions (microlesions) randomly distributed throughout the ventricular myocardium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g002"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref>). These were distinct from myocarditis and pericarditis that were also occasionally observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g002"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>). In many instances, IPD microlesions were adjacent to cardiac blood vessels suggesting cardiac tissue invasion might have arisen by penetration or migration of the bacteria through the vascular endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g002"><bold>Fig. 2C</bold></xref>). Lesions were characterized by the expansion of the interstitium between cardiomyocytes, extracellular vacuolation, the apparent loss of cardiomyocytes, and the stark absence of infiltrating immune cells within the lesion and surrounding tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g002"><bold>Fig. 2C–F</bold></xref>).

<p>Cardiac microlesion formation also was observed in C57BL/6 mice infected with TIGR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref>), as well as in BALB/c mice infected with serotype 2 strain D39. For D39, the number of microlesions observed at 30 h (2.34±0.41 lesions/cardiac section; n = 3) was lower than TIGR4 (39.3±9.9 lesions/cardiac section; n = 8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g003"><bold>Fig. 3A</bold></xref>). This may be due to speed that the mice succumbed to D39 infection (only 3 of 9 infected mice survived to 29 h), precluding sufficient time for the microlesions to develop. Importantly, mice infected with TIGR4 via the intratracheal route also developed cardiac microlesions (6.6±3.1 lesions per cardiac section; n = 5). Thus, lesion formation occurred as a result of severe disease and was not restricted by the challenge route. In mice infected with TIGR4, microlesions were not detected in the infected kidneys, livers, or spleens (n = 12). We did however detect a single microlesion in a mouse gastrocnemius muscle at 30 h. Of note, this lesion also lacked the infiltration of immune cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004383.s002">Fig. S2</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To determine if lesions formed in non-human primates, we examined cardiac sections from 3 simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaques that had succumbed to experimental serotype 19F pneumococcal pneumonia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Nelson1">[20]</xref>. In these primate experiments, 3 of 23 macaques succumbed to IPD within one week of infection, despite antimicrobial therapy, and all 3 of these animals had cardiac lesions similar in size and with vacuolar morphology. They were distinct from those seen in the mice due to the absence of visible pneumococci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g002"><bold>Fig. 2J</bold></xref>). Two animals that were infected with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, but did not develop fulminate disease, were taken to necropsy one month after bacterial challenge due to evidence of progressive SIV disease. Cardiac lesions similar to those in macaques that died as a result of IPD were not seen in these two animals.</p>

<title>Evidence of cardiac damage during IPD in humans</title>
<p>We also examined cardiac sections from 9 adults who had succumbed to IPD despite critical care intervention. In heart sections from 2 individuals, vacuolar lesions were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g002"><bold>Fig. 2K</bold></xref>). Similar to the experimentally infected macaques that had died of IPD, these lesions also did not contain pneumococci. To determine if the absence of pneumococci in the rhesus macaque and human cardiac lesions was due to the antimicrobial therapy received during critical care, we infected mice with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and intervened 30 h post-infection with high-dose ampicillin therapy. As early as 12 h after administering the antibiotic, we observed cardiac microlesions that were now largely devoid of bacteria yet maintained their vacuolar appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g002"><bold>Fig. 2L</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Microlesion formation is dependent on host LR and PAFr and the bacterial adhesin CbpA</title>
<p><italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> translocation across the vascular endothelium requires at least two interactions: the adhesin CbpA binds to host LR and cell wall ChoP binds to host PAFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Cundell1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Orihuela2">[21]</xref>. Using CbpA deficient pneumococci and PAFR<sup>−/−</sup> mice, we observed a requirement for these two proteins in cardiac microlesion formation in BALB/c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g003"><bold>Fig. 3A</bold></xref>) and C57BL/6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref>) mice, respectively. In addition to serving as an adhesin, CbpA binds to serum Factor H and inhibits complement deposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Lu1">[22]</xref>. Thus, bacterial titers in mice infected with CbpA deficient pneumococci were lower than the WT controls, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g003"><bold>Fig. 3A</bold></xref>). To address the possibility that reduced microlesion formation was due to this lower bacterial load, mice were passively immunized with monoclonal antibody against LR prior to TIGR4 intraperitoneal infection. Antibodies against LR completely blocked cardiac microlesion formation without negatively affecting levels of pneumococci in the blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g003"><bold>Fig. 3C</bold></xref>). Likewise, no differences in bacterial titers in blood were seen in the PAFR<sup>−/−</sup> mice infected with TIGR4 versus WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g003"><bold>Fig. 3B</bold></xref>). Thus, disruption of CbpA/LR and ChoP/PAFR interactions <italic>in vivo</italic> inhibited cardiac microlesion formation.</p>
<p>Using immunofluorescent microscopy, we subsequently determined that LR and PAFR were robustly expressed by endothelial cells of vessels throughout the heart but were nearly absent in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g003"><bold>Fig. 3D</bold></xref>). This observation was consistent with the low permissiveness of HL-1 cardiomyocytes for pneumococcal invasion <italic>in vitro</italic> in comparison to RBCEC6 rat brain vascular endothelial and A549 human type 2 pneumocyte cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g003"><bold>Fig. 3E</bold></xref>). Thus, high PAFR and LR expression on vascular endothelial cells coupled with low expression on cardiomyocytes is a potential explanation for why the pneumococcus could translocate into the myocardium, yet the bulk of these bacteria were found to be extracellular in cardiac tissue.</p>

<title>Cardiomyocytes undergo cell death following exposure to pneumolysin</title>
<p>TUNEL staining indicated the presence of dead or dying cardiomyocytes during early microlesion formation and at the leading edge of mature lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g004"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>). Pneumolysin, the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> pore-forming toxin, was localized at the microlesion site using immunofluorescent microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g004"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>) as was pneumococcal cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g004"><bold>Fig. 4C</bold></xref>), the latter which we have previously shown inhibits cardiac contractility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Fillon1">[10]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies with A549, RBCEC6 and HL-1 cells indicated that pneumococcal attachment and invasion alone did not contribute in a meaningful fashion to host cell death (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004383.s003">Fig. S3</xref></bold>). Yet, <italic>in vitro</italic> HL-1 cardiomyocytes were susceptible to killing with recombinant pneumolysin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g004"><bold>Fig. 4D</bold></xref>), but not with purified cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g004"><bold>Fig. 4E</bold></xref>).

Similar to the CbpA mutant, the pneumolysin mutant did not replicate in the blood to the same levels as wild type. Thus, leaving open the possibility that the absence of microlesions was instead due to the decreased bacterial burden. Retro-orbital injection of mice with a bolus of recombinant pneumolysin (n = 2), purified pneumococcal cell wall (n = 2), or both together (n = 7), failed to cause microlesion formation after 24 h despite considerable signs of damage and inflammation within the cardiac vasculature such as the sloughing of vascular endothelial cells and the presence of adherent leukocytes.</p>

<title>Antibodies against CbpA and pneumolysin protect mice against lesion formation</title>
<p>Given the presumptive critical roles for CbpA and pneumolysin in cardiac microlesion formation, we subsequently tested whether antibodies against these proteins, derived by immunization of mice with individual and fused protein constructs, afforded protection against cardiac damage.

<title>Cardiac microlesion sites are characterized by immune cell infiltration and collagen deposition during the convalescent stage</title>
<p>We sought to determine how cardiac microlesions resolved following successful antimicrobial therapy. To do this we examined hearts from mice rescued from death with high-dose ampicillin begun at 30 h post-infection. In these mice, blood samples were culture negative 12 h after ampicillin was begun, yet the survival rate was 31.7% (n = 41). In sharp contrast to the lesions before treatment, robust immune cell infiltration at distinct focal sites distributed throughout the myocardium was now observed at day 3, 42 h following the start of antimicrobial therapy, and this persisted through day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g006"><bold>Fig. 6A</bold></xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite over a century of investigation of IPD-related complications, this is first report to suggest that pneumococcal invasion of myocardial tissue may occur during IPD. Cardiac microlesion formation can contribute to cardiac dysfunction by physical interruption of conduction pathways, cardiomyocyte death due to pneumolysin, and loss of contractility by the release of cell wall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-CorralesMedina1">[1]</xref>. Cardiac remodeling as a result of collagen deposition is also a viable explanation for the increased mortality rates that are seen in convalescent individuals who have experienced pneumococcal CAP for up to one-year post-infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Kaplan1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> cardiac microlesions were highly distinct from typical Gram-positive abscesses in that they lacked the profuse infiltration of immune cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Cheng1">[19]</xref>. They were also distinct from purulent exudate that characterizes pneumococcal infections of the lung and brain. Importantly, when we observed pericarditis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004383-g002"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>), immune cells were present, suggesting that the absence of an immune cell response may be specific to cardiomyocytes. Yet our observation of a purulent-free lesion within the calf of an infected mouse (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004383.s002">Fig. S2</xref></bold>) instead suggests that this may instead be a phenomena shared by striated muscle cells. The immune response to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is primarily driven by a TLR-2 response to peptidoglycan in cell wall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Boyd2">[35]</xref>. TLR-2 is found both in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and cardiomyocytes have been shown to respond to <italic>S. aureus</italic> peptidoglycan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Boyd1">[8]</xref>. Why the host response to cardiomyocyte infection by the pneumococcus is distinct from other tissues or during infection by other pathogens remains unclear. We postulate that the impaired host response to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is, in some fashion, tied to the maintenance of vital cardiac function, but also involves specific host-pathogen interactions that are restricted to the pneumococcus.</p>
<p>Microlesion formation was dependent on CbpA/LR and ChoP/PAFR interactions. These are the same interactions that have been implicated in translocation across the cerebral vascular endothelium during the development of pneumococcal meningitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Cundell1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Orihuela1">[13]</xref>. Most respiratory tract pathogens, including <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> and <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>, also target LR and PAFR for epithelial and endothelial cell interactions and as such may also be capable of translocation into the myocardium. We have previously shown that statin therapy protects sickle cell mice against fulminate <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection by down-regulating PAFR on endothelial cells and inhibiting the pore-forming activity of pneumolysin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Rosch1">[36]</xref>. A similar protective effect for statins against cardiac lesion formation during IPD is supported by the fact that individuals on statin therapy who were hospitalized for pneumonia have significantly better post-hospital discharge survival rates than controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Chopra1">[37]</xref>; albeit direct evidence that statins impair pneumococcal translocation into the myocardium is lacking. Importantly, the pathophysiology described here is independent of the development of the sepsis syndrome. Microlesions were detected before the onset of sepsis in our experimental model (i.e. 24 h) and this presumably required bacterial translocation into the heart at an even earlier time point. The correlation of lesion formation with duration and intensity of bacteremia, which provides the bacteria with sufficient opportunity to invade the heart, is consistent with what is known regarding the development of meningitis. High-grade persistent bacteremia without translocation of bacteria was insufficient for the development of cardiac microlesions, as evidenced by the absence of lesions in PAFR KO mice and in wildtype mice treated with monoclonal antibodies against LR, both of which had equivalent levels of bacteremia as their respective controls with microlesions. In contrast, high-grade bacteremia when sufficiently prolonged in mice expressing LR and PAFR led to more frequent and larger lesion formation, as evidenced in the Caspase-1 deficient mice. For mice infected with D39, the duration of survival following challenge was most likely insufficient.</p>
<p>Exposure of cardiomyocytes to purified pneumolysin or live <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> was not associated with release of IL-1β despite the fact that pneumolysin could trigger cell death. The lack of IL-1β indicated cardiomyocyte death was not the result of pyroptosis. Necrotic cell death, such as that caused by membrane lysis, typically elicits a strong inflammatory response due to the release of damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs). Along similar lines, necroptosis, a cell-programmed mode of necrosis, has been shown to be involved in ischemia-reperfusion injury of the heart and to be highly inflammatory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Smith1">[38]</xref> and Gram-positive pore-forming toxins other than pneumolysin have been implicated as inducers of necroptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Kennedy1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Autheman1">[40]</xref>. Yet during acute pneumococcal cardiac microlesion formation, inflammation was decidedly absent. This suggests that instead, pneumolysin triggers immune quiescent apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Kaczmarek1">[41]</xref>. Importantly, robust immune cell infiltration was detected at microlesion sites only following antimicrobial therapy. How or why the cardiomyocyte response differs between live versus killed <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is unclear. Further studies are required to begin to answer this important question.</p>
<p>Our observation of profuse immune cell infiltration accompanied by collagen deposition after antibiotic therapy, is suggestive that bacterial death after microlesion formation results in cardiac remodeling similar to what is seen following infarction. Such scars have been shown to result in permanent changes in cardiac electrophysiology and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Arenal1">[30]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004383-Wu1">[34]</xref>. Importantly, it is not clear if the class of antimicrobials used to treat IPD would have an impact on cardiac function or the size of the affected region during convalescence. Treatment with cell wall acting antimicrobials, such as ampicillin, results in the lysis of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and this would enhance the release of pneumolysin and cell wall from previously intact pneumococci. In contrast, treatment with antimicrobials that do not result in bacterial lysis, such as macrolides, would presumably limit tissue damage and potentially could improve cardiac outcomes. Along such lines, a reduction in cardiac scarring would also presumably lower the risk for mortality in convalescent individuals. Importantly, immunization of mice with a fusion protein composed of the LR binding domain of CbpA and the pneumolysin toxoid L460D conferred significant protection against microlesion formation. This result supports the critical role for these virulence determinants in microlesion formation and suggests that this form of cardiac damage is potentially vaccine preventable.</p>
<p>Based on our current data, we propose the following model for cardiac microlesion development. During severe invasive disease, pneumococci in the bloodstream engage host LR and PAFR with surface adhesin CbpA and cell wall ChoP residues, respectively. As a result bacteria are translocated into the myocardium. Due to the relative absence of LR and PAFr on cardiomyocytes, the bacteria remain predominantly extracellular, but during replication they release toxic products such as pneumolysin that kill cardiomyocytes and cell wall that inhibits contractility. For as yet unknown reasons, this does not result in the recruitment of immune cells, allowing for further replication of the bacteria and growth of the microlesions. Ultimately, this culminates in altered electrophysiological conductance or contractility that serves as a substrate for acute cardiac events. As such, we propose that during infection microlesion-mediated cardiac damage, increased myocardial demand during infection, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, and the effects of circulating pro-inflammatory factors, together lead towards an adverse outcome in those with IPD. In convalescent animals, profuse immune cell recruitment to the microlesion site occurs accompanied by collagen deposition and possibly permanent scarring. This would most likely exacerbate pre-existing cardiac related problems. Research is merited to determine the true frequency of cardiac microlesions in patients hospitalized with IPD, if modifications in antibiotic therapy improve long-term outcomes, and if prevention of cardiac damage is an indication for vaccination.</p>
