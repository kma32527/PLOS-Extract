<abstract>
<p>Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne bunyavirus causing outbreaks of severe disease in humans, with a fatality rate approaching 30%. There are no widely accepted therapeutics available to prevent or treat the disease. CCHFV enters host cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis and is subsequently transported to an acidified compartment where the fusion of virus envelope with cellular membranes takes place. To better understand the uptake pathway, we sought to identify host factors controlling CCHFV transport through the cell. We demonstrate that after passing through early endosomes in a Rab5-dependent manner, CCHFV is delivered to multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Virus particles localized to MVBs approximately 1 hour after infection and affected the distribution of the organelle within cells. Interestingly, blocking Rab7 activity had no effect on association of the virus with MVBs. Productive virus infection depended on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, which meditates the formation of functional MVBs. Silencing Tsg101, Vps24, Vps4B, or Alix/Aip1, components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway controlling MVB biogenesis, inhibited infection of wild-type virus as well as a novel pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) bearing CCHFV glycoprotein, supporting a role for the MVB pathway in CCHFV entry. We further demonstrate that blocking transport out of MVBs still allowed virus entry while preventing vesicular acidification, required for membrane fusion, trapped virions in the MVBs. These findings suggest that MVBs are necessary for infection and are the sites of virus-endosome membrane fusion.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is the cause of a severe, often fatal disease in humans. While it has been demonstrated that CCHFV cell entry depends on clathrin-mediated endocytosis, low pH, and early endosomes, the identity of the endosomes where virus penetrates into cell cytoplasm to initiate genome replication is unknown. Here, we showed that CCHFV was transported through early endosomes to multivesicular bodies (MVBs). We also showed that MVBs were likely the last organelle virus encountered before escaping into the cytoplasm. Our work has identified new cellular factors essential for CCHFV entry and potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention against this pathogen.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne virus causing outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic disease in humans, with a fatality rate approaching 30%. The virus is endemic to much of Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Africa, although recent studies have detected CCHFV in ticks collected in Spain, indicating an expanding geographic distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-EstradaPena1">[1]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Vorou1">[4]</xref>. Despite the high mortality and global distribution of CCHFV, there are presently no licensed therapeutics to prevent or treat the disease.</p>
<p>CCHFV belongs to the family <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>. It is an enveloped, pleomorphic virus, possessing a tripartite single-stranded RNA genome in negative orientation. The small segment, S, encodes the nucleocapsid protein N, whose role is to encapsidate viral RNA during transcription and genome replication. The large segment, L, encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which associates with N to form the viral polymerase complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Schmaljohn1">[5]</xref>. The medium segment, M, contains the gene for the viral glycoprotein polyprotein, which is co-translationally cleaved and post-translationally modified to generate two structural transmembrane proteins, Gc and Gn, and non-structural proteins GP38 and NSm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Schmaljohn1">[5]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Erickson1">[9]</xref>. The Gc and Gn form complexes on the virion surface and are responsible for binding to the cellular receptors and subsequent fusion of the viral envelope with host membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Bente1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-BertolottiCiarlet1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>Virus entry into the cell is the first and critical step in the virus replication cycle. The host receptor of CCHFV has not been identified, although a recent study has suggested that nucleolin plays a necessary role in virus entry and that Gc is essential for binding to the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Xiao1">[12]</xref>. Virus uptake occurs through clathrin-dependent endocytosis and requires cholesterol and low pH to productively infect host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Garrison1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Simon1">[14]</xref>. An earlier study implicated Rab5, a small GTPase critical for vesicular transport from the plasma membrane to early endosomes, as important for infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Garrison1">[13]</xref>. The lack of the involvement of Rab7, which controls vesicular trafficking to late endosomes, in infection and the requirement for pH 6.0 to inactivate the virus led to speculation that virus fusion with host membranes takes place at early endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Garrison1">[13]</xref>, although direct localization of virus to the early endosomes was not demonstrated. Little else is known about trafficking of the virus along the endocytic route or the identity of cellular compartments where the fusion of the viral and host membranes takes place. Here, we investigated the mechanism of transport of CCHFV through the host cell in more detail.</p>

<title>CCHFV traffics through early endosomes in a Rab5-dependent manner</title>
<p>CCHFV enters cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Garrison1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Simon1">[14]</xref>. The virus was also previously shown to require Rab5 during infection of cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Garrison1">[13]</xref>, suggesting a requirement for trafficking through early endosomes. However, localization of the virus to early endosomes has not been demonstrated, and so we examined uptake and trafficking kinetics of virus particles in more detail. Human adenocarcinoma cell line, SW13, has been demonstrated to support CCHFV replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Flick1">[15]</xref> and, therefore, was utilized in our study. SW13 cells were incubated with CCHFV for up to 120 min and then stained with antibodies to virus nucleoprotein N and early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1), which localizes exclusively to early endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Dumas1">[16]</xref>. CCHFV is known to enter cells within 90 min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Simon1">[14]</xref>, and therefore the N protein signal was likely to represent incoming virions. We observed that virus localized to early endosomes as early as 15 min and reached steady state by 30 min, with approximately 10% of the virions being EEA1-associated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Our results directly confirm that CCHFV is trafficked through early endosomes during infection.</p>

<title>CCHFV traffics through early endosomes in a Rab5-dependent manner.</title>
<p>(A) SW13 cells were incubated with CCHFV for indicated times. Then, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and treated with CellMask blue dye (grey) to stain the cytoplasm and nucleus, anti-N antibody (virus, red), and anti-EEA1 antibody (early endosomes, green). Images were obtained as Z-stacks, and three-dimensional (3D) images of cells were generated to assess colocalization between virus and endosomes. The percentages of virus particles localizing to early endosomes were counted in 20 cells in each sample, and averages and standard deviations are shown. Arrowheads point to examples of CCHFV N-EEA1 colocalization (yellow). (B) SW13 cells were transfected with either pLenti-eGFP or pRab5A-DN. After 24 h, cells were incubated with CCHFV for 30 min, fixed, and stained with anti-N antibody (red), anti-EEA1 antibody (green), and CellMask blue dye (grey). eGFP-expressing cells are pseudocolored white (right panels). Images were generated and analyzed as described in (A). The edge of the cell at lower left is indicated by a dashed line. (C) SW13 cells transfected with either pLenti-eGFP or pRab5A-CA were incubated with CCHFV for 24 h. Subsequently, samples were fixed and treated with anti-N antibody (red) to detect infected cells and CellMask blue dye (grey) to define cell boundaries. Samples were imaged as described above. The number of eGFP-expressing cells that became infected (expressing N) is shown at right. The results are averages of three independent experiments, and the bars represent standard deviations.</p>

<p>To test whether Rab5A facilitates CCHFV movement to early endosomes, we expressed a fusion of enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and the dominant negative form of the Rab5A containing a substitution of serine to asparagine at position 34 (DN Rab5A) in SW13 cells and then infected the cells with wild-type virus. The control included cells expressing eGFP. The DN Rab5A arrests transport of vesicles from the cell surface due to a block in maturation of early endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Bucci1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Li1">[18]</xref> and, therefore, we expected to observe accumulation of virions near the cell surface. Indeed, cells expressing the DN, but not eGFP, showed virions localized close to the plasma membrane, in EEA1-positive structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). This finding confirms that CCHFV is transported in a Rab5A-dependent manner.</p>
<p>While expression of DN Rab5A inhibits formation of early endosomes, expression of a constitutively active mutant of Rab5A containing a substitution of glutamine to leucine at position 79 (CA Rab5A) enhances the formation of the endosomes, making the vesicles appear drastically enlarged, but also compromises maturation of and cargo transport to later endosomal compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Stenmark1">[19]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Lozach1">[22]</xref>. To determine whether CCHFV entry involves passage through endosomal compartments downstream of early endosomes, SW13 cells expressing a fusion of eGFP and CA Rab5A or eGFP alone as a control were infected with CCHFV for 24 h to allow virus to establish replication sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Garrison1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Simon1">[14]</xref>. The N distribution in eGFP-expressing cells was similar to that seen in untransfected cells and likely represented pools of newly expressed protein due to virus gene expression and genome replication. In contrast, in CA-expressing cells, N staining was limited and likely represented incoming virus trapped in endosomes, consistent with that described in the above figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, left and middle panels). The percentages of eGFP-expressing cells that were infected with CCHFV were found to be 47% and 1% in control eGFP- and CA-expressing cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, right panel). These data demonstrate that productive infection by CCHFV requires trafficking through early endosomes as well as downstream endosomal compartments.</p>

<title>CCHFV localizes to MVBs during infection</title>
<p>Over time, cellular cargo from early endosomes can become concentrated on intraluminal vesicles within vacuolar domains, generating multivesicular bodies (MVBs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Woodman1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Gruenberg1">[24]</xref>. Several viruses traffic through the MVB and depend on its sorting machinery during early steps in infection, including influenza A virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Lassa fever virus (LASV), and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Pasqual1">[25]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Luyet1">[28]</xref>. To test whether CCHFV localizes to MVBs during entry, we incubated SW13 cells with virus for up to 120 min and then stained them for N and tetraspanin protein CD63, which is enriched in MVBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Kobayashi1">[29]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, virus localized to CD63-positive structures, presumably MVBs, starting at 60 min post-infection. This association appeared to accelerate over time until a major redistribution of the organelle occurred within the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). CD63 is also known to contain a putative lysosomal targeting signal and to colocalize with late endosomal/lysosomal-associated membrane proteins Lamp1 and Lamp2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Metzelaar1">[30]</xref>, suggesting that a fraction of this protein is in late endosomes and lysosomes. To address the question whether CCHFV localizes to these endosomal compartments during infection, we infected cells with CCHFV for 120 min and then stained them with antibodies detecting either <italic>(i)</italic> N and ALG-2-interacting protein X/apoptosis-linked-gene-2-interacting protein 1 (Alix/Aip1), which associates with MVBs to coordinate vesicle formation and biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Sadoul1">[31]</xref>; or <italic>(ii)</italic> N and Lamp1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, 35% of CCHFV particles localized with Alix/Aip1, while only 3% of virions were found in Lamp1-positive endosomes. While it is possible that the Lamp1-positive endosomes represent late endosomes or lysosomes, the relevance of the association to virus infection mechanism is questionable since Rab7, which controls vesicular transport out of MVBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Vanlandingham1">[32]</xref>, does not play a role in CCHFV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Garrison1">[13]</xref>. Thus, our findings demonstrate that virus is transported through MVBs during early stages of infection.</p>

<p>Several studies have reported that Rab7 controls cargo movement out of early endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Vonderheit1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Zerial1">[34]</xref>, while others indicate the function of this Rab later in the endocytic pathway, from MVBs to lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Vanlandingham1">[32]</xref>. To test whether Rab7A has a role in virus transport to MVBs in SW13 cells, we overexpressed the DN form of Rab7A, containing a substitution of threonine to asparagine at position 22 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Feng1">[35]</xref>, in cells, challenged them with virus, and then tested for localization of virus to CD63-positive compartments. As a control, we transfected cells with a plasmid expressing eGFP alone. The overexpression of the DN or eGFP had no effect on localization of the virus to the MVBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), suggesting that Rab7A does not control virus transport between early endosomes and MVBs. Because Rab7 was shown as not important for CCHFV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Garrison1">[13]</xref>, our findings also indicate that CCHFV might not traffic beyond MVBs.</p>

<title>CCHFV infection requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity</title>
<p>According to our data, CCHFV colocalizes with and redistributes MVBs during early stages of infection. It is unclear, however, whether there is a functional significance of this association. To study CCHFV infection in more detail, we generated CCHFV that incorporated a minigenome segment encoding the red fluorescent protein mKate2 (CCHFV-mKate2). BsrT7/5 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Buchholz1">[36]</xref> were transfected with the minigenome construct and plasmids expressing viral N and polymerase and then mock-infected or infected with wild-type CCHFV. The recombinant virus was collected 48 h after infection and inoculated onto fresh SW13 cells to assess packaging of the minigenome. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, inoculation of the supernatant from the cells infected with the virus resulted in the expression of the mKate2 gene in the cells, demonstrating the generation of recombinant CCHFV-mKate2.

To assess the effect of pharmacological inhibitors on CCHFV-mKate2 infection, SW13 cells were pretreated with one of the following: bafilomycin A (20 nM), EIPA (10 ÂµM), nystatin (100 ÂµM), dynasore (200 ÂµM), or CPZ (10 Âµg/mL). After 1 h, cells were incubated with the virus in the presence of the drug for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were fixed, stained with the Hoechst 33342 dye, and imaged.

<title>Endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) regulators control CCHFV infection</title>
<p>MVB biogenesis critically depends on a group of class E vacuolar protein sorting (Vps) regulators, which form three large hetero-oligomeric complexes within the ESCRT pathway and are designated ESCRT-I, II, and III. The cargo, which is initially selected in early endosomes, is passed on to ESCRT-I on MVB membranes, where tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101) protein plays a central role in recognizing the cargo and activating ESCRT-II and subsequently ESCRT-III complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Fader1">[45]</xref>. ESCRT-associated ATPases Vps4A and B are important in the later stages of the MVB pathway by catalyzing disassembly of ESCRT-III complex, a step critical for sorting cargo into intraluminal vesicles within MVBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Bishop1">[46]</xref>.

<title>ESCRT regulators control CCHFV entry</title>
<p>Our results indicate that CCHFV is transported through MVBs and that productive virus infection requires MVB biogenesis. However, it is unclear what step of the viral lifecycle is regulated by the MVB pathway; it could be entry and/or viral gene expression and genome replication. Pseudotyped virus particles have become a valuable tool for analysis of entry mechanism of numerous viruses. However, to date, no pseudotype system has been described for CCHFV. To generate VSV pseudotyped with CCHFV glycoproteins (VSV-CCHFVG), we expressed CCHFV glycoprotein precursor G or Î²-galactosidase (control) in 293FT cells and then inoculated the cells with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus glycoprotein (VEEV GP) pseudotyped VSV stock encoding a firefly luciferase reporter gene (VSV-VEEVGP). VSV-VEEVGP was used because of its ability to grow to high titers and because residual VEEV GP is short-lived in target cells (our unpublished data). As VSV core is replicated and new viral particles are assembled, the overexpressed CCHFV glycoproteins would become incorporated into nascent virions. Î²-galactosidase-expressing cells served as an indicator of VSV-VEEVGP carryover in the media of the inoculated cells since no viral glycoprotein was expressed there. The pseudotyped virus was collected 48 h after addition of VSV-VEEVGP and added to monolayers of SW13 cells to assess titers by measuring luciferase activity. The intensity of luminescence in cells incubated with VSV-CCHFVG was typically 8 times higher than in cells incubated with the control supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) To generate VSV pseudotyped with CCHFV G (VSV-CCHFVG), 293FT cells were transfected with either pBabe-Î²Gal (control) or pC-G. After 18 h, the cells were inoculated with a VSV-VEEVGP stock for 6 hours. The supernatants were collected 48 h after infection and incubated with SW13 cells to determine the titer of the pseudotyped virus. Luciferase activity was measured 24 h later. (B) A neutralization assay was performed by incubating VSV-CCHFVG or VSV-VEEVGP with anti-Gc antibody at the indicated dilutions for 30 min. The pseudotype-antibody mixtures were subsequently added to SW13 cells, and luciferase activity was measured 24 h later. (C) SW13 cells were preincubated with DMSO or bafilomycin A (20 nM) for 1 h and then challenged with VSV-CCHFVG in the presence of the drug. Luciferase activity was measured after 24 h.

<p>Since Gc is crucial for CCHFV binding to the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Xiao1">[12]</xref>, we performed a neutralization test using a polyclonal anti-Gc antibody to assess whether functional CCHFV glycoprotein complexes were present on the pseudovirion surface. VSV-CCHFVG or VSV-VEEVGP was incubated with the antibody, and the pseudotype-antibody mixtures were transferred onto SW13 cells. Luciferase activity was measured 24 h later. The antibody treatment inhibited VSV-CCHFVG, but not VSV-VEEVGP infection in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the pseudovirus entry was glycoprotein-mediated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>CCHFV infection is pH-dependent, requiring endosomal acidification during entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Garrison1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Simon1">[14]</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>).

<p>We next used VSV-CCHFVG to verify whether the MVB pathway had a role in CCHFV entry. SW13 cells depleted of cellular Tsg101, Vps24, Vps4B, or Alix/Aip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>) were incubated with VSV-CCHFVG.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Entry into host cells is the first committal step in any virus replication cycle. In this study, we characterized the entry route taken by CCHFV after internalization from the plasma membrane. We confirmed previous work that the virus was transported through early endosomes in a Rab5A-dependent manner, but additionally showed that MVBs play an important role in productive infection. Virions localized to and reorganized the intracellular distribution of MVBs, and ESCRT pathway-related proteins involved in MVB formation and function were needed for entry. We also determined that endocytic trafficking out of MVBs did not affect CCHFV infection and that blocking endosome acidification resulted in accumulation of virions in the MVBs. These findings indicate that during entry the MVB is a late stage destination of CCHFV particles and is likely the site from which they are released into the cell cytoplasm to initiate genome replication.</p>

However, actual localization of virions to early endosomes was not previously demonstrated. In the current study, we used microscopy to track movement of CCHF virions through endocytic compartments. Virions were found in early endosomes starting at 15 min post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), although we do not exclude the possibility that the virus localized to early endosomes at even earlier time points, as has been demonstrated for influenza A virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Lakadamyali1">[59]</xref>. The increase in percentage of viral particles in the endosomes at later time points, however, indicates that CCHFV may enter host cells at a slower pace, reflecting potential differences in endosomal kinetics in different cell lines, markers used to identify the endosomes, or viral entry mechanisms.

CCHFV infection requires AP-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Garrison1">[13]</xref>, while influenza A virus infection does not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Lakadamyali1">[59]</xref>, suggesting that these two viruses may utilize different sets of early endosomes for uptake into cells.</p>
<p>Cargo sorted in early endosomes can be progressively shuttled along the endocytic pathway toward MVBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Woodman1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Gruenberg1">[24]</xref>. Several viruses, including those entering cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, have been demonstrated to localize to MVBs and depend on the sorting protein complex, ESCRT, during infection. Influenza A virus, LASV, and LCMV appear to pass through MVBs on their way toward late endosomes, while VSV needs the compartment to release genome into the cytoplasm for replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Pasqual1">[25]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Luyet1">[28]</xref>. For CCHFV, MVB involvement seems to be distinct. We found that CCHF virions localized to and dramatically affected intracellular distribution of MVBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). ESCRT regulators controlled CCHFV entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g004">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g005">5D</xref>), and trafficking beyond MVBs appeared to be dispensable for virus infection and entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g002">Figs. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g006">6</xref>), suggesting that MVBs might be the last endosomal compartment before virus exit into the cytoplasm. The small number of virus particles in Lamp1-positive compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) raised a question about a role, if any, of late endosomes or lysosomes in CCHFV infection. Since Rab7 controls vesicular transport out of MVBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Vanlandingham1">[32]</xref> and is not essential for virus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Garrison1">[13]</xref>, it is unlikely that localization of virus particles to compartments downstream of MVBs has functional significance. Additionally, a small amount of Lamp1 is found in MVBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Wasano1">[61]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Finzi1">[63]</xref>, so CCHF virions might have localized to these Lamp1-positive MVBs. We detected virus particles by staining infected cells with an anti-N antibody, and therefore our data indicate that MVBs may be where virus-endosome fusion takes place or where, similarly to VSV, nucleocapsids are released into the cytoplasm, or both, provided membrane fusion and nucleocapsid release are concurrent. Because our data also showed that blocking vesicular acidification resulted in inhibition of a novel CCHFV pseudotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>), affecting glycoprotein function and therefore virus entry, and accumulation of N, presumably virions, in MVBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g007">Figs. 7A and 7C</xref>), MVBs are likely the site of fusion of the viral and host membranes. The role of the MVB redistribution during CCHFV infection is unclear and requires additional examination, but, to our knowledge, was not observed during infection by any other virus.</p>
<p>While we identified Rab5A as a factor controlling CCHFV traffic from the plasma membrane to early endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), it is less clear how virions are transported from early endosomes to MVBs. Rab7 is known to localize on a variety of organelles including early and late endosomes, MVBs, and lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Vanlandingham1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Hutagalung1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Stenmark2">[65]</xref>. It is unclear, however, whether Rab7 regulates transport between these organelles or is itself trafficked via each to reach compartment(s) it functions on. A study by Vanlandingham and Ceresa showed that silencing Rab7 expression had no effect on MVB biogenesis, but instead affected lysosomal degradation of the epidermal growth factor in complex with its receptor by blocking transport/fusion between MVBs and lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Vanlandingham1">[32]</xref>. Our current observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>) are in agreement with those findings, demonstrating that for CCHFV, Rab7A does not contribute to early endosome-MVB transport and therefore does not control CCHFV infection, which is consistent with previously reported data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Garrison1">[13]</xref>. Additional factors controlling the traffic between early endosomes and MVBs remain to be identified.</p>
<p>The formation of internal vesicles within MVB compartments requires class III PI3K, whose cellular role is to facilitate synthesis of PI3P lipid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Pasqual1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-FernandezBorja1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Futter1">[43]</xref>. Protein sorting machinery, which selects cargo in early endosomes, is thought to directly bind early endosome-specific PI3P <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Gaullier1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Gillooly1">[67]</xref> and subsequently recruit ESCRT complexes to MVB membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Bache1">[68]</xref>. Inhibition of PI3K activity, therefore, results in formation of defective MVB compartments devoid of internal vesicles and thus missorted cargo. In the presence of PI3K inhibitor LY294002, CCHFV infection was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), most likely due to the block in MVB biogenesis. In addition to its role in vesicle formation and membrane trafficking, PI3K pathway is known to regulate various cellular functions such as survival and proliferation, glucose transport, superoxide production, and motility through actin rearrangement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Cantley1">[69]</xref>. There is mounting evidence that the PI3K pathway is often disregulated in human tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Fruman1">[70]</xref>. To date, several promising PI3K inhibitors have entered human trials for cancer treatments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Xu1">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-National1">[72]</xref>. Our current results that the PI3K pathway is also required for CCHFV infection could be exploited for development of new therapeutics to treat the CCHFV disease.</p>
<p>One of the limiting factors in studying early steps in CCHFV infection has been the lack of a pseudotyped virus. Although pseudotype systems have been described for several bunyaviruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Ogino1">[73]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-deBoer1">[76]</xref>, no such system was reported for CCHFV to date. Here, we reported a VSV core virus pseudotyped with CCHFV glycoprotein. Treatment of the pseudotyped virus with anti-Gc antibody or bafilomycin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g005">Figs. 5Bâ€“C</xref>) inhibited its infection, indicating that the entry was glycoprotein-dependent. The finding that neutralizing antibody blocked pseudotype infection also demonstrated that the pseudotype can be used in rapid diagnostic assays, circumventing the need for high-level biosafety containment and pathogenic virus stocks.</p>
<p>The bunyavirus family consists of five genera with over 350 members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Schmaljohn1">[5]</xref>. Of those tested, each require low pH to productively infect host cells and so, require uptake into acidified endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Lozach1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Hollidge1">[77]</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Hofmann1">[81]</xref>. CCHFV belongs to the <italic>Nairovirus</italic> genus, and its entry route is similar to that used by members of the <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic> genus, particularly La Crosse and Oropouche viruses. La Crosse virus infection was shown to be inhibited by overexpression of DN Rab5, but not DN Rab7, leading to the conclusion that this virus undergoes fusion at early endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Hollidge1">[77]</xref>, as was thought to occur for CCHFV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Vanlandingham1">[32]</xref>. While this might be the case, given our findings, MVBs may play a similar role in La Crosse virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004390-g002">Figs. 2Aâ€“B</xref>). For Oropouche virus, virions were not seen associated with early endosomes, but did localize to Rab7-positive endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Santos1">[80]</xref>, indicating that the virus may bypass the early endosome compartment. However, the location of Oropouche virus particles in cells was only examined after 40 minutes. This seemingly different mechanism of entry may be explained by the rapid and/or transient movement of virions through early endosomes, which, for CCHFV, occurred as early as 15 minutes after incubation with cells. The finding that Oropouche virus was Rab7-associated does suggest trafficking to late endosomes; however, Rab7 is not ideal for identifying the exact endosomal compartment since it localizes to various organelles, including subsets of MVBs, late endosomes, and lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Vanlandingham1">[32]</xref>. It is, therefore, important to determine if either La Crosse or Oropouche virus requires the MVB for infection or if CCHFV has a unique need for this compartment. In contrast, Hantaan and UUkuniemi viruses, each belonging to the <italic>Hantavirus</italic> and <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> genera, do require trafficking through and function of late endosomes or lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Lozach1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Jin1">[79]</xref>. For Hantaan virus, virions were associated with Lamp1-positive endosomes, although functional significance of this association was not investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Jin1">[79]</xref>. A comprehensive study by Lozach <italic>et al.</italic> used a combination of microscopy as well as overexpression of DN and CA forms of Rab5 and Rab7 to track UUkuniemi virions through the endosomal network. Their findings convincingly demonstrate that UUkuniemi virus infection depends on Rab7 and requires virion localization to late endosomes or lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004390-Lozach1">[22]</xref>. Unfortunately, passage of virus particles through MVBs was not studied. These differences in entry mechanisms for viruses may reflect the broad diversity of viruses across the <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> family.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our work has identified a novel requirement for trafficking of CCHFV through MVBs and has shown that host proteins controlling MVB function are important host factors needed for CCHFV infection and entry. Our findings were substantiated through the production and use of a novel pseudotyped virus bearing the glycoprotein of CCHFV. This reagent will most certainly stimulate further studies on entry mechanism of the virus as well as serve as a safe diagnostic tool overcoming the need to cultivate wild-type, pathogenic virus. The knowledge acquired during the studies will help to design new strategies for therapeutic intervention against this pathogen.</p>

The block of cholesterol transport out of the MVBs in the U18666A-treated cells was confirmed by staining the second set of cells with anti-CD63 antibody followed by an Alexa Flour-conjugated secondary antibody, filipin III (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and CellMask red dye (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Z-stack immunofluorescence imaging was done on 20 cells in each sample. 3D image reconstruction was performed using Imaris software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) after image deconvolution by AutoQuant X3 software (MediaCybernetics, Rockville, MD). The experiment was repeated three times. Numbers of cells and N-positive cells were counted using CellProfiler software. The relative infection efficiencies were calculated by dividing the number of infected cells by the number of the cells in that sample.</p>
<p>To test the effect of CA Rab5A on virus infection, SW13 cells transfected with 0.1 Âµg of either pLenti-eGFP or the CA by electroporation were plated into 8-chamber Î¼-slides. Twenty-four h later, cells were incubated with CCHFV for 24 h, then fixed and stained with the HCS CellMask blue stain to define cell boundaries and a rabbit antibody to N to detect infected cells. Twenty eGFP-expressing cells in each sample were used to determine infection efficiency. The number of cells expressing both eGFP and N in each sample was divided over the total number of eGFP-positive cells in the sample to determine infection efficiency. The experiment was repeated three times.</p>

<title>Virus internalization</title>
<p>All immunofluorescence experiments were repeated three times. To test the colocalization between CCHFV and early endosomes, MVBs, or late endosomes/lysosomes, SW13 cells grown in 8-chamber Î¼-slides were incubated with the virus for indicated times at 37Â°C. Then, the samples were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with antibodies: <italic>(i)</italic> a rabbit antibody to N and a mouse antibody to EEA1, <italic>(ii)</italic> a rabbit antibody to N and a mouse antibody to CD63, <italic>(iii)</italic> a mouse antibody to N and a rabbit antibody to PDCD6 (detecting Alix/Aip1), or <italic>(iv)</italic> a rabbit antibody to N and a mouse antibody to Lamp1 at 4Â°C overnight. The secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies. Then, the cells were stained with the HCS CellMask blue stain to identify cells. The Z-stack immunofluorescence imaging, 3D reconstruction, and deconvolution were done on 20 cells in each sample as described above. The virion-endosome colocalization was computed using Imaris software.</p>
<p>To assess whether the overexpression of the DN Rab5A or DN Rab7A affected the localization of virions to endosomes, SW13 cells transfected with 0.1 Âµg of pLenti-eGFP or a DN by electroporation were plated into wells of 8-chamber slides. After 24 h, cells were incubated with CCHFV for indicated time points. Subsequently, cells were fixed, stained, and analyzed as described above.</p>
<p>To test the effect of bafilomycin A on virus internalization, SW13 cells grown in 8-chamber Î¼-slides were treated with bafilomycin A to a final concentration of 20 nM or with DMSO as a control. One hour later, cells were incubated with either infectious or gamma-irradiated CCHFV. After 24 h, samples were fixed in 10% formalin, permeabilized, and stained with CellMask blue dye to define cell boundaries, anti-N and anti-CD63 antibodies. Immunofluorescence imaging and 3D reconstruction were done on 20 cells in each sample as described above. The percentages of N found in MVBs were computed by Imaris software.</p>

<title>Real-time quantitative (q)RT-PCR</title>
<p>To determine whether bafilomycin A treatment affected CCHFV replication, SW13 cells grown in three 35-mm dishes were treated with DMSO in duplicate or bafilomycin A to a final concentration of 20 nM. One h later, all dishes were inoculated with an equal amount of CCHFV. After 2 h, one set of DMSO-treated cells was subjected to RNA extraction using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturer's protocol. RNA isolation from the second set of DMSO-treated cells and bafilomycin A-treated cells took place 24 h after virus addition. Five hundred ng of extracted RNA was used to calculate CCHFV genome copies in the samples. Viral RNA levels were determined by a qRT-PCR (TaqMan) assay detecting sequences in the S segment of the genome using an ABI 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To obtain a standard curve to determine CCHFV genome equivalents, synthetic CCHFV S segment RNA was generated. pT7-Sseg was linearized with SalI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and used as a template to synthesize RNA using MEGAscript T7 kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA was purified using RNAzol-Bee reagent (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) to 2Ã—10<sup>5</sup> copies per Âµl. Then, serial 10-fold dilutions of the stock were used to create a linear regression of the standard curve. The CCHFV primer/probe sequences span from nucleotides 1086 to 1216 and were a forward primer (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5â€²-CTT TGC CGA TGA TTC TTT CC-3â€²</named-content>), a reverse primer (5â€²-GAC TTA GTG TGT CCA GAT CC-3â€²), and a FAM/TAMRA-labeled primer (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5â€²-TTG GGC AGC ATC ATC AGG ATT GGC-3â€²</named-content>). The experiment was repeated twice in duplicate.</p>
