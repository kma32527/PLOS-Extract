<abstract>
<p>Altered cell metabolism is inherently connected with pathological conditions including cancer and viral infections. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). KS tumour cells display features of lymphatic endothelial differentiation and in their vast majority are latently infected with KSHV, while a small number are lytically infected, producing virions. Latently infected cells express only a subset of viral genes, mainly located within the latency-associated region, among them 12 microRNAs. Notably, the metabolic properties of KSHV-infected cells closely resemble the metabolic hallmarks of cancer cells. However, how and why KSHV alters host cell metabolism remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effect of KSHV infection on the metabolic profile of primary dermal microvascular lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) and the functional relevance of this effect. We found that the KSHV microRNAs within the oncogenic cluster collaborate to decrease mitochondria biogenesis and to induce aerobic glycolysis in infected cells. KSHV microRNAs expression decreases oxygen consumption, increase lactate secretion and glucose uptake, stabilize HIF1α and decreases mitochondria copy number. Importantly this metabolic shift is important for latency maintenance and provides a growth advantage. Mechanistically we show that KSHV alters host cell energy metabolism through microRNA-mediated down regulation of EGLN2 and HSPA9. Our data suggest that the KSHV microRNAs induce a metabolic transformation by concurrent regulation of two independent pathways; transcriptional reprograming via HIF1 activation and reduction of mitochondria biogenesis through down regulation of the mitochondrial import machinery. These findings implicate viral microRNAs in the regulation of the cellular metabolism and highlight new potential avenues to inhibit viral latency.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most common cancer in HIV-infected untreated individuals. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the infectious cause of this neoplasm. The discovery of KSHV and its oncogenic enigmas has enlightened many fields of tumor biology and viral oncogenesis. The metabolic properties of KS significantly differ from those of normal cells and resemble cancer cells in general, but the mechanisms employed by KSHV to alter host cell metabolism are poorly understood. Our work demonstrates that KSHV microRNAs can alter cell metabolism through coherent control of independent pathways, a key feature of microRNA-mediated control of cellular functions. This provides a fresh perspective for how microRNA-encoding pathogens shape a cell's metabolism to create an optimal environment for their survival and/or replication. Indeed, we show that, in the case of KSHV, viral microRNA-driven regulation of metabolism is important for viral latency. These findings will evoke new and exciting approaches to prevent KSHV from establishing latency and later on KS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Viruses are the etiological agents in approximately 12% of human cancers. Most of these cancers can be attributed to infections by human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Schiller1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Lehoux1">[2]</xref>. KSHV is the etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and it is also causally linked to primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and a subset of multicentric Castleman's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Cesarman1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Soulier1">[5]</xref>. KSHV, like other herpesviruses, can enter a latent viral program after multiple rounds of replication and infection of new target cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Mesri1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>In traditional models of herpesvirus-induced tumorigenesis, latency has the primary role in oncogenesis, promoting cell proliferation and impairing apoptosis. The lytic cycle is not considered to directly contribute to oncogenesis, but plays an earlier role by allowing viruses to disseminate in the host and to infect the target cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Mesri1">[6]</xref>. Consistently, in KS tumors and in PEL, the majority of cells are latently infected and express only a subset of viral genes located within the latency-associated region. This includes the viral-encoded cyclin (<italic>vCyclin</italic>), FLIP (<italic>vFLIP</italic>), latency-associated nuclear antigen (<italic>LANA</italic>) and 12 microRNAs (miRNAs) (to express 17 mature miRNAs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Ganem1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Cai1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>miRNAs are regulatory RNAs expressed by animals, plants and some viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Bartel1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Lewis1">[14]</xref>. They are synthesized as precursors that fold into imperfect double strand RNA hairpins. This structure is cleaved in two steps, which are catalysed by Drosha and the endoribonuclease Dicer RNaseIII nucleases. This process results in a ∼22 base pair miRNA duplex. One strand of this duplex can be incorporated into the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) as a mature miRNA. Within RISC, miRNAs are bound by Argonaute (Ago) proteins and induce repression of mRNAs bearing sequences with partial complementary to the miRNA.</p>
<p>Ten out of twelve of the KSHV miRNAs (miR-K12-1 to 9, and 11) are located within the intron of K12 and are expressed as a cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Qin1">[15]</xref>. Although the expression levels of these miRNAs varies between different cells lines and KS samples, it has been consistently shown that all 10 miRNAs are expressed together in latently infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Gottwein1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Marshall1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recent studies have suggested that approximately half of all human miRNAs are expressed and function as clusters; targeting the same mRNA or different mRNAs involved in the same pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Becker1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Sass1">[22]</xref>. Recent cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) experiments in PEL cell lines have indicated that this also might apply to the KSHV miRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Gottwein1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Haecker1">[17]</xref>. This suggests that these miRNAs could have developed in the course of viral evolution to function as a cluster during latent infection.</p>
<p>The characteristic metabolic hallmark of tumor metabolism is aerobic glycolysis; In contrast to normal differentiated cells, which rely primary on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to generate energy, most cancer cells instead rely on aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon termed as the Warburg effect. Cancer cells metabolism is a result of the modulation of intracellular signaling pathways that are disrupted by mutated oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Moreover alteration in cell metabolism may trigger tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Jang1">[23]</xref>. Viruses do not inherently have their own metabolic output. However, upon infection, viruses dramatically alter the metabolism of the host cell. This can provide substrates necessary for viral replication and is also likely to be important for pathogenesis. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), HCV, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) and KSHV have all been shown to alter cell host metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Delgado1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Vastag1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>Mitochondria are unique and complex organelles that perform essential functions in many aspects of cell biology. The dominant function of mitochondria is the production of more than 90% of the cell's energy in the form of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The oxidative phosphorylation system consists of four multimeric complexes, coenzyme Q and cytochrome c forming the mitochondrial respiratory chain (I–IV), which transfer electrons from reducing equivalents to water, creating a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is used by a fifth complex, the F1F0 ATPase, to drive the synthesis of ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Barrientos1">[31]</xref>. In addition to their role in energy metabolism, mitochondria also perform various other functions, which make them absolutely indispensable to the cell. Among these, mitochondria are implicated in apoptosis, the regulation of various metabolism pathways, and signal transduction of antiviral responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Jiang1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Ohta1">[34]</xref>. This makes them a target of almost all invading pathogens, including viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Ohta1">[34]</xref>. Although mitochondria possess a separate and independent genome, most of the mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus, translated in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Mokranjac1">[35]</xref>. Therefore, mitochondrial genes are exposed to post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs.</p>
<p>The hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1α) is one of the master regulators of cell metabolism and was shown to inhibit mitochondrial biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Zhang1">[36]</xref>. Under normoxic conditions, HIF1α is hydroxylated by the three HIF prolyl hydroxylases (HPHs) EGLN1-3 (PHD1-3) and this marks it for proteosomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Epstein1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Kaelin1">[38]</xref>. Under hypoxic condition, the HPHs are suppressed, and consequently HIF1α is stabilized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Kaelin1">[38]</xref>. Stabilized HIF1heterodimerizes with HIF1β and binds to the hypoxia response elements (HREs) in numerous target genes to activate their transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Semenza1">[39]</xref>. HIF1 is known to mediate an active switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolytic metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Luo1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Iyer1">[45]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although the KSHV genome encodes 12 miRNAs, up to now, only a handful of their targets have been confirmed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Zhu1">[46]</xref>. Here we show that the KSHV miRNAs function as a cluster to induce metabolic transformation during latent infection from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. We identified and confirmed two specific targets for these miRNAs that suggest a possible mechanism for this metabolic transformation: the HIF prolyl hydroxylase EGLN2 and the heat shock protein HSPA9. We also show that this metabolic conversion contributes to the growth of latently infected cells under hypoxia and promotes latency maintenance.</p>

<title>KSHV miRNAs induce a metabolic transformation in LEC</title>
<p>KSHV was shown to induce the Warburg effect in latently infected endothelial cells, including lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC), and in KS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Delgado1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Delgado2">[25]</xref>. However, the mechanisms behind these alterations are not clear, and it is not known whether KSHV has a direct effect on mitochondrial function.</p>
<p>During latency KSHV expresses only a subset of genes including <italic>vcyclin</italic>, <italic>vFLIP</italic>, <italic>LANA</italic> and the miRNA cluster. This suggests that one or more of these genes are responsible for changing cellular glucose metabolism.</p>
<p>In order to test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of each of the latent proteins and the miRNA cluster on glucose metabolism. Metabolic output is known to vary between different cell types and miRNA function is affected by cell context. Therefore, we focused on primary dermal microvascular LEC, which are believed to be the progenitor cells for KS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Wang1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Chang2">[49]</xref>.</p>
<p>We used lentiviruses to express each of the latent proteins or the miRNA cluster in LEC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s001">Figure S1A–E</xref>). When we expressed the miRNA cluster, all the individual miRNAs are expressed and intriguingly the expression level of each one of them is similar to its expression in KSHV infected LEC (KLEC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s001">Figure S1E–F</xref>). Since over expression of exogenous miRNAs in cells can have non-specific effects, we created a mutated version of the miRK12-3, which is one of the most expressed among the KSHV miRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s001">Figure S1E and F</xref>), and used it as a control for expression of the KSHV miRNA cluster. There are two obvious characteristics that indicate a shift in glucose metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic glycolysis: reduced oxygen consumption and acidification of growth media due to secretion of the glycolysis product lactate. We first tested oxygen consumption rate using the Seahorse XF24 analyzer. The Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer determines oxygen consumption rate (OCR), and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), in order to assess cellular functions such as oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis.</p>
<p>While expression of LANA, vcyclin or vFLIP did not have a significant effect on oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s001">Figure S1G</xref>), expression of the KSHV miRNA cluster (miR-LEC) reduced base line oxygen consumption to a similar level to this in KLEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In concordance with this finding we also observed a ∼33% increase of secreted lactate from miR-LEC cells when lactate levels were measured directly from the growth media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Another known marker of aerobic glycolysis is increased glucose uptake. We monitored glucose uptake into cells by measuring the uptake of the fluorescently labeled deoxyglucose analog 6-NBDG and found increased uptake of ∼30% in cells expressing miR-LEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), but not in those expressing latent proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s001">Figure S1J</xref>). We also found that the glucose transporter GLUT1 is overexpressed by over 2-fold in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g001">Figure 1D</xref>); a second indicator of increased glucose uptake.</p>
<p>KSHV express additional two miRNAs out of the cluster; miR-K10-10 and miR-K12-12. Although these miRNAs expressed in a relative high levels in KLEC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s001">Figure S1F</xref>) we could not find any significant change in oxygen consumption, lactate secretion or glucose uptake when expressing these miRNAs in miR-LEC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s001">Figure S1 H–I and K</xref>).</p>
<p>To further rule out unspecific effects caused by expression of a miRNA cluster we used miR-132/212 cluster as a second control. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g001">figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s001">figures S1L–M</xref>, expression of this cluster does not affect oxygen consumption or glucose uptake. Taken together, these results suggest that the KSHV miRNAs have the ability to shift host cell metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis.</p>
<p>The hypoxia-induced factor alpha (HIF1α) is a known regulator of glucose metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Chen1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Fulda1">[51]</xref> and can mediate the Warburg effect in cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Semenza3">[52]</xref>.</p>
<p>KSHV was also shown to activate HIF1 and HIF2 alpha during latency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Carroll1">[53]</xref>. We therefore tested whether the miRNA-induced alteration in cell metabolism is related to HIF1α expression and activity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g001">figure 1E</xref>, in miR-LEC HIF1α protein is overexpressed by ∼3 fold compared to the control cells. Correspondingly, we found increased expression of two known targets genes of HIF1α: <italic>VEGFA</italic> (vascular endothelial growth factor A) and <italic>ADM</italic> (adrenomedullin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). This concurred with increased HIF-1 transcriptional activity as shown by increased luciferase activity when the miRNAs were expressed together with a HIF-1 luciferase-reporter assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Chau1">[54]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s001">Figure S1N</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together these results suggest that expression of the miRNA cluster in LEC is sufficient to change glucose metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis and this might occur due to HIF1α stabilization.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>KSHV miRNAs reduce mitochondrial number</title>
<p>Mitochondria are key players in normal glucose metabolism in aerobic conditions, and as part of the Warburg effect, many cancer types show altered mitochondrial activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Wallace1">[55]</xref>. Having found that expression of KSHV miRNAs reduces oxidative phosphorylation, we next tested their effect on mitochondrial function. As an initial assessment of mitochondrial function, we loaded cells with MitoTracker together with Calcein AM. MitoTracker is a fluorescent dye that labels mitochondria within live cells utilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential. It therefore allowed us to calculate mitochondrial volume (MitoTracker staining) relative to total cell volume (Calcein staining). Although we could not detect any change in mitochondrial structure, we did find a significant decrease in mitochondria volume in miR-LEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Calculation of mitochondria volume in KLEC showed again similar reduction to this in miR-LEC while the miR-132/212 did not have any effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). When we tested the expression of miR-K12-10 and miR-K12-12 in miR-LEC we found again no significant different (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Since mitochondria have their own independent genome, one can calculate their number by qPCR analysis using specific primers for the mitochondrial genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Venegas1">[56]</xref>. Total DNA (mitochondrial and genomic), extracted from miR-LEC and control cells, was used as template for this analysis. This showed that while the control cells had between 50–60 copies of the mitochondrial genome, in miR-LEC there was a 25% decrease in mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Measuring the expression of different OXPHOS complexes using an antibody cocktail, showed a similar decrease in their expression in miR-LEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g002">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s002">Figure S2C–D</xref>).

<title>The KSHV miRNA cluster regulates EGLN2 and HSPA9</title>
<p>miRNAs act to alter the translation and mRNA stability of specific genes and consequently they regulate the cellular pathways those genes control. Therefore, we investigated potential genes that are regulated by the KSHV miRNAs. For this we combined data from three prediction algorithms (PITA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Lewis2">[59]</xref>, miRanda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-John1">[60]</xref> and TargetScan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Kertesz1">[61]</xref>), together with published data for the KSHV miRNAs targetome from two different CLIP experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Gottwein1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Haecker1">[17]</xref>. This allowed us to identify a number of potential genes that might be regulated by these miRNAs resulting in altered cellular glucose metabolism. All three different HIF prolyl hydroxylases (<italic>EGLN1-3</italic>) were predicted to be targets of the viral miRNAs. <italic>EGLN1</italic> was suggested to be targeted by miR-K12-2 and miR-K12-11 in both BC-1 and BC-3 PEL cell lines through a CLIP experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Gottwein1">[16]</xref>, while <italic>EGLN2</italic> is predicted by the different algorithms to be targets by multiple miRNAs (miR-K12-2, miR-K12-3, miR-K12-6, miR-K12-7, miR-K12-8, miR-K12-9 and miR-K12-11).</p>
<p>It has been shown that in different cell types these three HIF prolyl hydroxylases (HPH) have different expression profiles and differential functions in the regulation of HIF1α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Appelhoff1">[62]</xref>. We therefore tested the expression profile of these genes in LEC and found that <italic>EGLN2</italic> is the most expressed, whilst <italic>EGLN3</italic> is hardly expressed in LEC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). We next quantified the mRNA levels of these genes after expression of the viral miRNA cluster and found that only <italic>EGLN2</italic> and <italic>EGLN3</italic> were down regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Taking these findings into consideration, we decided to focus only on regulation of <italic>EGLN2</italic> by the viral miRNAs for further study.</p>
<p>Interestingly, both previous CLIP studies identified in their pathway enrichment analysis genes that are involved in protein targeting and localization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Gottwein1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Haecker1">[17]</xref>. In addition, the different prediction algorithms also predicted many of these genes to be regulated by the KSHV miRNAs. Since mitochondrial biogenesis depends on protein translocation, down regulation of proteins involved in this process might explain the reduced mitochondrial number and biogenesis induced by KSHV miRNAs. To investigate this potential regulatory axis, we chose 9 different genes, predicted to be regulated by the KSHV miRNAs, and tested their mRNA expression in miR-LEC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). We found that the mRNA of 5 of these genes was indeed down regulated in the presence of the KSHV miRNA cluster. In order to further examine this finding, we cloned the 3′UTR of these genes into a reporter plasmid, downstream of the luciferase coding sequence. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s003">Figure S3D</xref>, these 3′UTRs are indeed targeted by the KSHV miRNA cluster, resulting in decreased luciferase activity.</p>
<p>As the mitochondrial heat shock protein <italic>HSPA9</italic> was suggested to be a target of multiple viral miRNAs in both CLIP studies (miR-K12-3 and miR-K12-4) and by all three algorithms (miR-K12-3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10 and 11), and it was shown to be the most down-regulated among the genes we tested, we focused on it for further studies. HSPA9 (mtHSP70, mortalin) is a central subunit of the matrix-exposed import motor playing a central role in the mitochondrial translocation system and is essential for efficient import and export of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Chacinska1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Kaul1">[64]</xref>. It was shown that it is crucial for viability and mitochondrial biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Craig1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Kawai1">[66]</xref>. Therefore, its down regulation could contribute to the reduction of mitochondria in cells expressing the viral miRNAs.</p>
<p>To confirm that the KSHV miRNA cluster targets <italic>EGLN2</italic> and <italic>HSPA9</italic>, we measured their expression in miR-LEC. EGLN2 and HSPA9 mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced in miR-LEC comparing to the controls cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g003">Figure 3A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s003">Figure S3E</xref>). To confirm that these miRNAs specifically target the 3′UTR of these genes, we used a vector containing the luciferase coding sequence up-stream of their 3′UTRs. We expressed this construct in the presence of the miRNA cluster and observed ∼50% reduction in luciferase activity, while the control vector maintained luciferase activity in the presence of the miRNA cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s003">Figure S3F</xref>). To confirm these genes are regulated also during KSHV infection, we tested their expression in KLEC and found both to be down regulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s003">Figure S3G</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we tested our hypothesis that the viral miRNAs function as a cluster, and dissected the contribution of each individual miRNA to the regulation of <italic>EGLN2</italic> and <italic>HSPA9</italic>. For this we tested the mRNA levels of <italic>EGLN2</italic> and <italic>HSPA9</italic> in LEC upon expression of the separate miRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s003">Figure S3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g003">figure 3C</xref>). This showed that, as predicted, each one of these genes is targeted by more than one of the KSHV miRNAs (miR-K12-1, 3, 8, and 11 for <italic>EGLN2</italic> and miR-K12-1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 for <italic>HSPA9</italic>). Expressing luciferase vectors harboring the 3′UTRs of EGLN2 or HSPA9, together with the individual miRNAs, also showed that these 3′UTRs have target sites for more than one of the KSHV miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Some miRNAs down regulated the mRNA levels of these genes but did not have any effect on luciferase activity (e.g. miR-K12-4 on HSPA9). These miRNAs may target predicted sites outside the 3′UTR or regulate ELGN2 and HSPA9 indirectly. Going back to the prediction algorithm PITA for these genes we found that indeed many of these miRNAs are also predicted to target these genes either in their 3′UTR or coding sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s008">Table S1</xref>).</p>

<title>The KSHV miRNA cluster can induce the Warburg effect through regulation of <italic>EGLN2</italic> and <italic>HSPA9</italic></title>
<p>To test whether the KSHV miRNAs trigger a shift in cell metabolism through down regulation of <italic>EGLN2</italic> and <italic>HSPA9</italic>, we used the human GIPZ shRNAmir lentiviral clones (Open Biosystems) to specifically suppress each of these genes. We down-regulated each one of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s004">Figure S4A–C</xref>) and tested the effect on cellular metabolism in LEC. We found that knockdown of each of these genes led to stabilization of HIF1α, decreased oxygen consumption and reduced mitochondrial volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g004">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Because knockdown of EGLN2 and HSPA9 caused HIF1α stabilization, we next investigated whether the observed metabolic phenotype depends on HIF1α. We therefore expressed the HIF1α P402A/P564A stable mutant in LEC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Yan1">[67]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s004">Figure S4D</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g004">Figure 4D–E</xref>, expression of this mutant resulted in a similar decrease in oxygen consumption and mitochondrial volume as that caused by <italic>EGLN2</italic> and <italic>HSPA9</italic> silencing, suggesting that HIF signaling is playing a role in this phenotype.</p>

<p>To further examine whether this metabolic transformation depends on EGLN2 and HSPA9, we next tested whether overexpression of these proteins could counteract the effect of the miRNA cluster. We achieved overexpression of both <italic>EGLN2</italic> and <italic>HSPA9</italic>, alongside viral miRNA expression, by using constructs that lacked 3′UTRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Expression of each miRNA-resistant gene reversed the effect of the viral miRNAs on its particular mRNA but not on the other gene's mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s005">Figure S5B</xref>), showing that the miRNA cluster down-regulates these genes independently.</p>
<p>As expected, overexpression of EGLN2 prevented HIF1α stabilization by the miRNA cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). More importantly, we found that both EGLN2 and HSPA9 overexpression significantly reduced the effect of the viral miRNA cluster on oxygen consumption and mitochondrial volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g005">Figure 5B and C</xref>). Interestingly, EGLN2 up-regulation had a bigger effect on both oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), and mitochondrial volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), when compared to HSPA9 overexpression. When both proteins were overexpressed together, they showed an additive effect. The fact that the miRNA cluster phenotype could not be fully reversed by overexpression of either EGLN2 alone, HSPA9 alone, or the combination of both proteins, suggests that although they are part of the miRNA-induced metabolic transformation mechanism, other genes also play a role.</p>

<title>Inducing the Warburg effect provides a growth advantage in low oxygen conditions and is important for latency maintenance</title>
<p>Increased glycolytic flux, together with HIF1α stabilization, suggests that latent cells might be more adaptable to low oxygen conditions. We therefore tested whether miR-LEC proliferate faster than the control cells when subjected to such conditions. Cells were grown in high oxygen (20%) and then moved to 1.5% oxygen and analyzed after 24, 48 and 72 hours. In contrast to high oxygen conditions, where both control and miR-LEC growth rates were similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s006">Figure S6A</xref>), when cells were exposed to hypoxia, miR-LEC had a significant growth advantage in the first 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

<p>There is evidence that <italic>in vitro</italic> three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures more accurately reflect the complex <italic>in vivo</italic> microenvironment than simple two-dimensional cell monolayers. We therefore explored the effect of the KSHV miRNAs on cell growth under these conditions. To do this we used the recently published microplate-based method to create and measure spheroid growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Vinci1">[68]</xref>. To investigate the effect of the KSHV miRNAs in this context, we chose the human osteosarcoma U2OS cell line, which has previously been shown to form spheroids using this method. U2OS were infected with lentiviruses to express the miRNA cluster or the specific hairpins for <italic>EGLN2</italic> and <italic>HSPA9</italic> knockdown. As in LEC, expression of the KSHV miRNA cluster in U2OS led to up-regulation of HIF1α and down regulation of EGLN2 and HSPA9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s006">Figure S6C</xref>). These cells were then plated in ultra-low attachment 96-well round-bottomed plates as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Vinci1">[68]</xref>. Spheroid growth was measured using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) and spheroid area was measured using the EVOS cell imaging system. We found that, similarly to the growth advantage under hypoxic conditions, expression of the KSHV miRNA cluster and knock down of EGLN2 led to enhanced growth in 3D cultures, as shown by increased spheroid area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s006">Figure S6D–E</xref>) and cell number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g006">Figure 6F</xref>).</p>
<p>The fact that KSHV has evolved to alter cellular metabolism and to reduce mitochondrial biogenesis during latency suggests that these phenomena have a function during the life cycle of the virus.</p>
<p>We therefore examined the importance of reduced mitochondrial biogenesis for latency maintenance. To test this, we treated the latently infected PEL cell line BCBL1 with Resveratrol, which has been shown to induce mitochondrial biogenesis in some cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Biala1">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Csiszar1">[70]</xref>. We found that in PEL cells, Resveratrol treatment leads to increased expression of COX-IV and the OXPHOS complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g006">Figure 6C–D</xref>), in a dose dependent manner. Strikingly, this increase in mitochondrial biogenesis caused extensive cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). When we tested for viral gene expression we found that Resveratrol treatment caused substantial expression of lytic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g006">Figure 6F</xref>), suggesting that the Resveratrol-induced cell death is due to induction of the lytic cycle in these cells. In order to directly test for viral production we used the media from Resveratrol induced cells to directly infect 293T cells and measured the KSHV copy number in these cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g006">figure 6G</xref>, infection using media from cells treated with Resveratrol leads to increase of up to ∼15 times of KSHV copy number in the infected cells.</p>
<p>In order to determine if the same holds true in primary infected cells, we used the recombinant virus, rKSHV.219, which expresses a red fluorescent protein under the KSHV lytic PAN promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Vieira1">[71]</xref>. This virus can establish a latent infection in LEC, making it a valuable model for the study of latency and reactivation. We selected infected LEC to create KLEC.219, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Vieira1">[71]</xref>, and treated them with Resveratrol to induce mitochondrial biogenesis. We first confirmed that Resveratrol does not have a toxic effect on LEC and that it induced mitochondrial biogenesis in them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s007">Figure S7A and B</xref>). Resveratrol treatment led to extensive KSHV reactivation, as indicated by a 42% increase in RFP positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g006">Figure 6H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s007">Figure S7C</xref>). Interestingly, when we overexpressed EGLN2 and HSPA9 in BCBCL1 and KLEC.219, we found that while HSPA9 did not show a significant effect, EGLN2 overexpression caused a small increase in lytic phase activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s007">Figure S7D and F</xref>). Respectively, knocking down HIF1α gave similar results; activation of the lytic phase indicated by increase in RFP positive cells and KSHV copy number in cell infected with media from these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s007">Figure S7 E–F</xref>).</p>
<p>These results suggest that reduced mitochondrial activity is important for maintaining latency in KSHV infected cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>KSHV has been shown to highjack and manipulate various cellular pathways to promote its own survival and spread <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Cai2">[72]</xref>. Among those it was shown that KSHV alter its host cell energy metabolism, but neither the mechanism by which this is achieved nor the biological benefit, are understood. Our study has revealed a functional role for the KSHV miRNAs in the regulation of cell metabolism. We report that expression of the KSHV miRNA cluster, in primary LEC, induces the Warburg effect; it reduces oxygen consumption, increases lactate secretion, increases glucose uptake and reduces mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, expression of these miRNAs also leads to stabilization and activation of the transcription factor HIF1α, a master regulator of cell metabolism.</p>
<p>We identified and confirmed two new targets for the KSHV miRNAs, EGLN2 and HSPA9, and show that KSHV alters host cell energy metabolism through down-regulation of these genes. Nevertheless, the fact that overexpression of these genes (without their 3′UTRs) did not fully rescue the phenotypic effect of these miRNAs, suggests that there are more genes involved in this metabolic transformation. This is not surprising because the miRNAs within the cluster are predicted to target many other genes, some of which are involved in cell metabolism, and these might also contribute to this phenomenon.</p>
<p>We suggest a two-armed mechanism by which KSHV changes cellular energy metabolism; the first is based on activation of the transcription factor HIF and the subsequent up-regulation of its metabolically relevant target genes. The second arm directly reduces mitochondrial biogenesis by impairing the import of proteins into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004400-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<p>We show that the KSHV miRNAs induced-metabolic shift contributes to infected cells proliferation in low oxygen and is important for latency maintenance. KS and PEL cells are not exposed to extensive hypoxia and KSHV associated solid lymphomas are rare. Nevertheless, in some cases KS can have a solid mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-DePond1">[73]</xref>, or PEL develops in hypoxic niches, as was shown in an artificial cavity related to the capsule of a breast implant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Said1">[74]</xref>. In addition, adjustments to energy metabolism have been suggested to give cancer cells many advantages with respect to proliferation and growth. The prevalent theory is that, although aerobic glycolysis is an inefficient way to generate energy, it is a necessary adaption to facilitate the uptake and incorporation of nutrients into the biomass, which is needed to produce new cells. This modification also offers similar advantages for KSHV-infected cells.</p>
<p>We have shown here for the first time that the KSHV miRNAs regulate cell metabolism. Nevertheless, regulating energy and cancer metabolism using miRNAs is not exclusive to viruses, and cellular miRNAs are also known to control energy metabolism. As we show for the KSHV miRNAs, cellular miRNAs also participate in manipulating cancer cell metabolism by regulating the expression of genes with protein products that either directly regulate the metabolic machinery or indirectly modulate the expression of metabolic enzymes, serving as master regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Chen2">[75]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Yoshino1">[78]</xref>.</p>
<p>Various types of cancer cells have been shown to overexpress HIF due to intratumoral hypoxia or as a result of genetic alterations that have occurred as part of their oncogenic program (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Semenza4">[79]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Kaelin2">[82]</xref>). We show a new miRNA-based mechanism by which KSHV regulates HIF1α levels in cells. The algorithm miRror <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Friedman1">[83]</xref> suggests that there are 35 cellular miRNAs predicted to target <italic>EGLN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s009">table S2</xref>) and 14 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004400.s010">table S3</xref>) predicted to target all three HIF prolyl hydroxylases. This suggests that a similar miRNA-based regulation mechanism of HIF1α stability might exist in normal or cancerous cells.</p>
<p>All previously performed AGO2 CLIP experiments in PEL, several different prediction algorithms and our results suggest that the KSHV miRNAs target <italic>HSPA9</italic>, together with other proteins from the mitochondrial import machinery. We confirm that several of the KSHV miRNAs collaborate to target <italic>HSPA9</italic> and consequently reduce mitochondrial activity. Very little is known about how cells regulate import into mitochondria and whether this might be a mechanism through which mitochondrial biogenesis and activity is regulated. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which do not have miRNAs, regulate import into mitochondria using cytosolic kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Schmidt1">[84]</xref>. We propose a possible regulation of the mitochondrial import machinery by miRNAs. Our results suggest the KSHV miRNAs regulates key proteins in this import machinery such as HSPA9, TOMM40, TOMM22 and others. This could be the reason that over expression of EGLN2 and HSPA9 failed to rescue the miRNAs phenotype, since other proteins from the import machinery are still down regulated. Regulation of this process by miRNAs could allow fine-tuning of mitochondrial activity, which could be rapidly reversed. It has been previously shown that knockout of the mitochondrial HSP70 (HSPA9), as well as other essential proteins in the import machinery, is lethal to cells. Thus, fine-tuning achieved by miRNAs can allow viruses to reduce mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation while keeping its host cell alive.</p>
<p>Our findings provide further support, in the context of cell metabolism, for the concept that KSHV miRNAs operate as a functional cluster. We show that KSHV miRNAs are expressed together in infected cells and collaborate to regulate specific genes (e.g. EGLN2 and HSPA9) within specific pathways (e.g. the mitochondria import machinery). With regards to individual mRNA targets we observe synergy but also some redundant targeting. However, we find that no individual miRNA can fully reproduce the effect of the whole KSHV miRNA cluster on metabolism, suggesting that these miRNAs function synergistically. Moreover, the fact that they are not all expressed to same level suggests an internal regulation of their expression. We speculate that by expressing this cluster, the virus circumvents one of the host cell's main evolutionary tools for escaping unwanted miRNA targeting: alterations in 3′UTR sequences. Even if one miRNA target site is lost, the remaining miRNAs are still able to bind to and regulate the transcript. Although the specific contribution of each of the KSHV miRNAs to this phenomenon has not yet been dissected, through suppressing expression of multiple genes within a specific cellular pathway, the overall effect of the miRNA cluster is coherent, robust and quantitatively sufficient to lead to functionally relevant outcomes. Interestingly, this functional clustering of viral miRNAs around cellular metabolism seems to be conserved in other herpesviruses. EBV, also a gamma-herpesvirus, which expresses multiple viral miRNAs, regulates many of the same genes and cellular pathways as KSHV. Notably, an AGO2 CLIP experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004400-Gottwein1">[16]</xref> pulled HSPA9, together with other proteins involved in import into mitochondria, as targets of the EBV miRNAs, suggesting potential functional convergence.</p>
<p>KSHV-infected cells share many characteristics with cancer cells, in particular altered energy metabolism. Therefore, in addition to the implications for KS biology, KSHV infection could be used as a model to study the role of the Warburg effect (and other altered metabolic pathways) during transformation.</p>
<p>Although having a growth advantage in hypoxic conditions may be significant in certain environments, we speculate that the main evolutionary benefit gained by KSHV through alteration of cellular metabolism is the generation of optimal intracellular conditions for latency establishment and maintenance. Our results show that inducing mitochondria biogenesis interferes with the virus ability to maintain latency - a key step in the virus oncogenic program. Consequently these findings have translational-medicine implications with regards to KSHV-associated malignancies, but also in the broader context of pathologies etiologically linked to DNA viruses.</p>
