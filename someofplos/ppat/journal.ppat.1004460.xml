<abstract>
<p>Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and primary effusion B-cell lymphoma. KSHV induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) early during infection of human dermal microvascular endothelial (HMVEC-d) cells that are critical for virus entry. One of the downstream targets of ROS is nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor with important anti-oxidative functions. Here, we show that KS skin lesions have high Nrf2 activity compared to healthy skin tissue. Within 30 minutes of <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection of HMVEC-d cells, we observed Nrf2 activation through ROS-mediated dissociation from its inhibitor Keap1, Ser-40 phosphorylation, and subsequent nuclear translocation. KSHV binding and consequent signaling through Src, PI3-K and PKC-Î¶ were also important for Nrf2 stability, phosphorylation and transcriptional activity. Although Nrf2 was dispensable for ROS homeostasis, it was essential for the induction of COX-2, VEGF-A, VEGF-D, Bcl-2, NQO1, GCS, HO1, TKT, TALDO and G6PD gene expression in KSHV-infected HMVEC-d cells. The COX-2 product PGE2 induced Nrf2 activity through paracrine and autocrine signaling, creating a feed-forward loop between COX-2 and Nrf2. vFLIP, a product of KSHV latent gene ORF71, induced Nrf2 and its target genes NQO1 and HO1. Activated Nrf2 colocalized with the KSHV genome as well as with the latency protein LANA-1. Nrf2 knockdown enhanced ORF73 expression while reducing ORF50 and other lytic gene expression without affecting KSHV entry or genome nuclear delivery. Collectively, these studies for the first time demonstrate that during <italic>de novo</italic> infection, KSHV induces Nrf2 through intricate mechanisms involving multiple signal molecules, which is important for its ability to manipulate host and viral genes, creating a microenvironment conducive to KSHV infection. Thus, Nrf2 is a potential attractive target to intervene in KSHV infection and the associated maladies.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>KSHV infection of endothelial cells <italic>in vivo</italic> causes Kaposi's sarcoma and understanding the steps involved in <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection of these cells and the consequences is important to develop therapies to counter KSHV pathogenesis. Infection of endothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> is preceded by the induction of a network of host signaling agents that are necessary for virus entry, gene expression and establishment of latency. Our previous studies have implicated reactive oxygen species (ROS) as part of this network. In the current study, we show that ROS activate Nrf2, a master transcriptional regulator of genes involved in ROS homeostasis, apoptosis, glucose metabolism and angiogenesis. Besides ROS, KSHV utilizes additional aspects of host signaling to induce Nrf2 activity. We also observed that infection of endothelial cells deficient in Nrf2 resulted in downregulation of multiple genes important in KSHV pathogenesis, such as COX-2 and VEGF, and affected proper expression of two hallmark KSHV genes, lytic ORF50 and latent ORF73. Taken together, this study is the first to demonstrate the importance of Nrf2 during <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection of endothelial cells, and establishes Nrf2 as an attractive therapeutic target to control KSHV infection, establishment of latency and the associated cancers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) or human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), a Î³-2 lymphotropic herpesvirus with a double-stranded DNA genome of â¼160 kb in length, is the etiological agent of hyper-proliferative disorders such as Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), primary effusion B-cell lymphoma (PEL), and plasmablastic multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Cesarman1">[1]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Soulier1">[3]</xref>. KS lesions exhibit a heterogeneous environment of hyperplastic, endothelium-derived spindle cells, neovascular structures and inflammatory cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Costa1">[4]</xref>. Like all herpesviruses, the KSHV life-cycle alternates between lytic and latent phases, and KSHV is predominantly in the latent state in KS endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Ganem1">[5]</xref>. KSHV genome and transcripts are also detected in the KS lesion fibroblasts, monocytes, and cells of epithelial origin and the expression of multiple latent and lytic genes in the infected cells, aided by the concomitant action of pro-inflammatory cytokines released by these cells, drives the excessive proliferation and hyperplasia of endothelial cells that lead to their spindle-shaped morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Ganem1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Investigation of KSHV infection of endothelial cells is frequently carried out <italic>in vitro</italic> in primary endothelial cell types such as human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-d), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC), or in immortalized endothelial cell-lines such as TIVE/TIVE-LTC and epithelial SLK/iSLK cells. HMVEC-d cells provide an excellent <italic>in vitro</italic> model for studying the early events that follow <italic>de novo</italic> infection of endothelial cells because i) they are naÃ¯ve, primary cells permissive to KSHV infection, ii) they are derived from the same cells that eventually transform into the characteristic spindle-shaped morphology in KS lesions, and iii) are not transformed, hence, exhibit signaling cascades that closely resemble early events during <italic>in vivo</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Chandran1">[6]</xref>. As primary cells, HMVEC-d cells have a limited life-span and culturing them is labor intensive, with about â¼50â70% infection efficiency if ample virus is used, and exhibit progressive viral episome loss with each cellular division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Ganem1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Chandran1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>The KSHV-binding receptor on HMVEC-d cells is heparan sulfate (HS), a negatively-charged plasma membrane macromolecule that uses electrostatic forces to attract KSHV envelope glycoproteins to the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Akula1">[7]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Wang2">[11]</xref>. Once on the surface of the cells, KSHV envelope glycoproteins interact with entry receptors such as integrins (Î±3Î²1, Î±VÎ²3 and Î±VÎ²5), xCT/CD98, and the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 to induce important signaling pathways that result in the phosphorylation and activation of many additional kinases and transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Wang1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Naranatt1">[10]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Chakraborty1">[14]</xref>. Specifically, KSHV infection sequentially induces activation of FAK, Src, PI3-K/Akt, ROS, EphA2, c-Cbl and CIB1 to mediate macropinocytosis and virus entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Chakraborty1">[14]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Veettil2">[21]</xref>. Subsequently, infection induces activation of PKC-Î¶, COX-2, MAPKs (MEK and ERK1/2) and NF-ÎºB, which collectively create a microenvironment conducive to establishment of viral gene expression and latency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Naranatt1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Bottero2">[22]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-SharmaWalia3">[25]</xref>. Unlike alpha- and beta-herpesviruses, whose <italic>in vitro</italic> infection results in robust lytic replication with high progeny virus formation and cytopathological changes in the cell, KSHV establishes latency within 24 hr post-infection (p.i.), which is clearly mirrored by a steady rise in major latency regulatory ORF73 (LANA-1) gene expression and with no progeny virus formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Ganem1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Krishnan2">[26]</xref>. Another interesting feature of <italic>de novo</italic> infection is that before the establishment of latency, a quick burst of lytic genes with important anti-apoptotic and immune-evasive roles peaks between 2â8 hr p.i., which subsequently declines by 24 hr p.i., likely due to i) increase in the antagonizing LANA-1 expression, ii) chromatin modifications of the KSHV genome, and iii) potentially other unidentified mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Krishnan2">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>We and others have also shown that stress-associated agents, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), play important roles in KSHV pathogenesis. ROS have been shown to induce lytic reactivation of KSHV in latently-infected endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Li1">[27]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Ye2">[29]</xref>. Our studies for the first time demonstrated that <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection of HMVEC-d cells induces ROS by â¼2-fold as early as 30 min p.i., which was sustained throughout the course of infection and during latency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Bottero1">[16]</xref>. This induction played an important role in mediating phosphorylation of a signal pathway involved in macropinocytosis, virus entry and establishment of KSHV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Bottero1">[16]</xref>. However, these studies did not examine the downstream effects of ROS activation.</p>
<p>Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a ROS-responsive, â¼65 kDa, master transcription factor involved in the transcriptional activation of hundreds of human genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Moi1">[30]</xref>. Nrf2 belongs to the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) subset of the <italic>cap ânâ collar</italic> family of transcription factors and consists of six highly conserved Nrf2-ECH homology domains labeled Neh1-6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Moi1">[30]</xref>. Neh1 contains the DNA-binding domain; Neh2 contains the ETGE and DLG motifs that bind to its inhibitor, Keap1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s001">Fig. S1</xref>); Neh3 is important for activity of the transactivation domains Neh4 and Neh5; Neh6 binds to GSK-3Î² and Î²-TrCP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Kansanen1">[31]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Chowdhry1">[40]</xref>. When activated, Nrf2 binds to DNA promoters that contain the anti-oxidant response element (ARE - TGAnnnnGC) and induces expression of genes such as NQO1, GCS, HO1, and GST etc. involved in the stress response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Kensler1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Hayes1">[41]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Thimmulappa1">[45]</xref>. In addition, recent studies have determined that Nrf2 induces transcription of genes involved in drug clearance (Mrp1 and Mrp2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Hayashi1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Maher1">[47]</xref>, glucose and glutamine metabolism (G6PD, TKT, TALDO, PGD, ME1 etc.) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Hirotsu1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Mitsuishi2">[49]</xref>, apoptosis (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Niture1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Niture2">[51]</xref>, angiogenesis (HIF-1Î± and VEGF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Kim1">[52]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Zhou1">[54]</xref> and cell invasion (MMP9) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Pan1">[55]</xref>.</p>
<p>Nrf2 is the major regulator of ROS homeostasis in multiple cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Nguyen1">[56]</xref>. Because of the importance of responding to elevated ROS rapidly before irreversible cell damage ensues, the cells have evolutionarily developed a quickly-inducible system of Nrf2 activation. In a steady state, new Nrf2 molecules are constantly translated in abundance, but are quickly degraded by its inhibitor, kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which acts as a scaffold for the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cul3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Cullinan1">[57]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Zhang3">[59]</xref>. Keap1 consists of three domains, i) the BTB domain (Broad Complex, Tramtack, and Bric-a-Brac), ii) the linker region heavy in reactive cysteine residues, and iii) the Kelch domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Zhang4">[60]</xref>. The N-terminal BTB domain homodimerizes with another Keap1 molecule and recruits Cul3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>, i) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Cullinan1">[57]</xref>. In the closed conformation, each of the C-termini Kelch domains of a Keap1 homodimer binds to the ETGE or DLG domains of one Nrf2 molecule (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>, ii) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Baird1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Baird2">[62]</xref>. The N-terminus-bound Cul3 then mediates ubiquitination of 7 lysine residues on the Neh2 domain of Nrf2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>, ii), an event that opens the complex and allows 26S proteasomal degradation of Nrf2 and recycling of Keap1-Cul3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>, iii) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Kobayashi1">[58]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Zhang3">[59]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Furukawa1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-McMahon1">[64]</xref>. Therefore, in a steady state, this system cycles between a closed conformation important for Nrf2 ubiquitination, and an open conformation important for Nrf2 degradation and Keap1-Cul3 recycling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>, overarching arrow) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Baird1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Baird2">[62]</xref>. The recycled Keap1-Cul3 complex then targets a newly synthesized Nrf2, restarting the cycle and keeping Nrf2 levels low.</p>
<p>When ROS levels are elevated, free radicals attack multiple cysteine residues on Keap1, leading to conformational and functional changes that disrupt the normal activity of the Keap1-Cul3 system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Zhang4">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-DinkovaKostova1">[65]</xref>. Specifically, Nrf2 inducers âlockâ the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction in the closed conformation, with both Kelch domains tightly bound to ETGE and DLG, irrespective of the ubiquitination status of Nrf2. As new Nrf2 is translated, the Keap1-Cul3 system is quickly saturated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>, ii and iii) and the newly synthesized Nrf2 accumulates in the cell, free of inhibition from the Keap1-Cul3 ubiquitination machinery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>, i) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Baird1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Baird2">[62]</xref>. The Nrf2 inducers tBHQ and sulforaphane have been shown to affect this pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Zhang3">[59]</xref>. Once stabilized, Nrf2 is phosphorylated on its Ser-40 residue, which results in its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of multiple ARE-responsive genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Niture3">[66]</xref>. Several kinases have been reported to either directly or indirectly affect Nrf2 activity, including ERK1/2, casein kinase 2 (CK-2), multiple PKCs and PI3-K/Akt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>, i) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Huang1">[67]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Numazawa1">[72]</xref>.</p>
<p>Several stimuli can induce Nrf2 activation, and virus infection is one of them. The Influenza A virus induced ROS, and as a consequence Nrf2 in alveolar epithelial cells, an event that mitigated the Influenza-induced alveolar toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Kesic1">[73]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Yageta1">[75]</xref>. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) also induced Nrf2 activity during infection of human foreskin fibroblasts, which enhanced the productivity of the infection by decreasing the cytopathic effects of the infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Lee2">[76]</xref>. Hepatitis C virus (HCV), through its core, E1, E2, NS4B and NS5A proteins, induced Nrf2 activity via ROS-dependent and ROS-independent mechanisms involving multiple kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Burdette1">[77]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Lee3">[80]</xref>. Recently, the Marburg virus structural protein VP-24 has been shown to inhibit Keap1 activity and enhance Nrf2-mediated anti-inflammatory responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Edwards1">[81]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Page1">[82]</xref>.</p>
<p>Oxidative stress is essential in development of all four types of KS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Mallery1">[83]</xref> and analysis of KS tissue sections in the present study detected enhanced Nrf2 activity. We hypothesized that KSHV infection of endothelial cells induces ROS levels to manipulate Nrf2. Studies conducted to test this hypothesis demonstrate for the first time that KSHV induces Nrf2 activity during <italic>de novo</italic> infection of HMVEC-d cells. KSHV binding, signaling, gene expression and cytokine induction play important roles in inducing Nrf2 activity by mediating its stability, Ser-40 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. This induction required ROS upregulation as well the activity of a series of host kinases induced by KSHV. Nrf2 induction was essential for the transcriptional activation of multiple host and viral genes that play important functions in KSHV infection. Collectively, these data suggest that KSHV has developed multiple mechanisms to induce Nrf2 activity during <italic>de novo</italic> infection, establishing Nrf2 as an important agent in KSHV biology and KS pathogenesis.</p>

At the molecular level, biochemical studies by us and others have demonstrated that KS lesions exhibit substantially elevated levels of pro-inflammatory and stress-associated agents like NF-ÎºB, COX-2 and PGE2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Naranatt1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Bottero2">[22]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-SharmaWalia3">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Paul1">[84]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Paul2">[85]</xref>. A hallmark of the stress response is the activation of the master regulator Nrf2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Nguyen1">[56]</xref>. To determine whether KSHV-positive tissues exhibit enhanced Nrf2 activity, we performed an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). KS tissue samples exhibited substantially higher levels of Nrf2 compared to normal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Moreover, while Nrf2 in healthy tissue localized mostly in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, top enlarged box, white arrows), we observed that Nrf2 localized predominantly in the nuclei of KS tissue cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, bottom enlarged box, red arrows) in addition to the cytoplasmic distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>, bottom enlarged box, white arrows).</p>

<p>Ser-40 phosphorylation of Nrf2 is an essential step in its activation that is required for its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation, resulting in the augmentation of Nrf2-dependent gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Zhang3">[59]</xref>. To determine if the increased nuclear Nrf2 observed in KS tissues is of the phosphorylated, active form, we reacted the tissues with an antibody specific to Ser-40-phosphorylated Nrf2 (pNrf2). As expected, the level of pNrf2 in healthy tissue cells was undetectable in the nucleus or the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, top two rows), indicating low Nrf2 activity. In contrast, KS tissue exhibited elevated levels of pNrf2, which predominantly colocalized with cells expressing latency-associated LANA-1, a common marker of KSHV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, bottom row).</p>
<p>To determine if Nrf2 activation was linked with KSHV infection, we quantified the association between KSHV infection of a cell and its pNrf2 levels by counting all DAPI-staining cells in a particular field (red boxes on the bottom row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) and considered that as the total number of cells within that field. Cells with only LANA-1 staining overlapping with DAPI were categorized as KSHV+/pNrf2â, while cells that displayed only detectable pNrf2 staining were categorized as KSHVâ/pNrf2+. Cells with no staining other than DAPI were categorized as KSHVâ/pNrf2â, while those that displayed a triple colocalization of the two proteins and DAPI were categorized as KSHV+/pNrf2+. By this method, &gt;65% of the cells were positive for both LANA-1 and high levels of pNrf2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, KSHV+/pNrf2+). Fewer than 14% of the cells were LANA-1-deficient and exhibited high levels of pNrf2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, KSHVâ/pNrf2+), while only 10% of the cells expressed LANA-1 but showed undetectable levels of pNrf2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, KSHV+/pNrf2â).</p>
<p>Because KS tissue may contain uninfected or non-endothelial bystander cells that may confound the observed increased Nrf2 activity, we compared the level of pNrf2 in KS areas abundant in spindle-shaped cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>, area enclosed by dashed white line) to areas of tissue scarce in spindle-shaped cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>, surrounding area). The spindle-shaped cells, in addition to their typical elongated nuclei, exhibited a high level of LANA-1 as well as pNrf2 staining in contrast to the cells in the surrounding areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). Moreover, mostly white staining, representing the triple-colocalization of pNrf2, LANA-1 and DAPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>), was observed in the enlarged image of the merged panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>, red arrows), which clearly suggested a predominantly nuclear localization of pNrf2 and LANA-1 in KS tissue.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results demonstrated that KS skin tissue exhibits elevated levels of active, nuclear Nrf2, and that this effect correlates strongly with KSHV infection.</p>

<p>Since KSHV-infected tissues had increased Nrf2 activity, we next determined whether <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection induces Nrf2 activity in endothelial cells.

To determine and quantitate virus binding and entry-mediated signaling pathways, we serum-starved HMVEC-d cells for 8 hr to reduce the signals induced by the serum (growth factors) in the culture medium. We then infected the cells for the indicated time points, and the levels of total Nrf2 (tNrf2) and pNrf2 were assessed by immunoblot analysis. We observed a 1.8-fold induction of tNrf2 as early as 30 min p.i., which steadily increased to â¼5-fold at 2 hr p.i. and was sustained during the monitored period of 8 hr p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, second panel). We also observed a robust â¼4-fold induction of pNrf2 as early as 30 min p.i., which peaked to 8-fold at 2 hr p.i. and was sustained during 8 hr p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, first panel). PKC-Î¶ phosphorylation was used as an infection marker, as it has been previously shown to be induced during <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s002">Fig. S2A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-SharmaWalia2">[24]</xref>. To determine whether ROS can activate Nrf2 in HMVEC-d cells, we treated the cells with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, a member of the ROS family, and observed an induction in tNrf2 levels to a similar magnitude, indicating a possible role for ROS in tNrf2 accumulation during KSHV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, middle panel). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also induced pNrf2 by a similar magnitude as tNrf2 (â¼1.9 vs. 2.0-fold at 15 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>), suggesting that HMVEC-d cells have a constitutive pathway that readily phosphorylates Nrf2 into pNrf2.</p>

<p>To determine whether the increase in pNrf2 observed during KSHV infection is an indirect result of constitutive tNrf2 phosphorylation, or due to an increase in activity of KSHV-induced kinases during early infection, the ratio of fold induction of pNrf2 to tNrf2 was plotted for each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). If the induction of Nrf2 phosphorylation was constitutive, as with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, one would expect the ratio to be â¼1.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, dashed horizontal line). However, the actual ratio of pNrf2/tNrf2 fold induction was significantly higher than 1.0 throughout the observed course of early infection, 2.3-fold higher at 30 min p.i., leveling to â¼1.6-fold higher at 2 hr p.i. and thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, red line). These results suggested that Nrf2 phosphorylation during KSHV infection involves signaling kinase(s) induced by <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection. The kinetics of Nrf2 phosphorylation are consistent with KSHV signaling kinetics, where signaling occurs early during KSHV entry, followed by a series of cytokine releases that mediate a second wave of signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Sadagopan1">[23]</xref>. The biology of <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection differs widely between early infection, where events are driven by virus-host surface receptor interactions, and late infection, where events are driven by the expression of a few KSHV latent genes. To assess whether latent KSHV infection also induces Nrf2 activation, we performed a Western blot analysis on HMVEC-d cells infected for 18 and 24 hr. We observed a 4.6 and 2.2-fold induction of tNrf2 and a 4.4 and 2.1-fold induction of pNrf2 at 18 and 24 hr p.i., respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these results demonstrated that <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection of HMVEC-d cells induced tNrf2 accumulation and its Ser-40 phosphorylation during the early and late stages of infection.</p>

<p>Phosphorylation of Nrf2 is an important step that leads to its nuclear localization and increased transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Zhang3">[59]</xref>. IFA of uninfected cells and cells infected with KSHV for 2 and 24 hr showed that tNrf2 was elevated throughout the cell (cytoplasm and nucleus) during the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, red and white arrows). pNrf2, on the other hand, accumulated predominantly in the nuclei of infected cells both at 2 and at 24 hr p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, red arrows), while no cytoplasmic accumulation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>, white arrows). Western blotting of fractionated cytoplasmic and nuclear protein from uninfected and infected cells corroborated the IFA data. Specifically, the levels of tNrf2 were induced by 1.7, 6.0 and 2.6-fold in the cytoplasm at 0.5, 2 and 24 hr p.i., respectively, while pNrf2 was induced by 2.7, 4.3 and 3.0-fold at the same time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, lanes 1â4). The nuclear protein fraction also exhibited a robust increase in tNrf2 by 4.2, 4.8 and 3.3-fold and pNrf2 by 4.3, 5.0 and 4.1-fold at 0.5, 2 and 24 hr p.i., respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>, lanes 5â8). Interestingly, although IFA at 2 hr p.i. showed predominantly nuclear pNrf2, the western blot assay demonstrated both nuclear and cytoplasmic pNrf2 accumulation at the same time point. The explanation for this discrepancy remains elusive, and is likely due to the different sensitivity of the pNrf2 antibody used in these different techniques.

<title><italic>De novo</italic> KSHV infection does not induce a high level of Nrf2 transcription</title>
<p>Because of the necessity to respond to stress in a rapid manner, cells constitutively translate new Nrf2 protein. However, under unstressed conditions, these cells maintain low Nrf2 protein levels by shunting it towards the proteasome through the ROS-dependent Keap1-Cul3 ubiquitination axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Zhang3">[59]</xref>.

<p>A KSHV-mediated increase in Nrf2 protein levels, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g002">figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g003">3</xref>, could be either due to upregulation of Nrf2 transcription, or due to modulation of Nrf2 protein stability through destabilization of the Keap1-Cul3 axis. To determine whether KSHV induces total Nrf2 levels by increasing its transcriptional levels, we performed real-time RT-PCR analysis using Nrf2-specific primers. We observed a 1.2, 1.8 and 1.4-fold induction of Nrf2 mRNA at 2, 8 and 24 hr p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). While statistically significant, the fold induction of the transcript is substantially lower than the fold induction of Nrf2 protein observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g002">figure 2A</xref>, explaining only in part the observed increase in total Nrf2 protein. Moreover, because the induction of Nrf2 protein preceded the induction of its transcript, the increase in Nrf2 transcript is likely a consequence and not a significant cause of increased Nrf2 protein.

<title>ROS induction during <italic>de novo</italic> infection is essential for Nrf2 upregulation</title>
<p>Since transcriptional upregulation may not be the only reason for the observed Nrf2 protein increase, we focused on the main post-translational modifier of Nrf2, the Keap1-Cul3 ubiquitination axis. Keap1 is highly abundant in cysteine residues, an amino acid that contains highly reactive thiol groups (-SH). When ROS levels increase, neighboring thiol groups of Keap1 get oxidized by the highly nucleophilic electrons present on oxygen radicals, and interact with one-another to form disulfide bonds (R-<bold>S-O-S</bold>-R), leading to conformational and functional changes in Keap1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Ma1">[87]</xref>. It is for this reason that the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction is especially sensitive to ROS, which we have shown to be induced during early as well as later stages of <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection of HMVEC-d cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Bottero1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>To determine if ROS are responsible for the induction of tNrf2 by KSHV, we utilized N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), two well-characterized anti-oxidants. At 2 hr p.i., cells pretreated with NAC exhibited decreased pNrf2 and tNrf2 induction by 82% and 77%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Similarly, PDTC pretreatment inhibited pNrf2 and tNrf2 induction by 87% and 96%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Because NAC and PDTC can affect cells in ROS-independent ways, as in the case of their inhibition of NF-ÎºB, we used an additional ROS inhibitor, Diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), which has been shown to inhibit ROS in macrophages and endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Hayakawa1">[88]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Stuehr1">[89]</xref>. Similarly to NAC and PDTC, DPI treatment of uninfected HMVEC-d cells reduced, albeit weakly, the levels of pNrf2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, lanes 1â6), likely by decreasing basal ROS activity. More importantly, DPI pretreatment significantly reduced KSHV-mediated tNrf2 and pNrf2 induction in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>, lanes 7â12), while not affecting KSHV-mediated NF-ÎºB activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>). These results further confirmed the importance of ROS induction in Nrf2 activation.</p>

PDTC pretreatment inhibited pNrf2 and tNrf2 induction by 93% and 88%, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s002">Fig. S2C</xref>, lane 4). Both drugs decreased tNrf2 levels below basal levels when compared to uninfected/untreated cells, which is most likely due to their anti-oxidative properties decreasing ROS levels of the cells below basal, an effect which increases Keap1 activity and Nrf2 degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s002">Fig. 2SC</xref>, compare lanes 3 and 4 to 1). Such findings were corroborated by IFA analysis, which showed that the KSHV-mediated pNrf2 nuclear localization at 2 and 24 hr p.i. was substantially abrogated by pretreatment with NAC and PDTC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s002">Fig. S2D</xref>). However, we have shown previously that pretreatment of the cells with anti-oxidants drastically reduces the entry and infectivity of KSHV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Bottero1">[16]</xref>. Therefore, the inhibition of Nrf2 induction observed at 24 hr p.i. by NAC or PDTC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s002">Fig. S2C</xref>, left) may be a result of reduced KSHV infection and not necessarily due to the dependence of this induction on ROS. To address this potential confounding variable, we performed a similar experiment where NAC or PDTC were not added to the cells until 16 hr p.i., a time when latency has already been established. Eight hours after NAC or PDTC addition (24 hr p.i.), the cells were immunoblotted for Nrf2 activity. NAC treatment of the latently-infected cells inhibited tNrf2 and pNrf2 induction by 62% and 46%, respectively, while PDTC inhibited their induction by 23% and 56%, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s002">Fig. S2C</xref>, lanes 5â8). These results clearly demonstrated the importance of ROS elevation in Nrf2 activation during early KSHV latency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s002">Fig. S2C</xref>, compare lanes 7 and 8 to 5). It is important to note that there was still some induction of pNrf2 and tNrf2 above the basal levels in uninfected cells, which suggested additional, ROS-independent mechanisms of induction at this time point.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results demonstrated that KSHV-mediated ROS induction is essential for Nrf2 upregulation during the early stages of infection, and although ROS are important for latent Nrf2 induction, additional pathways are likely involved.</p>

<title>KSHV induces Nrf2 stabilization by modulating the Nrf2-Keap1 interaction and decreasing its ubiquitination</title>
<p>Since ROS were involved in KSHV-mediated Nrf2 upregulation, we next determined the effect of KSHV infection on Keap1, the centerpiece of the ROS-dependent Nrf2-ubiquitination machinery. As expected, KSHV infection induced tNrf2 and pNrf2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>, top two panels). Simultaneously, we observed a decrease in Keap1 levels to 0.8 and 0.3-fold at 0.5 and 2 hr p.i. when compared to uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>, third panel, lanes 1â3). The levels of Keap1 were restored to that of uninfected cells at 24 hr p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>, third panel, lanes 4â5) and real-time RT-PCR analysis suggested that this could be due to increased levels of Keap1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). This positive regulatory feedback loop that exists between Nrf2 and the Keap1 gene promoter has been previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Lee4">[90]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although a decrease in absolute Keap1 levels is a strong indicator of its decreased inhibitory activity on Nrf2, we wanted to determine how <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection affects Nrf2-Keap1 interaction <italic>per se</italic>. According to the âopen-closed conformationâ model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s001">Fig. S1</xref>), if KSHV disrupts Keap1-Cul3 cycling, we would not expect an increase in the interaction levels between Nrf2 and Keap1 despite an increase in total Nrf2 levels, because Keap1 molecules are complexed with already ubiquitinated Nrf2. To assess this, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) studies by pulling down with anti-Keap1 antibody and Western blotted for Nrf2. When normalizing to whole cell lysate (WCL) Î²-tubulin, we observed a decrease in co-IPed Nrf2 by 13, 40 and 2% at 0.5, 2 and 24 hr p.i., (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>, first and second panel, and quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>, top graph-black bars). Moreover, when accounting for robust WCL Nrf2 induction, the relative interaction between Keap1-Nrf2 decreased 65%, 84% and 43% at 0.5, 2 and 24 hr p.i., respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>, top graph-white bars). Such findings demonstrated that new Nrf2 is being generated and is not being bound and targeted by the Keap1-Cul3 inhibitory axis.</p>
<p>To further demonstrate that these events lead to decreased Nrf2 degradation, we determined the levels of lysine-48 (K-48) ubiquitination of Nrf2, a marker for its proteasomal degradation, and compared to the overall induction of Nrf2 in the WCL. As expected, when normalized to Î²-tubulin, the ubiquitination levels of Nrf2 increased slightly by 30, 24 and 10% at 0.5, 2 and 24 hr p.i., respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>, third panel, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>, bottom graph-black bars), likely due to the increased amount of Nrf2 pulled down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>, fourth panel). As a consequence, when we normalized to the total Nrf2 pulled down, relative K-48 ubiquitination levels decreased by 48, 68 and 39% at the same time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g004">Fig. 4G</xref>, bottom graph-white bars), indicating that although KSHV infection results in a slight increase in Nrf2-Keap1 pulled down, a lesser fraction of it is in the ubiquitinated form.</p>
<p>Collectively, these Nrf2-Keap1 pulldown experiments suggested that KSHV infection likely strengthens the already existent, ubiquitinated Nrf2 interaction with Keap1, resulting in Keap1 saturation and possible degradation, while concomitantly allowing the newly-translated Nrf2 to rapidly accumulate in the non-ubiquitinated and active form.</p>

<title>KSHV binding is important for early Nrf2 induction</title>
<p>To determine if KSHV interaction with its cell-surface binding and entry receptors is necessary for Nrf2 activation, we incubated KSHV with heparin, which interacts with the virus envelope glycoproteins and prevents their interaction with heparan sulfate, thereby blocking KSHV-mediated binding and associated signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Akula1">[7]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Hahn1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Wang2">[11]</xref>.

<p>While KSHV infection of untreated HMVEC-d cells induced tNrf2 and pNrf2 by 1.7 and 2.3-fold, respectively, the Src-specific inhibitor PP2 abolished such activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).

<title>Lentiviral transduction with shNrf2 abolishes KSHV-mediated Nrf2 target gene induction</title>
<p>Nrf2 transcriptionally activates genes involved in a variety of functions such as ROS homeostasis, apoptosis, cell migration, angiogenesis and drug resistance. KSHV-mediated Nrf2 induction may prime the cell and provide an environment conducive to KSHV infection, especially considering that several Nrf2-target genes are induced during <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection. To determine what particular host genes KSHV infection induces in an Nrf2-dependent manner, we created HMVEC-d cells deficient in Nrf2 by transducing them with lentiviral vectors expressing either short hairpin RNA against the Renilla luciferase mRNA (shRLâcontrol) or short hairpin RNA against Nrf2 mRNA (shNrf2). These cells were then infected with KSHV for various time points and the level of Nrf2 activity was assessed for each condition. To assess the efficiency of the knockdown, we performed real-time RT-PCR analysis using Nrf2-specific primers. We observed a consistent â¼50â60% reduction in Nrf2 mRNA in shNrf2 cells compared to shRL cells during the whole course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). To further verify the knockdown efficiency, Western blot analysis was carried out to determine the protein levels of Nrf2. We observed a drastic reduction in Nrf2 protein levels in shNrf2 cells compared to shRL cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s004">Fig. S4A</xref>).

<p>Next, we determined the effect of the knockdown on the induction of several well-characterized Nrf2 target genes involved in ROS homeostasis. NAD(P)H quinone oxidase 1 (NQO1) is an important anti-oxidative agent involved in the clearance of quinones and hydroquinones, and is considered a reliable reporter of Nrf2 transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Kensler1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Thimmulappa1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Ma1">[87]</xref>.

<p>In addition to stress-related genes, we observed other genes that are induced by <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection and that have also been shown recently to be Nrf2 target genes.

Upregulation in VEGF-A gene expression was dependent on Nrf2 at 8 hr p.i., since infection of shNrf2 cells did not show any increase at this time, but was independent of Nrf2 at 24 hr p.i. as it showed a 2.4-fold upregulation at this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>, red bars).

<p>To determine if VEGF-A secretion levels were dependent on Nrf2 expression similarly to its gene expression, we performed a VEGF ELISA on the supernatant of infected cells.

<title>Nrf2 activity is important for COX-2 transcriptional induction by KSHV</title>

<p>Because Nrf2 is a transcription factor, we explored the possibility of Nrf2 playing an important role in COX-2 induction by direct binding to the COX-2 promoter. When we analyzed the sequence of the COX-2 promoter, we identified two Nrf2 binding sites (ARE-consensus sequence - TGAnnnnGC) on the template strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>, red arrows). Moreover, the coding strand also provided a sequence pattern containing multiple ARE-like domains (grey arrows), which contained either an extra or missing base-pair between the required TGA and GC (TGAnnnnnGC or TGAnnnGC).

<p>Because COX-2 is also induced by KSHV latency, we wanted to determine if latent gene expression is important for Nrf2 induction during the later stages of <italic>de novo</italic> infection. Ultraviolet (UV) light treatment of KSHV creates thymidine dimers between adjacent thymine residues of its DNA, and this abolishes its ability to replicate or properly express its genome. This process, however, does not affect the envelope and capsid of the virion, creating a virus that is incapable of establishing proper latent infection, but still capable of inducing early, gene expression-independent events propagated by virion-host interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-SharmaWalia2">[24]</xref>.

<p>To assess which KSHV latent gene(s) was responsible for the observed Nrf2 induction, HMVEC-d cells were transduced with lentiviruses expressing four known latent KSHV genes (ORFs 71, 72, 73 and K12) along with two vector controls (pSIN A and pSIN B). Real-time RT- PCR analysis revealed that all latent genes were successfully expressed in their respective transductions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s006">Fig. S6B</xref>). Of the four KSHV genes, only transduction with ORF71 (vFLIP) significantly upregulated NQO1 and HO1 mRNA expression, suggesting that vFLIP might be an important inducer of Nrf2 activity during later stages of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>).

Real-time RT-PCR assessment of Nrf2 transcript did not show any significant changes during vFLIP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g009">Fig. 9D</xref>), indicating that vFLIP induces the Nrf2 axis through non-transcriptional pathways.

<title>KSHV-infected HMVEC-d cells have enhanced intracellular pNrf2 during latency</title>
<p>Results described above in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g009">Fig. 9</xref> demonstrated that latent KSHV induces Nrf2 activity in the whole population of infected cells. At the single-cell level, vFLIP expression may affect Nrf2 activity either i) by inducing intracellular signaling pathways that affect Nrf2 activity within the same cell or ii) by inducing secretion of cytokines (PGE2) and other signaling ligands, which, through autocrine and paracrine signaling, can induce Nrf2 activity in adjacent cells. In the first scenario, only infected cells would exhibit enhanced Nrf2 activity, whereas in the later, both infected and adjacent uninfected cells would exhibit enhanced Nrf2 levels. To differentiate between these two possibilities, we performed an IFA on HMVEC-d cells infected with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled KSHV. Such a technique allowed us to determine precisely which cells were infected with KSHV by staining with an anti-BrdU antibody, while simultaneously observing pNrf2 activity by staining with anti-pNrf2 antibody.</p>
<p>As expected, the cells in the uninfected condition (negative control) showed no BrdU staining and low levels of pNrf2 in their nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g010">Fig. 10A</xref>, top row). In contrast, cells in the BrdU-KSHV condition showed significant BrdU staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g010">Fig. 10A</xref>, bottom 3 rows, second column). Colocalization of pNrf2 with BrdU-labeled KSHV genome was readily observed in the infected cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g010">Fig. 10A</xref>, bottom 3 rows, enlarged box, yellow arrows). More interestingly, in the infected condition, all the cells (14/14 or 100%) that stained for BrdU-KSHV also demonstrated high levels of pNrf2 in their nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g010">Fig. 10A</xref>, bottom 3 rows, first column, red arrows). Most uninfected cells (9/13 or â¼70%) showed very low to undetectable levels of pNrf2 staining (white arrows). However, a minority of uninfected cells (4/13 or â¼30%) showed some increase in pNrf2 activity (blue arrows), and these cells were often adjacent to the infected cells, possibly influenced by their paracrine effect. We confirmed that BrdU-KSHV infection induces pNrf2 in the nuclei of the cells through confocal imaging, which provides better resolution. Specifically, two cells, one positive and one negative for BrdU-KSHV staining, were visualized within the same field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g010">Fig. 10B</xref>). Corroborating the IFA data, the infected cell exhibited substantially elevated levels of pNrf2 in the nucleus compared to the adjacent uninfected cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g010">Fig. 10B</xref>).</p>

<p>We next determined whether pNrf2 and LANA-1 colocalized together on the KSHV genome or elsewhere in the nucleus, where they may affect gene expression. To determine possible triple-colocalization we performed PLA for pNrf2 and LANA-1 (green dots) and stained the EdU-labeled virus (red) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g011">Fig. 11C</xref>). Using the BrdU-labeled KSHV was not feasible for this experiment because the IFA procedure for BrdU labeling requires DNA denaturation, a process that interferes with the PLA procedure. Interestingly, we observed that about half of the pNrf2-LANA-1 PLA puncta colocalized with the EdU-KSHV genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g011">Fig. 11C</xref>, bottom panel, white arrows), suggesting a possible interaction of all these three agents.

<title>Nrf2 modulation does not affect KSHV entry</title>
<p>Since Nrf2 associated with the KSHV genome, we wanted to determine its effects on KSHV biology.

<title>Nrf2 knockdown does not affect ROS levels in HMVEC-d cells</title>
<p>The results of the entry experiments were surprising, as we had anticipated Nrf2 knockdown to increase KSHV entry due to increased basal ROS levels. To test whether knockdown of Nrf2 in HMVEC-d cells results in elevated ROS, we performed a ROS measurement experiment in cells transduced with shNrf2 and shGFP (shRNA against green fluorescent proteinânegative control). The use of shRL-expressing lentivirus used in most of the experiments was avoided in this experiment because the vector that expresses shRL also expresses GFP (used to monitor transduction efficiency), which has the same excitation/emission spectrum as the CM-H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA dye, and would interfere with ROS measurement. As we have previously shown, KSHV-infected HMVEC-d cells produced 2â3-fold more ROS than uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s007">Fig. S7F</xref>). To our surprise, Nrf2 knockdown did not affect the basal ROS levels in uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g012">Fig. 12B</xref>, compare shGFP U.I. with shNrf2 U.I.). Moreover, KSHV-mediated ROS induction was unchanged between the two cell conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g012">Fig. 12B</xref>, compare shGFP+KSHV with shNrf2+KSHV). Similarly, Nrf2 knockdown did not affect basal ROS production or KSHV-induced ROS even at 24 hr p.i. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s007">Fig. S7G</xref>). Real-time RT-PCR analysis of Nrf2 mRNA demonstrated that the lentiviral knockdown of shNrf2 cells was successful (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s007">Fig. S7B</xref>).</p>
<p>These results demonstrated that basal Nrf2-levels are dispensable for ROS homeostasis in HMVEC-d cells and that KSHV-mediated Nrf2 induction does not affect the induction of ROS during <italic>de novo</italic> infection, suggesting no role for Nrf2 in KSHV entry.</p>

<title>Nrf2 knockdown decreases the early KSHV lytic gene expression burst</title>
<p>Our earlier studies have determined that <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection of HMVEC-d cells inevitably results in the establishment of latency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Krishnan2">[26]</xref>. Indeed, we observed a steady increase in ORF73 gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s008">Fig. S8C</xref>), whose product, LANA-1, is essential for maintenance of viral latency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Krishnan2">[26]</xref>. However, before latency is established, a transient expression of lytic genes with anti-apoptotic and immune-evasive functions peaks at the earlier stages of infection and subsides as latency takes over <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Krishnan2">[26]</xref>. We observed a robust expression of ORF50, the master regulator of lytic gene expression, which decreased by 24 hr p.i. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s008">Fig. S8D</xref>).</p>
<p>Since Nrf2 knockdown did not affect KSHV entry or nuclear delivery, and because Nrf2 colocalized with LANA-1 on the KSHV genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g011">Fig. 11</xref>), we further wanted to determine if Nrf2 plays a role in the proper establishment of KSHV latency by affecting the normal course of viral gene expression during the early stages of <italic>de novo</italic> infection. As expected, infection of shRL cells produced a viral expression pattern similar to that of untransduced cells, with ORF50 peaking at 8 hr p.i., declining by 24 hr p.i., and becoming essentially undetectable by 48 hr p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g012">Fig. 12D</xref>, black bars). Interestingly, ORF50 expression during the infection of shNrf2 cells was reduced by 47 and 64% at 8 and 24 hr p.i., respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g012">Fig. 12D</xref>, red bars).

The knockdown for each condition was efficient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s008">Fig. S8E</xref>), and KSHV infection was able to induce NQO1 gene expression in shRL cells, but not shNrf2 cells, as we previously determined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s008">Fig. S8F</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess how Nrf2 knockdown increased LANA-1 expression, we performed an IFA analysis of LANA-1 during the infection of shRL and shNrf2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g013">Fig. 13A</xref>). As expected, the shRL condition consisted of cells expressing GFP, which is part of the shRL lentiviral vector used to measure transduction efficiency. In contrast, the shNrf2 lentiviral vector does not code for GFP. For the purposes of this experiment, fields from the shRL condition containing â¼50% transduction efficiency were obtained to more accurately assess if control vector (shRL) lentiviral transduction had any effects on subsequent KSHV infectivity. As observed by the quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g013">Fig. 13B</xref>, the same percentage of GFP-positive cells and GFP-negative cells, â¼60%, were infected with KSHV, arguing against a possible role for the control lentiviral transduction in affecting subsequent KSHV infectivity.

<p>KSHV is the etiological agent of KS, and the importance of oxidative stress in the development of KS pathogenesis has been shown before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Mallery1">[83]</xref>. In this comprehensive study, we have demonstrated for the first time that <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection of endothelial cells induces the powerful transcription factor Nrf2.

We also show that Nrf2 induction is required for optimal COX-2 expression seen during KSHV infection, which through its enzymatic product PGE2 further induced Nrf2 activity, creating a feed-forward loop between these two molecules at later time points of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g014">Fig. 14</xref>). For a better understanding, we have summarized the potential implications of the multiple roles that Nrf2 plays in KSHV biology in the following sections.</p>

<title>Schematic diagram showing Nrf2 induction and consequences during <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection of endothelial cells.</title>
<p><bold>Phase I</bold>. KSHV binding to cellular receptors induces signaling that involves multiple kinases and ROS. ROS induction inhibits degradation of Nrf2 by the Keap1-Cul3 ubiquitination axis, allowing for its rapid accumulation inside the cells. Signaling kinases induced by the interaction of KSHV with its cell-surface receptors to facilitate virus entry and gene expression also mediate Nrf2 phosphorylation, which serves to further stabilize Nrf2 by decreasing its association with Keap1 as well as by increasing its nuclear localization. Nrf2 nuclear localization induces expression of well-known anti-oxidative target genes as well as additional genes such as COX-2, Bcl-2 and VEGF. <bold>Phase II</bold>. As the original signaling wanes, the Nrf2-mediated COX-2 induction releases PGE2 in the surrounding environment, which in turn induces Nrf2 activation via autocrine and paracrine signaling pathways involving PKC-Î¶. This establishes a feed-forward loop where Nrf2 activation induces COX-2 expression, which releases PGE2 and mediates further Nrf2 activation. As latency initiates, vFLIP expression further fuels the COX-2/PGE2 axis, and likely other pathways, to augment Nrf2 activity. <bold>Phase III</bold>. As virus establishes latency, Nrf2 activity appears to be important at several levels in its biology, as its inhibition upregulates ORF73 expression and decreases ORF50 and other lytic expression. Nrf2 also colocalizes with the major latency protein, LANA-1, as determined by PLA, and both colocalized with the KSHV genome, probably modulating the expression of viral and host genes.</p>

<title>Nrf2 stability during <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection</title>
<p>Although the importance of Keap1 in Nrf2 inhibition and degradation has long been known, the precise mechanism how this interaction is affected by ROS and other Nrf2 inducers was just recently elucidated. Oxidative stress, Sulforaphane and tBHQ stabilize Nrf2 not by directly dissociating it from Keap1, but by increasing the binding of existent, ubiquitinated Nrf2 with the Keap1-Cul3 ubiquitination axis, thus allowing newly synthesized Nrf2 to accumulate untargeted in the cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Baird1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Baird2">[62]</xref>. Kobayashi <italic>et al</italic> (2006) had shown that <italic>de novo</italic> Nrf2 protein synthesis was required for Nrf2 nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation by ROS, further validating this model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Kobayashi2">[111]</xref>. Indeed, our results are in full concordance with this novel mechanism. KSHV infection of HMVEC-d cells did not significantly affect the levels of Nrf2 precipitated by Keap1 pull-down despite a robust increase in cellular Nrf2 protein levels, most of which was in an un-ubiquitinated form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g004">Fig. 4F</xref>). This process was ROS-dependent, as inhibition of ROS with the NAC, PDTC and DPI abrogated KSHV-mediated Nrf2 induction. Collectively, these results strongly suggested that KSHV induces ROS, an event that thiolizes the cysteine residues located in the linker region of Keap1, disrupting the fluidity of the âclosed-to-openâ conformational cycling of the inhibitory machinery, saturating the Keap1-Cul3 system, and allowing Nrf2 to accumulate in the cytoplasm of HMVEC-d cells early during <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection.</p>
<p>Novel pathways that may affect Nrf2 stability are under intense scrutiny. Specifically, it has been shown that GSK-3Î² mediates phosphorylation of certain serine residues on the Neh6 domain of Nrf2, increasing its affinity for another E3 ubiquitin ligase, Î²-TrCP, which is believed to mediate Nrf2 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Chowdhry1">[40]</xref>.

<title>Nrf2 phosphorylation during <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection</title>
<p>KSHV infection of endothelial cells and fibroblasts induces the host's pre-existing Src, PI3-K/Akt, PKC-Î¶ and ERK1/2 signal pathways. This induction is important for several functions that aid in KSHV infection, including cytoskeletal rearrangements that help in virus entry and nuclear delivery, as well as viral gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Chakraborty1">[14]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Veettil2">[21]</xref>. We have also shown that ROS induction is essential for activation of FAK, Src and EphA2 receptor because pretreatment of the cells with NAC prior to KSHV infection abolished their induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Bottero1">[16]</xref>. Interestingly, similarly to kinase inhibitors (i.e. PP2, Wortmannin, LY294002 and Myr-PKC-Î¶), ROS inhibitors such as NAC, PDTC and DPI also abolished Nrf2 phosphorylation and stability. The effect on total Nrf2 accumulation is most likely attributed to inhibition of the Keap1-Cul3 axis. The surprising effect of KSHV-induced ROS in Nrf2 phosphorylation is most likely attributed to its important role in amplifying the highly interdependent phosphorylation cascade.</p>
<p>Although Src, PI3-K and PKC-Î¶ activity was important in mediating Nrf2 activation, their inhibition affected Nrf2 behavior in distinct ways. Specifically, the Src-specific inhibitor PP2 affected Nrf2 accumulation and phosphorylation in both uninfected and infected cells, suggesting that not only is Src important for Nrf2 activity in infected cells, but also that it affects its constitutive phosphorylation levels in uninfected cells. PKC-Î¶ inhibition, on the other hand, did not affect total Nrf2 levels in either the infected or uninfected conditions, but it fully abolished Nrf2 phosphorylation in both cases. PI3-K inhibition did not affect Nrf2 levels or phosphorylation in uninfected cells. However, while KSHV infection of HMVEC-d cells strongly induced Nrf2 activity, infection of PI3-K-inhibited cells resulted in Nrf2 inhibition. This is a very interesting finding that can be used to affect the Nrf2 response during <italic>de novo</italic> infection, as modulation of a single agent, PI3-K, may be able to switch the fate of Nrf2 during <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection from induction to inhibition.</p>
<p>Our earlier studies have established a linear signaling pathway that starts with FAK and continues with Src, PI3-K, PKC-Î¶ and ERK1/2 in sequential order <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Chandran1">[6]</xref>. If the same linearity applied to the signaling cascade that mediates Nrf2 activity, one would expect that interruption of this pathway at any point during its course would have the same effect on Nrf2 stability and phosphorylation. However, given the different effects that the inhibition of Src, PI3-K and PKC-Î¶ kinases had on Nrf2 stability and phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g005">Fig. 5AâF</xref>), it is much more likely that this linear network branches off at certain sites to include additional factors important in Nrf2 activity. Interestingly, CKII, MAPK p38, JNK, etc., are kinases that may affect Nrf2 behavior, and further studies that are beyond the scope of the present one are required to decipher their role in KSHV-mediated Nrf2 activity.</p>

<title>Nrf2 and host gene induction during <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection</title>
<p>In a previous study, we performed global host gene expression mapping at 2 and 4 hr p.i. and determined that KSHV infection of HMVEC-d cells upregulates expression of a myriad of genes involved in anti-apoptotic functions (Bcl2A1, Bcl-3), signal transduction (PKC and MAPK), cytokine signaling (IL-1Î²), angiogenesis (VEGF-A), and metabolism (COX-2, PFK-2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Naranatt2">[113]</xref>. Expanding on such findings, in the current study we determined that Nrf2 was essential in upregulating the transcription of several KSHV-induced genes not previously identified, likely due to the time points selected in the previous investigations (2 and 4 hr p.i. in Naranatt <italic>et al</italic> (2004) vs. 8 and 24 hr p.i. in this study) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Naranatt2">[113]</xref>. Interestingly, several of the genes that KSHV induced in an Nrf2-dependent manner, such as anti-apoptosis (Bcl-2), metabolism (COX-2, G6PD, TALDO/TKT) and angiogenesis (VEGF-A and -D), fall in similar categories to those identified by Naranatt <italic>et al</italic> (2004) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Naranatt2">[113]</xref>. It is interesting to point out that Bcl-2 is an important anti-apoptotic factor and, like Bcl2A1, helps KSHV infection bypass apoptosis, an important barrier inherent in virus infection, as well as autophagy, a pathway well-known to antagonize KSHV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Marquez1">[114]</xref>.</p>
<p>We also identified three new KSHV-induced genes that play an important role in shunting glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), TALDO, TKT and G6PD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Mitsuishi2">[49]</xref>. Such an induction could serve multiple functions, and a recent study by Mitsuishi <italic>et al</italic> (2012) showed that one of these functions is an increase in ribulose-5-phosphate, a crucial precursor in nucleotide synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Mitsuishi2">[49]</xref>. This increase may provide a reservoir of nucleotides available for KSHV to utilize in i) the synthesis of host genes that are crucial in its infection or ii) the synthesis of viral genes during its early lytic burst (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s004">Fig. S4D</xref> for schematic of PPP).</p>
<p>Additionally, although Nrf2 was important for the transcription of several genes, they often followed different expression kinetics. For example, COX-2 and NQO1 peaked as early as 2 hr p.i., while HO1 showed no induction until 8 hr p.i. and subsided thereafter. VEGF and GCS showed Nrf2-dependence at 8 hr p.i. but seemed to be independent of Nrf2 activity at 24 hr p.i., while Bcl-2 steadily increased during the course of infection in an entirely Nrf2-dependent manner. These different patterns of transcript upregulation indicate that while Nrf2 plays an important role in the KSHV induction of these genes, assembly at the promoter of each gene is also likely affected by a cohort of gene-specific transcriptional cofactors that modulate the kinetics of each gene expression induced by Nrf2.</p>

Its induction by KSHV and the subsequent elevation in PGE2 secretion and signaling has been shown to be important for KSHV latent gene expression and KS pathogenesis. Given the importance of COX-2 in its biology, it is not surprising that KSHV utilizes Nrf2 to induce its transcriptional levels. It was interesting to observe that PGE2, an enzymatic product of COX-2, induced Nrf2 stabilization and phosphorylation through PKC-Î¶ activation. This is an exciting finding that establishes a self-amplifying feed-forward loop between two important agents in KSHV biology. Indeed, an initial signaling event that is initiated by virion-host receptor interaction induces Nrf2 activity, which is necessary for COX-2 upregulation and PGE2 secretion, which further induces Nrf2 activity long after the original stimulus mediated by virus binding has subsided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g014">Fig. 14</xref>, Phase II). Such sustained Nrf2 activity could additionally help with COX-2 transcription until, and likely even after, vFLIP expression initiates. Interestingly, vFLIP was able to induce transcription of Nrf2 target genes NQO1 and HO1 when lentivirally transduced in HMVEC-d cells. The exact mechanism of vFLIP-mediated Nrf2 induction remains elusive, but it is possible that such induction is dependent on the COX-2/PGE2 axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-SharmaWalia5">[109]</xref>.</p>

<title>Nrf2 and viral gene regulation link during <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection</title>
<p>In long-term latent models, Ye <italic>et al</italic> (2011) showed that inhibiting ROS through NAC abolished TPA-induced lytic reactivation of KSHV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Li1">[27]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Ye2">[29]</xref>. In addition, they showed that addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and upregulation of endogenous ROS induced lytic reactivation of KSHV in latently infected endothelial and PEL cells, and that KSHV-induced signaling kinases were important for such activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Li1">[27]</xref>. However, the mechanisms of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced lytic reactivation were not examined and remained unclear. Our preliminary viral gene expression profile could provide the missing link between H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment and lytic reactivation. Our studies demonstrate that knockdown of Nrf2 results in decreased ORF50 and other lytic gene expression, especially at 8 hr p.i., and an increase in ORF73 expression, implicating Nrf2 as a positive factor for ORF50 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g012">Fig. 12DâF</xref>). It could be possible that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which we showed to induce Nrf2 activity, and the kinases it induces, stabilize Nrf2 and induce its transcriptional activity on factors that upregulate lytic gene expression. It is very important to note that while these interpretations would involve Nrf2 activity as a lytic agent, such conclusions are preliminary, and current studies are underway to fully elucidate Nrf2 activity on latent and lytic gene expression in latent KSHV infection models. Moreover, the effects of Nrf2 on viral gene expression in endothelial and PEL cells may vary drastically, as developmental epigenetic modifications in these cell types are very different, leading to a completely different set of cellular cofactors present in their respective nuclei.</p>
<p>During <italic>de novo</italic> infection, virus gene expression is a dynamic process, and the role of Nrf2 on ORF73 and ORF50 expression may vary depending on time and context. Early, ORF50 (Rta) is expressed at high levels as soon as 30 min p.i., reaching a peak around 2â8 hr p.i., and subsequently declining to minimally detectable levels by 24 hr p.i. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Krishnan2">[26]</xref>. In contrast, only low levels of ORF73 (LANA-1) are detected around 2 hr p.i., but steadily increase over time, peaking around 24 hr p.i. and maintained during the observed period of 5 days p.i. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Krishnan2">[26]</xref>. Rta is shown to initiate ORF73 expression from the LTi (inducible) promoter, and subsequent LANA-1 accumulation promotes its own transcription via the LTc (constitutive) promoter while simultaneously repressing the ORF50 promoter and Rta production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004460-Ganem1">[5]</xref>. The low ORF50 expression in shNrf2-transduced cells and concomitant high expression of ORF73 suggest that during the early stages of KSHV infection of Nrf2-intact cells, Nrf2 could be playing a role in ORF50 induction. These events, in turn, regulate proper ORF73 expression. As LANA-1 accumulates, it could bind to Nrf2, as suggested by our PLA data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g011">Fig. 11</xref>), possibly leading to conformational and functional changes in both proteins, modifying the positive effect that Nrf2 has on ORF50 expression. While ORF50 and other lytic gene expression in the absence of Nrf2 was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g012">Fig. 12DâE</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004460.s007">Fig. S7</xref>), their expression was still detected, likely due to the activity of other well-known ORF50 inducers such as NF-ÎºB and ERK1/2, which in turn can induce ORF73 in an unregulated manner. Induction of very high levels of Nrf2 by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> may lead to low LANA-1 and/or high ORF50 expression during <italic>de novo</italic> infection. Further studies are essential to dissect out the complexity of this scenario, which are beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p>
<p>Overall, here we have demonstrated that KSHV induces Nrf2 during <italic>de novo</italic> infection of HMVEC-d cells through multiple mechanisms, and that this activation served an essential role in the induction of host and viral genes that are important in creating a microenvironment conducive to infection and establishment of latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004460-g014">Fig. 14</xref>). Such knowledge, coupled to the fact that Nrf2 modulators such as Sulforaphane, tBHQ and Trigonelline are easy to administer orally, under clinical trials, and currently with no known side-effects, makes Nrf2 a very appealing target in the fight against KSHV infection.</p>

Briefly, equal amounts of nuclear protein (15 Âµg/condition), as determined by BCA assay, were loaded in each well containing the Nrf2-binding oligo probes (TGAnnnnGC) for 1 hr at room temperature, washed, and sandwiched with an HRP-conjugated anti-Nrf2 antibody for an additional hour prior to chemiluminescent assessment. Thirty Âµg of MCF-7 cell line nuclear extract was used as a positive control for the assay.</p>

<p>PLA (DuoLink, Sigma-Aldrich) was performed using the DuoLink PLA Kit to detect proteinâprotein interactions using fluorescence microscopy as per manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, HMVEC-d cells were cultured and infected with KSHV (20 DNA copies/cell) for 24 hr in 8 chamber microscopic slides, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and blocked with DuoLink blocking buffer for 30 minutes at 37Â°C. Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies against LANA-1 (mouse monoclonal) and pNrf2 (rabbit) diluted in DuoLink antibody diluents for 1 hr, washed and then further incubated for another hour at 37Â°C with species-specific PLA probes under hybridization conditions and in the presence of 2 additional oligonucleotides to facilitate the hybridization only in close proximity (&lt;16 nm). A ligase was then added to join the two hybridized oligonucleotides to form a closed circle and initiate a rolling-circle amplification using the ligated circle as a template after adding an amplification solution to generate a concatemeric product extending from the oligonucleotide arm of the PLA probe. Lastly, a detection solution consisting of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides was added, and the labeled oligonucleotides were hybridized to the concatemeric products. The signal was detected as distinct fluorescent dots in the Texas red channel and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Negative controls consisted of samples treated as described but with only secondary antibodies.</p>

<p><bold>The Nrf2-Keap1-Cul3 interaction model.</bold> <bold>A</bold>) In an unstressed cell, (i) the constitutively translated Nrf2 protein is maintained under control by the Keap1-Cul3 ubiquitination machinery. The two Kelch domains of a Keap1 homodimer bind to the Neh2 domain of one Nrf2 molecule, whereas the BTB domains of Keap1 bind to Cul3. This Nrf2-Keap1-Cul3 complex cycles between two conformations, (ii) closed, during which time the Cul3 E3-ubiquitin ligase mediates Nrf2 ubiquitination, and (iii) open, during which time the ubiquitinated Nrf2 gets degraded by the 26S proteasome. As a result, the Keap1-Cul3 complex is recycled and ready to mediate ubiquitination and degradation of another, newly translated, Nrf2 molecule, maintaining low basal Nrf2 levels. <bold>B</bold>) During times of oxidative stress, alteration in the Keap1 cysteine redox state induces conformational changes that shift the closed-to-open cycling of the Nrf2-Keap1-Cul3 complex towards the closed conformation irrespective of the ubiquitination status of Nrf2 (ii and iii). This impairs the ability of the proteasome to access ubiquitinated Nrf2, which in turn, keeps the Keap1-Cul3 ubiquitination machinery hostage. No recycling of this complex results in its quick saturation, and as a consequence, newly synthesized Nrf2 accumulates in the cell free of degradation by the proteasome (i).</p>
