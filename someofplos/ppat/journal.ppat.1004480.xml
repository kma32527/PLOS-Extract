<abstract>
<p>In chronic infections, pathogens are often in the presence of other microbial species. For example, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is a common and detrimental lung pathogen in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) and co-infections with <italic>Candida albicans</italic> are common. Here, we show that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm formation and phenazine production were strongly influenced by ethanol produced by the fungus <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Ethanol stimulated phenotypes that are indicative of increased levels of cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP), and levels of c-di-GMP were 2-fold higher in the presence of ethanol. Through a genetic screen, we found that the diguanylate cyclase WspR was required for ethanol stimulation of c-di-GMP. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that ethanol stimulates WspR signaling through its cognate sensor WspA, and promotes WspR-dependent activation of Pel exopolysaccharide production, which contributes to biofilm maturation. We also found that ethanol stimulation of WspR promoted <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> colonization of CF airway epithelial cells. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> production of phenazines occurs both in the CF lung and in culture, and phenazines enhance ethanol production by <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Using a <italic>C. albicans adh1</italic>/<italic>adh1</italic> mutant with decreased ethanol production, we found that fungal ethanol strongly altered the spectrum of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> phenazines in favor of those that are most effective against fungi. Thus, a feedback cycle comprised of ethanol and phenazines drives this polymicrobial interaction, and these relationships may provide insight into why co-infection with both <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> has been associated with worse outcomes in cystic fibrosis.</p>

<p>In many human infections, several species of microbes are often present. This is typically the case with the disease cystic fibrosis, characterized by thick mucus in the lungs that is colonized by bacteria and fungi. Here, we show evidence that interactions between the bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and the fungus <italic>Candida albicans</italic> result in attributes of infection that are worse for the human host. We found that ethanol, such as that produced by <italic>C. albicans</italic>, causes increased levels of a signaling molecule in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> that promotes biofilm formation. Biofilm formation by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is associated with infections that are more difficult to treat. Ethanol stimulated <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> colonization of plastic surfaces and airway cells, and we identified components of this mechanism. Fungally-produced ethanol also changes the spectrum of phenazine toxins produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and phenazines are associated with worse lung function in people with cystic fibrosis. In light of the fact that phenazines interact with <italic>C. albicans</italic> to promote ethanol production, we propose a positive feedback loop between <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> that contributes to worse disease. Our findings could have implications for the study and treatment of multi-species infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is an opportunistic pathogen capable of causing severe nosocomial infections and infections in immunocompromised patients. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is a common pathogen of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease that is caused by a mutation in the gene coding for the CFTR ion transporter and strongly associated with chronic, recalcitrant lung infections. Altered CFTR function leads to a fluid imbalance that results in thick, sticky mucus in the lungs that is difficult to clear, thus creating a hospitable environment for microbial growth, biofilm formation, and persistence. While <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is a common microbe in the CF lung, it is rarely the only microbe present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Filkins1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Leclair1">[5]</xref>. Co-infections of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with other bacterial and fungal species are common, and there is a need to understand how these complex multi-species infections impact disease course and treatability. For example, the presence of the fungus <italic>Candida albicans</italic> correlates with more frequent exacerbations and a more rapid loss of lung function in CF patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Chotirmall1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Navarro1">[7]</xref>. Additional studies are needed to determine if the presence of the fungus contributes to more severe disease.</p>
<p>Published reports strongly suggest that in the CF lung, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> forms biofilms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Parsek1">[8]</xref>, described as hearty aggregations of cells in a sessile group lifestyle that includes extracellular matrix comprised of proteins, membrane vesicles, DNA, and exopolysaccharides. A biofilm existence provides many advantages to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> including increased antibiotic tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Davey1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Mah1">[10]</xref>. As with many Gram-negative species, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm formation is positively regulated by the secondary signaling molecule cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Romling1">[11]</xref>. C-di-GMP is formed from two molecules of GTP by diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and its levels inversely correlate to motility. High levels of c-di-GMP promote biofilm formation in a number of ways including via increased matrix production and decreased flagellar motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Baraquet1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Kuchma1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> also produces a class of redox-active virulence factors called phenazines. In CF sputum, the phenazines pyocyanin (PYO) and phenazine-1-carboxylate (PCA) are found in micromolar (5–80 µM) concentrations, and their levels are inversely correlated with lung function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Hunter1">[15]</xref>. Phenazines play a role in the relationships between <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and eukaryotic cells. Several studies have shown how phenazines can negatively affect mammalian physiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Rada1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Denning1">[17]</xref>. In addition, phenazines impact different fungi, including <italic>C. albicans</italic>. At high concentrations, phenazines are toxic to <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and lower concentrations of phenazines reduce fungal respiration and impair growth as hyphae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Morales1">[18]</xref>. Phenazines figure prominently in shaping the chemical ecology within mixed-species communities. For example, when exposed to low concentrations of phenazines, <italic>C. albicans</italic> increases the production of fermentation products such as ethanol by 3 to 5 fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Morales1">[18]</xref>. Furthermore, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-<italic>C. albicans</italic> co-cultures form red derivatives of 5-methyl-phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (5MPCA) that accumulate within fungal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Morales2">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the present study, we show that ethanol produced by <italic>C. albicans</italic> stimulated <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm formation and altered phenazine production. Ethanol caused a decrease in surface motility in both strains PA14 and PAO1 concomitant with a stimulation in levels of c-di-GMP, a second messenger nucleotide that promotes biofilm formation. Through a genetic screen, we found that the diguanylate cyclase WspR, a response regulator of the Wsp chemosensory system, was required for this response. Elements upstream and downstream of WspR signaling were required for the ethanol response. Ethanol no longer stimulated biofilm formation in a mutant lacking WspA, the membrane-localized sensor methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (MCP) that is involved in the activation of WspR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Guvener1">[20]</xref>. In addition, an intact Pel exopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway, known to be stimulated by c-di-GMP derived from the Wsp pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Hickman1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Kulasakara1">[22]</xref>, was also required for ethanol stimulation of biofilm formation. The effects were observed on both abiotic surfaces and a cell culture model for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa-C. albicans</italic> airway colonization. We found that both exogenous and fungally-produced ethanol enhanced the production of two phenazine derivatives known for their antifungal activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Morales2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Chin1">[23]</xref>, 5MPCA and phenazine-1-carboxamide (PCN), through a Wsp-independent pathway and independent of ethanol catabolism. Because phenazines stimulate fungal ethanol production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Morales1">[18]</xref>, we present evidence for a signaling cycle that helps drive this polymicrobial interaction.</p>

<title>Ethanol stimulates biofilm formation and suppresses swarming in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14</title>
<p>Our previously reported findings show that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> produces higher levels of two phenazines, PYO and 5MPCA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Gibson1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Cugini1">[25]</xref>, when cultured with <italic>C. albicans</italic> and that phenazines stimulate <italic>C. albicans</italic> ethanol production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Morales1">[18]</xref>. Thus, we sought to determine how fungally-derived ethanol affects <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. A concentration of 1% ethanol (v/v) was chosen for these studies based on the detection of comparable levels of ethanol in <italic>C. albicans</italic> supernatants from cultures grown with phenazines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Morales1">[18]</xref>. The presence of 1% ethanol in the culture medium did not affect <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> growth in minimal M63 medium with glucose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004480.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) or LB (doubling time of 36±2 min in LB versus 39±2 min in LB with ethanol), or on solid LB medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004480.s001">Fig. S1</xref> inset) except that the final culture yield in M63 was slightly higher in cultures amended with ethanol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004480.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
<p>When we performed a microscopic analysis of the effects of ethanol on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PAO1, we observed a significant increase in attachment of cells to the bottom of a titer dish well within 1 h (15±5 cells per field in vehicle treated compared to 31±6 cells per field in cultures with ethanol, p&lt;0.01) and development of microcolonies was strongly enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004480-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Ethanol also promoted an increase in the number of attached cells and microcolonies in cultures of another <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain, PA14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004480-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Using two assays that assess biofilm-related phenotypes (swarming motility and twitching motility), we sought to gain additional insight into how ethanol impacted biofilm formation. Our initial studies focused on strain PA14. We found that ethanol repressed swarming motility, a behavior that is inversely correlated with biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004480-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). Ethanol did not affect type IV-pili-dependent twitching motility, a form of movement that is required for microcolony formation in biofilms on plastic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004480.s002">Fig. S2B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-OToole1">[26]</xref>.</p>

<title>Ethanol catabolism is not necessary for the inhibition of swarming</title>
<p>Because <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can catabolize ethanol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Mern1">[27]</xref>, we sought to determine if ethanol consumption contributed to the repression of swarming motility. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> first oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde by an ethanol dehydrogenase, ExaA, which requires the cofactor PQQ (pyrroloquinoline quinone) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Mern1">[27]</xref>. Acetaldehyde is further oxidized to acetate by an NAD+ dependent acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ExaC), and the acetate is subsequently oxidized to acetyl-CoA by AcsA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Kretzschmar1">[28]</xref>. We retrieved the <italic>exaA</italic>::Tn<italic>M</italic>, <italic>pqqB</italic>::Tn<italic>M</italic>, and <italic>acsA</italic>::Tn<italic>M</italic> mutants predicted to be defective in ethanol catabolism from the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14 NR transposon library <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Liberati1">[29]</xref> and confirmed the transposon insertion sites by PCR (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for more detail). As predicted, none of these mutants grew with ethanol as the sole carbon source, and growth on glucose was unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004480.s003">Fig. S3A</xref>).</p>
<p>When we used these mutants in the swarm assay, we found no difference in the effects of ethanol on these three ethanol catabolism mutants in comparison to the wild-type parental strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004480.s003">Fig. S3B</xref>) indicating that ethanol catabolism was not required for the ethanol response. Furthermore, other carbon sources such as glycerol, another fungal fermentation product, or choline, another two-carbon alcohol degraded by a PQQ-dependent enzyme, did not inhibit swarming motility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004480.s004">Fig. S4</xref>).</p>

<p>Ethanol stimulated attachment and biofilm formation on plastic and inhibited swarming motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004480-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). These two phenotypes are positively and negatively regulated by levels of the second messenger molecule c-di-GMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Tamayo1">[30]</xref>. Thus, we measured intracellular levels of this dinucleotide in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14 cells grown on swarm plates with or without 1% ethanol for 16.5 h as described previously.

<p>WspR is a response regulator with a GGDEF domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-DArgenio1">[32]</xref>, which is associated with diguanylate cyclase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Guvener1">[20]</xref>. Consistent with the observation that Δ<italic>wspR</italic> continued to swarm on medium with ethanol, c-di-GMP levels were not different between cultures with and without ethanol in the Δ<italic>wspR</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004480-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). These data suggest that WspR activity, and thus c-di-GMP levels, are enhanced by ethanol.</p>
<p>WspR is known to regulate the production of the Pel polysaccharide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Hickman1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Kulasakara1">[22]</xref>, and production of Pel is associated with colony wrinkling and biofilm formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Friedman1">[33]</xref>. After 72 hours on swarm plates, we also observed that ethanol strongly promoted colony wrinkling while the addition of equivalent amounts of other carbon sources, such as glycerol or choline, did not have this effect. Furthermore, the colony wrinkling induced by ethanol was less apparent in a Δ<italic>wspR</italic> strain (not shown) and completely absent in a strain lacking <italic>pelA</italic>, an enzyme required for Pel biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004480-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).

<title>Ethanol induces c-di-GMP signaling in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PAO1 through WspA and WspR</title>
<p>As we found that ethanol stimulated biofilm formation in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> wild-type strains PA14 and PAO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004480-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) and that WspR mediated the ethanol effect in strain PA14, we also examined the role of WspR in the ethanol response in strain PAO1. As shown above, PAO1 wild-type cells had increased early attachment and subsequent microcolony formation on plastic when ethanol was added to the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004480-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Consistent with our model that ethanol is acting through WspR, ethanol did not stimulate surface colonization in the PAO1 Δ<italic>wspR</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004480-g005">Fig. 5</xref>).

Ethanol also promoted colony wrinkling in strain PAO1, as was observed in strain PA14, consistent with the prediction that increased WspR activity would lead to increased matrix production. Enhanced wrinkling with ethanol was shown most clearly for both strains in non-motile (<italic>flgK</italic>) mutants which formed colonies of similar size regardless of the presence of ethanol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004480.s005">Fig. S5</xref>).

<title>Ethanol promotes WspR clustering and a functional Wsp system is required for this effect</title>

Thus, we were intrigued by the observation that colonies on ethanol-containing swarm plates, but not control plates, contained abundant emerald green crystals, similar to those formed by reduced phenazine-1-carboxamide (PCN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Kanner1">[40]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004480-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004480-g004">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004480.s007">Fig. S7A</xref>), which could indicate a reciprocal relationship between ethanol and phenazines. Phenazine concentrations were measured using HPLC in either extracts from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain PA14 colonies or extracts from the underlying agar. In extracts from wild type colonies, PCN and PCA concentrations were 24.2- and 5.8-fold higher, respectively, when ethanol was in the medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004480.s007">Fig. S7B</xref>); much smaller differences in PCN and PCA concentrations were found in extracts of the underlying agar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004480.s007">Fig. S7C</xref>). Because PCA is the precursor for all other phenazine derivatives, including PCN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004480.s007">Fig. S7A</xref>), we further explored the effect of ethanol on PCA production. For this, we measured levels of PCA in a strain lacking all of the PCA modifying enzymes (PhzH, PhzM, and PhzS; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004480.s007">Fig. S7A</xref> for pathways) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Recinos1">[41]</xref>.

These data suggest that ethanol may cause a minor increase in PCA, and that it has greater effects on which species of phenazines are formed.

<p>To determine if there was a connection between ethanol effects on Wsp signaling and ethanol stimulation of PCN levels, we assessed PCN accumulation in mutants lacking <italic>wspR</italic> or <italic>pelA</italic>. We found that both strains responded like the wild type in terms of PCN crystal formation upon growth with ethanol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004480.s008">Fig. S8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004480-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Similarly, ethanol catabolic mutants still showed enhanced levels of PCN crystals upon ethanol exposure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004480.s008">Fig. S8A</xref>).</p>
<p>Having observed alterations in the phenazine profile induced by ethanol, we examined the impact of ethanol in the production of a fourth phenazine derivative, 5MPCA, which we have previously shown to be released by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> when in the presence of <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Morales2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Gibson1">[24]</xref>. Because <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-produced 5MPCA is converted into a red pigment within <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells, 5MPCA accumulation can be followed by observing the formation of a red color where <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> are cultured together <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Morales2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Gibson1">[24]</xref>. To examine the effects of ethanol production on the accumulation of red 5MCPA derivatives, we again used the <italic>C. albicans adh1</italic>/<italic>adh1</italic> mutant and its complemented derivative. Strikingly, when <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was cultured on lawns of the <italic>C. albicans adh1</italic>/<italic>adh1</italic> strain, a strong decrease in red pigmentation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004480-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). When <italic>ADH1</italic> was provided in trans to the <italic>adh1</italic>/<italic>adh1</italic> mutant, accumulation of the red pigment was restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004480-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>).

<p>Together, our data suggest that ethanol only slightly increases total phenazine production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004480.s007">Fig. S7D and E</xref>) but more strongly affects the derivatization of phenazines in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> colonies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004480.s007">Fig. S7B and C</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>C. albicans</italic>-produced ethanol stimulated <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> 5MPCA production, and in turn, phenazines, including 5MPCA analogs, promote ethanol production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Morales1">[18]</xref>. Thus, it appears that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-<italic>C. albicans</italic> interactions include a positive feedback loop that promotes fungal ethanol production and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Wsp-dependent biofilm formation when the two species are cultured together.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This paper reports new effects of ethanol on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence-related traits, and illustrates that these effects occur through multiple pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004480-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). We found that ethanol: i) promoted attachment to and colonization of plastic and airway epithelial cells, ii) decreased swarming, but not twitching motility, iii) increased Pel-dependent colony wrinkling, and iv) increased c-di-GMP levels. All of these responses to ethanol required the diguanylate cyclase WspR. WspR is part of the Wsp chemosensory system, which is a member of the “alternative cellular function” (ACF) chemotaxis family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Guvener1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Hickman1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Wuichet1">[43]</xref>. The Wsp chemosensory system is different from the chemotaxis systems in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in terms of its localization and response to environmental signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-OConnor1">[44]</xref>. The membrane-bound receptor WspA and the CheA homologue WspE are necessary for the Wsp system to function, and WspE activates WspR via phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-OConnor1">[44]</xref>. Consistent with our hypothesis that the entire Wsp system is required for the response to ethanol, we found that a <italic>wspA</italic> mutant was also insensitive to the effects of ethanol on biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004480-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). The activation of WspR was independent of ethanol catabolism and independent of phenazine production. Ethanol and other alcohols can increase the rigidity of cell membranes by promoting an altered composition of fatty acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Ingram1">[45]</xref>, and future studies will determine if the Wsp system, particularly the membrane localized WspA, can be activated by changes in the lipid composition or changes in the physical properties of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> membranes. Because the Wsp system is also activated upon contact with a surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Guvener1">[20]</xref>, it is intriguing to consider how these stimuli might be similar. Ethanol had mild, if any, effects, on biofilm formation at the air-liquid interface in a commonly used 96-well microtiter dish assay in either strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004480.s009">Fig. S9</xref>) suggesting that in this environment, different Wsp activating cues were not additive.</p>

<title>Our proposed model for the impacts of fungally-produced ethanol on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> behaviors.</title>
<p>Our previous work has shown that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> phenazines increase fungal ethanol production. Here, we show that ethanol stimulates the Wsp system, leading to a WspR-dependent increase in c-di-GMP levels and a concomitant increase in Pel production and biofilm formation on plastic and on airway epithelial cells. In addition, ethanol altered phenazine production by promoting 5MPCA release and the accumulation of PCN.</p>

<p><italic>C. albicans</italic> and other <italic>Candida</italic> spp. are commonly detected in the sputum of CF patients, and clinical studies suggest that the presence of both <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> results in a worse prognosis for CF patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Chotirmall1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Azoulay1">[46]</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic> ethanol production by other fungi has been documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Himmelreich1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Grahl1">[48]</xref>, but a link between <italic>Candida</italic> spp. and ethanol production in the lung has not yet been made. It is important to note, however, that ethanol was one of two metabolites in exhaled breath condensate that differentiated CF from non-CF individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Montuschi1">[49]</xref>. Thus, regardless of the source of ethanol, be it fungal or bacterial, the effect of ethanol on pathogens such as <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is likely of biological and clinical relevance. We tested this interaction in the context of CF, but this polymicrobial interaction likely occurs in other contexts as well.</p>
<p>As shown above, ethanol promoted biofilm formation and likely concomitant increases in drug tolerance. In the airway epithelial cell system, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CFU recovery was increased 3-fold by addition of ethanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004480-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>) and 4.7-fold by co-culture with <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004480-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). A two-fold difference is comparable to the differences in colonization between wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains and mutants lacking genes known to play a role in virulence in animal models. For example, a Δ<italic>plcHR</italic> mutant lacking hemolytic phospholipase C or a Δ<italic>anr</italic> strain defective in a global regulator have 1.3- to 2.6-fold fewer CFUs recovered from airway cells compared to wild type, and notable differences in animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Jackson1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Wargo1">[51]</xref>. Hence the presence of ethanol may result in increased virulence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in the host. Ethanol has also been shown to promote <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> conversion to a mucoid state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-DeVault1">[52]</xref>, in which the exopolysaccharide alginate is overproduced; mucoidy is common in CF isolates and is correlated with a decline in lung function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Deretic1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Boucher1">[54]</xref>. Ethanol has been shown to enhance virulence and biofilm formation by other lung pathogens such as <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Korem1">[55]</xref> and <italic>Acinetobacter baumanii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Nwugo1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Smith2">[59]</xref> via mechanisms that have not yet been described. Like in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004480.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>), ethanol caused a slight stimulation of growth in <italic>A. baumanii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Smith1">[58]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition to the effects of ethanol on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, ethanol is an immunosuppressant that negatively influences the lung immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Goral1">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Guidot1">[64]</xref>. In a mouse model, ethanol inhibits lung clearance of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> by inhibiting macrophage recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Greenberg1">[65]</xref>. Together, these observations suggest that in mixed infections, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> may promote the production of ethanol by fungi, and that fungally-produced ethanol may in turn enhance the virulence and persistence of co-existing pathogens, and thus may directly impact the host.</p>
<p>It is not yet known how ethanol influences the spectrum of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> phenazines produced. In a previous study, we found evidence for increased production and release of 5MPCA when <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is grown in co-culture with <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and that live <italic>C. albicans</italic> is required for this effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Morales2">[19]</xref>. More recent studies show that <italic>C. albicans</italic> ethanol production increased in the presence of even very low concentrations of the 5MPCA analog phenazine methosulfate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Morales1">[18]</xref>, that the 5MPCA-like compounds were even more effective inhibitors of fungi than PCA and PYO, the two phenazines normally produced when <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is grown in mono-culture. Here, our findings suggest a feedback loop in which <italic>C. albicans</italic>-produced ethanol promoted the release of phenazines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004480-g007">Fig. 7</xref>) that may promote further ethanol production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Morales1">[18]</xref>. It is also important to consider that some studies have reported that 5MPCA and PCN have enhanced antifungal activity when compared to PCA and PYO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Morales2">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Chin1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Gibson1">[24]</xref>. The ethanol-induced changes in PCA were not as dramatic when compared to the ethanol-induced changes in PCN and 5MPCA, suggesting that ethanol mainly affected the biosynthetic steps after the formation of PCA leading to its conversion to PCN, 5MPCA and PYO. In different settings, such as liquid cultures or in clinical isolates lacking activity of LasR, a transcriptional regulator for quorum sensing that controls phenazine production, the presence of <italic>C. albicans</italic> enhanced the production of 5MPCA and PYO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Gibson1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Cugini1">[25]</xref>. Taken together, all these observations indicate that fungally-produced ethanol may enhance the conversion of PCA to end products such as PCN, 5MPCA and PYO.</p>
<p>These studies indicate how microbial species can alter the behavior of one another and suggest that the nature of these dynamic interactions can change depending on the context. In the rhizosphere, where pseudomonad antagonism of fungi includes the colonization of fungal hyphae and phenazine production, the enhancement of fungally-produced ethanol by phenazines and stimulation of biofilm formation and phenazine production by ethanol may create a cycle that is relevant to biocontrol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Chin1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Chin2">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Bolwerk1">[67]</xref>. In chronic infections where these two species are found together, such as in chronic CF-associated lung disease, this molecular interplay may be synergistic and promote long-term colonization of both species in the host. These findings indicate that the treatment of colonizing fungi may be beneficial due to their effects on other pathogens even if the fungi themselves are not acting as overt agents of host damage.</p>

<title>Quantification of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> attachment to plastic and airway epithelial cells</title>
<p>To measure the attachment of cells to the plastic surface in 6-well or 12-well untreated polystyrene plates, wells were inoculated with a suspension of cells at an initial OD<sub>600 nm</sub> of 0.002 from overnight cultures. Every 90 minutes, the culture medium was removed and fresh medium was supplied. Pictures were taken using an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope with a long distance 63× DIC objective at specified intervals. To quantify the number of cells or microcolonies in control cultures compared to cultures with ethanol, images were captured, randomized, and analyzed by a researcher who was blind to the identity of the sample at the time of analysis. In each experiment, more than 10 fields were counted for each strain. Microcolonies were defined as clusters of more than 5 cells in physical contact with one another. Biofilm formation on plastic microtiter dishes were performed and analyzed using the crystal violet assay as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004480-Korem1">[55]</xref> and biofilm values were measured by quantification of dye as measured absorbance at 650 nm.</p>
