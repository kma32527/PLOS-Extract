<abstract>
<p>Many Gram-negative bacteria use Type Three Secretion Systems (T3SS) to deliver effector proteins into host cells. These protein delivery machines are composed of cytosolic components that recognize substrates and generate the force needed for translocation, the secretion conduit, formed by a needle complex and associated membrane spanning basal body, and translocators that form the pore in the target cell. A defined order of secretion in which needle component proteins are secreted first, followed by translocators, and finally effectors, is necessary for this system to be effective. While the secreted effectors vary significantly between organisms, the ∼20 individual protein components that form the T3SS are conserved in many pathogenic bacteria. One such conserved protein, referred to as either a plug or gatekeeper, is necessary to prevent unregulated effector release and to allow efficient translocator secretion. The mechanism by which translocator secretion is promoted while effector release is inhibited by gatekeepers is unknown. We present the structure of the <italic>Chlamydial</italic> gatekeeper, CopN, bound to a translocator-specific chaperone. The structure identifies a previously unknown interface between gatekeepers and translocator chaperones and reveals that in the gatekeeper-chaperone complex the canonical translocator-binding groove is free to bind translocators. Structure-based mutagenesis of the homologous complex in <italic>Shigella</italic> reveals that the gatekeeper-chaperone-translocator complex is essential for translocator secretion and for the ordered secretion of translocators prior to effectors.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Type Three Secretion Systems (T3SS) are essential virulence factors found in many pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. These machines aid infection by delivering bacterial proteins into host cells where these proteins modulate host processes and help establish a niche for the bacteria. Protein delivery occurs in a highly regulated manner in which proteins involved in early steps in infection, or necessary to build the secretion conduit, are typically secreted before other substrates, a phenomenon termed secretion hierarchy. This study presents the structure of a molecular complex that physically links one class of early substrates, components of the secretion pore termed translocators, to a gatekeeper protein, a protein that has been implicated in the secretion hierarchy. Disruption of this interaction in <italic>Shigella</italic> disrupts the secretion of translocators, while supporting increased secretion of effectors, resulting in phenotypes indistinguishable from a gatekeeper deletion, and leading to the conclusion that a gatekeeper-chaperone-translocator complex is a critical component of the T3SS.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Type Three Secretion Systems (T3SS) are conserved bacterial protein delivery machines used by many pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria to deliver a diverse group of protein molecules, termed effectors, into cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Cornelis1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Galan2">[4]</xref>. The type three secretion (T3S) apparatus is a conserved molecular machine that forms a protein-conducting channel from the bacterial cytosol to the target cell cytosol. Major structural components of the T3SS include: a cytosolic-ring complex, which includes the ATPase that catalyzes protein unfolding and secretion; a basal-body, which forms a pore across both the inner and outer bacterial membranes; a needle complex, which extends from the basal-body to the host cell; and translocators, which form a pore in the target cell membrane, termed a translocon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Hodgkinson1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Abrusci1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>The translocon, through which effectors enter the host cell, is an oligomeric pore formed by bacterial proteins termed translocators that are themselves secretion substrates of the T3SS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Cornelis2">[2]</xref>. Translocator secretion is regulated such that it occurs prior to effector secretion, ensuring that effector secretion occurs after a functional conduit from the bacterial cytoplasm to the target cell has been formed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Deane1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Stamm1">[8]</xref>. Efficient secretion is dependent on the interaction of specialized chaperones with cytosolic T3SS components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Parsot1">[9]</xref>. Molecular structures have revealed two architectures for T3S chaperones: a mixed α/β homo or heterodimer and an all α-helical tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) chaperone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Stebbins1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Job1">[14]</xref>. These chaperones, termed class I (α/β) and class II (TPR), are specific for effectors and translocators, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Parsot1">[9]</xref>. Our understanding of how the T3SS switches from translocator to effector secretion is limited, but in multiple systems this process is known to involve a conserved gatekeeper protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Iriarte1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Pallen1">[20]</xref>. Gatekeepers are encoded as one of two molecular architectures, either as two separate proteins (YopN-TyeA family), or as a gene fusion (MxiC family) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Pallen1">[20]</xref>. The importance of this architectural distinction is unknown, and a protein fusion resulting from ribosomal frameshifting has been reported without an evident functional change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Ferracci1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>In <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, the gatekeeper, CopN, is known to directly bind Scc3, a translocator-specific chaperone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Spaeth1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-SilvaHerzog1">[26]</xref>. Translocator-specific chaperones (class II chaperones) bind directly to translocators, prevent their degradation, and maintain the translocators in a secretion competent state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Parsot1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Lunelli1">[13]</xref>. Structures from homologous class II chaperone/translocator pairs have revealed the chaperone to be a TPR protein with a conserved binding groove that binds an amino terminal chaperone-binding motif on the translocator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Buttner1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Job1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Schreiner1">[27]</xref>. In addition to binding translocators, Scc3 also binds CopN, although the nature of this interaction is unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Spaeth1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Slepenkin1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Archuleta1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-SilvaHerzog1">[26]</xref>. It is not known if CopN and the <italic>Chlamydial</italic> translocators (CopB/B2) compete for the TPR binding groove on Scc3, or if different binding determinants are responsible for the Scc3-CopN interaction. More fundamentally, it is not known how gatekeepers promote translocator secretion.</p>
<p>Gatekeepers and translocator chaperones have been observed in immunopurified complexes from other systems, but only as components of large complexes that also include other components of the T3SS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Iriarte1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Kubori1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Cherradi1">[28]</xref>. Because such complexes are not readily accessible to structural study, we have focused our structural studies on the gatekeeper-translocator chaperone complex from <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. We reasoned that the CopN-Scc3 complex is likely to be involved in the ordered secretion of translocators prior to effectors, a conserved phenomenon termed the translocator-effector secretion hierarchy.</p>
<p>The origin of the translocator-effector secretion hierarchy is not understood, but has been proposed to arise from differential affinities and competition for binding sites either between chaperones and their effector or translocator cargo or between chaperone-effector/translocator complexes and cytosolic components of the T3SS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Stebbins1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Birtalan1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Tomalka1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Thomas1">[32]</xref>. To assess the importance of gatekeeper-translocator chaperone interactions in diverse pathogens, and because adequate tools and reagents for functional analysis of CopN mutants are not available in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, we have extended our structural analysis with functional studies of MxiC and IpgC, the gatekeeper and translocator-specific chaperone from <italic>Shigella</italic>.</p>

<title>Structure of Scc3-CopN complex</title>
<p>We determined the crystal structure of the Scc3-CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> complex and refined the structure to 2.2 Å (PDB ID 4NRH). The amino terminal 84 residues of CopN were not included in the construct used for crystallization because they are unstructured <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Archuleta1">[25]</xref>. Data collection and structure refinement statistics are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1004498-t001">Table 1</xref>, and representative electron density is shown in Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004498.s001">Figure S1</xref>. Two nearly identical Scc3-CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> complexes (RMS deviation 0.34 Å for all CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> mainchain atoms and 0.49 Å for all Scc3 mainchain atoms) are present in the asymmetric unit. CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> forms a long cylindrical structure composed of three helical domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004498-g001">Figure 1</xref>). A search for structurally similar proteins using the DALI software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Holm1">[33]</xref>, indicates structural homology to the globin fold, which, aside from the use described here, is used in bacteria both as a light harvesting complex and as a stress response sigma factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Murray1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Reuter1">[36]</xref>. In gatekeeper proteins multiple domains are concatenated through elongated connecting helices, whereas globin domains typically oligomerize through lateral contacts. CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> is structurally similar to other gatekeeper proteins, both MxiC from <italic>Shigella</italic> and the YopN-TyeA complex from <italic>Yersinia</italic>. The most substantial differences among family members relate to the position of the carboxy-terminal domain or subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004498-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Deane2">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Schubot1">[38]</xref>). In the Scc3-CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> complex, this domain is translated ∼9.5 Å and rotated ∼50° relative to the YopN-TyeA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004498-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Similarly, Scc3 is structurally similar to other translocator chaperones. The striking result from the Scc3-CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> is the unexpected assembly of the complex and the role of the Scc3 amino terminus in binding CopN<sub>Δ84</sub>.</p>

<p>T3SS chaperones bind the amino terminus of effectors and translocators, and class II chaperones (those specific for translocators) use a conserved peptide-in-groove binding mode, utilizing the TPR binding groove, in which translocators bind in the concave face of the chaperone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Parsot1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Job1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Schreiner1">[27]</xref>. The structure reveals that Scc3 does not engage CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> using this conserved binding groove. Instead, the amino terminus, referred to here as a gatekeeper-binding region (GBR), forms a relatively flat surface, adjacent to the convex side of the TPR and binds across the interdomain interface of the last two domains of CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004498-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The interface formed by this interaction results from burial of 980 Å<sup>2</sup> of surface area. The Scc3 side of the interface is formed exclusively by residues from the GBR, consistent with separate functions of translocator and gatekeeper binding for the TPR and GBR regions of Scc3. Despite minimal sequence conservation, other translocator chaperones also have an amino terminal extension (GBR) prior to the TPR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004498-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In the homologs from <italic>Shigella</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> this region mediates homo-dimerization, although translocator binding is known to disrupt these dimers such that in translocator-chaperone complexes this region (GBR) is no longer involved in homodimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Lunelli1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Tomalka1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Adam1">[39]</xref>.

<title>The Scc3-CopN interface is conserved in other bacteria</title>
<p>Scc3 engages CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> with residues from the GBR, which bind a contiguous surface on CopN<sub>Δ84</sub>. This surface is formed by two distant patches of sequence conservation, site 1 and site 2, and spans the second and third domains of CopN<sub>Δ84</sub>, requiring these two domains to be appropriately oriented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004498-g001">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004498-g002">2</xref>). In the YopN-TyeA family, the third domain is encoded as a separate protein, such that in these homologs one would predict the interdomain interface recognized by the Scc3 homolog to be a dimer.</p>
<p>Residues 16–23 of Scc3 interact principally with site 1 of CopN<sub>Δ84</sub>, whereas residues 24–43 form a much larger interface in which Scc3 projects a ring of hydrophobic sidechains toward CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> to surround a highly conserved arginine (R365) on CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004498-g002">Figures 2</xref>, Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004498.s002">Figure S2</xref>). This interaction includes three tyrosines, one of which, Y43 is oriented to allow a π-cation interaction. Peripheral to this ring of hydrophobic residues are a collection of inter-molecular salt bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004498-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The circumscribed arginine (R365) is conserved across diverse species, including species with two polypeptide gatekeepers and is among the most conserved surface exposed residues in this protein family (this residue is an arginine in homologs from <italic>Shigella</italic>, <italic>Vibrio</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic>Bordetella</italic>, and <italic>Yersinia</italic> and glutamine in <italic>Salmonella</italic>) (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004498.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Residues on the CopN side of this interface are better conserved than those on the GBR, despite the fact that they span two proteins in the <italic>Yersinia</italic> architecture and are on the same protein in the architecture presented here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004498-g002">Figure 2</xref>, Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004498.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess the importance of the two binding regions, we disrupted each interaction by mutagenesis. We made an amino terminal 24 amino acid deletion to Scc3 (Scc3<sub>Δ24</sub>), which eliminates the GBR-site one interaction. We also mutated the central arginine and two adjacent residues (A362R, R365D, and G369R) in site 2 of CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> (CopN<sub>Δ84</sub>-RDR). A362, R365, and G369 are buried by Scc3 and likely solvent exposed in unliganded CopN<sub>Δ84</sub>. We introduced charged residues at these sites with the expectation that the solvent exposed charges would not disturb CopN, but would disrupt the CopN<sub>Δ84</sub>-Scc3 complex. CopN<sub>Δ84</sub>-RDR and Scc3<sub>Δ24</sub>, are well-folded, as judged by circular dichroism spectra similar to CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> and Scc3 (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004498.s003">Figure S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004498.s008">Methods S1</xref>). As judged by the inability of Scc3<sub>Δ24</sub> to bind CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> and the inability of CopN<sub>Δ84</sub>-RDR to bind Scc3 (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004498.s004">Figure S4</xref>), both regions are important for Scc3-CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> complex formation.</p>

<title>Disruption of the Scc3-CopN interface alters secretion in <italic>Shigella</italic></title>
<p>To determine the importance of the gatekeeper-chaperone interaction during T3S, we disrupted the homologous gatekeeper-translocator chaperone interface in <italic>Shigella</italic>. <italic>Shigella</italic>, unlike <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, are genetically tractable allowing disruption of the endogenous mxiC gene (the copN homolog) and rescue with a plasmid expressing mutant or wild-type MxiC.

The Scc3-CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> structure was disrupted by mutation of A362R, R365D, and G369R on CopN (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004498.s004">Figure S4</xref>), supporting the idea that the homologous mutations would disrupt IpgC-MxiC interface. We expressed the E331R/R334D/I338R MxiC mutant (MxiC-RDR) from a plasmid in a previously described mxiC null <italic>Shigella</italic> strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-MartinezArgudo1">[18]</xref> and compared secretion profiles following Congo Red induction. MxiC-RDR is deficient in secretion of the translocators IpaB, IpaC, and IpaD, but efficiently secretes IpaA, an effector, and secretes elevated levels of the effectors OspC1-3 and IpgB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004498-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). IpaA is not secreted efficiently if wild type MxiC is present, but is secreted earlier and in greater quantities from ΔMxiC or MxiC-RDR strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004498-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, compare IpaA secretion at 10 minutes and 60 minutes). The secretion profile of MxiC-RDR closely mimics that of the ΔMxiC strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004498-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), highlighting the importance of gatekeeper-translocator chaperone complexes in translocator secretion. To further evaluate the importance of the conserved, central, arginine, we evaluated the secretion profile of a single point mutant, MxiC-R334D, revealing a phenotype similar to the triple mutant (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004498.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Similar to CopN, MxiC is both the gatekeeper and a T3S substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-MartinezArgudo1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Botteaux1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Fields2">[43]</xref>. To verify that the mutations to MxiC did not prevent recognition and secretion of MxiC by the T3SS, we evaluated the secretion of MxiC-RDR, which is unaltered from wild-type MxiC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004498-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). To further confirm that the mutations didn't grossly alter the structure of MxiC, we compared circular dichroism specta of MxiC<sub>Δ74</sub>, MxiC<sub>Δ74</sub>-RDR, and MxiC<sub>Δ74</sub>-R334D, which indicated that all three proteins are similarly folded (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004498.s003">Figure S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004498.s008">Methods S1</xref>). In these constructs the first 74 residues of MxiC have been deleted to allow expression and purification from <italic>E. coli</italic>. MxiC-RDR is secreted in a similar manner to MxiC, indicating that the mutations do not disrupt its ability to interact with the T3SS, yet is unable to direct translocators for secretion, and is unable to prevent inappropriate secretion of the effectors, IpaA, OspC1-3, and IpgB.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we have presented the structure of CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> bound to Scc3. This structure provides the first description of a novel interaction for translocator-chaperones, which involves an amino-terminal extension, termed the GBR, binding across the YopN-TyeA-like domain interface in CopN<sub>Δ84</sub>. The translocator-chaperone-gatekeeper interaction involves a conserved arginine from the gatekeeper and the amino terminal GBR from the chaperone. Despite the lack of sequence conservation within the chaperone, the presence of a GBR in class II chaperones appears to be conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004498-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Scc3's GBR is ∼20 amino acids longer than others, implying that the extensive interactions made to the YopN-like domain are likely unique to the Scc3-CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> complex. Although the unique α1 helix of Scc3 (amino acids 2–15) does not contact CopN, α1 does orient the α1–α2 loop, which contacts CopN. In organisms with shorter GBRs, other T3S apparatus components likely contribute to organizing this interface. This appears to be the case in <italic>Salmonella</italic>, where the gatekeeper interacts with the translocator-chaperone when it is bound to either translocator, but not to the empty chaperone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Kubori1">[17]</xref>. In <italic>Shigella</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, the translocator-chaperones are known to homodimerize using the amino terminus, and translocator binding is necessary to disrupt this dimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Tomalka1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Adam1">[39]</xref>. Although the monomeric chaperone is able to bind translocators, our data suggest a role for the chaperone amino terminus distinct from the role in homodimerization, namely a role in gatekeeper binding. We find that Scc3 is a monomer and the Scc3-CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> complex is a heterodimer in solution (Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004498.s007">Figure S7</xref>). We suggest that disruption of chaperone homodimers, by translocator binding likely occurs prior to chaperone-gatekeeper complex formation, and that once the chaperone-translocator complex is formed, it is recruited to the T3S apparatus by the gatekeeper.</p>
<p>The binding mode observed in our structure leaves the canonical translocator-binding groove free and available to bind translocators. The Scc3-CopN<sub>Δ84</sub> complex binds directly to CopB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004498-g003">Figure 3</xref>, Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004498.s005">Figure S5</xref>), a <italic>Chlamydial</italic> translocator, thus establishing a physical link between the gatekeeper and a translocator. By physically linking gatekeepers and translocators, the temporal order of secretion events in which translocators are secreted immediately after gatekeepers and prior to effectors is assured. The mechanism by which gatekeepers are recruited to the apparatus prior to effectors or translocators remains to be determined. The unusual CopN-Scc3 interface and relatively small buried-surface area (980 Å<sup>2</sup>) are consistent with the physiological role of this complex, in that the gatekeeper-translocator chaperone must assemble and disassemble each cycle of translocator secretion.</p>
<p>In <italic>Chlamydia</italic> the CopN-Scc3 interaction can be formed with purified proteins, suggesting that it is stronger than in homologous systems, likely because the GBR is longer and complex formation is not prevented by chaperone homodimerization. The precise advantage this affords <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is unclear, but T3S activation may represent an early “committed step” for <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection. As obligate intracellular pathogens, the need for <italic>Chlamydia</italic> to enter their host subsequent to T3S activation seems absolute. <italic>Chlamydia</italic> are dependent on their hosts for ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Saka1">[44]</xref> and therefore a T3S event that doesn't result in entry is likely fatal for the bacterium. Consistent with this idea, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> also express a second translocator chaperone, Scc2, which is expressed during late stages of infection, after invasion, and does not bind CopN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Spaeth1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Slepenkin1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>Mutations shown to disrupt the CopN-Scc3 complex were evaluated in the MxiC-IpgC complex. The highly conserved central arginine and two additional charged residues, located at positions homologous to the sites mutated in CopN, were mutated (E331R/R334D/I338R) on a MxiC expressing plasmid and used to complement a mxiC deletion strain. This mutant MxiC (MxiC-RDR) was expressed and secreted normally, indicating that the mutations did not significantly disrupt MxiC. Strains harboring MxiC-RDR, however, mimicked deletion strains and were both deficient in translocator secretion and secreted elevated levels of effectors, resulting in significant effector secretion at early timepoints, prior to translocator secretion. These results support the conclusion that a key function of MxiC during secretion is to scaffold translocators and that the MxiC-IpgC complex is needed for this function. This arrangement, in which the gatekeeper directs translocators to the secretion apparatus, makes proper assembly of a gatekeeper-chaperone-translocator complex needed to promote translocator secretion. Gatekeepers are also needed to prevent effector secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Iriarte1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Pallen1">[20]</xref> indicating that the relevant “plug” that prevents premature effector secretion is likely the gatekeeper-chaperone-translocator complex. Consistent with this interpretation, disruption of IpaB (a <italic>Shigella</italic> translocator) or MxiC (the gatekeeper) both cause constitutive effector secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-MartinezArgudo1">[18]</xref>. In many systems, translocator chaperones have an additional role and act as transcription co-activators after translocator secretion thereby linking expression of some effector proteins to secretion of translocators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Parsot1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Collectively, our results support a new mechanism for the translocator-effector hierarchy. We suggest that the translocators are recruited to the T3S pore as a molecular complex including the gatekeeper, translocator-chaperone, and translocator. There are likely multiple variations on this theme, one of which is evident in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, where translocators make multiple interactions with their chaperone, including regions outside the canonical chaperone binding region, at the extreme carboxy terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-Tomalka2">[45]</xref>. The entire complex is needed both to promote translocator secretion and to prevent effector secretion. A triggering event from the tip of the T3S needle is known to induce gatekeeper release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004498-MartinezArgudo1">[18]</xref>, which through the molecular complex described above is directly linked to translocator secretion. Secretion of the gatekeeper and translocator then allows effector secretion through a gatekeeper independent mechanism, similar to the efficient effector secretion seen in gatekeeper mutants.</p>
