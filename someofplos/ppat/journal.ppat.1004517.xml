<abstract>
<p>CD4 T cells are critical for control of persistent infections; however, the key signals that regulate CD4 T help during chronic infection remain incompletely defined. While several studies have addressed the role of inhibitory receptors and soluble factors such as PD-1 and IL-10, significantly less work has addressed the role of T cell co-stimulatory molecules during chronic viral infection. Here we show that during a persistent infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) clone 13, mice lacking the glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor related protein (GITR) exhibit defective CD8 T cell accumulation, increased T cell exhaustion and impaired viral control. Differences in CD8 T cells and viral control between GITR<sup>+/+</sup> and GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice were lost when CD4 T cells were depleted. Moreover, mixed bone marrow chimeric mice, as well as transfer of LCMV epitope-specific CD4 or CD8 T cells, demonstrated that these effects of GITR are largely CD4 T cell-intrinsic. GITR is dispensable for initial CD4 T cell proliferation and differentiation, but supports the post-priming accumulation of IFNγ<sup>+</sup>IL-2<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells, facilitating CD8 T cell expansion and early viral control. GITR-dependent phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB as well as phosphorylation of the downstream mTORC1 target, S6 ribosomal protein, were detected at day three post-infection (p.i.), and defects in CD4 T cell accumulation in GITR-deficient T cells were apparent starting at day five p.i. Consistently, we pinpoint IL-2-dependent CD4 T cell help for CD8 T cells to between days four and eight p.i. GITR also increases the ratio of T follicular helper to T follicular regulatory cells and thereby enhances LCMV-specific IgG production. Together, these findings identify a CD4 T cell-intrinsic role for GITR in sustaining early CD8 and late humoral responses to collectively promote control of chronic LCMV clone 13 infection.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The natural rodent pathogen LCMV clone 13 causes a persistent viral infection in mice and has successfully predicted several immunological factors that are relevant to human chronic viral infection such as HIV. LCMV clone 13 infection is ultimately controlled by cell-mediated and humoral immune responses by day 60–90 post-infection in CD4 T cell-sufficient mice. While it has been known for several years that CD4 T cell help is critical for control of LCMV clone 13, research to date has been largely limited to the regulatory factors that contribute to late CD4 T cell dysfunction, with little knowledge of the role of T cell co-stimulatory factors in sustaining CD4 T cells to help cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. Using GITR-deficient mice, we show that the co-stimulatory molecule GITR plays a critical cell-intrinsic role in early CD4 T cell accumulation to support cytotoxic T cell responses and late LCMV-specific IgG production. The early effects of Th1 on CTL responses are IL-2-dependent. Mice lacking GITR have up to 35-fold higher viral burden relative to GITR-sufficient controls. Taken together, we demonstrate a critical cell-intrinsic role for GITR is sustaining CD4 T cell responses to control chronic LCMV infection. Thus, GITR on CD4 T cells may critically contribute to the initial viral set-point in infections such as HIV.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During chronic viral infections, exemplified by the clone 13 variant of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV cl 13), persistent antigen presentation results in the functional exhaustion of the T cell response, characterized by persistent upregulation of inhibitory molecules and a progressive loss of T cell effector functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref001">1</xref>]. Ultimately, LCMV cl 13 is cleared by 60–90 days p.i. due to both T- and B-cell responses. While there have been a number of studies on the role of T cell inhibitory receptors and anti-inflammatory cytokines during chronic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref007">7</xref>], rather less has been done to study the role of co-stimulatory receptors in this context. Co-stimulatory TNFR family members are of particular interest in this regard because they are often induced upon antigen receptor signaling, leading to their co-expression with inhibitory receptors during a persistent infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref010">10</xref>]. CD4 T cell help is critical for the control of chronic infections. The removal of CD4 T cells from mice prior to infection with LCMV cl 13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref013">13</xref>], or the loss of CD4 T cells during progressive HIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref014">14</xref>] leads to increased viral burden, immune dysregulation, and functional T cell exhaustion. While CD4 cells are clearly implicated in the control of chronic viral infections, the co-stimulatory signals that contribute to CD4 T cell help remain poorly defined. Evidence to date suggests that there is significant heterogeneity in the potency and mechanisms of T cell modulation by members of the TNFR superfamily during chronic viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>The Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR related protein (GITR) and its ligand (GITRL) are induced upon activation of a number of immune cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref019">19</xref>]. GITR is expressed at low levels on resting T cells, but its expression rapidly increases upon activation. Although constitutively expressed on Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Treg), GITR is dispensable for Treg function but can play a role in the accumulation of both regulatory and effector T cells <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref021">21</xref>]. In many experimental systems, it has been difficult to determine the key cell types through which GITR mediates its effects. Controversy over the relative role of GITR on effector versus regulatory T cells persists, though these effects may be context-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref023">23</xref>]. GITR-deficient mice are viable, reproduce normally, and have no obvious immunological defects in the naïve state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref024">24</xref>]. Studies using GITR-deficient mice or an agonist anti-GITR antibody have shown an immune stimulatory role for GITR in the context of viral infections, but the mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not entirely clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we address the role of GITR during chronic viral infection using GITR-deficient mice infected with LCMV cl 13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref025">25</xref>]. We find that GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice have 2–3-fold fewer LCMV-specific CD8 T cells post-priming and throughout the infection, with concomitant increases in viral load. A previous study showed that GITR on TCR transgenic CD8 T cells contributes to the control of influenza infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref026">26</xref>]. Surprisingly however, during LCMV cl 13 infection, the effect of GITR was largely CD4 T cell-intrinsic and independent of Tregs. GITR-deficiency impaired the accumulation of IFNγ<sup>+</sup>IL-2<sup>+</sup> T helper 1 (Th1) cells as well as follicular helper T cells (Tfh) and the production of LCMV-specific IgG. Mixed bone marrow chimeras and adoptive transfer studies of LCMV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells demonstrate that the effects of GITR are CD4 T cell-intrinsic. Neutralization of IL-2 in GITR<sup>+/+</sup> mice reduced the immune response to the level observed in GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice, whereas IL-2 neutralization in GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice had no effect, revealing a central role for this cytokine in GITR-dependent control of LCMV cl 13. Taken together, our studies provide evidence for a critical role for GITR in the post-priming accumulation of IL-2<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells to help cell-mediated immunity as well as Tfh accumulation to sustain the humoral arm of the immune response to control a persistent viral infection.</p>

<title>GITR is required for CD8 T cell accumulation and function post-priming and control of chronic LCMV infection</title>
<p>To evaluate the role of GITR in a chronic infection, we infected wild-type mice (GITR<sup>+/+</sup>) or mice with ablated <italic>Tnfrsf18</italic> (GITR<sup>-/-</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref024">24</xref>] with LCMV cl 13. At both acute and chronic time points (days eight and 45 p.i.), GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice had significantly increased viral load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004517.g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). These effects were particularly striking in the kidney, where GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice had 35-fold higher viral load than GITR<sup>+/+</sup> mice at day eight p.i. GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice had substantially fewer LCMV-specific CD8 T cells in peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004517.g001">Fig. 1B</xref>, for gating strategy see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004517.s001">S1 Fig.</xref>). Following initial infection and T cell priming at day five p.i., there was no difference in the number of splenic LCMV-specific CD8 T cells between GITR<sup>+/+</sup> and GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004517.g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). However, between days five and eight p.i., a significant impairment in the frequency and total number of splenic LCMV-specific CD8 T cells in GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice materializes, and this effect becomes even more striking at day 45 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004517.g001">Fig. 1, D–F</xref>).</p>

<p>Co-signaling molecules PD-1 and Tim-3 impair CD8 T cell responses to LCMV cl 13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref005">5</xref>]. The majority of the LCMV-specific CD8 T cells in GITR<sup>+/+</sup> and GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice were PD-1<sup>+</sup> Tim-3<sup>+</sup> after LCMV cl 13 infection, but CD8 T cells from GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice expressed significantly higher levels of PD-1 and Tim-3 per cell at days eight and 45 p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004517.g002">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). CD8 T cells from GITR<sup>+/+</sup> or GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice produced similar amounts of IFNγ following peptide restimulation at day eight p.i., but by day 45 p.i., the GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice had fewer IFNγ<sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells with lower IFNγ production per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004517.g002">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>). Moreover, at all time points analyzed, fewer of the IFNγ-producing CD8 T cells from GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited a multifunctional phenotype as defined by TNF and surface CD107a expression (a surrogate marker for cellular cytotoxic activity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004517.g002">Fig. 2, E and F</xref>). These findings reveal a key role for GITR in the CD8 T cell response and control of chronic LCMV infection. We also examined the role of GITR with the acutely infecting Armstrong variant of LCMV and observed approximately two- to three-fold more GP<sub>33–41</sub>-specific CD8 T cells in GITR<sup>+/+</sup> compared to GITR<sup>-/-</sup> at day eight p.i. (p&lt;0.01 in two of the three experiments, total of ten mice per group), however both GITR<sup>+/+</sup> and GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice cleared LCMV Armstrong infection by day eight p.i.</p>

<title>GITR potentiates the CD8 T cell response through CD8 T cell-extrinsic effects</title>
<p>Previous work has shown an intrinsic role for GITR in sustaining the survival of TCR transgenic CD8 T cells during acute influenza virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref026">26</xref>]. To determine if CD8 T cell-intrinsic effects were also responsible for defects in LCMV cl 13 control in GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice, we crossed GITR<sup>-/-</sup> with P14 mice, which have a transgenic TCR specific for the D<sup>b</sup>-restricted LCMV GP<sub>33–41</sub> epitope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref027">27</xref>]. We transferred 10<sup>3</sup> purified CD8 T cells from CD45.1 GITR<sup>+/+</sup> or GITR<sup>-/-</sup> P14 littermates into CD45.2 congenic mice one day prior to LCMV cl 13 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004517.g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). P14 T cells lacking GITR showed no impairment in expansion, and in fact showed a slight increase in frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004517.g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). There was also no difference in IFNγ production or degranulation, PD-1 or Tim-3 expression between the GITR-sufficient or GITR-deficient P14 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004517.g003">Fig. 3, C–E</xref>). Moreover, the absence of GITR only on the transferred P14 T cells had no effect on viral control at day eight p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004517.g003">Fig. 3F</xref>). Thus, the effect of GITR in potentiating the CD8 T cell response to LCMV cl 13 is CD8 T cell-extrinsic.</p>

CD4-depleted GITR<sup>+/+</sup> mice had fewer and less functional LCMV-specific CD8 T cells, and 100-fold higher viral load relative to non-CD4-depleted GITR<sup>+/+</sup> mice, consistent with previous reports of CD4 depletion increasing the severity of LCMV cl 13 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref013">13</xref>]. However, the qualitative and quantitative differences between GITR<sup>+/+</sup> and GITR<sup>-/-</sup> CD8 T cell responses and viral control at day eight p.i. were largely lost in CD4-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004517.g004">Fig. 4, B–E</xref>), suggesting that CD4 T cells are necessary for the effect of GITR on the CD8 T cell response to LCMV cl 13 as well as viral control.</p>

<p>We next analyzed the effect of GITR on CD4 T cell responses. GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice had similar total numbers of CD4 T cells in the spleen following LCMV infection at day eight p.i. However, fewer of the GITR<sup>-/-</sup> CD4 T cells expressed the signature Th1 transcription factor T-bet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004517.g004">Fig. 4F</xref>, for gating strategy see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004517.s002">S2 Fig.</xref>) and there was a striking three-fold reduction in the percent of CD4 T cells that were IFNγ<sup>+</sup> or IFNγ<sup>+</sup>IL-2<sup>+</sup> following GP<sub>61–80</sub>-restimulation at day eight p.i., a defect that was maintained out to day 45 p.i.

<title>IL-2 is necessary for the effect of GITR on CD8 T cell responses</title>
<p>IL-2 is important for CD8 T cell accumulation and function in the context of chronic LCMV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref030">30</xref>].

As the CD8 T cell deficit in GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice is not realized until after day five p.i., we administered 0.5mg of blocking anti-IL-2 to mice on days four and six p.i., and evaluated T cell responses at day eight p.i. IL-2 blockade reduced the LCMV-specific Th1 and CD8 T cell responses in GITR<sup>+/+</sup> mice to the level observed in GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice, whereas IL-2 blockade had no impact on the T cell responses in GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004517.g004">Fig. 4, I and J</xref>). Thus, GITR is critical for Th1 responses and IL-2-dependent help for CD8 T cells.</p>

<p>GITR impacts viral load both early and late during LCMV cl 13 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004517.g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

<title>GITR acts intrinsically on CD4 T cells</title>
<p>Although CD4 T cells are required for the effect of GITR on the CD8 T cell response to LCMV, it was conceivable that GITR on another cell population could indirectly affect CD4 T cell help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref019">19</xref>]. To evaluate a cell-intrinsic effect of GITR, we used mixed bone marrow chimeras, in which GITR<sup>+/+</sup> and GITR<sup>-/-</sup> cells compete in the same mouse. If GITR intrinsically affects a specific cell type, then the GITR<sup>-/-</sup> cells will be at a competitive disadvantage, whereas if the effect of GITR is extrinsic then GITR<sup>+/+</sup> and GITR<sup>-/-</sup> cells would be equally affected by the lack of GITR in another cell compartment and their ratio would be constant. To this end, we reconstituted lethally irradiated C57BL/6 mice with 1:1 mixture of CD45.2 GITR<sup>+/+</sup>:CD45.1 GITR<sup>-/-</sup> bone marrow cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004517.g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Although we used CD45.2 recipients, we have found that in separate control experiments using identical radiation schedules, &gt;95% of lymphocytes were of donor origin at three months post-reconstitution. Consistent with the minimal contribution from residual T cells following lethal irradiation, we verified that the CD45.2:CD45.1 ratio in peripheral blood was 1:1, with similar proportions of CD4, CD8 T cells and Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs prior to infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004517.g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p>

Consistent with GITR-dependent NF-κB activation in CD8 T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref043">43</xref>], (p)p65 NF-κB was increased in GITR<sup>+/+</sup> compared to GITR<sup>-/-</sup> SMARTA cells at day three p.i. and (p)S6 was also increased, consistent with GITR-dependent mTORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004517.g007">Fig. 7I</xref>).</p>
<p>mTORC1 can be activated by Akt, a kinase that critically regulates T cell metabolism and expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref038">38</xref>].

Therefore, we evaluated Akt activation following GITR cross-linking. GITR<sup>+/+</sup> SMARTA splenocytes were activated <italic>in vitro</italic> with LCMV GP<sub>61–80</sub> and IL-2 to induce GITR expression, then serum starved for 12 hours, followed by treatment with agonistic anti-GITR (DTA-1) or Rat IgG control.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The mechanism by which CD4 T cell responses contribute to the control of persistent infection, or how co-stimulation regulates CD4 T cell responses to infection remains incompletely defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref045">45</xref>]. Here we show that GITR directly augments the CD4 Th1 response to LCMV cl 13, which in turn impacts IL-2-dependent CD8 T cell expansion and viral control. The critical role of GITR on the CD4 T cells for control of LCMV cl 13 is demonstrated by the loss of GITR-mediated protection when CD4 T cells are depleted. Signaling downstream of GITR could be detected as early as day three p.i., consistent with an effect of GITR on CD4 T cell accumulation starting around day five and delayed effects on CD8 T cells appearing between days five and eight p.i. These findings are also consistent with strong induction of GITRL by day two p.i. with LCMV cl 13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref046">46</xref>]. These results demonstrate an important role for GITR early in the immune response that impacts post-priming accumulation of CD4 T cells to allow help for CD8 T cells. CD4 T cell-intrinsic GITR also reciprocally affects the Tfh and Tfr responses and, consequently, LCMV-specific IgG production. As Tfh and antibody responses are thought to contribute to the late control of persistent LCMV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref032">32</xref>], this effect of GITR on Tfh and Tfr likely impacts the late control of the infection rather than the early control, when Tfh and anti-LCMV IgG levels are comparable between GITR<sup>+/+</sup> and GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p>
<p>Previous work demonstrated a CD8 T cell-intrinsic role for GITR on survival of adoptively transferred CD8 T cells during acute respiratory infection of mice with influenza A virus, with no impact on cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref026">26</xref>]. Here we saw similar effects in the competitive bone marrow chimera experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004517.g006">Fig. 6</xref>). However, the CD4-depletion studies and the P14 GITR<sup>+/+</sup> and GITR<sup>-/-</sup> adoptive transfer studies support a CD8 T cell-extrinsic effect of GITR. LCMV cl 13 infection results in systemic prolonged inflammation, perhaps providing additional signals to compensate for the lack of GITR on CD8 T cells during the early stages of LCMV cl 13 infection. Nonetheless, the effects of GITR on CD8 T cells can be revealed under competitive conditions, but are clearly not sufficient to compensate for the requirement for GITR on the CD4 T cells to allow help for CD8 T cell and antibody responses to chronic LCMV infection.</p>
<p>LCMV-specific CD4 T cells can rescue exhausted CD8 T cell responses to LCMV cl 13, although the precise mechanism of this CD4 T cell helper function remains open to speculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref047">47</xref>]. CD25-deficient CD8 T cells have defective persistence during chronic LCMV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref030">30</xref>], and IL-2 can be used therapeutically to augment the CD8 T cell response to Armstrong (acute) and cl 13 (chronic) LCMV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref029">29</xref>]. Here we show that IL-2 blockade in GITR<sup>+/+</sup> mice resulted in an immune response indistinguishable from that in GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice, in which IL-2 blockade had no effect. These findings imply that the effect of GITR on CD4 help for CD8 T cells is IL-2 dependent. Although we have not directly shown that the CD4 T cells are the source of IL-2, taken together with the CD4 depletion studies, the IL-2 blocking data are consistent with a lack of early IL-2<sup>+</sup> Th1 accumulation as the underlying cause of the defective CD8 T cell accumulation and viral control in GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice at day eight p.i.</p>
<p>GITR-deficiency did not result in a change in the proportion or number of Tregs. However, under conditions of competition, there was a two-fold reduction in the number of GITR<sup>-/-</sup> Tregs, consistent with previous findings that GITR may have a role in peripheral maintenance of Tregs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref020">20</xref>]. When CD4 T cells were depleted, the dominant effect was a net increase in viral load, consistent with a loss of T cell help rather than the removal of a regulatory CD4 T cell population in GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Nonetheless, it is possible that GITR on effector cells could render them resistant to Tregs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref020">20</xref>]. Therefore we used DEREG mice to further assess the role of Tregs in our model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004517.s003">S3 Fig.</xref>). Diphtheria toxin (DT) was used to deplete Tregs from depletion of regulatory T cells (DEREG) mice, which express the human DT receptor under the <italic>Foxp3</italic> promoter. DT was highly toxic in the LCMV cl 13 model, even in the non-DEREG mice. Viral load in this model was three to four orders of magnitude higher than in non-DT treated GITR<sup>+/+</sup> mice, making the results difficult to interpret. Moreover, four of 26 LCMV cl 13 infected GITR<sup>+/+</sup> mice treated with DT died, whereas all GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice survived, likely due to reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines. Although the data from these experiments are difficult to interpret given the high level of toxicity, it is clear that Th1 as well as CD8 T cell differences between GITR<sup>+/+</sup> and GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice are largely retained even when &gt;90% of Tregs were depleted. These data argue against a major role for GITR on the CD4 or CD8 effector T cells in preventing the action of Tregs in this model.</p>
<p>Late in LCMV cl 13 infection Tfh accumulate and provide help for antibody responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref032">32</xref>]. GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice have impaired Tfh responses with a slight concomitant increase in the Tfr population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref036">36</xref>] and a modest decrease in LCMV-specific antibodies. Competitive bone marrow chimeras revealed that GITR also has cell-intrinsic effects on Tfh. GITRL is largely absent on total B cells, whereas a low level of GITRL can be detected on GL-7<sup>+</sup> Fas<sup>+</sup> germinal center B cells at days eight and 21 p.i. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref046">46</xref>]. It is unlikely that the defect in LCMV-specific IgG production is due to direct effects of GITR on the B cell response, as GITR is largely dispensable for B cell development and activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref048">48</xref>].</p>
<p>Competitive adoptive transfer experiments showed that the absence of GITR on CD4 T cells resulted in a three-fold defect in total LCMV-specific CD4 T cells, Th1, and Tfh sub-populations equivalently, indicating that the Th1 deficit in GITR<sup>-/-</sup> mice is not due to altered CD4 T cell differentiation. We demonstrated that differences in GITR<sup>+/+</sup> and GITR<sup>-/-</sup> CD4 numbers are not due to differences in early CD4 T cell proliferation, but instead due to defects in post-priming accumulation of CD4 T cells. GITR induces classical NF-κB to induce the pro-survival molecule Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in CD8 T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref026">26</xref>]. T cell accumulation also requires upregulation of glycolytic and biosynthetic pathways, such as induced by the Akt-mTORC1 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004517.ref038">38</xref>]. Here we show that GITR can directly activate Akt and induce phosphorylation of the downstream mTORC1 target S6, as well as activate the classical NF-κB pathway in CD4 T cells as early as day three p.i. Collectively, these signals allow the accumulation of IL-2<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells, thereby allowing them to help the early CD8 T cell response, as well as to sustain the CD4 response as it progresses towards a Tfh fate.</p>
<p>In sum, we report here a critical CD4 T cell-intrinsic role for GITR in control of chronic LCMV infection. We showed that GITR co-stimulation activates the Akt-mTORC1-S6 signaling axis as well as classical NF-κB signaling to collectively promote CD4 T cell expansion. GITR-deficient mice have defective post-priming accumulation of IL-2<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells, which precedes an impaired CD8 T cell response and loss of viral control. The effects of GITR on both Th1 and CD8 T cells are IL-2-dependent. We also reveal a novel role for GITR in sustaining the Tfh response and LCMV-specific IgG production. These findings define a critical role for CD4 T cell-intrinsic GITR signaling in early accumulation of CD4 T cells, help for CD8 T cells and viral control.</p>
