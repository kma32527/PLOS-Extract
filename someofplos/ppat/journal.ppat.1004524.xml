<abstract>
<p>Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) utilizes two different pathways for host cell entry. HCMV entry into fibroblasts requires glycoproteins gB and gH/gL, whereas HCMV entry into epithelial and endothelial cells (EC) requires an additional complex composed of gH, gL, UL128, UL130, and UL131A, referred to as the gH/gL-pentamer complex (gH/gL-PC). While there are no established correlates of protection against HCMV, antibodies are thought to be important in controlling infection. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) that prevent gH/gL-PC mediated entry into EC are candidates to be assessed for <italic>in vivo</italic> protective function. However, these potent NAb are predominantly directed against conformational epitopes derived from the assembled gH/gL-PC. To address these concerns, we constructed Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) viruses co-expressing all five gH/gL-PC subunits (MVA-gH/gL-PC), subsets of gH/gL-PC subunits (gH/gL or UL128/UL130/UL131A), or the gB subunit from HCMV strain TB40/E. We provide evidence for cell surface expression and assembly of complexes expressing full-length gH or gB, or their secretion when the corresponding transmembrane domains are deleted. Mice or rhesus macaques (RM) were vaccinated three times with MVA recombinants and serum NAb titers that prevented 50% infection of human EC or fibroblasts by HCMV TB40/E were determined. NAb responses induced by MVA-gH/gL-PC blocked HCMV infection of EC with potencies that were two orders of magnitude greater than those induced by MVA expressing gH/gL, UL128-UL131A, or gB. In addition, MVA-gH/gL-PC induced NAb responses that were durable and efficacious to prevent HCMV infection of Hofbauer macrophages, a fetal-derived cell localized within the placenta. NAb were also detectable in saliva of vaccinated RM and reached serum peak levels comparable to NAb titers found in HCMV hyperimmune globulins. This vaccine based on a translational poxvirus platform co-delivers all five HCMV gH/gL-PC subunits to achieve robust humoral responses that neutralize HCMV infection of EC, placental macrophages and fibroblasts, properties of potential value in a prophylactic vaccine.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) fetal infection during pregnancy and infection of immunocompromised patients are both clinical problems considered extremely important by the Institute of Medicine. Limited efficacy against primary HCMV infection was found using a subunit vaccine based on glycoprotein B, an important neutralizing antibody determinant blocking HCMV entry into fibroblasts. The HCMV field has been transformed by the discovery that a five-member (pentamer) protein complex is a required factor for epithelial and endothelial cell entry and indispensable for transmission as shown in non-human primates. Targeting HCMV with antibodies specific to the pentamer may interrupt horizontal and vertical transmission. We describe an innovative vaccine strategy to induce serum neutralizing antibodies of impressive magnitude against HCMV in two animal models. Using an attenuated poxvirus vector system, we demonstrate that co-expression of all five pentamer components is significantly more potent to induce serum neutralizing antibodies than subunit subsets of the complex or glycoprotein B, reaching peak levels comparable to HCMV hyperimmune globulin. A vaccine that elicits systemic and mucosal antibody responses that prevents infection of multiple cell types crucial to natural history of HCMV infection could play a role in preventing congenital HCMV infection and control of infection in immunocompromised patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>HCMV infection causes morbidity and mortality in vulnerable hosts following horizontal or vertical transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Plotkin1">[1]</xref>. In immunosuppressed subjects, multi-system life-threatening disease can occur with primary infection, reinfection by a different HCMV strain, or after viral reactivation. HCMV is the most common congenital infection worldwide (0.2–2.0% of all pregnancies) often resulting in long-term consequences to the developing fetus including mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Weller1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Pereira1">[3]</xref>. Intrauterine HCMV has a marked tropism for the developing central nervous system, and a consequence of congenital infection can be irrevocable neurological sequelae in newborns. Despite intensive research that spans four decades, there is no licensed vaccine to prevent HCMV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Griffiths1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Schleiss1">[5]</xref>. In 1999, the Institute of Medicine ranked HCMV infection in the highest category for vaccine preventable diseases because potential societal benefits from reduction in associated morbidity and mortality would far outweigh development costs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Stratton1">[6]</xref>. Development of an HCMV vaccine that efficiently confers protection against primary HCMV infection or reinfection of a woman of child-bearing years by limiting horizontal transmission is a candidate solution to significantly reduce the devastating consequences of intrauterine HCMV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Lilja1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>A number of challenges have inhibited progress in HCMV vaccine development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Krause1">[8]</xref>. HCMV vaccine strategies have been guided, in large part, by historical precedents of currently licensed vaccines demonstrating that induction of pathogen-specific B cell immunity protects against infection and/or disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Plotkin2">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Keating1">[11]</xref>. The disappointing Phase 2 trial showing that HCMV hyperimmune globulins are ineffective in the treatment of congenital HCMV infection has renewed interest in eliciting NAb by an HCMV vaccine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Nigro1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Corti1">[14]</xref>. Studies using fibroblasts as a cell substrate for infection have demonstrated that the envelope glycoprotein B (gB) is essential for HCMV entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Rasmussen1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Isaacson1">[17]</xref>. gB elicits the majority of antibodies in immune individuals that neutralize fibroblast infection by blocking gB-mediated fusion between the virion and cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Kinzler1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Liu1">[23]</xref>. Importantly, pregnant women who develop high avidity anti-gB NAb during primary infection are less likely to give birth to an infant with congenital infection compared to women who are initially CMV seronegative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Boppana1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Fowler1">[26]</xref>. These observations formed the rationale to focus HCMV subunit vaccine design using gB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Lilja1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Pass1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Pass2">[28]</xref>. A Phase II clinical trial based on recombinant gB admixed in the adjuvant MF59 established a protection level of 50% against primary HCMV infection among women who had given birth in the preceding year <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Pass3">[29]</xref>. gB adjuvanted in MF59 is the sole example of a vaccine that has shown significant efficacy to protect healthy women against primary HCMV infection and seronegative solid organ transplant recipients from infection as a result of receiving a seropositive donor organ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Griffiths2">[30]</xref>. These clinical results provide evidence that a vaccine which targets major neutralizing epitopes may have a role in protection against primary HCMV infection. Consequently there is a strong interest to optimize vaccine strategies by identifying dominant viral targets of the host immune response that will improve protective efficacy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Krause1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>While prior work highlights the importance of gB-specific immune responses in limiting primary infection, recent discoveries on viral entry conclude that NAb responses that prevent HCMV infection of various non-fibroblast cell types, including endothelial, epithelial cells (EC) and monocytes, are qualitatively different from those blocking fibroblast infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Gerna1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Wang1">[33]</xref>. A current model proposes that HCMV entry into fibroblasts occurs by fusion at the plasma membrane and depends on envelope glycoprotein complexes composed of gB, gH/gL and/or gH/gL/gO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Vanarsdall1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Vanarsdall3">[37]</xref>. Alternatively, HCMV entry into EC is mediated by endocytosis and requires an additional glycoprotein complex consisting of UL128, UL130, UL131A, and gH/gL, termed the gH/gL pentamer complex (gH/gL-PC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Wang1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Vanarsdall3">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Ryckman1">[39]</xref>. Several studies provide evidence that gH/gL-PC is the dominant target of NAb in sera from naturally HCMV positive individuals that prevents HCMV infection of EC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Gerna1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Cui1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Fouts2">[44]</xref>. Significantly, the majority of NAb in HCMV hyperimmune globulins (CMV-IVIg) are directed against epitopes of gH/gL-PC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Fouts2">[44]</xref>. In contrast to NAb targeting epitopes of gB, gH/gL, or gM/gN that neutralize HCMV infection of fibroblasts or EC with moderate potency, NAb that recognize conformational epitopes of gH/gL-PC neutralize HCMV infection of EC with unusually high potency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Macagno1">[41]</xref>. In addition, there is correlative evidence obtained by <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements for NAb responses to gH/gL-PC which have implications for the <italic>in vivo</italic> control of viral dissemination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Lilleri1">[45]</xref>. These data are consistent with previous studies showing that gH/gL-PC is an important target of the host response to HCMV infection, and induction of gH/gL-PC-specific NAb should be evaluated as a potential component of an HCMV vaccine trial.</p>
<p>We demonstrated that vaccination of rhesus macaques (RM) with a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-derived MVA vector co-expressing all five rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) orthologs of HCMV gH/gL-PC elicits potent RhCMV-specific NAb responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Wussow1">[46]</xref>. Based on this observation, we constructed a single MVA that co-expressed all five HCMV gH/gL-PC subunits derived from the clinical-like isolate, TB40/E which has both EC and macrophage tropism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Sinzger1">[47]</xref>. This vector induced EC-specific NAb titers in mice and RM that were orders of magnitude higher than those induced by MVA expressing only gH/gL-PC subunit subsets (gH/gL or UL128/UL130/UL131A), or solely gB. In addition, MVA-gH/gL-PC elicited NAb preventing HCMV infection of fibroblasts with titers comparable to those induced by MVA expressing gH/gL or gB. NAb generated in RM by vaccination with MVA-gH/gL-PC also inhibited infection of placental macrophages called Hofbauer cells (HC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Tang1">[48]</xref>. The avidity of CMV-specific antibodies durably rose after MVA-gH/gL-PC vaccination, indicating that the quality of responses is consistent with protective immunity. These results describe a novel vaccine strategy that induces high level NAb titers that interfere with two prominent HCMV entry routes utilizing a single vaccine vector, a possible requirement to prevent clinical HCMV infection.</p>

<title>Generation of MVA vectors expressing gH/gL-PC subunit proteins or gB</title>
<p>We used as a model our recently described BAC-derived MVA vaccine vector for RhCMV gH/gL-PC, to rapidly and efficiently construct a single MVA vector expressing all five HCMV gH/gL-PC subunits (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g001">Figure 1A</xref> for details) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Wussow1">[46]</xref>. gH/gL-PC subunits were derived from HCMV TB40/E, a well-characterized clinical-like HCMV strain with an intact complement of gH/gL-PC genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Sinzger2">[49]</xref>. Two versions of gH/gL-PC vectors were constructed expressing either a full-length version of gH (MVA-gH/gL-PC) or a variant of gH in which the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic domains were deleted (MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). To provide a comparative basis for evaluating the NAb responses elicited by immunization with MVA-gH/gL-PC and MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ, MVA vectors expressing full-length gH/gL (MVA-gH/gL), UL128/UL130/UL131A (MVA-UL128-131), full-length gB (MVA-gB), and TM-deleted gB (MVA-gBΔ) were also constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). gO is known to associate with gH/gL and to contribute to the endoplasmic reticulum transport of these proteins, anchoring either gH/gL or gH/gL/gO complexes within the virion envelope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Ryckman2">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Zhou1">[51]</xref>. We did not investigate co-expression of gH/gL and gO because gO does not promote gH/gL cell surface expression, and is therefore unlikely to aid in more effectively displaying gH/gL to the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Vanarsdall2">[36]</xref>. We also did not test a combination of the gH/gL-PC and gO, since gO would likely compete with UL128, UL130 and UL131A subunits to associate with gH/gL and, thus, prevent or decrease the formation of gH/gL-PC and the induction of potent EC specific NAb responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Vanarsdall2">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Ryckman2">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Zhou1">[51]</xref>. Full-length gH or gB ORFs with an intact TM domain as well as their TM-deleted versions were inserted between the essential ORFs G1L and I8R of the MVA genome, an insertion site that is known to provide stable propagation of large and/or unstable sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Wyatt1">[52]</xref>. Vectors to express full-length or TM-deleted gH and gB were constructed to test which complex, a membrane-tethered or a soluble one would elicit the strongest NAb responses. Deletion of the TM domain of gB has been shown to improve the protein expression and the generation of NAb when compared to its full-length counterpart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Wang2">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Endresz1">[54]</xref>.

<p><bold>A)</bold> Gene insertion using transfer vector. The transfer vector contains in the indicated order a mH5 promoter, a multiple cloning site (<italic>MCS</italic>), and a transcription termination signal (TS). It further comprises a <italic>I-SceI</italic> recognition site and a kanamycin resistance marker (Kan<sup>R</sup>) both flanked by a 50 bp MVA sequence duplication (small black boxes). The entire construct is flanked by two ∼700 bp sequences of the MVA insertion site (large green and red bars).

<title>Expression of gH/gL-PC or gB subunits from MVA</title>

There was no discernible size difference between full-length gH (MVA-gH/gL-PC and MVA-gH/gL) and truncated gH (MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ), since the size difference of the TM-deleted gH (ΔgH) and its full-length counterpart was only fourteen amino acids (AA) taking into account deletion of the TM and addition of the myc-tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Comparable levels of expression for each of the gH/gL-PC components were found from either the MVA-gH/gL-PC or MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Expression levels of UL128, UL130, and UL131A appeared to be slightly greater in MVA-UL128-131 than in either MVA-gH/gL-PC or MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ. Of note, the MVA-expressed BR5 antigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Schmelz1">[57]</xref> used as a loading control had slightly higher expression in both MVA-UL128-131 and MVA expressing the fluorescent marker Venus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Wang3">[58]</xref> than any of the gH expressing MVA vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). These small differences in expression levels have not been explored further, and may reflect properties of MVA and/or the protein subunits. Full-length gB harvested from whole cells shows a 130 kDa precursor (PC) band, and a 55 kDa band corresponding to the processed C-terminal (CT) fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

In summary, these data show that MVA-BAC technology allows rapid generation of MVA expressing all five gH/gL-PC subunits with either gH or gHΔ, subunit subsets (UL128-UL131A or gH/gL), gB or gBΔ proteins with sufficient stability for animal vaccination.</p>

<title>Secretion of gH/gL-PC subunits or gB depends on transmembrane deletion</title>
<p>We first investigated if deletion of the TM domain of gH led to secretion of the gH/gL-PC subunits by performing immunoblot analysis of concentrated serum-free medium from chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) which are permissive for MVA infection. As observed in infected BHK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), comparable levels of the individual gH/gL-PC subunits were detectable in whole cell lysates of CEF cells infected with MVA expressing subsets or all 5 gH/gL-PC subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g002">Figure 2C</xref>;Cell). In contrast, efficient secretion of all 5 gH/gL-PC subunits was only detectable in the medium of CEF cells infected with MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ (without gH TM); whereas none of the subunits were detected in the medium of MVA-gH/gL-PC (with gH TM) infected CEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g002">Figure 2C</xref>; Med). In addition, gH or gL was not detectable in the medium of MVA-gH/gL (with gH TM) infected CEFs. In the case of MVA-UL128-131, only small amounts of UL130 and UL131A were observed in the medium of MVA-UL128-131 infected cells, though UL128 was undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). These data indicate that deletion of the gH TM promotes efficient secretion of all 5 gH/gL-PC subunits, whereas maintenance of the gH TM retains the gH/gL-PC subunits or gH/gL in the cell or on the cell surface when co-expressed from MVA. Therefore, we believe that the data implicates the gH TM as a pivotal structure for the co-localization of all five gH/gL-PC subunits on the cell surface, and in the absence of the gH TM, the complex is secreted into the medium from the MVA-infected cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Presumably, the scaffold properties of the gH protein allow assembly of the full five member complex anchored to the cell surface. We also investigated the impact of TM deletion on secretion of the gB protein. Protein species corresponding to the precursor and the C-terminal fragments of gB and gBΔTM in lysates of MVA-gB or MVA-gBΔ infected CEFs were similar to those found in BHK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g002">Figure 2B and D</xref>; Cell). However, only the cleavage product of the gBΔTM protein was detectable in the medium from gBΔ-MVA-infected CEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, Med). We hypothesize that the gB TM tethers the full-length or precursor forms of gB onto the cell surface which limits the secretion of these forms of gB from MVA-gB infected cells.</p>

<title>Complex formation of gH/gL-PC subunits expressed from MVA</title>
<p>We examined if multi-protein complexes were formed by expression of gH/gL-PC from MVA-gH/gL-PC, gH/gL expressed from MVA-gH/gL or UL128-UL130-UL131A expressed from MVA-UL128-131, and characterized their subunit composition using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) with two different antibody (Ab) preparations. Using the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 11-1-1 to HCMV gH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Simpson1">[59]</xref> to isolate protein complexes containing gH, all five gH/gL-PC subunits were immunoprecipitated from BHK cells infected with MVA-gH/gL-PC, and gH/gL proteins were immunoprecipitated from cells infected with MVA-gH/gL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). As expected, the UL128-UL131A proteins expressed from MVA-UL128-131 were not immunoprecipitated by the anti-gH mAb. Similar to the gH antibody results, polyclonal antibodies to UL130 immunoprecipitated all five gH/gL-PC subunits from BHK cells infected with MVA-gH/gL-PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g003">Figures 3A and B</xref>). As expected, gH/gL protein complexes expressed from MVA-gH/gL were not immunoprecipitated by UL130 polyclonal antibodies, though UL128, UL130 and UL131A proteins expressed from MVA-UL128-131 were immunoprecipitated by UL130 antisera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In comparison to the immunoprecipitated proteins from MVA-gH/gL-PC, higher amounts of gH/gL were confirmed following IP of gH from MVA-gH/gL infected cells, and of UL128, UL130, and UL131A after IP of UL130 from cells infected with MVA-UL128-131. This difference in immunoprecipitated gH/gL or UL128-131A proteins can be explained by differing protein amounts extracted from MVA-gH/gL-PC infected cells in comparison to proteins extracted from cells infected with MVA-gH/gL or MVA-UL128-131, respectively (input; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). HCMV proteins were not immunoprecipitated by an IgG control Ab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) or rabbit polyclonal pre-immune serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), confirming the specific co-IP of individual gH/gL-PC subunits by the gH mAb or UL130 antiserum. The major conclusions from these observations were that (1) four other gH/gL-PC subunits associate either directly or indirectly with gH or UL130 and are pulled down with anti-gH or anti-UL130 antibodies when co-expressed from MVA-gH/gL-PC, (2) gL interacts with gH when co-expressed from MVA-gH/gL, and (3) UL128-UL130-UL131A interact with each other when expressed by MVA-UL128-131. Together, these data indicate that all three MVA constructs can express HCMV proteins capable of forming complexes, at least when cell-associated.</p>

<title>Secretion of gH/gL-PCΔ complexes from MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ infected BHK cells</title>
<p>An important result would be to demonstrate that the subunits that compose gH/gL-PCΔ physically associate with each other to form a secreted complex. To determine if the complex that was released into the medium of cells infected with MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ contained all five gH/gL-PC subunits, we performed co-IP using concentrated medium harvested from MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ infected CEF. IP was carried out either using mAb 11.1.1 to gH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) or rabbit polyclonal antiserum to UL130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), with a similar result that all 5 subunits were shown to associate by co-IP. While the gH mAb was more efficient in detecting and precipitating the gH/gL-PC than the polyclonal antiserum to UL130, the qualitative result was the same, which shows evidence that the secreted form of the gH/gL-PCΔ is maintained as an intact complex in the cell culture medium.</p>

<title>TM-dependent cell surface expression of gH/gL-PC</title>
<p>Next, we investigated whether the efficient transport of gH complexes (gH/gL-PC, gH/gL-PCΔ, or gH/gL) to the cell surface depends on the TM of the gH subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). BHK cells infected with MVA recombinants were analyzed by flow cytometry (FC) using the anti-gH Ab 14-4b to evaluate cell surface expression of the gH subunit with or without its TM domain. Cells infected with MVA-gH/gL-PC showed higher expression of cell-surface gH than other infected samples and the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The minimal detection of cell-surface gH on MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), may reflect transit of soluble complexes through the plasma membrane, rather than actual cell-surface expression. As expected, cell surface expression of gH was detected on MVA-gH/gL-infected cells, although at a lower density than on MVA-gH/gL-PC infected cells, consistent with previous observations that the transport of gH to the cell-surface is more efficient when all 5 gH/gL-PC subunits are co-expressed in comparison to only gH and gL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Ryckman1">[39]</xref>. We confirmed the FC results that we obtained with the anti-gH mAb by using the same rabbit polyclonal Ab preparation specific for UL130 that was used in the co-IP experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g003">Figure 3</xref>. Cell surface UL130 antigen was detected on MVA-gH/gL-PC infected cells, although not on cells infected either with MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ or MVA-gH/gL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). UL130 was also detectable on cells infected with MVA-UL128-131 with comparable density to that observed for MVA-gH/gL-PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). GFP expression quantified by its fluorescence properties was used to demonstrate equal infection of cells by all MVA vectors examined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g004">Figure 4A and B</xref> (data not shown). BAC derived MVA expressed GFP due to the vector construction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Cottingham1">[60]</xref>. Collectively, these results indicate that gH and UL130 are transported to the cell surface when all five gH/gL-PC subunits are co-expressed from MVA when gH contains a TM. Further proof is needed to establish if gH and UL130 are expressed on the cell surface in a complex with UL128, UL131A, and gL. Nonetheless, as shown by the secretion experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g003">Figure 3C and D</xref>, complexes composed of all five gH/gL-PC subunits are secreted and not cell-surface associated when the gH TM is deleted. Further work is needed to explain how UL130 is transported to the cell surface in the absence of gH/gL.</p>

<title>IF demonstrates cellular localization of gH/gL complexes is dependent on presence of TM</title>
<p>We utilized immunofluorescence (IF) to detect surface expression of gH on BHK cells infected with MVA-gH/gL-PC, MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ or MVA-gH/gL by staining with anti-gH HCMV mAb 14-4b. We permeabilized MVA-infected cells to facilitate intracellular Ab penetration. This enabled labeling of internal cytoplasmic proteins to compare with the results of Ab labeling of non-permeabilized cells. Consistent with the FC data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), cell surface staining of gH without permeabilization was only observed for constructs expressing TM containing glycoprotein complexes (MVA-gH/gL-PC and MVA-gH/gL <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004524.s001">Figure S1</xref>; non-permeabilized). In contrast, only a few cells infected with MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ showed staining for gH with less intensity when compared to MVA-gH/gL-PC infected cells, which may reflect TM-deleted gH protein transitioning through the plasma membrane or intracellular penetration of the gH Ab through leaky cell membranes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004524.s001">Figure S1</xref>). However, when cells infected with any of the three constructs were permeabilized, the signal was brighter and emanated prominently from the cytoplasm. The effect is most prominent in the case of MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ, but clearly visible with either MVA-gH/gL or MVA-gH/gL-PC infected cells. GFP expression was monitored to localize areas of viral foci. As shown in the control panel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004524.s001">Figure S1</xref>), most nuclei were intensely stained with an anti-Histone 3 Ab when cells were permeabilized, while only a few scattered nuclei were stained with less intensity in non-permeabilized cells. This indicates that only permeabilization allowed intracellular Ab entry, whereas non-permeabilized cells were resistant to Ab entry. We were unable to effectively use the UL130 polyclonal antiserum for IF studies to replicate the results we found with the anti-gH mAb; therefore we cannot conclude that UL130 is present on the cell-surface alone or as part of a protein complex using the IF approach (data not shown). Direct evidence that gH with a TM is associated with the other four gH/gL-PC subunits will require further study with Ab reagents that bind to cell-surface forms of these proteins.</p>

However, the kinetics of reaching peak NAb titers in MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ vaccinated mice were quite different. NAb were undetectable following the initial vaccination, but increased to maximum NT50 levels after two boosts (peak titers &gt;62000; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g005">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004524.s005">Table S1</xref>). Substantially lower titers were observed with MVA-gH/gL (peak titer = 2,170) and lower yet with MVA-gBΔ (peak titer = 250). No EC NAb were stimulated with MVA-UL128-131 or MVA-gB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). In a repeat experiment examining MVA-gH/gL-PC, high titer NAb were stably elevated over a period of at least fifty weeks after initial vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). In experiments conducted with HUVECs using the identical methods, we found almost identical results as documented on ARPE-19 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g005">Figure 5B-D, F</xref>) using week seven (data not shown) and week sixteen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) serum. Both gH/gL-PC expression constructs, either with or without gH TM, induce comparable peak NAb levels, but these titers are more rapidly induced with a membrane-anchored form than with a TM deleted form of the gH/gL-PC. The impact of the TM on the kinetics of the NAb response is noteworthy as it may reflect a reduced capacity by the immune system to generate a rapid humoral response to a secreted form versus the cell surface form of the gH/gL-PC. Ultimately, after three vaccinations, both forms of the complex support the development of equivalent levels of NAb.</p>

The five proteins that compose the gH/gL-PC of TB40/E and TR have protein sequences which are &gt;97% identical (Accession # EF999921 and KF021605). Sequence information for the clinical-like VHL/e strain is unavailable. There is sufficient sequence variability in the gH amino acid sequence to define two separate clusters of gH sequences designated as gH-group 1 and group 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004524.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

Yet, serum antibodies generated against TB40/E proteins expressed from MVA neutralized group 1 (TR) and 2 (TB40/E) gH strains equivalently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). In fact, MVA-gH/gL-PC and MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ induced equivalent NAb titers against all three HCMV strains, reaching NT50 levels &gt;30,000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Similarly, MVA-gH/gL elicited comparable NAb titers against all three strains, although all were markedly lower than those generated following immunization with either MVA-gH/gL-PC or MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). MVA-UL128-131, MVA-gB, or MVA-gBΔ did not stimulate detectable EC-specific NAb in this experiment. These data indicate that MVA-gH/gL-PC and MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ elicit high titer NAb, and far greater than MVA-gH/gL to prevent HCMV infection of EC with heterologous HCMV isolates with limited gH/gL-PC sequence diversity.</p>

<title>MVA-gH/gL-PC induces high NAb titers in vaccinated RM: EC neutralization</title>
<p>We performed vaccinations studies in RM to investigate NAb induction by MVA-gH/gL-PC or MVA-gH/gL in an animal model that is evolutionarily closely related to humans. RhCMV-uninfected RM were immunized three times with MVA-gH/gL-PC, MVA-gH/gL or MVA-Venus (four RM per group) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). We chose MVA-gH/gL-PC instead of MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ because the full-length version of gH/gL-PC produced higher titer NAb with faster kinetics than with TM-deleted gH in our mouse experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g005">Figure 5B and E</xref>). All MVA vaccines were well-tolerated with no evidence of local injection site or systemic reaction (data not shown). Both MVA-gH/gL and MVA-gH/gL-PC stimulated EC- and fibroblast-specific NAb responses in RM, and, as observed following vaccination in mice, notably higher EC titers were elicited with MVA-gH/gL-PC than with MVA-gH/gL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g006">Figure 6B-F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004524.s006">Table S2</xref>).

Memory NAb responses were stimulated after two booster immunizations with MVA-gH/gL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g006">Figure 6D and F</xref>), but peak titers (150–530; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004524.s006">Table S2</xref>) were two orders of magnitude less than those generated with MVA-gH/gL-PC (29,960–78,340, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004524.s006">Table S2</xref>). NAb titers declined for both MVA-gH/gL-PC and MVA-gH/gL, but one distinction for MVA-gH/gL-PC was that NAb titers declined to a plateau, and remained elevated fourteen weeks after the second booster at week twelve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g006">Figures 6B and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004524.s006">Table S2</xref>).

We also investigated if serum from RM that was active on ARPE-19 cells could neutralize HCMV infection of HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g006">Figure 6G</xref>).

<title>MVA-gH/gL-PC induces high NAb titers in vaccinated RM: Fibroblast neutralization</title>
<p>Sera from monkeys vaccinated with MVA-gH/gL-PC or MVA-gH/gL were tested for NAb that prevented HCMV TB40/E infection of MRC-5 fibroblasts. As observed in mice, MVA-gH/gL-PC and MVA-gH/gL induced comparable fibroblast-specific NAb titers in vaccinated RM (peak titers 190–630 and 100–310, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g006">Figures. 6C, E, and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004524.s006">Table S2</xref>). Two injections were required to stimulate detectable NAb with both vectors. As with NAb that interfered with HCMV infection of EC, comparable NAb interfering with fibroblast infection progressively declined after the first and second booster. While the second booster stimulated NAb titers, peak titers after the second boost did not reach those observed after the first boost, and NAb titers were below or at the level of detection within six weeks of the second boost (eighteen weeks). These data confirm in RM that MVA-gH/gL-PC induces NAb that prevent HCMV infection of fibroblasts with levels comparable to those induced by MVA-gH/gL. Moreover, these data extend our mouse results in a primate host and demonstrate that MVA expressing all five gH/gL-PC subunits induce high titer HCMV-specific NAb. Detection of ARPE-19 specific NAb titers that exceed those measured on fibroblasts is consistent with observations made with HCMV-positive human sera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Fouts2">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Wang4">[65]</xref>.

<title>MVA-gH/gL-PC induced higher NAb titer than HCMV positive serum preparations</title>
<p>To better gauge the magnitude of the immune responses generated in vaccinated mice and RM, NAb titers were compared to a pool of HCMV seropositive sera, commercially available HCMV IgG sera, human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and CMV-IVIg preparations which all should be considered as arising from chronically infected individuals.

Peak NAb titers generated in vaccinated RM and mice were similar to the titer of CMV-IVIg in sera from chronically infected humans.

<title>All MVA recombinants induce binding antibodies</title>
<p>We noted profound differences in the capacity of different combinations of gH/gL-PC subunits to support production of NAb. The absence or lower levels of NAb in mice vaccinated with MVA-UL128-131, gB or gH/gL in both mice and RM compared to gH/gL-PC prompted us to investigate if certain MVA recombinants were incapable of stimulating the production of BAb. Serum samples from animals vaccinated with MVA recombinants were evaluated by WB for BAb to gH/gL-PC subunits or gB. Mice vaccinated with MVA-gH/gL-PC and MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ developed BAb to gH, gL, UL128, UL131A, though not to UL130 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004524.s004">Figure S4</xref>). In contrast, MVA-UL128-131 not only induced BAb to UL128 and UL131A, but to UL130 as well. Mice vaccinated with MVA-gH/gL stimulated BAb to gH and gL proteins as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004524.s004">Figure S4</xref>). However, there was far greater intensity of gL and gH recognition from the gH/gL construct than MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ which may reflect steric interference with immune recognition. In addition, we detected BAb to gB in MVA-gB or MVA-gBΔ vaccinated mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004524.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Interestingly, RM vaccinated with MVA-gH/gL-PC developed BAb to gH, gL, UL128, and UL130, though not to UL131A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004524.s004">Figure S4</xref>). As observed in mice, MVA-gH/gL elicited BAb to both gH and gL in RM, with gL showing greater immune recognition than when expressed from MVA-gH/gL-PC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004524.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Although all single gH/gL-PC subunits exhibited capacity for an immunological response, only their co-expression led to high titer NAb that prevented HCMV infection of EC. These results support the hypothesis that NAb against gH/gL-PC are directed against a higher order structure or conformational epitopes as a result of co-expression of five gH/gL-PC proteins.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It has been repeatedly confirmed that cell types besides fibroblasts, notably EC, monocytes, Langerhans cells, and decidual cells of the placenta influence HCMV natural history following initial exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Sinzger1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Pereira2">[78]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Lauron1">[79]</xref>. Moreover, antibodies that neutralize HCMV infection of non-fibroblast cell types constitute a significant proportion of total HCMV NAb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Gerna1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Cui1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Wang4">[65]</xref>. Accordingly gH/gL-PC has become a focus of HCMV vaccine efforts since HCMV viral entry into EC and monocytes is absolutely dependent on the presence of a functional gH/gL-PC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Gerna1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Wang1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Cui1">[40]</xref>. However, HCMV entry into EC of different origin or modification than HUVECs or ARPE-19 cells may be gH/gL-PC independent, since in one case it has been reported that the gH/gL-PC defective HCMV strain Towne is apparently able to infect and replicate in fibroblasts, microvasculature endothelial cells, and immortalized retinal epithelial cells with comparable efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Dunn1">[80]</xref>. An obstacle for targeting gH/gL-PC by vaccination is that formation of EC-specific NAb requires co-expression of all five gH/gL-PC subunits. This requires that vaccines targeting gH/gL-PC-neutralizing epitopes co-express all the individual proteins, to ensure cell surface expression of multimeric protein structures that are needed to form conformational epitopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Macagno1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our previous study provided a template for efficiently stimulating HCMV gH/gL-PC-specific NAb in vaccinated RM. BAC-derived MVA was engineered to co-express all five RhCMV gH/gL-PC proteins, and RM immunized with MVA-RhgH/gL-PC developed antibodies that neutralized EC infection with a virulent RhCMV strain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Wussow1">[46]</xref>. One advantage of this approach is using bacterial genetics to serially introduce the five genes encoding gH/gL-PC proteins, which shortens the time for vector construction. In addition, a single vector for co-expression means that every vaccine infected cell <italic>in vivo</italic> can express all combinations of multimeric protein structures that encode epitopes stimulating NAb. This study extends our work in RhCMV with a focus on MVA vectors that express two forms of HCMV gH/gL-PC. We show that both forms of gH/gL-PC stimulate potent serum Ab titers in murine and primate hosts that neutralize infection of EC, HC and fibroblasts with different HCMV strains.</p>
<p>Our biochemical studies provided valuable insight into the role of gH as a membrane anchor and the Ab accessible surfaces of the complex. The importance of the contribution of gH/gL towards NAb stimulation by gH/gL-PC is emphasized, because expression of UL128-130-131A in the absence of gH/gL fails to stimulate EC-NAb. Using co-IP, in which a mAb to gH or polyclonal antisera to UL130 results in the pull-down of all five gH/gL-PC proteins is consistent with the formation of a complex composed of five subunits. This suggests that both gH and UL130 are accessible by Ab in the secreted and cellular forms of the gH/gL-PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g003">Figures 3A-D</xref>). The FC results provide further evidence, but do not prove that the TM-containing gH/gL-PC is accessible by gH and UL130 Ab on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g004">Figure 4</xref>). It is significant that we detected a cell-associated trimolecular UL128-UL130-UL131A complex using co-IP after in <italic>vitro</italic> cell infection with MVA-UL128-131; since vaccination with MVA-UL128-131 did not cause the development of NAb preventing HCMV infection of the cell types we investigated. Paradoxically, UL128-UL130-UL131A proteins form a sufficiently stable intracellular complex to be detected by co-IP using the UL130 polyclonal antisera and BAb were stimulated for each of the UL128-131A subunits. Moreover UL130 is detectable by FC on the surface of cells infected with MVA-UL128-131. These data provide evidence that the gH/gL scaffold facilitates the production of NAb, and that complexes of UL128-130-131A proteins without gH/gL are insufficient to induce NAb. MVA expressing only gH/gL stimulated EC-specific NAb following vaccination in both mice and RM. However, the titers generated with MVA-gH/gL were one to two orders of magnitude lower than those generated with either MVA-gH/gL-PC or MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ. We conclude that gH/gL-PC composed of five proteins results in higher titer NAb than elicited by gH/gL complexes. Our results demonstrate that co-expression of all five subunits of gH/gL-PC is an efficient mechanism to stimulate high titer EC-specific NAb. However, alternative explanations could account for our observations, since the stoichiometry of the subunits is unknown. For example, gH might form multiple complexes with different combinations of the other gH/gL-PC proteins which collectively would co-precipitate with gH.</p>
<p>MVA-gH/gL-PC and MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ were generated to evaluate the impact of the TM domain on the localization of the complexes, either within the cell or secreted in the medium, and whether membrane-attached gH/gL-PC with full-length gH or soluble gH/gL-PCΔ with TM-deleted gH is a better immunogen to induce NAb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Wang2">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Endresz2">[81]</xref>. Using a WB approach, we compared efficiency of expression of gH/gL-PC subunits in the whole cell when gH was expressed with or without a TM domain and found no difference in the expression levels of individual gH/gL-PC subunits. We conclude from our results that the presence or absence of the TM domain determines if the complex will be secreted into the medium. Co-IP was used again to discover that the gH/gL-PCΔ remains intact in the medium, as we were able to account for all five subunits using the mAb to gH and a polyclonal sera against UL130. This finding helps explain why we found strong NAb responses when vaccinating with MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ, since the secreted complex remains intact, and likely stimulates the generation of the required conformational Ab that we and others find to be highly neutralizing against EC and fibroblast infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Macagno1">[41]</xref>. We found a similar result with gB, with or without the TM domain. In that case, in the presence of the TM domain, both the precursor and membrane-spanning processed forms are detected intracellularly, although not in the medium. In contrast, in the case of the expression product without the TM, we found that the processed C-terminal fragment is expressed both intracellularly and in the medium. A further independent confirmation of the influence of the TM on the localization of complexes was carried out using FC or IF. The TM domain localized the protein to the cell surface, presumably co-localized with other gH/gL-PC subunits, while the absence of the TM dramatically reduced cell-surface expression. These results agree with prior studies by Ryckman and collaborators investigating the gH/gL-PC and others who investigated gB secretion requirements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Ryckman1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Wang2">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Britt3">[82]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Spaete1">[83]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that MVA-gH/gL-PC and MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ boost the immune system to produce comparable NAb titers. However, induction of maximum NAb responses required only one boost with MVA-gH/gL-PC versus two boosts with MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ. The necessity for only two vaccinations with MVA-gH/gL-PC to induce maximum NAb titers could reduce anti-vector immunity and simplify the regimen. The lower number of vaccinations using MVA-gH/gL-PC and faster kinetics to obtain a maximal NAb response favors that form of the construct for clinical translation and provided the rationale why it was chosen instead of MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ for evaluation in monkeys. However, further experiments including long-term studies are required to conclude if gH/gL-PC with full-length gH is superior to TM-deleted gH for induction of durable and potent NAb. In the case of gB, we anticipated that gBΔ should induce far greater NAb titers than full-length gB on MRC-5 fibroblasts based on work by Plotkin and associates and our prior work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Wang2">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Endresz2">[81]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Gonczol2">[84]</xref>. While the results with fibroblasts and different forms of gB were unexpected, there were significant differences in the experimental design of our previous studies as well as those from the Plotkin laboratory. For instance, the clinical-like strain TB40/E was not previous employed and the current vaccine virus was derived from an MVA-BAC as opposed to the cell-culture method that we used in our previous study.</p>
<p>Our studies contribute to the understanding of the role of gH/gL-PC as a pivotal target of the host NAb response to HCMV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Wang1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Lilleri1">[45]</xref>. We demonstrated that NAb induced by MVA-gH/gL-PC that prevent HCMV infection of EC are at higher titers when compared to NAb that prevent HCMV infection of fibroblasts. This is consistent with NAb responses observed after natural HCMV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Gerna1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Cui1">[40]</xref>. The strength and utility of MVA-gH/gL-PC as a vaccine is illustrated by its ability to boost the immune system in two different animal species to reach peak levels of serum NAb that are higher than those measured from IVIg and roughly equivalent to CMV-IVIg. The significance of equaling or surpassing NAb levels in IVIg and CMV-IVIg is to develop an approach that supersedes the efficacy of these products that failed to provide adequate protection against congenital HCMV infection and disease in the recently reported randomized Phase 2 trial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Nigro1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Revello1">[13]</xref>. Noteworthy are studies with HC, a placental cell of fetal origin and depot of HCMV that may contribute to transplacental crossing of HCMV, a potential initiating factor of congenital infection and disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Schleiss1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Pereira2">[78]</xref>. We observed strong neutralization of the clinical-like isolate TB40/E which makes the vaccine a possible means to prevent HCMV infection of the placenta and/or fetus. Studies of RhCMV infection of pregnant RM provide an excellent model to investigate the capacity of a rhesus gH/gL-PC vaccine to limit congenital infection as we described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Kaur1">[85]</xref>.</p>
<p>We discovered that the MVA-gH/gL-PC vaccine stimulated EC-specific NAb in saliva of vaccinated RM. Furthermore, we characterized the Ab class that was found in the saliva as either mucosal IgA or transudated IgG. Interestingly, the peaks of both IgA and IgG corresponded to peak NAb titers in two of the four RM. As anticipated, MVA-gH/gL-PC vaccinated animals showed more peaks of IgA and IgG than MVA-gH/gL vaccinated animals. Recently, low level saliva NAb to HCMV were measured in HCMV-positive individuals, so it is relevant that we measured comparable NAb after MVA-gH/gL-PC vaccination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Saccoccio1">[73]</xref>. While we could not measure saliva IgA, IgG, or NAb in all RM, this could be attributable to genetic diversity of the RM we studied, analogous to findings that not all HCMV-positive humans had measurable saliva NAb. Moreover, we cannot exclude that some RM developed saliva NAb titers of biological relevance that were under the detection limit of the assay. We conclude that MVA-gH/gL-PC induces NAb in saliva from RM analogous to naturally infected humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Lilleri1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Saccoccio1">[73]</xref>.</p>
<p>The apparent paradox that MVA-gH/gL-PC induced NAb that prevented HCMV infection of fibroblasts can be explained by proposing that a subset of the NAb repertoire generated by MVA-gH/gL-PC are uniquely directed against gH/gL epitopes without the accompanying UL128-UL130-UL131A subunit contribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Macagno1">[41]</xref>. It is striking that NAb responses induced by MVA-gH/gL-PC and MVA-gH/gL that block HCMV infection of fibroblasts are almost identical to each other in titer and kinetics. This suggests either that gH/gL subunits as part of the gH/gL-PC encode neutralizing epitopes similar to those presented by the gH/gL heterodimer, or that MVA-gH/gL-PC generates both gH/gL heterodimers as well as the gH/gL-PC that is composed of all five proteins, with each complex stimulating NAb. Further biochemical studies will clarify which complexes are generated by the MVA-gH/gL-PC vaccine. The results of this study indicate that gH/gL-PC can be used to stimulate NAb against both the fusion and endocytic pathways of virus attachment and entry. An important contribution highlights that the gH/gL-PC is dispensable for Langerhans-type dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Lauron1">[79]</xref>. Nevertheless, the property of the MVA-gH/gL-PC vaccine to neutralize both fibroblast and EC infection by HCMV, suggests that it would be important to test if the MVA-gH/gL-PC vaccine will generate NAb that will be effective on Langerhans-type dendritic cells. A recent study has reported on non-infectious particles generated from HCMV strain Towne that likely express a subset of entry glycoprotein complexes such as gB, gH/gL, gM/gN but unlikely intact gH/gL-PC due to a defective UL128-UL131A locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Cayatte1">[86]</xref>. As expected due to the missing gH/gL-PC and consistent with our data, they found equivalent levels of NAb measured on fibroblast or ARPE-19 cells. Comparison with results from our study showed that while neutralization on MRC-5 fibroblasts was comparable, levels of NAb that neutralize infection of ARPE-19 cells were far lower using the DB preparation than what we measured using the MVA-gH/gL-PC construct by two orders of magnitude, further confirming that the UL128-UL131A proteins are required in combination with gH/gL to induce high titer EC specific NAb. These results suggest a qualitative difference of DB and MVA-gH/gL-PC in eliciting NAb that prevent HCMV infection of EC.</p>
<p>The implications of our work on the gH/gL-PC can be appreciated as a comparable model to the main HIV envelope glycoprotein complex. HIV research has shown that vaccine constructs which resemble the antigenic structure of the native trimeric gp120/gp41 (gp140) envelope spike induce more potent NAb than those using only gp120 monomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Kovacs1">[87]</xref>. Our results complement these findings by showing in mice and RM that a vaccine approach based on all five gH/gL-PC proteins is overwhelmingly more effective for high titer NAb induction than using only protein subsets of the complex. Our findings together with a recent report from Novartis that demonstrates similar vaccine properties of the gH/gL-PC using an alphavirus approach will influence virus vaccine design to optimize the generation of potent NAb responses by co-expressing multimeric subunits in the same vector construct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Corti1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Wen1">[88]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Burton1">[89]</xref>.</p>
<p>The strict human host specificity of HCMV precludes evaluation of protective efficacy by MVA-gH/gL-PC in any currently used animal model such as RM. In addition, although the genomes of HCMV and RhCMV are largely co-linear, the two viruses likely do not share cross-reactive immune responses, excluding RhCMV as a challenge virus to analyze protection by HCMV specific immunity in RM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Yue1">[90]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Barry1">[91]</xref>. We confirmed that sera of DNA-typed RhCMV-positive RM contain no cross-reactive NAb that prevent HCMV infection of EC and fibroblasts, although these same sera neutralize RhCMV infection of primary rhesus kidney epithelial cells (data not shown). Consequently, protective efficacy by MVA-gH/gL-PC or any other vaccine against HCMV can only be evaluated in humans. Our prior work using MVA as a vaccine vector in which RhCMV-negative RM were partially protected from acquiring a virulent RhCMV demonstrates the suitability of this vector system as a candidate prophylactic vaccine in a relevant herpesvirus model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Abel1">[92]</xref>. In that study and our more recent study involving the rhesus gH/gL-PC only two administrations of vaccine were required to attain partial protection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Wussow1">[46]</xref>. MVA as a vaccine vector is well established and is in the clinic (NCT01941056) as a therapeutic vaccine to control HCMV viremia in stem cell transplant recipients and to prevent HIV infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Walsh1">[93]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Wilck1">[94]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our approach of measuring NAb in a primate species after MVA vaccination comes closest to actual human vaccination without requiring FDA approval. These studies lay the groundwork for a step-wise clinical evaluation of the MVA-gH/gL-PC, either as a single agent or combined with other prominent NAb or cellular immune targets in HCMV-negative healthy adults, pregnant women, and adolescents, especially those exposed to HCMV in a daycare setting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Pass4">[95]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Adler2">[96]</xref>. While it is unknown if any HCMV vaccine will prevent reinfection by a second strain of the virus, our approach has been developed to prevent primary infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Boppana2">[97]</xref>. It will require clinical investigation to assess if a gH/gL-PC containing vaccine is a successful therapeutic option, either alone or combined with other vaccine antigens.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have generated an MVA vaccine vector expressing five gH/gL-PC subunits that elicited high titer EC and fibroblast specific NAb in mice and RM. This study will influence HCMV vaccine design for the following reasons. 1) It outlines a strategy to effectively prevent the infection of EC and fibroblasts, primary portals for HCMV replication. 2) HCMV infection is neutralized on placental macrophages or HC, a known HCMV depot in the placenta. 3) It introduces a vector system to assemble all five gH/gL-PC subunits, a requirement for the formation of conformational neutralizing epitopes for <italic>in vivo</italic> applications. 4) It is the first vaccine strategy that targets neutralizing epitopes formed by the full complement of HCMV gH/gL-PC subunits expressed from a translational vaccine vector platform with an extensive clinical safety record. 5) The strategy is equally effective to elicit high titer NAb in mice and RM. 6) NAb in mice and RM induced by MVA-gH/gL-PC exceed those of HCMV positive serum and IVIg preparations. 7) The vaccine strategy induced NAb preventing infection of EC with titers that exceed those induced by gH/gL or gB. The pivotal test is to vaccinate HCMV-negative adolescents with MVA-gH/gL-PC with or without additional antigens and assess efficacy in preventing infection and shedding. Equally important is preventing infection in pregnancy and viral transmission to a fetus. If successful, a gH/gL-PC vaccine may reduce the morbidity and burden of congenital HCMV as well as in immunosuppressed hosts from primary or reactivated infection.</p>

ARPE-19 and MRC-5 cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM, Corning, Corning, NY, USA) or minimal essential medium (MEM, Corning), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA). HUVECs were maintained in VascuLife Basal Medium added with VascuLife EnGS LifeFactors (all from Lifeline Cell Technology, Frederick, MD, USA). HCMV stocks were generated following virus propagation in ARPE-19 cells. Cells were monitored for cytopathic effects (CPE) and re-seeded at a dilution of 1∶2 until 70-80% of the ARPE-19 cells were infected. Cells were again re-seeded at a dilution of 1∶2 and grown for additional three to four days. Virus particles were concentrated from clarified medium by ultracentrifugation (70000×g for one hour) over 20% sucrose (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline (0.1 M Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.1 M NaCl). Concentrated virus was resuspended in Tris-buffered saline and stored at −80°C. Virus stocks were titrated on each cell type (ARPE-19, HUVEC, MRC-5, HC) by immediate-early-1 (IE1) immunostaining to use approximate the same amounts of plaque forming units (PFU) for the different cell types in the neutralization assay.</p>

<p>In order to isolate HCs, the decidua basalis was dissected from the placenta, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004524-Johnson1">[100]</xref>. The tissue was thoroughly washed in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) to minimize peripheral blood contamination and mechanically dispersed in complete medium (RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM L-glutamine, and 1% pen/strep). The minced tissue was re-suspended in complete medium containing 10% Trypsin/EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 1 hour, followed by resuspension in media containing 1 mg/ml collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 U/ml dispase (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ, USA), and 0.2 mg/ml of DNAse I (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated in a shaking water bath at 37°C for 1 hour. The digested tissue was washed with PBS and passed through a 70 µm cell strainer (BD-Falcon Biosciences, Lexington, TN, USA). The mononuclear cell population was isolated by density gradient centrifugation on Histopaque-1077 (Sigma-Aldrich). CD14<sup>+</sup> Magnetic Cell Sorting was performed using anti-CD14 magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) as recommended by the manufacturer.

After 2 h incubation, mixtures were added in triplicate (50 µl) to cells (ARPE-19 cells, MRC-5 fibroblasts, HUVECs, or HC) seeded the day before at 1.5×10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in a clear bottom Polystyrene 96-well plate (Corning) that contained 50 µl per well of complete growth medium. Cells were grown for 48 h and fixed in methanol/acetone. Infected cells were identified by immunostaining using mouse anti-HCMV IE1 Ab (p63-27) and the Vectastain ABC kit (VectorLabs, Burlingame, CA, USA). The substrate was 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB, VectorLabs). Plates were analyzed by an automated system using the Axio Observer Z1 inverted microscope equipped with a linear motorized stage (Carl Zeiss). IE1 positive nuclei were counted using ImagePro Premier (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA). For each dilution the average number of positive nuclei in triplicate was calculated. The percent neutralization titer (NT) for each dilution was calculated as follows: NT = [1−(positive nuclei number with immune sera)/(positive nuclei number with pre-immune sera)]×100. The titers that gave 50% neutralization (NT50) or 90% neutralization (NT90) were calculated by determining the linear slope of the graph plotting NT versus plasma dilution by using the next higher and lower NT values that were closest to 50% or 90% neutralization respectively.</p>

<title>Human sera and IgG</title>
<p>HCMV IgG positive and negative sera were derived from a pool of seven plasma bags that were donated by volunteers and tested for HCMV IgG by the City of Hope Blood Bank. Commercially available HCMV seropositive (Lots BM204234, BM204360 and BM204371) and negative (Lot BM216642) sera were purchased from SeraCare Life Sciences (Oceanside, CA, USA). Intravenous human immunoglobulin (IVIg) was purchased from Privigen, CSL Behring (Marburg, Germany). Cytogam (CMV-IVIg) was obtained from the manufacturer (Baxter-Healthcare Corp., Irvine, CA, USA).</p>

<title>HCMV-TB40/E antigen</title>
<p>HCMV antigen for ELISA assays was prepared as follows. Approximately 2.5×10<sup>7</sup> ARPE-19 cells showing 80–90% CPE after HCMV TB40/E infection were harvested in 5 ml of glycine-saline buffer (0.04 M Glycine, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M NaOH, pH 9). Cell suspensions were incubated on ice for 4 h. Cells were dounce-homogenized and cell lysates were clarified at 1500×g at 4°C. Supernatants were aliquoted and stored at −80°C until use.</p>

<title>HCMV IgG ELISA</title>
<p>Microtiter wells (EIA/RIA Plates, Costar, Corning) were coated overnight with 100 µl HCMV TB40/E antigen prepared as described above. Wells were washed three times with PBS and blocked for 2 h with PBS containing 1% BSA. Wells were washed again in PBS containing 0.1% Tween20 (wash-buffer) and serum samples diluted 1/100 in sample buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% BSA) were added in quadruplicate and incubated for 2 h. Two wells of each quadruplicate were washed either in wash-buffer or wash buffer containing 6 M urea; then, all wells were washed again two times in wash-buffer. Wells were incubated with secondary anti-mouse HRP conjugate (Promega) or anti-monkey HRP conjugate (KPL) and then developed with TMB substrate reagent. OD values at 450 were measured and normalized based on week zero OD. Avidity index (AI) values were expressed as percentage of the ratio of OD in wells washed with wash buffer containing 6 M urea/OD in wells washed with wash buffer.</p>

<title>Oral swab total and HCMV-specific IgG</title>
<p>Evaluation of total IgG titer in oral swab samples was performed using an ELISA kit for human/monkey IgG (Mabtech, Stockholm, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oral swab samples were diluted 1/240 in sample buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% BSA). Standard or sample dilutions were added in duplicate. Total IgG concentration was derived from the standard curve. HCMV-specific IgG assay was performed as above using CMV-TB40/E antigen coated plates. Oral swab samples were diluted 1/24 in sample buffer and added in duplicate. CMV-IgG levels were expressed as OD at 405 nm.</p>

<p><bold>Cell surface imaging of gH expressed from MVA recombinants.</bold> Monolayers of BHK cells were infected at a low multiplicity of infection with the indicated MVA recombinants (MVA-gH/gL-PC, MVA-gH/gL-PCΔ, and MVA-gH/gL). Cells were fixed 16 h after the infection and either left untreated (non-permeabilized) or permeabilized. Staining was performed with mouse anti-HCMV gH mAb 14-4b and anti-mouse Alexa Flour 555 secondary Ab. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. Immunofluorescence was imaged by confocal microscopy. GFP expression from the MVA vectors (all BAC-reconstituted MVA expressed GFP due to the vector construction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004524-g001">Figure 1</xref>) was detected to localize foci of virus spread. Staining of Histone H3 using anti-Histone H3 rabbit mAb and secondary Alexa Flour 647 Ab was performed as a control to determine if non-permeabilized cells were non-penetrable by antibodies and permeabilized cells were penetrable by antibodies.</p>
