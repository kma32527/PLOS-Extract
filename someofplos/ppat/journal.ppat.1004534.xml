<abstract>
<p>Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and ApoE have been shown to participate in the particle formation and the tissue tropism of hepatitis C virus (HCV), but their precise roles remain uncertain. Here we show that amphipathic α-helices in the apolipoproteins participate in the HCV particle formation by using zinc finger nucleases-mediated apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and/or ApoE gene knockout Huh7 cells. Although Huh7 cells deficient in either ApoB or ApoE gene exhibited slight reduction of particles formation, knockout of both ApoB and ApoE genes in Huh7 (DKO) cells severely impaired the formation of infectious HCV particles, suggesting that ApoB and ApoE have redundant roles in the formation of infectious HCV particles. cDNA microarray analyses revealed that ApoB and ApoE are dominantly expressed in Huh7 cells, in contrast to the high level expression of all of the exchangeable apolipoproteins, including ApoA1, ApoA2, ApoC1, ApoC2 and ApoC3 in human liver tissues. The exogenous expression of not only ApoE, but also other exchangeable apolipoproteins rescued the infectious particle formation of HCV in DKO cells. In addition, expression of these apolipoproteins facilitated the formation of infectious particles of genotype 1b and 3a chimeric viruses. Furthermore, expression of amphipathic α-helices in the exchangeable apolipoproteins facilitated the particle formation in DKO cells through an interaction with viral particles. These results suggest that amphipathic α-helices in the exchangeable apolipoproteins play crucial roles in the infectious particle formation of HCV and provide clues to the understanding of life cycle of HCV and the development of novel anti-HCV therapeutics targeting for viral assembly.</p>

<p><italic>In vitro</italic> systems have been developed for the study of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and have revealed many details of the life cycle of HCV. Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and ApoE have been shown to play crucial roles in the particle formation of HCV, based on data obtained by siRNA-mediated gene knockdown and overexpression of the proteins. However, precise roles of the apolipoproteins in HCV assembly have not been elucidated yet. In this study, we show that infectious particle formation of HCV in Huh7 cells was severely impaired by the knockout of both ApoB and ApoE genes by artificial nucleases, and this reduction was cancelled by the expression of not only ApoE, but also other exchangeable apolipoproteins, including ApoA1, ApoA2, ApoC1, ApoC2 and ApoC3. In addition, expression of amphipathic α-helices in the exchangeable apolipoproteins restored the infectious particle formation in the double-knockout cells through an interaction with viral particles. These results provide clues to the understanding of life cycle of HCV and the development of novel antivirals to HCV.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>More than 160 million individuals worldwide are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma induced by HCV infection are life-threatening diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Maasoumy1">[1]</xref>. Current standard therapy combining peg-interferon (IFN), ribavirin (RBV) and a protease inhibitor has achieved a sustained virological response (SVR) in over 80% of individuals infected with HCV genotype 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Jacobson1">[2]</xref>. In addition, many antiviral agents targeting non-structural proteins and host factors involved in HCV replication have been applied in clinical trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Sulkowski1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Janssen1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> systems have been developed for the study of HCV infection and have revealed many details of the life cycle of HCV. By using pseudotype particles bearing HCV envelope proteins and RNA replicon systems, many host factors required for entry and RNA replication have been identified, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Bartosch1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Lohmann1">[6]</xref>. In addition, development of a robust <italic>in vitro</italic> propagation system of HCV based on the genotype 2a JFH1 strain (HCVcc) has gradually clarified the mechanism of assembly of HCV particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Wakita1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Lindenbach1">[8]</xref>. It has been shown that the interaction of NS2 protein with structural and non-structural proteins facilitates assembly of the viral capsid and formation of infectious particles at the connection site between the ER membrane and the surface of lipid droplets (LD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Jirasko1">[9]</xref>. On the other hand, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) associated proteins, including apolipoprotein B (ApoB), ApoE, and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP), have been shown to play crucial roles in the formation of infectious HCV particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Gastaminza1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Andre1">[12]</xref>. Generally, ApoA, ApoB, ApoC and ApoE bind the surface of lipoprotein through the interaction between amphipathic α-helices and ER-derived membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Saito1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Narayanaswami1">[14]</xref>. This binding of apolipoproteins enhances the stability and hydrophilicity of lipoprotein. However, the specific roles played by the apolipoproteins in HCV particle formation are controversial. Gastaminza et al. demonstrated that ApoB and MTTP are cellular factors essential for an efficient assembly of infectious HCV particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Gastaminza1">[10]</xref>. However, studies by other groups demonstrated that ApoE is a major determinant of the infectivity and particle formation of HCV, and the ApoE fraction is highly enriched with infectious particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Jiang1">[11]</xref>. In addition, Mancone et al. showed that ApoA1 is required for production of infectious particles of HCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Mancone1">[15]</xref>. However, the evidence of the involvement of apolipoproteins in HCV particle formation is dependent on knockdown data and exogenous expression of the apolipoproteins, and thus the precise mechanisms of participation of the apolipoproteins in HCV assembly have not been elucidated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Gastaminza1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Jiang1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-DaCosta1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recently, several novel genome editing techniques have been developed, including methods using zinc finger nucleases (ZFN), transcription activator like-effector nucleases (TALEN) and CRISPR/Cas9 systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Porteus1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Mali1">[19]</xref>. DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by these artificial nucleases can be repaired by error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), resulting in mutant mice or cell lines carrying deletions, insertions, or substitutions at the cut site. To clarify the detailed function of gene family with redundant functions, the generation of animals or cell lines carrying multiple mutated genes may be essential.</p>
<p>In this study, Huh7 cell lines deficient in both ApoB and ApoE genes were established by using ZFNs and revealed that ApoB and ApoE redundantly participate in the formation of infectious HCV particles. Interestingly, the expression of other exchangeable apolipoproteins, i.e., ApoA1, ApoA2, ApoC1, ApoC2 and ApoC3, facilitated HCV assembly in ApoB and ApoE double-knockout cells. In addition, the expression of amphipathic α-helices in the exchangeable apolipoproteins restored the production of infectious particles in the double-knockout cells through an interaction with viral particles.</p>

<title>Several apolipoproteins participate in the production of infectious viral particles</title>
<p>First, we compared expression levels of apolipoproteins between hepatocyte and hepatic cancer cell lines including Huh7 and HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g001">Fig. 1A and B</xref>). The web-based search engine NextBio (NextBio, Santa Clara, CA) revealed that ApoB, ApoH and the exchangeable apolipoproteins ApoA1, ApoA2, ApoC1, ApoC2, ApoC3, and ApoE are highly expressed in human liver tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). On the other hand, the expressions of ApoA1, ApoC1, ApoC2, ApoC3 and ApoH in hepatic cancer cell lines were suppressed compared to those in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). To examine the roles of apolipoproteins in the formation of infectious HCV particles, the effects of knockdown of ApoA2, ApoB and ApoE on the infectious particle production in the supernatants were determined in Huh7 cells by focus forming assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). The transfection of siRNAs targeting to ApoA2, ApoB and ApoE significantly suppressed the production of infectious HCV particles. This inhibitory effect is well consistent with the high level of expression of these apolipoproteins in the hepatic cancer cell lines, suggesting that the apolipoproteins involved in HCV assembly are dependent on the expression pattern in hepatic cancer cell lines, including Huh7 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Kupershmidt1">[20]</xref>. Therefore, we examined the effects of exogenous expression of the apolipoproteins highly expressed in the liver tissues on the infection of HCV in the stable ApoE-knockdown Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). In contrast to the control-knockdown cells, expression of not only ApoE but also ApoA1, ApoA2, and ApoC1 rescued the infectious particle formation in the ApoE-knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>), suggesting that various exchangeable apolipoproteins participate in the efficient production of infectious HCV particles.</p>

<p>(A) Relative mRNA expression of the apolipoproteins in the liver tissues (left columns) was determined using the NextBio Body Atlas application. The median expression (right columns) was calculated across all 128 human tissues from 1,068 arrays using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. mRNA expression for each gene was log10 transformed. (B) Log10 transformed, normalized signal intensity of the apolipoproteins in Huh7 (left columns) and HepG2 (right columns) cells were extracted from previously published expression microarray dataset GSE32886. (C) Huh7 cells infected with HCVcc at an MOI of 1 at 6 h post-transfection with siRNAs targeting ApoA2 (A2), ApoB (B), ApoE (E) and control (Cont), and expression levels of apolipoproteins (upper panel) and infectious titers in the culture supernatants (lower panel) were determined by immunoblotting and a focus-forming assay at 72 h post-infection, respectively. (D) ApoA1, ApoA2, ApoC1, ApoE and ApoH were exogenously expressed in control and ApoE-knockdown Huh7 cells by lentiviral vectors. Expressions of the apolipoproteins were determined by immunoblotting analysis. (E) Infectious titers in the culture supernatants of control and ApoE-knockdown Huh7 cells expressing the apolipoproteins were determined by focus-forming assay at 72 h post-infection. In all cases, asterisks indicate significant differences (*, P&lt;0.05; **, P&lt;0.01) versus the results for control cells.</p>

<title>ApoB and ApoE have a redundant role in HCV particle formation</title>
<p>To obtain more convincing data on the involvement of apolipoproteins in the production of infectious HCV particles, we established knockout (KO) Huh7 cells deficient in either ApoB (B-KO1 and B-KO2) or ApoE (E-KO1 and E-KO2) by using ZFN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Deficiencies of ApoB or ApoE expression in these cell lines were confirmed by ELISA and immunoblotting analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s001">Figure S1</xref>). First, we examined the roles of ApoB and ApoE on the entry and RNA replication of HCV by using HCV pseudotype particles (HCVpp) and subgenomic replicon (SGR) of the JFH1 strain, respectively. The B-KO and E-KO cell lines exhibited no significant effect on the infectivity of HCVpp and the colony formation of SGR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s002">Figure S2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s002">Figure S2B</xref>), suggesting that ApoB and ApoE are not involved in the entry and replication processes of HCV. To examine the role of ApoB and ApoE in the propagation of HCV, HCVcc was inoculated into parental, B-KO and E-KO cell lines at an MOI of 1, and intracellular viral RNA and infectious titers in the supernatants were determined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s002">Figure S2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). Although RNA replication and infectious particle formation in B-KO cells upon infection with HCV were comparable with those in parental Huh7 cells, E-KO cells exhibited slight reduction of particle formation, and the expression of ApoE in E-KO cells rescued infectious particle formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s002">Figure S2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s002">Figure S2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s002">Figure S2E</xref>). Next, to examine the redundant role of ApoB, the effect of knockdown of ApoB on HCV assembly was determined in parental and E-KO Huh7 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Knockdown of ApoB in E-KO cells resulted in a more efficient reduction of infectious particle production than that in parental Huh7 cells, suggesting that ApoB and ApoE have a redundant role in the formation of infectious HCV particles.</p>

<p>(A) Huh7 and E-KO1 cells were infected with HCVcc at an MOI of 1 at 6 h post-transfection with siRNAs targeting ApoB or ApoE, and infectious titers in the culture supernatants were determined by focus-forming assay at 72 h post-infection. (B) HCVpp were inoculated into Huh7, BE-KO1 and BE-KO2 cells, and luciferase activities were determined at 48 h post-infection. (C) A subgenomic HCV RNA replicon of the JFH1 strain was electroporated into BE-KO1 and BE-KO2 cells with/without expression of ApoE by lentiviral vector (ApoE-res), and the colonies were stained with crystal violet at 31 days post-electroporation after selection with 400 µg/ml of G418. Huh7, BE-KO1 and BE-KO2 cells were infected with HCVcc at an MOI of 1, and intracellular HCV RNA (D) and infectious titers in the supernatants (E) were determined at 72 h post-infection by qRT-PCR and focus-forming assay, respectively.

<p>To further confirm the redundant role of ApoB and ApoE in the HCV life cycle, especially in the particle formation, 2 clones of ApoB and ApoE double-knockout (BE-KO1 and BE-KO2) Huh7 cells were established by ZFNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s003">Figure S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). The lack of ApoB and ApoE expressions was confirmed by immunoblotting and ELISA analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s003">Figure S3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s003">Figure S3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s003">Figure S3E</xref>). The BE-KO cell lines also exhibited no significant effect on the infectivity of HCVpp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) and the colony formation of SGR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). Next, we examined the redundant role of ApoB and ApoE on the propagation of HCVcc. Upon infection with HCVcc at an MOI of 1, infectious titers in the supernatants of BE-KO1 and BE-KO2 cells were 50 to 100 times lower than those of parental Huh7 cells at 72 h post-infection, while the level of intracellular RNA replication was comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g002">Fig. 2D and E</xref>). In addition, exogenous expression of ApoE in BE-KO (ApoE-res) cells rescued the production of infectious viral particles to levels comparable to those in parental Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g002">Fig. 2F and G</xref>), suggesting that ApoB and ApoE redundantly participate in the particle formation of HCV.</p>

To further clarify the roles of ApoB in the life cycle of HCV, we established knockout Huh7 cell lines deficient in MTTP (M-KO1 and M-KO2) and in both ApoE and MTTP (EM-KO1 and EM-KO2) by using the ZFN and CRISPR/Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s004">Figure S4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s004">Figure S4E</xref>). The lack of MTTP, ApoB and ApoE expressions was confirmed by immunoblotting and ELISA analyses (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s004">Figure S4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s004">Figure S4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s004">Figure S4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s004">Figure S4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s004">Figure S4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s004">Figure S4H</xref>). As previously reported, the secretion of ApoB was completely abrogated in M-KO and EM-KO cells, while the mRNA levels of ApoB were comparable among Huh7, M-KO and EM-KO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s004">Figure S4I</xref>). To examine the roles of MTTP in the assembly of HCV through the secretion of ApoB, HCVcc was inoculated into the Huh7, B-KO, M-KO, E-KO, BE-KO and EM-KO cell lines at an MOI of 1, and intracellular HCV genomes and infectious titers in the supernatants were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g003">Fig. 3A–C</xref>). Although intracellular RNA replication in M-KO and EM-KO cells was comparable with that in Huh7, B-KO, E-KO and BE-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), infectious titers in the supernatants of EM-KO cells were severely impaired as seen in BE-KO cells, while those of M-KO cells were comparable to those of parental Huh7cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), suggesting that MTTP participates in the HCV assembly through the regulation of ApoB secretion. To further confirm the roles of MTTP in HCV assembly through ApoB secretion, the effects of exogenous expression of MTTP in EM-KO cells on the infectious particle formation of HCV were determined. Immunoblotting and ELISA analyses revealed that exogenous expression of MTTP rescued the secretion of ApoB into the supernatants of EM-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g003">Fig. 3D and E</xref>), while expression of ApoE or MTTP in both BE-KO and EM-KO cells exhibited no effect on the intracellular RNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g003">Fig. 3F</xref>). Although exogenous expression of ApoE rescued the infectious particle formation of HCV in both BE-KO and EM-KO cells, expression of MTTP rescued the particle formation in EM-KO cells but not in BE-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g003">Fig. 3G</xref>), supporting the notion that MTTP plays a crucial role in the HCV assembly through the maturation of ApoB.</p>

<title>Exchangeable apolipoproteins redundantly participate in the assembly of infectious HCV particles</title>
<p>Next, to examine the roles played in HCV particles formation by other apolipoproteins highly expressed in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>), the expressions of ApoA1, ApoA2, ApoC1, ApoC2, ApoC3 and ApoH in BE-KO1 cells were suppressed by siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s005">Figure S5</xref>). While knockdown of ApoA1, ApoC3 and ApoH exhibited no effect, that of ApoA2, ApoC1 and ApoC2 significantly inhibited the release of infectious particles, which was consistent with the expression pattern of endogenous apolipoproteins except for ApoH in Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>), suggesting that not only ApoB and ApoE but also other exchangeable apolipoproteins participate in HCV particle formation. To confirm the redundant role of these apolipoproteins on the infectious particle formation, the effects of exogenous expression of these apolipoproteins on the propagation of HCVcc in BE-KO1 cells were determined. ApoA1, ApoA2, ApoC1, ApoC2, ApoC3, ApoE and ApoH were expressed by lentiviral vector in BE-KO1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g004">Fig. 4B</xref> upper panel). The expressions of ApoA1, ApoA2, ApoC1, ApoC2, ApoC3 and ApoE but not of ApoH enhanced extracellular HCV RNA, while they exhibited no effect on intracellular HCV RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). In addition, the expressions of these exchangeable apolipoproteins enhanced the infectious particle formation in the supernatants of BE-KO1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g004">Fig. 4B</xref> lower panel). On the other hand, the expression of nonhepatic apolipoproteins, including ApoD, ApoL1, and ApoO, exhibited no effect on HCV particle formation in BE-KO1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s006">Figure S6</xref>). These results suggest that exogenous expression of not only the ApoE but also the ApoA and ApoC families can compensate for the impairment of HCV particle formation in BE-KO1 cells. Interestingly, specific infectivity (infectious titers/viral RNA levels in supernatants) was also enhanced by the expression of ApoA1, ApoA2, ApoC1, ApoC2, ApoC3 and ApoE, suggesting that these apolipoproteins participate in the infectious but not non-infectious particle formation of HCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Previous reports have suggested that the expressions of Claudin1 (CLDN1), miR-122 and ApoE facilitate the production of infectious particles in nonhepatic 293T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-DaCosta1">[16]</xref>. Therefore, the effects of exogenous expression of exchangeable apolipoproteins on particle formation were examined in 293T cells expressing CLDN1 and miR-122 (293T-CLDN/miR-122 cells). Exogenous expression of ApoA1, ApoA2, ApoC1, ApoC2, ApoC3 and ApoE, but not of ApoH by lentiviral vector facilitated the production of infectious HCV particles in 293T-CLDN/miR-122 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). On the other hand, the expression of ApoE exhibited no effect on the propagation of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and dengue virus (DENV) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s007">Figure S7</xref>) in BE-KO1 cells. These results suggest that the exchangeable apolipoproteins and ApoB redundantly and specifically participate in the formation of HCV particles.</p>

<title>Apolipoproteins participate in the post-envelopment step of particle formation</title>
<p>To determine the details of the assembly of infectious HCV particles in the BE-KO1 cells, intracellular infectious titers were determined in Huh7, BE-KO1 and ApoE-res cells by using the freeze and thaw method. Not only intracellular but also extracellular infection titers were impaired in BE-KO1 cells compared with those in parental and ApoE-res cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>), suggesting that intracellular particle formation is impaired by deficiencies in the expression of ApoB and ApoE. Previous reports have shown that the recruitment of viral proteins around LD and redistribution of LD are essential for HCV assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Miyanari1">[24]</xref>. To clarify the roles of the exchangeable apolipoproteins on HCV assembly in more detail, we examined the intracellular localization of viral proteins, LD and ER in BE-KO1 and ApoE-res cells. The localization of core proteins around LD and the membranous-web structure forming the replication complex were observed in BE-KO1 cells upon infection with HCVcc, as reported in parental Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g006">Fig. 6B, 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004534.s008">Figure S8</xref>). However, greater accumulation of core proteins and LD around the perinuclear region was detected in BE-KO1 cells in comparison with ApoE-res cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g006">Fig. 6C and 6D</xref>), supporting the notion that apolipoproteins participate in the infectious particle formation in HCV rather than viral RNA replication. Previous studies revealed that core proteins were mainly localized on the ER membrane upon infection with the genotype 2a Jc1 strain-based HCVcc (HCVcc/Jc1), and inhibition of capsid assembly and envelopment caused accumulation of core proteins on the surface of LD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Boson1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Shavinskaya1">[27]</xref>. In ApoE-res cells, core proteins of HCVcc/Jc1 were mainly localized on the ER membrane, in contrast to the co-localization of core proteins of HCVcc (JFH1) with LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g006">Fig. 6E</xref> upper). However, core proteins were accumulated around LD in BE-KO1 cells infected with HCVcc/Jc1, as seen in those infected with HCVcc (JFH1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g006">Fig. 6E</xref> lower). These results suggest that apolipoproteins participate in the steps of HCV particle formation occurring after HCV protein assembly on the LD.</p>

Although peak levels of the core proteins and infectious titers were detected around 1.08 g/ml in both cell lines, the infectious titers in all fractions of BE-KO1 cells were significantly lower than those in ApoE-res cells, supporting the notion that apolipoproteins participate in the post-assembly process of HCV capsids which is required to confer infectivity.

<title>Amphipathic α-helices in exchangeable apolipoproteins participate in the formation of infectious HCV particles through the interaction with viral particles</title>
<p>To determine the structural relevance of apolipoproteins involved in the HCV assembly, the secondary structures of the apolipoproteins were deduced by using a CLC Genomics Workbench and previous reports (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Mei1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Sevvana1">[34]</xref>. Tandem repeats of amphipathic α-helices were observed in the apolipoproteins capable of rescuing HCV assembly in BE-KO1 cells, but not in those lacking this activity, suggesting that amphipathic α-helices in the apolipoproteins participate in the assembly of HCV. To examine the involvement of the amphipathic α-helices of the exchangeable apolipoproteins in the particle formation of HCV, we constructed expression plasmids encoding deletion mutants of ApoE and ApoC1, and then these deletion mutants were exogenously expressed in BE-KO1 cells by lentiviral vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g008">Fig. 8B and C</xref> upper panels).

In addition, more abundant full-length and truncated ApoE were detected in the precipitates of the culture supernatants of cells infected with HCVcc than those of mock-infected cells concentrated by ultracentrifugation, suggesting that the amphipathic α-helices of apolipoproteins are directly associated with HCV particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g008">Fig. 8D and E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated the redundant roles of ApoB and the exchangeable apolipoproteins ApoA1, ApoA2, ApoC1, ApoC2, ApoC3 and ApoE in the assembly of infectious HCV particles. The deficiencies of both ApoB and ApoE inhibited the production of infectious HCV particles in Huh7 cells, and exogenous expression of exchangeable apolipoproteins rescued the particle formation. cDNA microarray revealed that the expression patterns of exchangeable apolipoproteins in hepatic cancer cell lines are widely different from those in liver tissue. In previous reports, ApoE and ApoB were identified as important host factors for the assembly of infectious HCV particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Gastaminza1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Jiang1">[11]</xref>, and knockdown of ApoE and ApoB expression also inhibited the production of infectious particles in this study. Because ApoB and ApoE are major apolipoproteins in VLDL, several reports have suggested that the VLDL production machinery participates in the production of HCV particles. Furthermore, density gradient analyses revealed co-fractionation of HCV RNA with lipoproteins, with the resulting complexes being termed lipoviroparticles (LVP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Andre1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Nielsen1">[35]</xref>. However, it has been reported that there is no correlation between secretion of VLDL and production of LVP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Jammart1">[36]</xref>. In addition, exogenous expression of ApoE facilitated the infectious particle formation of HCV in 293T cells stably expressing CLDN1 and miR-122 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-DaCosta1">[16]</xref>, suggesting that ApoE-mediated particle formation is independent from VLDL production. Furthermore, exogenous expression of ApoA1, a major apolipoprotein of HDL, also facilitated the production of HCV particles as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004534-g004">Fig. 4E</xref>. These data suggest that the roles of the exchangeable apolipoproteins in HCV assembly are independent from the production of VLDL. MTTP plays crucial roles in the lipoprotein formation through the incorporation of triglyceride into growing lipoprotein and secretion of ApoB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Hussain1">[21]</xref>. Although it has been shown that treatment with an MTTP inhibitor impairs the production of HCV particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Jiang1">[11]</xref>, in this study, we found that knockout of MTTP abrogated the secretion of ApoB but not the production of infectious HCV particles. Collectively, these data suggest that exchangeable apolipoproteins redundantly participate in the infectious particle formation of HCV independently from lipoprotein secretion machinery.</p>
<p>Production of HCV capsids in the culture supernatants is impaired in 293T cells expressing miR-122 due to lack of ApoE expression, but envelopment of viral capsids is observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Hueging1">[37]</xref>, suggesting that ApoE is involved in the post-envelopment step. Coller et al. suggested that ApoE is associated with <italic>de novo</italic> formation of HCV particles during secretory pathway based on an experiment using HCV possessing a tetracysteine-tag in the core protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Coller1">[38]</xref>. In this study, ApoA1, ApoA2, ApoC1, ApoC2, ApoC3 and ApoE enhanced the formation of HCV particles in the post-envelopment step. These results suggest that a direct interaction between exchangeable apolipoproteins and enveloped particles in the ER lumen facilitates an efficient secretion of infectious HCV particles. Ultrastructural analysis of HCV particles has shown that large amounts of apolipoproteins, including ApoA1, ApoB and ApoE, bind to the surface of viral particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Catanese1">[39]</xref>. Interestingly, ApoE-specific antibodies were more efficient in capturing viral particles than α-E1/E2 antibodies, and significantly large numbers of gold particles reacting with ApoE were observed per virion than those with E2, suggesting that viral envelope proteins are masked by a large amount of apolipoproteins. The unique characteristics of interaction between apolipoproteins and HCV particles might be applied for visualization of entry and purification of HCV particles by using GFP- or affinity-tagged amphipathic α-helices of apolipoproteins. In the previous report, virocidal amphipathic helical peptides impaired the infectivity of viral particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Cheng1">[40]</xref>. There is a possibility that such peptide influences on the interaction between apolipoproteins and viral particles, and might be a new therapeutic approach.</p>
<p>In previous reports, the importance of the interaction between lipoprotein receptors and ApoE in the entry of HCV has been well established. Lipoprotein receptors including scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) are involved in HCV entry into the target cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Scarselli1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Molina1">[42]</xref>. LDLR is thought to mediate cell attachment of HCV through an interaction with virus associated ApoE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Owen1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Prentoe1">[44]</xref>. SR-B1 also interacts with ApoE and hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) in the envelope protein of HCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Owen1">[43]</xref>. In this study we have shown that exchangeable apolipoproteins including not only ApoE but also ApoA and ApoC facilitate the production of infectious HCV particles, and that exchangeable apolipoproteins directly associate with viral particles. Meunier et al. reported that ApoC1 associates intracellularly with viral particles during particle morphogenesis and enhances the entry of HCV through an interaction of the C-terminal region of ApoC1 with heparan sulfate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Meunier1">[45]</xref>. Another group also showed that ApoC1 enhances HCV infection through the triple interplay among HVR1, ApoC1, and SR-B1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Dreux1">[46]</xref>. These results suggest that the interaction of HCV particles with apolipoproteins also participates in the entry through the binding of lipoprotein receptors including SR-B1 and LDLR.</p>
<p>Although the gene-knockout technique is essential to obtain reproducible and reliable data, and many knockout mice have been produced in various research areas, the development of experimental tools for HCV study has also been hampered by the narrow cell tropism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Fukuhara1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Ploss1">[48]</xref>. A humanized mouse model in which human liver cells were xenotransplanted into immunodeficient mouse was developed and provided an important platform for the analysis of pathogenesis and the development of antivirals for HCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Mercer1">[49]</xref>. However, the exogenous expression of human receptor molecules required for HCV entry and impairment of innate immunity are required for the complete propagation of HCV in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Dorner1">[50]</xref>. Gene-knockout techniques using a CRISPR/Cas9 system composed of guide RNA and Cas9 nuclease that form RNA-protein complexes to cleave the target sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Mali1">[19]</xref> have allowed quick and easy establishment of gene-knockout mice and cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Wang1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Cho1">[52]</xref>, and indeed, such MTTP-knockout cell lines were established also in this study. Recently, the high-throughput screening of host factors involved in several conditions was reported by using a CRISPR/Cas9 system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004534-Shalem1">[53]</xref>. Together, these novel genome-editing techniques are expected to reveal the precise roles of host factors involved in the HCV life cycle.</p>
<p>In summary, we have shown that apolipoproteins, including ApoA1, ApoA2, ApoC1, ApoC2, ApoC3, ApoE and ApoB, possess redundant roles in the assembly of HCV through the interaction of the amphipathic α-helices in the apolipoproteins with viral particles in the post-envelopment step. It is hoped that these findings will provide clues to the life cycle of HCV and assist in the development of novel antivirals targeting the assembly process of HCV.</p>
