<abstract>
<p>Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites of most animal groups including humans, but despite their significant economic and medical importance there are major gaps in our understanding of how they exploit infected host cells. We have investigated the evolution, cellular locations and substrate specificities of a family of nucleotide transport (NTT) proteins from <italic>Trachipleistophora hominis</italic>, a microsporidian isolated from an HIV/AIDS patient. Transport proteins are critical to microsporidian success because they compensate for the dramatic loss of metabolic pathways that is a hallmark of the group. Our data demonstrate that the use of plasma membrane-located nucleotide transport proteins (NTT) is a key strategy adopted by microsporidians to exploit host cells. Acquisition of an ancestral transporter gene at the base of the microsporidian radiation was followed by lineage-specific events of gene duplication, which in the case of <italic>T. hominis</italic> has generated four paralogous NTT transporters. All four <italic>T. hominis</italic> NTT proteins are located predominantly to the plasma membrane of replicating intracellular cells where they can mediate transport at the host-parasite interface. In contrast to published data for <italic>Encephalitozoon cuniculi</italic>, we found no evidence for the location for any of the <italic>T. hominis</italic> NTT transporters to its minimal mitochondria (mitosomes), consistent with lineage-specific differences in transporter and mitosome evolution. All of the <italic>T. hominis</italic> NTTs transported radiolabelled purine nucleotides (ATP, ADP, GTP and GDP) when expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, but did not transport radiolabelled pyrimidine nucleotides. Genome analysis suggests that imported purine nucleotides could be used by <italic>T. hominis</italic> to make all of the critical purine-based building-blocks for DNA and RNA biosynthesis during parasite intracellular replication, as well as providing essential energy for parasite cellular metabolism and protein synthesis.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Microsporidians are highly reduced obligate intracellular eukaryotic parasites that cause significant disease in humans, animals and commercially relevant insects. Despite their medical and economic interest the mechanisms whereby microsporidians exploit the cells they infect are mainly unknown. We have characterised a conserved family of nucleotide transport proteins that we demonstrate have key roles in parasite biology. Microsporidians cannot synthesize the primary building blocks needed to make DNA and RNA for themselves, so they must import the starting materials from the infected host. We show that the microsporidian <italic>Trachipleistophora hominis</italic>, originally isolated from an HIV/AIDS patient, may achieve this by using four nucleotide transport proteins located in the plasma membrane of replicating intracellular parasites. In functional assays we demonstrate that all four proteins can transport radiolabelled adenine and guanine nucleotides. Genome analysis suggests that the imported nucleotides could be transformed by <italic>T. hominis</italic> into all of the critical purine-based building-blocks needed for DNA and RNA biosynthesis during parasite intracellular replication, as well as providing essential energy for parasite cellular metabolism and protein synthesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Microsporidian parasites are highly reduced eukaryotes that have an obligate intracellular lifestyle based upon the exploitation of other eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Vavra1">[1]</xref>. The life cycle of microsporidians alternates between a dispersive spore stage that is resistant to environmental stress, and intracellular replicative stages that can only take place inside the cytoplasm of an infected host cell. Despite lineage-specific variations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Vavra1">[1]</xref>, the general infectious cycle starts with spore germination and the injection of the parasite through a specialised polar tube into the cytoplasm of a suitable host cell. The active vegetative cell (meront) then undergoes binary fission, and after several rounds of multiplication, differentiates (sporogony) into spores that can exit the host by either cell lysis or exocytosis to infect adjacent cells and tissues or a new host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Wittner1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Troemel1">[3]</xref>. Microsporidians are a large group of parasites with over 1200 described species infecting most animal groups including economically important fish, insect pollinators and silkworms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Vavra1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Wittner1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Lom1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Keeling1">[5]</xref>. Microsporidians are also increasingly recognised as a significant threat to human health, affecting not only patients with HIV/AIDS but also the young and old in the developing world <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Didier1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>A hallmark feature shared by microsporidians and bacterial obligate intracellular pathogens is a dramatic genomic reduction coupled with loss of metabolic pathways during the transition from a free-living to an obligate intracellular lifestyle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Katinka1">[7]</xref>. Genome analyses suggest that all microsporidians have lost the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation pathways for ATP production although, with a single exception <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Keeling1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Keeling2">[8]</xref>, they have retained the pathway for glycolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Wittner1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Katinka1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Dolgikh1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Heinz1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Nakjang1">[11]</xref>. Published data for <italic>Nosema grylli</italic> and <italic>Trachipleistophora hominis</italic> suggest that glycolysis may be mainly active in the spore stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Heinz1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Dolgikh2">[12]</xref> and hence actively replicating parasites living inside host cells may require an alternative source of ATP. In the case of <italic>Encephalitozoon cuniculi</italic> this energy gap is potentially filled by the expression of nucleotide transport (NTT) proteins on the parasite cell surface, where they can be used to import ATP from the host cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Katinka1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Tsaousis1">[13]</xref>. The same type of transport proteins are also used by important, phylogenetically diverse bacterial intracellular pathogens, including <italic>Rickettsia</italic> and <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, to import host-generated ATP to support their own reduced metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Tjaden1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Haferkamp1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Audia1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Trentmann1">[17]</xref>. The broad taxonomic distribution of NTT proteins suggests that intracellular pathogens are using lateral gene transfer to exchange transporter genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Tsaousis1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Richards1">[18]</xref>, providing a general strategy for exploiting host cells. Genes for NTT-like transport proteins have been identified in all microsporidian genomes and were recently identified in the genome of the fungal endoparasite <italic>Rozella allomyces</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Nakjang1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-James1">[19]</xref>. Phylogenomic analyses demonstrate that <italic>Rozella</italic> and microsporidia share a common ancestor, confirming microsporidia as fungi and suggesting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Nakjang1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-James1">[19]</xref> that the acquisition of NTT transporters was a key step for the foundation of a major clade of endoparasitic fungi.</p>
<p>In addition to the loss of mitochondrial ATP-generating pathways, the microsporidians studied so far also lack the enzymes needed for the <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of the building blocks of DNA and RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Katinka1">[7]</xref>. Loss of the early steps of purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, which are costly in terms of ATP, has occurred repeatedly among parasitic protozoa, which have devised a variety of ways of securing and interconverting purines and pyrimidines of host origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-deKoning1">[20]</xref>. Intracellular bacteria also show loss of pathways for <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of purines and pyrimidines. These bacterial pathogens use their NTT proteins to import a range of different nucleotides in addition to ATP, including GTP, UTP and CTP. In the case of <italic>Protochlamydia amoebophila</italic>, a bacterial symbiont of the protozoan <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic>, these substrates appear to provide all of the starting materials needed to make DNA and RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Tjaden1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Haferkamp1">[15]</xref>. Competition studies on the four NTT transporters of <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> indicate that ATP transport is reduced by an excess of some nucleotides, but the actual transport of substrates other than ATP and ADP was not directly investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Tsaousis1">[13]</xref>. In addition to using its NTT transporters to exploit its host, <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> also targets an NTT transporter to its highly reduced mitochondrion (mitosome) to provide ATP for an organelle that can no longer make its own <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Tsaousis1">[13]</xref>. Like the other microsporidians for which genome sequences are available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Nakjang1">[11]</xref>, <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> and <italic>T. hominis</italic> have lost all genes for members of the mitochondrial carrier family of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Katinka1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Heinz1">[10]</xref>: one member of this family is used by canonical mitochondria to transport ATP and ADP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Kunji1">[21]</xref>. The mitosomes of <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> contain mitochondrial heat shock protein Hsp70, which requires ATP for its functions in protein import <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Schmidt1">[22]</xref> and Fe/S cluster biosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Goldberg1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Molik1">[24]</xref>. Other microsporidians, including <italic>T. hominis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Williams1">[25]</xref>, also contain ATP-requiring mitochondrial Hsp70 proteins in their mitosomes, but it is not known if the organelles of these species use NTT transport proteins to import ATP.</p>
<p>In the present study we have investigated the evolution, cellular locations and substrate specificities of the nucleotide transport (NTT) proteins of <italic>T. hominis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Heinz1">[10]</xref>, a microsporidian that is distantly related to <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Vossbrinck1">[26]</xref>. Our results demonstrate that the use of surface-located NTT transport proteins is a general strategy adopted by microsporidians to exploit host cells. Acquisition of an ancestral transporter gene at the base of the microsporidian radiation was followed by lineage-specific events of gene duplication, which in the case of <italic>T. hominis</italic> has generated four paralogous NTT transporters. All four <italic>T. hominis</italic> NTT proteins are located predominantly to the plasma membrane of replicating parasites. In contrast to <italic>E. cuniculi</italic>, we found no evidence for a mitosomal location for any of the <italic>T. hominis</italic> NTT transporters, consistent with lineage-specific differences in transporter and mitosome evolution. All of the <italic>T. hominis</italic> proteins transported purine nucleotides when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, but did not transport pyrimidine nucleotides. Analysis of the enzyme repertoire predicted from the <italic>T. hominis</italic> genome suggests that imported purine nucleotides could be transformed into all of the critical purine-based building-blocks required for DNA and RNA biosynthesis as well as providing essential energy for cellular metabolism and protein synthesis by replicating intracellular parasites.</p>

<title><italic>Trachipleistophora hominis</italic> and other microsporidians cannot make nucleotides <italic>de novo</italic> but retain a suite of enzymes for their interconversions</title>
<p>Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA and RNA, and also play key roles as signalling molecules and carriers of energy and electrons. They can be made by <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis pathways in free-living Bacteria, Archaea and eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Kanehisa1">[27]</xref>. In contrast, the loss of the ability to synthesize nucleotides <italic>de novo</italic> appears to be a general feature of microsporidia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Nakjang1">[11]</xref>, including <italic>T. hominis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004547-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004547.s003">Table S1</xref>), that is shared with obligate intracellular bacteria such as <italic>Chlamydiae</italic> and <italic>Rickettsiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Haferkamp1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Haferkamp2">[28]</xref>. Comparing the manually-curated enzyme complements of <italic>T. hominis</italic>, <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> and <italic>Nosema ceranae</italic> with representative intracellular bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004547-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004547.s003">Table S1</xref>) identified a similar core of enzymes for the transformation of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides between different phosphorylation and oxidation states to meet different metabolic requirements. There are minor differences between microsporidians in the enzymes detected by genome analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004547-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004547.s003">Table S1</xref>), which may reflect differences in the range of substrates that can be used by individual microsporidians. For example, <italic>T. hominis</italic> is predicted to possess a dCMP deaminase (EC 3.5.4.12) potentially capable of converting dCMP into dUMP, that appears to be missing from the genomes of <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> and <italic>N. ceranae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004547-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004547.s003">Table S1</xref>). <italic>T. hominis</italic> also has a gene for uridine kinase (EC 2.7.1.48) which can potentially convert uridine plus ATP into UMP and ADP, that is missing from <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> and <italic>N. ceranae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004547-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004547.s003">Table S1</xref>). We did not detect any <italic>T. hominis</italic>, <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> or <italic>N. ceranae</italic> enzymes or pathways that could potentially convert between adenine and guanine nucleotides, or between purine and pyrimidine (cytosine, uracil and thymidine) nucleotides. This suggests that <italic>T. hominis</italic> and other microsporidians need to import both types of purine nucleotides and at least one type of pyrimidine nucleotide, or substrates that can be used to make them, to complete DNA and RNA biosynthesis during intracellular replication.</p>

Four charged residues (K155, E245, E385 and K527 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Trentmann3">[31]</xref>) are strongly conserved among bacteria, in <italic>Rozella allomyces</italic>, in most published microsporidian sequences including all four <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> NTT sequences, and in <italic>T. hominis</italic> ThNTT2 (uniprot L7JXU1) and ThNTT4 (uniprot L7JS26) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004547.s001">Figure S1</xref>). All four residues were previously shown to be important for the transport mechanism of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plastid ADP/ATP transporter AATP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Trentmann3">[31]</xref> and mutation of K527 also reduced P<sub>i</sub> transport by the <italic>Protochlamydia amoebophila</italic> ADP/ATP transporter NTT1 (residue K446 in the <italic>P. amoebophila</italic> sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Trentmann2">[30]</xref>). The predicted amino acid sequences of ThNTT1 (uniprot L7JRV4; I155, N245, Y385) and ThNTT3 (uniprot L7JTX7; I155, V245 and Y385) have non-conservative changes at three of the four alignment positions, but there are conserved amino acids of the correct identity within 3 or 4 residues in both sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004547.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

<p>To investigate the evolution of the <italic>T. hominis</italic> proteins relative to those from other microsporidians, <italic>R. allomyces</italic>, and bacterial outgroups, we carried out a detailed phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004547-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The common endoparasitic ancestor of <italic>R. allomyces</italic> and microsporidia is most parsimoniously inferred to have had a single NTT gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-James1">[19]</xref>. Based upon the absence of any deep symmetrical split in the tree of microsporidian NTTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004547-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), it appears likely that the common ancestor of microsporidians also possessed a single NTT gene. The variable number of NTT genes detected in the contemporary microsporidian genomes investigated appears to be the product of repeated events of lineage-specific gene duplication. Hence the common ancestor of <italic>T. hominis</italic> and <italic>Vavraia culicis</italic> probably had four paralogous NTT genes; by contrast, their close relative <italic>Spraguea lophii</italic> has six NTT genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Campbell1">[32]</xref>. The common ancestor of the three <italic>Nematocida</italic> isolates had only two genes for NTT transport proteins. The common ancestor of <italic>Encephalitozoon</italic> and <italic>Nosema</italic> species probably had four NTT genes, one of which was subsequently lost by <italic>Nosema</italic> spp.</p>

<p>According to classical theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Ohno1">[33]</xref> gene duplication can have a number of potential advantages. For example, an increased gene dosage effect could increase the amount of NTT protein produced, or relaxed selection on individual gene copies might allow functional divergence of NTT proteins in terms of their substrate specificities, expression patterns or cellular location. It is interesting to note that <italic>T. hominis</italic> ThNTT4 is more conserved than the other <italic>T. hominis</italic> paralogues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004547-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004547.s001">Figure S1</xref>), and groups closely with related NTT sequences from <italic>V. culicis</italic> and <italic>S. lophii</italic>; one possibility is that ThNTT4 carries out the ancestral NTT function for the clade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Kellis1">[34]</xref>. This protein was also the only ThNTT homologue detected in a recent investigation of the spore proteome of <italic>T. hominis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Heinz1">[10]</xref>. Two of the other <italic>T. hominis</italic> NTT genes (ThNTT1 and ThNTT3) and their respective <italic>V. culicis</italic> orthologues are more divergent and have lost or shifted the position of broadly-conserved residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004547.s001">Figure S1</xref>) previously implicated in transport function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Trentmann3">[31]</xref>, suggesting relaxed selection and possibly functional divergence within the <italic>T. hominis</italic>/<italic>V. culicis</italic> clade. Bacterial NTT proteins have been studied in greater detail than those of microsporidians and there is evidence that gene duplication events have allowed functional divergence in the transport mechanism and substrate specificities of individual proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Tjaden1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Haferkamp1">[15]</xref>. The published functional data for the four <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> NTT proteins demonstrates that they can all transport ATP when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and, although other substrates have not been directly evaluated for transport, competition experiments with different nucleotides yielded broadly similar inhibition profiles for all four <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> NTT proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Tsaousis1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>The most compelling evidence for functional specialisation affecting <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> NTT proteins comes from their different cellular locations. Three of the <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> NTT proteins are located on the surface of the parasite but the fourth (<italic>E. cuniculi</italic> EcNTT3) is targeted to its mitosomes. Orthologues of <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> EcNTT3 were also found in <italic>E. romaleae</italic>, <italic>E. hellem</italic> and <italic>E. intestinalis</italic>, but were not detected in <italic>Nosema</italic> species or other microsporidians. Note that it is unclear whether the cellular localizations and transport specificities of these genes can be transferred to other microsporidian NTTs, because the gene duplications giving rise to the four <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> NTTs do not date back to the last common ancestor of microsporidia. In particular, the observation that the other three <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> NTT paralogues are surface-located, a feature shared with bacterial NTT homologues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Haferkamp1">[15]</xref>, suggests that the targeting of <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> EcNTT3 to the mitosome is a derived state that might be restricted to the <italic>Encephalitozoon</italic> lineage. Computational analyses detected no obvious differences between <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> EcNTT3 and surface-located <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> NTT paralogues that might explain the observed differential targeting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Tsaousis1">[13]</xref>, and genetic manipulation of microsporidians to identify the specific residues involved is still not possible. Mitosomal targeting in general is not well understood in microsporidia, and even for model mitochondria the precise targeting signals are known for only a subset of organelle proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Chacinska1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Burri1">[36]</xref>.

The specificity of each ThNTT was determined quantitatively in vegetative stages (meronts) by assessing the extent to which the specific peptides (for ThNTT1, 2 and 3) or polypeptide (for ThNTT4) that were used to generate the antisera blocked the individual antibody signals in parallel replicate experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Lucocq2">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Hacker1">[39]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Material and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004547.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

<p>The antibodies were also used on <italic>T. hominis</italic>-infected rabbit kidney cells prepared for immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) to gain an overview of the ThNTT distribution in replicating parasites. The distribution of staining for antibodies raised for ThNTT1, ThNTT3 and ThNTT4 demonstrate a localisation on the surface of the growing parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004547-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), consistent with the plasma membrane location revealed by the EM data. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004547-g004">Fig. 4k</xref>, the antibodies against ThNTT4 and ThHsp70 did not give signals for structures inside the developing thick walled spores contained in the sporophorous vesicles (SPV) that are a characteristic feature of the <italic>T. hominis</italic> intracellular lifecycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Hollister1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Weidner1">[41]</xref>.

The lack of label in the outer envelope of the SPV is consistent with our EM data where no signal was detected for ThNTT4 in the electron-dense outer layer surrounding the parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004547-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) from which the SPV envelope is thought to originate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Weidner1">[41]</xref>.

Our failure to obtain IFA data for ThNTT2 despite successful EM experiments for this protein may reflect differences in sample preparation influencing epitope accessibility: the immuno-EM approach includes opening up the compartments by sectioning whereas IFA involves permeabilization of cell membranes and depends on penetration of the antibody prior to labelling.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Microsporidians infect most animal groups, often with devastating consequences for the host animal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Vavra1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Wittner1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Keeling1">[5]</xref>. Given the major loss of genes affecting most metabolic pathways revealed by genome analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Katinka1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Nakjang1">[11]</xref>, surface-located transport proteins are of critical importance for completing the microsporidian life cycle once inside an infected host cell. Consistent with this idea, comparative analyses suggest that expansion of specific transporter families was contemporaneous with loss of metabolic capacity at the origin of the microsporidian radiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Heinz1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Nakjang1">[11]</xref>. We have investigated the evolution, intracellular location and substrate specificities of nucleotide transport (NTT) proteins, homologues of which are conserved on all microsporidian genomes. Gaps in the predicted microsporidian metabolome suggest that these transporters potentially play essential roles supporting microsporidian DNA and RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004547-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004547.s003">Table S1</xref>), as well as providing energy for cellular metabolism and protein synthesis for a cellular stage that may no longer make its own <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Keeling1">[5]</xref>. Consistent with predictions from analyses of the <italic>T. hominis</italic> enzyme repertoire that both types of purine nucleotide must be imported, we detected transport of adenine and guanine nucleotides by all four ThNTTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004547-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Further work is now needed to characterise the detailed mechanisms of transport used by the ThNTTs. It has already been demonstrated that the mitosome-located <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> EcNTT3 is an exchanger of adenine nucleotides exporting ADP in exchange for ATP to supply an organelle unable to make its own ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Tsaousis1">[13]</xref>. This mechanism (Class I NTT proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Haferkamp1">[15]</xref>) has already been demonstrated for some NTTs of bacterial intracellular pathogens with a reduced energy metabolism - often called energy parasites - including <italic>Rickettsia prowazekii</italic> and <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Haferkamp1">[15]</xref>. The loss of the ability to make mitochondrial ATP and the apparent down-regulation of glycolytic enzymes in replicating cells of <italic>T. hominis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Heinz1">[10]</xref> suggests that one or more of the <italic>T. hominis</italic> NTTs might also use this transport mechanism. However, the requirement for net nucleotide import to support DNA and RNA biosynthesis that is predicted by our genome analyses also suggests that at least one of the ThNTTs could mediate a unidirectional proton-energised import of purine nucleotides. This mechanism (Class II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Haferkamp1">[15]</xref>) has also been described for NTT transporters from intracellular bacteria that lack <italic>de novo</italic> nucleotide biosynthesis, including <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Tjaden1">[14]</xref> and <italic>Protochlamydia amoebophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Haferkamp1">[15]</xref>. The similarities in the predicted enzyme repertoires of <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> and <italic>N. ceranae</italic> suggest that the requirement for host produced ATP and net nucleotide import of both types of purine nucleotides may be a general feature of microsporidians. Although NTT-like proteins in some bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Haferkamp1">[15]</xref> have been shown to transport purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, we did not detect any transport of the tested pyrimidine nucleotides by the NTTs of <italic>T. hominis</italic> under the assay conditions we used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004547-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). It is therefore possible that additional transporters are needed to provide these substrates. One candidate for this function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Cuomo1">[46]</xref> is a conserved family of microsporidian proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Nakjang1">[11]</xref> that share significant sequence similarity to <italic>E. coli</italic> NupG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Xie1">[47]</xref>. This is a nucleoside transporter of the major facilitator superfamily of transport proteins that can transport both purine (adenosine) and pyrimidine (uridine) nucleosides when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Xie1">[47]</xref>. Genome analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004547-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004547.s003">Table S1</xref>) suggest that any imported uridine could be used by <italic>T. hominis</italic> to make the pyrimidine nucleotides needed for nucleic acid biosynthesis.</p>
<p>The observed pattern of lineage- and even species-specific duplications of NTTs over the microsporidian tree, coupled with differences in their subcellular localization between <italic>T. hominis</italic> and <italic>E. cuniculi</italic>, suggests that the role of NTTs in parasite biology has continued to evolve throughout the microsporidian radiation. Previous work on the NTT proteins of <italic>Encephalitozoon cuniculi</italic> demonstrated that some NTT proteins were located on the surface of parasites inside infected host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Tsaousis1">[13]</xref>. Here we demonstrate that all four ThNTTs are located in the plasma membrane of replicating <italic>T. hominis</italic> cells, providing the first detailed evidence for NTT subcellular location. These data suggest that the location of NTT transporters at the host-parasite interface is a general strategy used by microsporidians to exploit host cells and compensate for their own highly reduced metabolism. In contrast to <italic>E. cuniculi</italic> we found no evidence that any of the ThNTTs were located to the <italic>T. hominis</italic> mitosome: this feature appears to be a derived feature of mitosome biology that may be restricted to the <italic>Encephalitozoon</italic> lineage.</p>

<title>Antibody generation</title>
<p>To obtain antibodies targeting exposed epitopes of these predominantly hydrophobic proteins, we identified two peptide sequences located in predicted surface-exposed loop regions for each ThNTT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004547.s001">Figure S1</xref>, Table S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004547.s004">Text S1</xref>). Peptide synthesis, animal immunisation, antisera extraction and affinity purification of all antisera was performed by Agrisera (Sweden). Both peptides for each ThNTT were used for immunisation of the same rabbit, and the affinity-purified antisera were tested for their specificity against <italic>E. coli</italic> strains expressing the individual ThNTT proteins. The peptide sequences are given in Table S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004547.s004">Text S1</xref>. The peptide antibodies for ThNTT3 gave some non-specific binding in IFA experiments and antibodies for ThNTT4 gave a high level of nonspecific background labelling in immuno-electron microscopy, so we designed a second set of antibodies to regions of ThNTT3 or ThNTT4 predicted to form exposed loop regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004547.s001">Figure S1</xref>, Table S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004547.s004">Text S1</xref>). These regions were synthesised (GenScript Inc., USA) as a single gene encoding the polypeptide, cloned into the pQE-40 expression vector (Qiagen) and expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> M15 [pREP4] cells as single dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) fusion proteins and processed to make rabbit antibodies (Agrisera, Sweden) as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Tsaousis1">[13]</xref>.</p>

<title>Electron microscopy</title>
<p>Monolayer RK cells (RK-13) were infected with <italic>T. hominis</italic> and grown to near confluence. The cells were fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.2 M PIPES buffer (pH 7.2) for 15 min at room temperature, then scraped from the culture dish and pelleted (15 min at 16.000× g). The cells were subsequently washed three times with buffer (5 min per wash) and cryoprotected in 2.3 M sucrose in PBS overnight at 4°C. Small fragments of the cell pellet were mounted onto specimen carriers and plunge-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Eighty nm thick sections were cut at −100°C (EM FC7 ultracryomicrotome; Leica, Vienna, Austria) and mounted on carbon/pioloform-coated EM copper grids (Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK) in drops containing equal volumes of pre-mixed 2.1 M sucrose and 2% w/v methylcellulose. Prior to labelling, grids were washed in ice-cold distilled water (3 times, 5 min each) followed by PBS at room temperature. The sections were then incubated in 0.5% fish skin gelatin (Sigma Aldrich, Poole, UK) in PBS, and labelled using rabbit antisera raised against the four <italic>T. hominis</italic> NTTs, followed by 10 nm protein-A gold (BBI solutions, Cardiff, UK) and contrasted using 2% w/v methylcellulose/3% w/v uranyl acetate (mixed 9∶1). To assess the specificity of labelling, sections were incubated in parallel with antisera which had been pre-mixed with the peptides (for ThNTT1, 2 or 3) or polypeptide (for ThNTT4) used to generate the antibodies, in order to inhibit specific antibody binding (peptide-control). For this purpose, equal volumes of antisera and the corresponding peptides or polypeptide in PBS were mixed for 30 min at room temperature and were then applied to sections in parallel with the native antisera, which were incubated in PBS under the same conditions. For quantification, labelled sections were sampled systematic uniform random (SUR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Lucocq3">[51]</xref>) in three individual experiments per antibody by taking 16–20 micrographs per sample with a JEOL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kv using either Ditabis imaging plates (DITABIS Digital Biomedical Imaging Systems AG, Pforzheim, Germany) or a GATAN Orius 200 digital camera (GATAN, Abingdon, Oxon, UK). Mitosomes were sampled separately by comprehensive scanning of all parasites within a randomly selected grid square (22 to 40 micrographs per sample). Tiff files of micrographs were further analysed using Adobe Photoshop CS6. Square lattice grids were randomly placed on each micrograph and used to estimate the length of membrane profiles of compartments of interest by intersection counting (grid spacing either 262, 618 or 914 nm for the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope; 914 nm or 1.54 µm for endo-membranes, including endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi as well as every other non-categorized internal membrane apart from nuclear envelope and mitosome membranes). Gold particles were categorized as being membrane-associated if the particle was less than 1 particle width away from a membrane profile. The specificity of immunogold labelling was assessed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Lucocq2">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004547-Hacker1">[39]</xref>. Briefly, the specific labelling density D(sp) (gold per micron) was estimated by subtracting the labelling density obtained with the peptide-control D(-) from the initial (raw) density D(0). Next, the fraction of the specific labelling F(sp) is given by D(sp)/D(0) and F(sp) is multiplied with the initial labelling counts over each compartment in order to calculate the specific labelling distribution. The vegetative meront stages of <italic>T. hominis</italic> could be identified as single or multinucleated cells proliferating in RK cells. Spore stages were distinguished by the presence of a discernible cell wall and/or the formation of the polar tube. The plasma membrane was visible as a smooth membrane profile covered with an electron dense coating in early meront stages and as a more convoluted membrane profile in later meront stages. Endo-membranes were defined as membrane structures inside the cytoplasm including the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi and any other membrane compartment excluding the nuclear envelope and mitosomal membranes. Mitosomes were identified as double membrane bound organelles with minor and major axes measuring between 50 and 300 nm.</p>
