<abstract>
<p>Cerebral malaria (CM) is a complex parasitic disease caused by <italic>Plasmodium sp</italic>. Failure to establish an appropriate balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune responses is believed to contribute to the development of cerebral pathology. Using the blood-stage PbA (<italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> ANKA) model of infection, we show here that administration of the pro-Th2 cytokine, IL-33, prevents the development of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) in C57BL/6 mice and reduces the production of inflammatory mediators IFN-γ, IL-12 and TNF-α. IL-33 drives the expansion of type-2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) that produce Type-2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13), leading to the polarization of the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, which in turn expand Foxp3 regulatory T cells (Tregs). PbA-infected mice adoptively transferred with ILC2 have elevated frequency of M2 and Tregs and are protected from ECM. Importantly, IL-33-treated mice deleted of Tregs (DEREG mice) are no longer able to resist ECM. Our data therefore provide evidence that IL-33 can prevent the development of ECM by orchestrating a protective immune response via ILC2, M2 macrophages and Tregs.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cerebral malaria (CM) caused by the parasite <italic>Plasmodium sp</italic>. is a fatal disease, especially in children. Currently there is no effective treatment. We report here our investigation on the role of a recently discovered cytokine IL-33, in treating experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) in the susceptible C57BL/6 mice. IL-33 protects the mice against ECM. The protection is accompanied by a reduction of Th1 response and the enhancement of type 2 cytokine response. We also found that IL-33 mediates its protective effect by inducing a population of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), which then polarize macrophages to alternatively-activated phenotypes (M2). M2 in turn expand regulatory T cells (Tregs) which suppress the deleterious Th1 response. Our report therefore reveals hitherto unrecognised mechanisms of the regulation of ECM and provide a novel function of IL-33.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Malaria remains a major health problem for humans infected with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species. Cerebral malaria (CM) is a severe and potentially fatal neurological manifestation of infection and accounts for approximately one million deaths annually of children in sub-Saharan Africa alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref001">1</xref>]. CM is characterized by a strong Th1 immune response, with a robust and uncontrolled production of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF-α) and chemokines (IP-10/CXCL10, KC/CXCL1 and MCP-1/CCL2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref003">3</xref>] that contribute to vascular leakage and sequestration of parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs) and leukocytes within the brain blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref005">5</xref>]. In malaria, the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines is critical in determining the outcome of infection, and recent evidences suggest that helminth co-infection may dampen immunopathological responses to malaria parasite by inducing a protective type-2 response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref007">7</xref>]. Studies using murine models of malaria have established that genetic background of the host affects the development and outcome of ECM. Infection of C57BL/6 mice, which present a Th1-biased phenotype, with the rodent parasite <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> ANKA (PbA) induces a fatal cerebral disease characterized by neurological disorders including paralysia, convulsion and coma. In contrast, BALB/c mice, that present a Th2-biased phenotype, do not develop neurological complications and die at later stages from high parasitemia and anaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>IL-33, the latest member of the IL-1 cytokine family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref010">10</xref>], plays an important role in Th2-associated immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref012">12</xref>]. IL-33 has been linked to a number of inflammatory disorders including allergic asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, allergic rhinitis and ulcerative colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref013">13</xref>]. IL-33 binds to a heterodimer receptor composed of ST2 (IL-33R) and IL-1R accessory protein, leading to the production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 from mast cells, eosinophils, Th2 lymphocytes and the newly discovered population of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref012">12</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, IL-33 has also been shown to synergize with IL-4 to drive the polarization of alternatively-activated macrophages (M2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref014">14</xref>], that secrete high levels of IL-10 and TGF-β. We hypothesized that IL-33 could divert the deleterious Th1-immune response during infection and therefore protects mice from ECM.</p>
<p>Results reported here demonstrate that PbA-infected C57BL/6 mice treated with recombinant IL-33 presented no signs of neurological pathology associated with CM and had reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This IL-33-protective effect was mediated by the activation of ILC2 that produced type 2 cytokines which in turn polarized anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Furthermore, M2 macrophages expanded Tregs, the depletion of which abrogated the protective effect of IL-33. We therefore present a previously unrecognised role of IL-33 in ECM, and provide evidence that induction of type 2 immunity by an exogenous cytokine treatment was sufficient to down-regulate the inflammatory Th1 response and ECM induced by PbA.</p>

<title>IL-33 treatment protects mice from cerebral malaria induced by PbA</title>
<p>To determine whether IL-33 could modulate malaria pathogenesis, we first infected C57BL/6 mice with <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> ANKA (PbA) parasites (10<sup>4</sup> parasitized red blood cells, pRBC) and treated the mice with recombinant murine IL-33 (0.2 μg/mouse/day, intraperitoneally) starting from day 0. Body weight loss, parasitemia, clinical score and survival were monitored daily. PbA-infected control mice developed parasitemia, body weight loss and CM symptoms (head deviation, ataxia and paraplegia) from day 5 post infection, and all mice succumbed to CM by day 7–8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g001">Fig. 1A-D</xref>). In contrast, mice treated with IL-33 displayed reduced body weight loss, clinical score and survived up to day 20 post-infection when they were euthanised due to development of hyperparasitemia (up to 40% parasitemia) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). This indicates that IL-33 administration protects mice from ECM but not from malaria-induced hyperparasitemia and death. Similar results were obtained when the IL-33 treatment began one day after infection (day +1). Similar results were also obtained with 100× higher PbA infective dose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004607.s001">S1A-S1B Fig.</xref>).</p>

<p>Adherence of parasited red blood cells (pRBC) to the vascular endothelium of organs plays a key role in the pathogenesis of <italic>Plasmodium species</italic> allowing the parasite to escape clearance in the spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref015">15</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic> imaging using luciferase-expressing PbA confirmed that the parasite biomass was significantly reduced in IL-33-treated mice indicating that the reduction in blood parasitemia was not due to an increase of parasite sequestration in the peripheric organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g001">Fig. 1E, F</xref>).</p>
<p>CM is associated with parasite sequestration into the brain microvasculature and cerebral hemorrhage that result from excessive systemic inflammation, which involves pro-inflammatory cytokine production leading to endothelial cell activation and vascular permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref016">16</xref>]. Using the luciferase-expressing PbA, we found a strong increase in parasite biomass in the brain of PBS-treated mice on day 7 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g001">Fig. 1G, H</xref>). In contrast, IL-33-treated animals showed a significant reduction of luciferase activity in the brain, indicating diminished pRBC accumulation. Histopathological analysis of brains from PBS-treated mice showed microhemorrhages and cytoadhesion of erythrocytes and leucocytes to the brain vasculature on day 7. Mice treated with IL-33 displayed markedly fewer hemorrhages and less vessel obstruction compared to the PBS-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g001">Fig. 1I, J</xref>). Finally, quantitative PCR analysis showed an upregulation of <italic>Icam-1</italic> expression in the brain tissues of PbA-infected PBS-treated mice, that was absent in IL-33-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g001">Fig. 1K</xref>), consistent with the reduction of cytoadhesion in IL-33-treated mice compared to the controls.</p>

<title>IL-33 reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in PbA-infected mice</title>
<p>To investigate how IL-33 might interfer with the host immune response, we measured the levels of the key Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-12 and TNF-α), key Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13), and the regulatory cytokine IL-10 in the serum at various time-points after infection with PbA. Levels of IFN-γ, IL-12 and TNF-α rose progressively to day 5 in the serum of PBS-treated mice. In contrast, the levels of these cytokines were significantly reduced in IL-33-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g002">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). The levels of serum IL-5 were low in the control mice but were strongly enhanced in IL-33-treated mice, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). The levels of serum IL-4 and IL-13 were barely detectable in all groups of mice. The concentrations of serum IL-10 also increased in PBS control mice but were reduced in IL-33-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Early production of the pro-inflammatory chemokines IP-10/CXCL10, KC/CXCL1 and MCP-1/CCL2 was also reduced in the serum of IL-33-treated mice compared to PBS-control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g002">Fig. 2F-H</xref>). We then assessed the expression of lineage-specific transcription factors in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells purified from the spleen of PbA-infected mice. The Th1-specific transcription factor <italic>Tbet</italic> peaked at day 3 of infection in PBS control mice but was reduced on day 3 and unchanged on day 5 in IL-33-treated mice compared to PBS-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g002">Fig. 2I</xref>). IL-33 did not affect <italic>Gata3</italic> expression in purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g002">Fig. 2J</xref>), suggesting that Th2 cells are unlikely involved in IL-33-mediated protection. T cell-derived Granzyme B (GrmB) is known to drive cytotoxic T cell-mediated cerebral pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref017">17</xref>]. We therefore determined GrmB expression in splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Percentage and frequency of GrmB<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> and GrmB<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in PbA-infected mice was markedly increased compared to non-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g002">Fig. 2K, L</xref>). Granzyme B positive CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly reduced in percentage and number in IL-33-treated mice compared to PBS-treated control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g002">Fig. 2K, L</xref>). Together, our results suggest that IL-33-mediated protection against ECM is likely associated with reduction in the early pro-inflammatory type-1 response.</p>

<title>IL-33 induces ILC2 expansion and type 2 cytokine production in PbA-infected mice</title>
<p>Recently, IL-33 has been found to directly induce ILC2 expansion and cytokine production <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref020">20</xref>].We therefore analysed the effect of IL-33 on ILC2 in the ECM model. The frequency and number of ILC2 in the spleen of non-infected (NI) or PbA-infected mice after treatment with PBS or IL-33 were analysed by FACS. A small but consistent percentage of lineage negative CD45<sup>+</sup>ST2<sup>+</sup>ICOS<sup>+</sup> cells, corresponding to ILC2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref021">21</xref>], was found in the spleen of NI mice in the absence of IL-33-treatment. However IL-33-treatment significantly increased the percentage and number of ILC2 in the spleen in NI and PbA-infected mice compared to PBS-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g003">Fig. 3A-C</xref>).

<p>To investigate the potential role of ILC2 in IL-33-driven protection from CM, we sorted ILC2 and adoptively transferred them into naïve WT mice. One day after ILC2 transfer, mice were infected with PbA and monitored daily for parasitemia, body weight loss and neurological symptoms. Two injections of IL-33 (0.2 μg/mouse, i.p.) were given to the recipient mice 30 min and 24 h after cell transfer. An earlier study has shown that the provision of IL-33 boosts the survival and cytokine production of the transferred ILC2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref022">22</xref>]. A control group infected with PbA and similarly treated with IL-33 confirmed that IL-33 at this dose and schedule of treatment was suboptimal and not protective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g003">Fig. 3G, H</xref>). While the two control groups developed severe body weight loss and succumbed to CM by day 7, all the recipient mice given ILC2 exhibited limited clinical disease and survived beyond day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g003">Fig. 3G, H</xref>). The parasitemia of ILC2-transferred mice was reduced within the first week of infection compared to PbA control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g003">Fig. 3I</xref>). Mice that received only 2 injections of IL-33, exhibited a slight reduction of parasitemia but nevertheless succumbed to CM by day 7. Histopathology analysis of the brain on day 7 revealed a significant reduction of microhemorrhages and vessel obstruction in the ILC2 recipients compared to the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g003">Fig. 3J, K</xref>). The cells producing IL-5 and IL-13 in the ILC2 recipient mice are CD4<sup>−</sup> T cells and not CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004607.s002">S2A-S2C Fig.</xref>), indicating that they are unlikely to be Th2 cells. These results therefore demonstrate that ILC2 play an important role in the IL-33-mediated protection against ECM.</p>

<title>IL-33 polarizes M2 macrophages</title>
<p>We then investigated the mechanism by which ILC2 protects mice against ECM. Macrophages can be divided into specific subsets according to their polarization environment, phenotype, and function. M1 (classically-activated macrophages) typically produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-12, whereas M2 (alternatively-activated macrophages) have been implicated in immune regulation, phagocytosis, and tissue remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref024">24</xref>]. As M2 macrophages are polarized by IL-4 and IL-13, and that these cytokines are produced by ILC2, we therefore assessed the profile of macrophage polarization in mice infected with PbA with or without IL-33 treatment.</p>
<p>The percentage and number of CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>−</sup> cells in the spleen of mice administered with IL-33 were significantly elevated compared to that treated with PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g004">Fig. 4A-C</xref>). Expansion of CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>−</sup> cells was accompanied by increased expression of the key M2 marker (CD206, mannose receptor) and the reduction of the M1 markers (CD86, MHC-II and CD40) on macrophages recovered from IL-33-treated mice compared to that of the PBS control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g004">Fig. 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004607.s003">S3A Fig.</xref>). The expression of other M2 markers (<italic>Arginase-1, Ym1</italic>/chitinase 3–like 3 and <italic>Fizz1</italic>/resistin-like α) were also elevated in the spleen whereas the expression of the key M1 marker, <italic>Nos2</italic>, was reduced in IL-33-treated mice compared to that of the PBS control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). Interestingly, mRNA expression of heme oxygenase-1 (<italic>Hmox-1</italic>), an enzyme that converts heme into carbon monoxide, was significantly increased in the spleen of IL-33-treated mice compared to PBS-control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g004">Fig. 4E</xref>). QPCR analysis on sorted CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>−</sup> cells confirmed that splenic macrophages from IL-33-treated mice, but not from PBS-treated mice, exhibited an M2-polarization status (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004607.s003">S3B Fig.</xref>). Overall, our data indicate that IL-33 increases macrophage number in the spleen and promotes their polarization towards M2 phenotype.</p>

<p>Since IL-33 alone is not sufficient to fully differenciate M2 macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref014">14</xref>], we investigated the potential role of ILC2 in M2 polarization <italic>in vitro</italic>.

<p>Since ILC2 proliferation and cytokine production are IL-7- and IL-33-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref025">25</xref>], we determined the effect of activated-ILC2 on BMDM. To avoid any direct effect of IL-33 on BMDM, we used ST2-deficient BMDM. When cultured alone, ST2-deficient BMDM did not express any M2 markers even when IL-33 or IL-33 + IL-7 were added to the culture. In the presence of ILC2, the expression of <italic>Arginase-1</italic> and <italic>Ym1</italic> in the ST2-deficient BMDM was increased, and the expression of these markers were further enhanced by the addition of IL-33 alone or in combination with IL-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g005">Fig. 5B</xref>), suggesting that activated-ILC2 can produce cytokines involved in M2 polarization. The level of <italic>Fizz1</italic> expression was high in the presence of ILC2 alone and was reduced in the presence of IL-33/IL-7. The reason of this reduction is not clear but could be due to over-stimulation of <italic>Fizz1</italic> expression. We then analysed the production of Th2 cytokines by ILC2 <italic>in vitro</italic>. ILC2 alone (without BMDM) were able to produce low levels of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 in the culture supernatants. This production was markedly increased after stimulation by IL-33 and IL-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis of ILC2 confirmed that ILC2 in the culture produced IL-4 and IL-13 and the production was further enhanced by the presence of IL-33 + IL-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g005">Fig. 5D, E</xref>).

<title>The role of ILC2, M2 and Tregs in IL-33-mediated protection against ECM</title>
<p>Previous studies have implicated Tregs to limit disease and immunopathology in the PbA-induced models of ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref028">28</xref>] and IL-33 has been shown to induce Tregs in <italic>vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref031">31</xref>]. We therefore explored the impact of IL-33, ILC2 and M2 macrophages on Tregs in the ECM model. First, we noted that the level of <italic>Foxp3</italic> message in sorted splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was increased in IL-33-treated mice during PbA-infection compared to PBS-treated mice. The percentage and total number of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the mice infected with PbA were significantly increased by the treatment with IL-33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g006">Fig. 6A-B</xref>). We then determined the effect of adoptively transferred ILC2 in the induction of Tregs <italic>in vivo</italic> (as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g003">Fig. 3F</xref>). Suboptimal doses of IL-33 led to increased frequency of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells among splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> suggesting that IL-33 alone could induce Treg polarization which was however not sufficient to protect the mice from ECM (see Survival curve and Clinical Score in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g003">Fig. 3F</xref>). However, the spleens of IL-33-treated PbA-infected mice given ILC2 contained significantly higher frequency of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> among CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to those not given ILC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g006">Fig. 6C-D</xref>). To demonstrate a direct link between M2 and Tregs, we co-cultured purified CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells with M2 in the presence of soluble anti-CD3. M2 significantly expanded the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g006">Fig. 6E</xref>).

In PbA-infected mice, exogenous IL-33 induces a robust expansion and mobilization of ILC2 which have the potential to produce IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. Adoptive transfer of ILC2 markedly ameliorated ECM. IL-33 administration following ILC transfer was necessary to induce the protection, likely because ILC2 require IL-33 stimulation to expand and produce sufficient amount of type 2 cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref022">22</xref>]. However, the possibility that IL-33 may also act on other cell types that participate in the protection against ECM cannot be excluded. <italic>In vitro</italic>, we confirmed that ILC2 can polarize BMDM into M2 macrophages in a cell-cell contact independant manner. IL-33 increased production of IL-4 and IL-13 by ILC2, which can synergize to polarize M2 macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref036">36</xref>]. This is supported by our data showing that adoptively transferred ILC2 can collaborate with IL-33 to polarize M2 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>M2 macrophages exhibit potent anti-inflammatory properties and play important roles in parasite clearance, tissue repair and remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref037">37</xref>]. One of the proposed mechanism for the immunomodulatory role of M2 macrophages is the competition between Arginase-1 (expressed by M2) and iNOS (expressed by M1) for the subtrate L-Arginine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref037">37</xref>]. Another mechanism is the production of carbon monoxide (CO) by heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an enzyme which has been shown to be preferentially expressed in CD206<sup>+</sup> M2 macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref038">38</xref>]. HO-1 catalyzes the degradation of heme into biliverdin, iron and CO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref039">39</xref>]. Here, we found that IL-33-treated mice expressed higher levels of HO-1 in the spleen. Free heme release during <italic>Plasmodium spp</italic>. infection contributes to blood brain barrier disruption and ECM pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref040">40</xref>]. CO production by HO-1 has been shown to suppress PbA-induced ECM by inhibiting blood brain barrier disruption, reducing adhesion molecule expression in the brain microvasculature and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell sequestration in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref040">40</xref>]. The role of IL-33 in the induction of CO via HO-1 merits further investigation.</p>
<p>Tregs expansion by IL-2/anti-IL-2 complexes <italic>in vivo</italic> has been implicated to protect mice against T cell-mediated immune pathology in PbA-induced ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref028">28</xref>], although direct evidence for a role of Tregs in ECM remains elusive. We and others have shown earlier that IL-33 administration leads to Treg induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref041">41</xref>]. Here, we provide data supporting that IL-33-mediated induction of Tregs in PbA-infected mice involves the activity of ILC2 and M2 macrophages. We also show that M2 expand natural Tregs and inducible Tregs <italic>in vitro</italic>. Importantly, Tregs depletion abrogated the protective effect of IL-33 in ECM by reducing the Th1 cell response. These results therefore demonstrate a cascade of events leading to the protection of ECM by IL-33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g008">Fig. 8</xref>). The detailed mechanism by which Tregs suppress effector T cells, the major immunopathological mediators of ECM, remains to be explored.</p>
<p>It is important to note that IL-33-treated mice produced minimal amount of IL-10 during PbA-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1004607.g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Furthermore, administration of anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibody in IL-33-treated mice did not affect the protection conferred by IL-33 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004607.s004">S4A-S4B Fig.</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that M2- or Tregs-produced-IL-10 participates to ECM protection by IL-33. This is consistent with an earlier report which shows CTLA4-dependent but IL-10-independent protection against ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>IL-33-treated mice, though consistently showed significant reduction in parasitemia at the early stage of infection (day 5–7) compared to untreated mice, were unable to clear the parasite and eventually died at later stage from hyperparasitemia. IL-33-mediated protection was achieved when the cytokine was given relatively early after infection and delaying treatment by 48 h failed to control the disease. This observation suggests a fine temporal interplay between the protective T cell response against the parasite and the anti-inflammatory response during PbA infection. Spleen is a key site for removal of pRBC during malaria through production of reactive oxygen species and phagocytosis by activated macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref042">42</xref>]. Moreover, it has been shown that Flt3L-induced CD11b<sup>int</sup> F4/80<sup>+</sup> red pulp macrophages, which ressemble the macrophages induced by IL-33, displayed higher phagocytic activity and contributed to parasite clearance in PbA-infected mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref043">43</xref>]. Here, we observed that polarized M2 macrophages showed enhanced capacity in dextran-FITC or pRBC uptake compared to unpolarized macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004607.s003">S3C-S3D Fig.</xref>). Therefore, the initial reduced parasitemia observed in our model could be explained by local activation and proliferation of red pulp macrophages, which might contribute to the parasite killing. Although it is possible that the low parasitemia contributed to IL-33-mediated protection by reducing PbA antigenic stimulation, it is unlikely an influential mechanism since we found that IL-33 treatment was still equally protective in mice infected with a 100× higher dose of pRBC which displayed a parasitemia &gt; 5% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004607.s001">S1A-S1B Fig.</xref>).</p>
<p>IL-33 can directly stimulate eosinophil differentiation and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref044">44</xref>]. Eosinophil granules contain cytotoxic, highly basic proteins, including the eosinophilic cationic protein that has been shown to inhibit <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref045">45</xref>]. In our model, although the percentage and number of splenic eosinophils were augmented by 6 folds in IL-33-treated mice compared to untreated mice, eosinophil depletion using anti-Siglec-F antibody did not affect IL-33-mediated protection during PbA infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004607.s004">S4C-S4G Fig.</xref>) suggesting that eosinophils are unlikely an influential mechanism in IL-33-mediated protection against ECM.</p>
<p>Increased number of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs have been observed in humans infected with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004607.ref047">47</xref>]. It would be of considerable interest to investigate if the observation reported here is also applicable to clinical cerebral malaria.</p>

<p>C57BL/6 red blood cells infected with <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> ANKA parasites expressing a green fluorescent protein (PbA GFPcon 259cl2, MRA-865, deposited by CJ Janse and AP Waters) were stored in liquid nitrogen and thawed and passed into wild-type mice that served as parasite donor. All mice, unless otherwise stated, were inoculated intravenously (i.v.) into the tail vein with 1×10<sup>4</sup> parasitized red blood cells (pRBC). Parasitemia was monitored daily (from day 4) by flow cytometry using the FL3 channel (PbA-GFP) and TER-119 APC (erythrocytes) in a BD FACScalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences). Clinical score was assessed using the following clinical scale: 1 = no signs; 2 = ruffled fur and/or abnormal posture; 3 = lethargy; 4 = reduced responsiveness to stimulation and/or ataxia and/or respiratory distress/hyperventilation; and 5 = prostration and/or paralysis and/or convulsions. All animal that reachs stage 4 developped ECM. Recombinant murine IL-33 (Biolegend) was injected intraperitoneally (0.2 μg/mouse/200 μl) daily, routinely from the beginning of infection (day 0). As a control for IL-33 effects, non-infected (NI) mice also received IL-33 for 5 consecutive days.

<p>Mice infected with the transgenic PbA strain that constitutively expresses luciferase (PbA-luc, gift of Dr. AP Waters, Glasgow, UK) were imaged using an IVIS Imaging 100 system (Xenogen Corp.) Mice were injected intraperitoneally with D-luciferin (PerkinElmer, 150 mg/kg in DPBS) and anesthetized in 5% isoflurane/1L O2.min<sup>−1</sup> atmosphere. The animals were then placed in the imaging chamber of the IVIS and anesthesia was maintained using 2% isoflurane/0.2L O<sub>2</sub> per mouse min<sup>−1</sup> atmosphere. Bioluminescence (photons per second per square centimeter per steridian) was monitored over a 20 min period in previously defined regions of interest (ROI). Exposure times varied between 0.5 and 1 min, depending on signal intensity. To standardize imaging and to allow comparison between mice, the images presented in the figures were taken once luminescence plateaued.
