<abstract>
<p>Lentiviral Envelope (Env) antigenic variation and related immune evasion present major hurdles to effective vaccine development. Centralized Env immunogens that minimize the genetic distance between vaccine proteins and circulating viral isolates are an area of increasing study in HIV vaccinology. To date, the efficacy of centralized immunogens has not been evaluated in the context of an animal model that could provide both immunogenicity and protective efficacy data. We previously reported on a live-attenuated (attenuated) equine infectious anemia (EIAV) virus vaccine, which provides 100% protection from disease after virulent, homologous, virus challenge. Further, protective efficacy demonstrated a significant, inverse, linear relationship between EIAV Env divergence and protection from disease when vaccinates were challenged with viral strains of increasing Env divergence from the vaccine strain Env. Here, we sought to comprehensively examine the protective efficacy of centralized immunogens in our attenuated vaccine platform. We developed, constructed, and extensively tested a consensus Env, which in a virulent proviral backbone generated a fully replication-competent pathogenic virus, and compared this consensus Env to an ancestral Env in our attenuated proviral backbone. A polyvalent attenuated vaccine was established for comparison to the centralized vaccines. Additionally, an engineered quasispecies challenge model was created for rigorous assessment of protective efficacy. Twenty-four EIAV-naïve animals were vaccinated and challenged along with six-control animals six months post-second inoculation. Pre-challenge data indicated the consensus Env was more broadly immunogenic than the Env of the other attenuated vaccines. However, challenge data demonstrated a significant increase in protective efficacy of the polyvalent vaccine. These findings reveal, for the first time, a consensus Env immunogen that generated a fully-functional, replication-competent lentivirus, which when experimentally evaluated, demonstrated broader immunogenicity that does not equate to higher protective efficacy.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Our best effort for containment of the global HIV epidemic is the development of a broadly protective vaccine. Current research has focused on vaccines that can generate a protective immune response against numerous strains of the virus. For this reason, vaccines with centralized HIV genes as immunogens, which merge HIV genetic information and potentially protect against multiple viral strains in a single inoculation, are an increasing area of interest to the field. Existing published studies have not evaluated centralized immunogens in the context of attenuated vaccines, which to date, have demonstrated the highest level of vaccine protection in lentiviral studies. Furthermore, centralized immunogen studies have also not included protective efficacy findings accomplished through challenge with highly pathogenic virus strains. In this study we not only examine the immunogenicity of these immunogens in an animal model, but we also for the first time evaluate the ability of centralized immunogens to induce protection against virulent virus challenge.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The scientific community has aggressively sought after the development of a universal HIV vaccine that can prevail over the extraordinary levels of antigenic diversity in the fight against HIV and AIDS. The considerable extent of genomic variation found between isolates and within clades, and to a larger extent within the circulating recombinant forms, make for an effectual blockade to vaccine protection. Different strategies of vaccine composition and delivery have been proposed that are actively and widely being examined. A majority of these vaccines target the Env protein, as lentiviral antigenic variation is most pronounced in the viral Env proteins that serve as initial primary targets for host immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Gaschen1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Mullins1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Centralized Env immunogens are one of the more promising contemporary approaches to overcoming HIV antigenic diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Gaschen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Liao1">[6]</xref>. Centralized sequences attempt to minimize the genetic distance between vaccine proteins and the circulating isolates that pose a threat to public health. The centralized genes are generated through the computational determination of consensus genes (the most common amino acid at each position), ancestral genes (modelling ancestral states through phylogenetics), or center of the tree sequences (phylogenetic determination of a central isolates) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Gaschen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Korber1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Mullins2">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Nickle1">[8]</xref>. Centralized genes have been investigated as effective vaccine approaches in the HIV field both as DNA and/or protein immunogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Liao1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Gao1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Mcburney1">[19]</xref>. To date, however, the efficacy of centralized immunogens has not been fully explored in the context of an attenuated lentiviral vaccine model that could provide both immunogenicity data as well as protective efficacy data via virulent challenge in an animal model.</p>
<p>Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), a macrophage-tropic lentivirus, causes a persistent infection and chronic disease in equids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Montelaro1">[20]</xref>. Infection, transmitted via blood-feeding horse flies, occurs in three stages: acute, chronic and inapparent. Acute and chronic stages are defined by episodes of clinical disease that are triggered by waves of viremia, and distinguished by fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia, edema, and various wasting signs. By one year post-infection animals typically progress to life-long inapparent carriers, but continue to harbor steady-state levels of viral replication in monocyte-rich tissue reservoirs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Montelaro1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Hammond1">[22]</xref>. Stress or immune suppression of inapparent carriers can induce increases in viral replication and potentially a recrudescence of disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Montelaro1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Kono1">[23]</xref>. Among virulent lentiviruses, EIAV is unique in that, despite aggressive virus replication and associated rapid antigenic variation, greater than 90% of infected animals progress from chronic disease to an inapparent carrier stage, by a strict immunologic control over virus replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Montelaro1">[20]</xref>. The EIAV system hence serves as a unique animal model for the natural immunologic control of lentiviral replication and disease. Further, EIAV inapparent carriers have proven to be resistant to subsequent virus exposure to diverse viral strains, indicating the development of a high level of prophylactic immunity. Thus, the EIAV system provides a valuable model for identifying critical immune correlates of protection and ascertaining the potential for developing effective prophylactic lentivirus vaccines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>While the disease processes for EIAV and HIV have distinguishing dynamics, key similarities between the two virus systems make EIAV an extremely valuable tool and model for AIDS vaccine development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo3">[26]</xref>. EIAV and HIV are transmitted parenterally and share a macrophage/monocyte tropism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo3">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo4">[27]</xref>. EIAV quasispecies also possess high levels of antigenic heterogeneity and their Env proteins share architectural characteristics such as extensive glycosylation and immune decoys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo2">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo5">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo6">[29]</xref>. These features, all of which are critical elements associated with initial virus exposure, coupled to a very similar immune maturation process of the EIAV-infected equine to HIV-infected humans, are fundamental factors relevant to vaccine efficacy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Montelaro2">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p>We previously reported serial studies evaluating the efficacy of an attenuated EIAV proviral vaccine containing a mutation in the viral <italic>S2</italic> accessory gene (EIAV<sub>D9</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo7">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Li1">[33]</xref>. The results of these studies indicate that horses inoculated with the EIAV<sub>D9</sub> viral vaccine were 100% protected from disease by virulent, albeit homologous, EIAV challenge. Thus, the EIAV system mirrors other animal lentivirus vaccine models, which consistently identify attenuated vaccines as producing the highest level of vaccine protection. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo7">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Koff1">[38]</xref>. Our latest EIAV<sub>D9</sub> data demonstrated the effects of challenge virus Env sequence variation on vaccine protection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo10">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Tagmyer2">[41]</xref>. We identified a significant, inverse, linear correlation between vaccine efficacy and increasing divergence of the challenge virus Env surface protein, gp90, compared to the vaccine virus gp90 protein. The study demonstrated that the 100% protection of immunized horses from disease after challenge by virus with a homologous gp90 (EV0), dropped to approximately 60% protection when a challenge virus gp90 was 6% divergent (EV6), and nose-dived to less than 50% protection against challenge with a gp90 that was 13% (EV13) divergent from the vaccine strain. Most recently, we demonstrated that the attenuated vaccine strain progressively evolved during the seven-month pre-challenge period and that the observed protection from disease was significantly associated with divergence from the original vaccine strain, not the overall diversity of the vaccine Env quasispecies present on the day of challenge (DOC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo10">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>Despite numerous studies on the immunogenicity of centralized Env proteins, use of these noteworthy immunogens in an attenuated vaccine model, accompanied by virulent virus challenge, has yet to be reported. In the current study, we sought to directly build upon our current model and the series of described EIAV<sub>D9</sub> vaccine studies. Our attenuated vaccine model, coupled with the well-characterized genomic and phylogenetic ancestry of the Env gene of our EIAV strain, enabled a thorough, unparalleled evaluation of centralized sequence vaccine efficacy not as readily modelled in other lentiviral systems. The presented studies evaluated multiple derivatives of centralized Env immunogens, both consensus and ancestral, in our proviral attenuated vaccine backbone. The studies were designed to first, develop and test a consensus immunogen for functionality through examination of replication and pathogenic potential in proviral backbones; second, compare the protective efficacy of the consensus immunogen in an attenuated backbone to attenuated strains containing our ancestral Env <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo9">[34]</xref> as well as a polyvalent Env attenuated strain mixture; and third, to develop and utilize a more stringent challenge model in the form of an engineered quasispecies.</p>

<title>Development of consensus Env</title>
<p>Consensus gene development of the EIAV Env protein focused on the gp90 region of the gene as genomic evolution and antigenic variation in the transmembrane (gp45) protein has been shown to be minimal among characterized longitudinal EIAV isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Leroux1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Leroux2">[43]</xref>. To engineer a consensus Env, the gp90 genes of approximately 90 naturally occurring isolates from an experimental infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Leroux1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo11">[44]</xref> were aligned. Virus isolates included the inoculum strain Env as well as isolates from all three stages of disease (acute, chronic, and inapparent). Isolates therefore included an ancestral strain (EV0) and its descendant strains that evolved innately between day zero and 1200 days post-infection (DPI). Consensus sequences were derived primarily from codon-aligned nucleotide sequences and secondarily from amino acid alignments. The consensus sequence from the nucleotide alignment was translated, compared to the consensus sequence from the amino acid alignment for congruence and the resolution of ambiguities, and termed ConEnv. To evaluate the veracity of the derived ConEnv sequence and discriminate it against other potential consensus Env proteins, additional consensus sequences were designed. Consensus Envs representing the individual febrile episodes (six) and inapparent stage isolates were generated from the isolate amino acid sequences and thereafter a consensus from those engineered sequences was constructed as well. This “consensus from all consensus” method is similar to creating consensus Envs from each HIV clade and subsequently creating a consensus of those clades. The ConEnv consensus sequence was then examined by phylogenetic comparison with these control consensus sequences, the Env sequences involved in ConEnv construction, and sequences targeted as partner Envs for vaccine and challenge strains of this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004610-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The “consensus from all consensus” sequence was phylogenetically closely related to the ancestral Env (EV0) emerging on the main ancestral root amongst the acute disease Env genes. ConEnv shared the same ancestral root as the EV6 strain, manifesting ancestrally between EV0 and EV6. Genetic distance calculations demonstrated the ConEnv gp90 sequence was 4%, 6%, and 11% divergent from the EV0, EV6, and EV13 strains, respectively. The majority of the disparate residues occurred within the designated variable regions, specifically V3 through V7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004610-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Hence, the ConEnv sequence was a strong consensus sequence representative of the 90 isolates, capturing epitopes broadly characteristic of the family of EIAV isolates.</p>

<title>Functional replication assessment and characterization of the consensus Env</title>
<p>To fully assess the competency of the ConEnv protein to function indistinguishably from a naturally occurring Env protein, ConEnv was evaluated in the context of both attenuated and pathogenic EIAV proviruses. Commercially synthesized ConEnv was cloned into the attenuated EIAV<sub>D9</sub> backbone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo7">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo8">[32]</xref> and the pathogenic EIAV<sub>UK3</sub> backbone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Cook1">[45]</xref>, with the resultant proviral strains termed ConD9, and EVCon, respectively. Attenuated and pathogenic proviral clones were sequenced to verify the ConEnv gene, and then transfected into equine dermal (ED) cells for production of infectious virus stocks. Virus stocks were titered and characterized for <italic>in vitro</italic> replication kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo12">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Li2">[48]</xref>. Both proviral strains, EVCon (pathogenic) and ConD9 (attenuated) demonstrated typical <italic>in vitro</italic> kinetics, emulating their parental and variant strain counterparts, and peaked in virus production at approximately ten DPI.</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic> analysis of the proviral pathogenic and attenuated ConEnv strains, by experimental infections of equids, confirmed characteristic EIAV clinical and virological profiles of both pathogenic and attenuated infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004610-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Typical attenuated and avirulent replication properties were observed for the ConD9 strain. Low level, viral replication kinetics (averaging between 10<sup>2</sup>–10<sup>3</sup> copies RNA/ml) which failed to progress to clinical disease over a 100 day observation period were observed. Conversely, pathogenesis and virulence, characterized by standard viremic replication kinetics (averaging between10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>4</sup> copies RNA/ml and peaking at 10<sup>6</sup> copies RNA/ml), including the induction of acute, and progression to chronic disease were observed with the EVCon strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Montelaro1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Leroux2">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Lichtenstein1">[49]</xref>. Hence, for the first time, a synthetic consensus lentiviral Env was demonstrated to not only be fully functional in the context of replication competence <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, but also capable of inducing traditional and virulent lentiviral disease.</p>

<p>The final pre-vaccine trial evaluation was an assessment of ConEnv's immunogenicity. Assays of antibody responses elicited by EVCon, EV0, EV6, and EV13 experimental infections, with variant and consensus viruses, indicated primarily distinct neutralization phenotypes for the individual variant Envs; each variant virus was neutralized by immune serum from homologous virus infections, but not from heterologous virus infections, except for marginal neutralization of the EVCon strain by the EV0 heterologous serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004610-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). However, sera produced by the EVCon virus infections were capable of not only neutralizing its homologous strain, but also neutralized the EV0 and EV6 heterologous strains. Thus, these data demonstrate that the ConEnv was similar to EV0, EV6, and EV13 in replication and virulence properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo9">[34]</xref>, yet distinct in immune properties as a result of the defined Env sequence variation.

<title>Experimental vaccination and challenge</title>
<p>To directly evaluate the consensus Env as well as the general premise of centralized immunogens, we compared the consensus Env attenuated strain (ConD9) with an ancestral Env attenuated vaccine strain (EIAV<sub>D9</sub> or D9). Proficiency of the centralized immunogens was further scrutinized by inclusion of a third attenuated vaccine regimen. The third arm of the study, a polyvalent attenuated strain mixture, was chosen as the most rigorous match to the centralized immunogens. The polyvalent attenuated quasispecies was constructed utilizing the D9 backbone. A trivalent attenuated mixture was assembled with the D9 as one of three strains. The EV6 and EV13 Envs were cloned into the D9 backbone to create 6D9 and 13D9, respectively, the final two strains of the polyvalent mix. The polyvalent attenuated mixture, a 1∶1∶1 mix of D9, 6D9, and 13D9, otherwise termed TriD9, was tested <italic>in vivo</italic> for TCID<sub>50</sub> dosage verification in a group of eight ponies.</p>
<p>Twenty-four ponies of mixed age and gender were divided randomly into groups of eight animals and inoculated intravenously with two, 3×10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> doses of the ancestral D9 vaccine, the consensus ConD9 or polyvalent TriD9 vaccines, at four-week intervals.

<p>An engineered quasispecies challenge model, EV<sub>MX</sub>, was developed as a rigorous assessment of immune protection. Based on previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo5">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo9">[34]</xref>, equivalent (1∶1∶1) TCID<sub>50</sub> dosages of the virulent EV0, EV6, and EV13 strains combined to create the virulent, well-defined, swarm. Six months following the second vaccination, the immunized ponies were challenged intravenously every other day with three, 3×10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>, EV<sub>MX</sub> inoculations. A control group consisting of six EIAV-naïve ponies was also challenged with EV<sub>MX</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004610-g005">Figs. 5B</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004610-g007">7B</xref>). Analyses of vaccinate day of challenge (DOC) viral loads demonstrated all three attenuated viral regimens replicated to similar levels, averaging, over the seven month pre-challenge period, between 2×10<sup>3</sup> and 3×10<sup>3</sup> copies RNA/ml plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004610-g005">Figs. 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004610-g007">7</xref>). Despite these similarities in viral vaccine replication, however, trial groups displayed markedly different levels of EV<sub>MX</sub>-induced disease. Four ancestral D9, six consensus ConD9, and three polyvalent TriD9 animals displayed clinical signs of EIA disease during the observation period post challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004610-g005">Figs. 5A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004610-g007">7A</xref>). Chronic disease was observed in the majority of vaccinates that experienced initial acute disease. All six control animals of each variant virus challenge group developed clinical EIA disease, indicating 100% virulence of the quasispecies challenge under the current experimental infection conditions. DOC vaccine immune responses in all groups were also indicative of mature immune responses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1004610-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1004610-t002">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004610.s001">S1 Fig</xref>.).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The collective success of attenuated vaccine regimens makes it the ideal modality to rigorously test novel vaccine concepts. Previous work by our group and others have demonstrated attenuated vaccines to be an extremely useful tool for vaccine development, regardless of the potential for marketable advancement of the attenuated platform due to the safety concerns associated with HIV vaccines. Consequently, we resolved to examine the efficacy of centralized Env immunogens in our well-established EIAV attenuated vaccine model. Results presented here reveal, for the first time, a consensus Env in a fully replication-competent attenuated virus backbone that can confer protective efficacy against virulent virus challenge; however, it does not induce the highest level of protection as compared to ancestral or polyvalent vaccines.</p>
<p>A concept not articulated in most reports on centralized Env sequences are the specifics involved in the determination of the consensus sequence. Creation of an ideal consensus sequence requires careful consideration of various parameters. Our original attempts to construct a consensus gp90 gene focused on a more basic approach than what we utilized for the current study. Initial alignments were performed utilizing the three sequences that comprise the EV<sub>MX</sub> quasispecies challenge strain, EV0, EV6, and EV13 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Craigo9">[34]</xref>. Phylogenetic analysis of this consensus gp90 demonstrated that the consensus sequence was located high on the ancestral root and would not have represented a good consensus sequence as it was highly related to the ancestral, or EV0 gp90. Likewise, the “consensus of all consensus” method utilized in both the HIV and influenza fields <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Liao1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Gao1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Liao2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Eugene1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Mcburney1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Weaver2">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Giles4">[56]</xref> resulted in a gp90 sequence that phylogenetically was more related to early disease isolates on the ancestral root (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004610-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) than to the consensus gene generated from all 90 isolate sequences (nucleotide and amino acid). <italic>In</italic> vitro analysis of the virus constructed from the second-generation consensus gp90, assembled from the 90-isolate alignment and cloned into a proviral backbone, was found to infect equine cells, but was not fully replication competent. Therefore, if we were to analyze this Env in a single-round infection assay it would falsely appear to be fully functional. Hence, the 90-isolate sequence alignment was re-evaluated and a higher level of hand-editing performed, especially in the highly variable V3 region, prior to consensus generation. This thorough computational analysis and consideration of the consensus Env limited the potential sampling bias that obfuscates computational engineering of protein immunogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Gaschen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Kothe3">[57]</xref>. Likewise, our use of an actual ancestoral Env also reduced the potential sampling bias that is problematic to computationally constructed most recent common ancestors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Gaschen1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1004610-Kothe3">[57]</xref>. Additionally, in the absence of replication analysis and study in an attenuated model, the incapability of the consensus Env to functional naturally would not have been observed and a gp90 less representative of a fully functional Env would have been examined. Ultimately, this is the first successful construction of a consensus envelope lentivirus construct with full replication and virulence properties.</p>
<p>The highest protective efficacy against disease was observed in the polyvalent TriD9 vaccinates. Survival analysis revealed the polyvalent TriD9 disease curve was significantly different from the naïve controls and importantly, the consensus ConD9 curve. Considering the EV<sub>MX</sub> challenge quasispecies virus strain composition, the polyvalent TriD9 regimen displaying the highest levels of protective efficacy might be anticipated; however, the ancestral D9 vaccinates also protected to a higher degree than the consensus ConD9 vaccinates. Pre-challenge analysis of clinical and virological factors would not have predicted these results. All three attenuated vaccine regimens displayed similar levels of pre-challenge viral strain replication. Pre-trial evaluation of the capability to induce neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004610-g004">Fig. 4</xref>) indicated that the ConEnv produced a broader immune response than the ancestral gp90 (EV0/D9) and also the EV6 and EV13 gp90 proteins. Immune analysis of DOC responses did not reveal a direct correlation of protection. Neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses were not associated with protective efficacy. Although a significantly higher level of Env-specific antibodies were found in the polyvalent TriD9 vaccinates, the consensus ConD9 vaccinates, similarly, had a higher antibody response as compared to the ancestral D9. In the case of the consensus ConD9 vaccinates, immune response data is suggestive of potential issues related to the artificial nature of the consensus Env and its ability to induce broadly protective responses. Protection in all three vaccine groups could be due to anamnestic responses that could be related to conserved regions or conformational epitopes that allow for protective response in lieu of sequence identity. Although total antibody binding does not reveal directly correlative data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1004610.s001">S1 Fig</xref>.), mapping of the reactive epitopes will be key to determining if a region of the gp90 potentially conferred more protective responses. These studies are currently underway. A notable observation of the polyvalent TriD9 vaccinates was the delayed onset of disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1004610-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). The quasispecies challenge virus eventually broke through causing its first case of disease at the late time point of 81 days post-challenge. The nature of this break through is an interesting study of evolution: did the EV<sub>MX</sub> Env evolve at a faster rate than the polyvalent TriD9 and escape the protective immune responses or did recombination allow the escape. Current studies are being performed to enable future characterization of break-through febrile isolates.</p>
<p>As part of the current report we generated an engineered quasispecies challenge virus mix containing different degrees of Env variation. The majority of current lentiviral vaccine studies employ a single strain challenge model. Heterologous challenge models, while more rigorous than homologous challenge models, are commonly single viral strains. Data presented here indicate that more comprehensive challenge models, that include variable Env proteins, should be developed for the study of lentiviral vaccines to better test the vaccine modalities being investigated. The polyvalent TriD9 and EV<sub>MX</sub> vaccine and challenge strains were at their basic phenotype, a homologous pairing. However, the complexity of a pathogenic, diverse, challenge strain resulted in a notable difference and reduction in the protective efficacy as compared to previous studies where the vaccine and challenge strains were matched in their Env sequences. Improved challenge model development for animal lentiviral studies that comprehensively test protective efficacy are critical tools required for broadly protective vaccine development.</p>
<p>The studies presented here demonstrate definitively that polyvalent attenuated vaccine regimens have significantly higher levels of protection as compared to centralized immunogens. Although it is not possible with absolute confidence to extrapolate the results of vaccine studies in any single animal lentivirus system to other animal lentiviruses or to HIV, the data presented here certainly highlight the priority of ascertaining centralized immunogens on HIV vaccine efficacy in the context of higher animal models that include challenge studies which can inform on the true protective nature of the proposed immunogens.</p>
