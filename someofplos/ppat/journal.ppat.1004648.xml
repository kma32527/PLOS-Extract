<abstract>
<p>Chemokines have been shown to be effective bactericidal molecules against a variety of bacteria and fungi <italic>in vitro</italic>. These direct antimicrobial effects are independent of their chemotactic activities involving immunological receptors. However, the direct biological role that these proteins may play in host defense, particularly against intestinal pathogens, is poorly understood. Here, we show that CXCL9, an ELR- chemokine, exhibits direct antimicrobial activity against <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>, an attaching/effacing pathogen that infects the gut mucosa. Inhibition of this antimicrobial activity <italic>in vivo</italic> using anti-CXCL9 antibodies increases host susceptibility to <italic>C. rodentium</italic> infection with pronounced bacterial penetration into crypts, increased bacterial load, and worsened tissue pathology. Using Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> mice and CXCR3<sup>-/-</sup> mice, we demonstrate that the role for CXCL9 in protecting the gut mucosa is independent of an adaptive response or its immunological receptor, CXCR3. Finally, we provide evidence that phagocytes function in tandem with NK cells for robust CXCL9 responses to <italic>C. rodentium</italic>. These findings identify a novel role for the immune cell-derived CXCL9 chemokine in directing a protective antimicrobial response in the intestinal mucosa.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Host defense peptides are an essential part of the innate immune response to pathogens, particularly at mucosal surfaces. Some chemokines, previously known for their ability to recruit immune cells to a site of inflammation, have been identified to have direct antimicrobial activity <italic>in vitro</italic> against a variety of pathogens. Despite this, it was unknown whether chemokines play a role in protecting the gut mucosa against enteric pathogens, independent of their immunological receptors. Using a mouse model of enteric pathogen infection with both wild type mice and genetic knockouts, we showed that the chemokine CXCL9 has direct antimicrobial activity against pathogen infection. This antimicrobial activity prevented the invasion of bacteria into intestinal crypts, thus protecting the host from immunopathology. Neutralization of this CXCL9-dependent antimicrobial activity increased host susceptibility to infection, leading to bacterial penetration into intestinal crypts and increased tissue pathology. These data support the importance of a receptor-independent role for chemokines in host defense at mucosal surfaces and may offer alternative treatment strategies for infections, particularly in regards to organisms that are resistant to conventional antibiotics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The intestinal tract is a site of continuous interaction between host and microbe. Tight regulation of immune surveillance and activation maintains the integrity of this interface during non-infectious periods while preserving the ability to launch immediate action upon pathogen exposure. Chemokines are a vital component of this protective response, linking innate and adaptive immunity by activating and recruiting immune cells to infection sites [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Until recently, the function of these molecules was focused on their chemotactic activity induced upon interaction with their receptors on various immune cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, mounting evidence has shown a direct antimicrobial function for a number of chemokines that relates to their cationic surface properties, similar to antimicrobial host defense peptides [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Host defense peptides (or antimicrobial peptides), are produced by a wide variety of cell types and form an important component of innate host defenses [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although the exact bactericidal mechanism for cationic antimicrobial peptides remains debated [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], membrane-disrupting activity appears to be a common feature, facilitated by cationic charge distribution and amphipathicity allowing for attachment to and insertion into bacterial membranes. In mammals, antimicrobial peptides help protect the gut mucosae from infection and maintain intestinal homeostasis [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the chemokine CXCL9 has potent bactericidal activity against <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, and <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], likely related to a cationic C-terminal domain resembling well characterized antimicrobial peptides [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Additionally, antimicrobial activity of CXCL9 appears to play a key role in protection of mucosal surfaces against pathogen infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, outside of its role in T cell homing and activation, a potential role for CXCL9 in conferring antimicrobial protection of the gut mucosae against intestinal infections has not been investigated.</p>
<p><italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> is an intestinal pathogen of mice used to model infections with the attaching and effacing (A/E) human pathogens, enteropathogenic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and enterohemorrhagic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> colonizes the cecum prior to traversing to the primary site of infection in the distal colon. Like other A/E pathogens, <italic>Citrobacter</italic> forms intimate attachments with the epithelial surface in the cecum and colon by using a type III secretion system and effectors that it injects into the host’s intestinal epithelial cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The host response to infection includes an early and robust chemokine response [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Infection clearance in resistant mice requires Th1 adaptive responses [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] mediated by the IFNγ-stimulated chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 acting in a CXCR3 dependent manner [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Interestingly, of all the ELR- chemokines, CXCL9 is the most highly expressed during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], suggesting that its role in protecting the host from this intestinal pathogen might be dominant. Previous work by our laboratory found that depletion of IFNγ-producing NK1.1+ CD3- cells reduced CXCL9 levels in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic>-infected gut, leading to increased host susceptibility to infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Whether this was solely related to T cell recruitment or additional antimicrobial activity was not known. Here, we uncover a direct antibacterial function for CXCL9 that protects intestinal crypts from bacterial infiltration.</p>

<title>CXCL9 directs <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> killing <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>ELR- chemokines have an emerging role as potent antimicrobial agents, owing to their cationic C-terminal domain rich in positively charged amino acids. Since the level of CXCL9 increases dramatically following <italic>Citrobacter</italic> infection of resistant mice [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], we first determined whether CXCL9 exerted antimicrobial activity against <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium in vitro</italic>. Treatment of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> with CXCL9 resulted in a dose-dependent bacterial killing, as measured by viable colony counts of residual survivors (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). Exposure to CXCL9 at ∼4 μg/ml (270 nM) resulted in 100% killing, and 85% killing at ∼0.4 μg/ml (27 nM). This concentration is biologically relevant as CXCL9 levels in rectal perfusions from the inflamed human intestine can reach up to 2 μg/ml (138 nM) [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Time-kill curves showed that killing was rapid, reaching near maximal effect at ∼5 min post-exposure to 27 nM CXCL9 (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). Importantly, in addition to antimicrobial action against the mouse pathogen <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic>, we also observed similar susceptibility of human pathogens, EHEC and EPEC to CXCL9-directed bacterial killing (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Many host-adapted pathogens have evolved resistance to antimicrobial peptides through LPS modifications controlled by the two-component system PhoP-PhoQ [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To determine whether residual survival of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> following treatment with lower doses of CXCL9 was PhoP-PhoQ dependent, we treated wild type bacteria and a <italic>phoPQ</italic> deletion mutant with a concentration of CXCL9 that produced ∼10–20% survival of wild type bacteria, and measured viable bacteria after 1–2 h. The Δ<italic>phoPQ</italic> strain was more susceptible to CXCL9, with only 1–2% residual survivors, similar to a peptide-sensitive strain of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. A similar result was seen using the human α-defensin, HD5, an abundant defense molecule produced by Paneth cells in the gut (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>). Interestingly, we found that a 1000-fold lower molar concentration of CXCL9 could elicit similar killing when compared with HD5. To confirm that this killing was directly linked to CXCL9, we performed killing assays in the presence of purified anti-CXCL9 antibody or control IgG. Whereas CXCL9 killed ∼100% of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic>, this activity was completely blocked by anti-CXCL9 antibody but not an IgG control (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref></bold>). Antimicrobial peptides like polymyxin B kill bacteria by inducing membrane permeability [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which can be measured by a fluorescence increase following membrane incorporation of the neutral hydrophobic molecule 1-anilino-8-naphthalene-sulfonate (ANS) [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Indeed, injection of polymyxin B into a culture of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> led to an immediate increase in ANS fluorescence (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref></bold>). To better understand how CXCL9 might exert its antimicrobial activity, we measured ANS fluorescence following CXCL9 injection into <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> culture. An increase in fluorescence, which occurs when ANS partitions into exposed membrane, was observed on a similar time scale and magnitude upon injection of CXCL9 as that seen with polymyxin B (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref></bold>). Together, these data established a direct antimicrobial activity for CXCL9 on <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> in a manner consistent with membrane disruption, similar to classic antimicrobial peptides.</p>

<title>CXCL9 increases host survival and decreases <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> burden <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Previous work investigating the role of CXCL9 in the gut has focused solely upon its chemotactic properties. However our <italic>in vitro</italic> results suggested that CXCL9 might have biological significance as a direct antimicrobial molecule. To investigate this, we first measured the levels of CXCL9 in the gut following <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infection by ELISA. CXCL9 was readily detectable in a variety of tissue samples, including fecal pellets, rectal perfusions, scrapings of the colonic mucosae, and in total homogenized colon samples (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig.</xref></bold>). Next, we depleted CXCL9 in Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> mice infected with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> and monitored host survival and bacterial load. Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> mice were used in order to study the protective effect of CXCL9 independent of its ability to recruit T cells. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic>-infected mice depleted of CXCL9 died, on average, 2 days earlier than mice receiving IgG control. This was significant, and specific to CXCL9 depletion, as depletion of another antimicrobial ELR- chemokine, CXCL10, had no effect on host mortality over 10 days (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). This difference between CXCL9 and CXCL10 in affecting disease severity may be due to the differential expression of the two chemokines, where CXCL9 is expressed at much higher levels in the infected colon, suggesting a more dominant role [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In line with these data, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> burden was 10–100 times higher in the fecal output from CXCL9-depleted mice compared to controls over the 10-day infection period (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>). In order to confirm that anti-CXCL9 antibodies were reaching the lumen of the gut, we measured IgG levels in fecal samples following intraperitoneal delivery of anti-CXCL9 antibody or control IgG into uninfected Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> mice and showed an IgG accumulation in the feces (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig.</xref></bold>). As a secondary biological readout for CXCL9 depletion, we measured the number of infiltrating CD3+ cells in the distal colon 10 days after <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infection of immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice and in mice depleted of CXCL9. As expected, in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic>-infected immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice depleted of CXCL9, there was a ∼75% reduction in the number of CD3+ cells in the distal colon (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C–D Fig.</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To investigate the impact of CXCL9 depletion on disease severity, we examined the gross pathology of the gut during necropsy. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic>-infected mice depleted of CXCL9 had (<italic>i</italic>) increased evidence of colitis in the cecum, which was shrunken and partially emptied; (<italic>ii</italic>) shortening and thickening of the colon; (<italic>iii</italic>) increased incidence of watery stool; and (<italic>iv</italic>) hematomas along the length of the cecum and colon (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>).

These results were independent of significant differences in the levels of TNFα, IFNγ, IL12p40, or IL-10 in colonic explants on day 10 post-infection, which were all similar in control mice and mice depleted of CXCL9 (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig.</xref></bold>).

<p>The gross pathological differences in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic>-infected mice upon CXCL9 depletion suggested a worsened immunopathological response to infection, which correlated with increased bacterial load. Since the pathologic impact on the host can be affected by less than a log-change in peak <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> load [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], we scored colonic histopathology on day 10 in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic>-infected control mice and animals depleted of CXCL9. CXCL9 depletion was associated with increased numbers of sloughed epithelial cells in the lumen and immune cell infiltration, with destruction of the epithelial architecture (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>). These changes resulted in significantly greater transmural pathology in the colon (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>). Similar findings were observed for cecal pathology upon <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infection of CXCL9-depleted mice, with a more pronounced pathology in the mucosa and submucosa regions of depleted animals (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig.</xref></bold>). In a typical <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infection, the bacteria attach to the intestinal epithelium, but do not commonly penetrate deep into intestinal crypts [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

<p>CXCL9 is mainly dependent on IFNγ for its expression [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and IFNγ<sup>-/-</sup> mice have impaired resistance and greater pathology following <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infection similar to that seen in our CXCL9 depletion studies [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Given our results following infection of CXCL9-depleted mice, we hypothesized that IFNγ<sup>-/-</sup> mice would be similarly susceptible to crypt penetration by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> due to the attendant decrease in CXCL9 expression. We tested this by localizing <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> in colonic tissues of IFNγ<sup>-/-</sup> mice and C57BL/6 wild type controls by immunohistochemical staining. In these experiments, we found that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> was localized mainly to the epithelial surface in C57BL/6 mice, whereas bacteria were commonly found penetrating into colonic crypts of IFNγ<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E and 3F</xref></bold>).

<p>We examined the potential sources of IFNγ responsible for driving CXCL9 expression within DCs, and macrophages. It is well established that natural killer (NK) cells are an important early source of IFNγ, and previous work by our laboratory has shown that depletion of NK1.1+ cells, a common NK cell marker, in <italic>Citrobacter</italic>-infected mice results in decreased CXCL9 expression in the colon [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Unstimulated BMDM, BMDC, or NK cells did not express CXCL9. However, co-culture of BMDM and NK cells, or DCs and NK cells, lead to CXCL9 secretion that was dependent on the presence of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>). NK cells were important for maximal CXCL9 release as CXCL9 levels were reduced by ∼50% in the absence of NK cells. Interestingly, we observed that macrophages were far more capable at not only inducing their own expression of CXCL9 upon exposure to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic>, independent of NK cells, but also released more CXCL9 upon co-stimulation with either IFNγ and <italic>Citrobacter</italic>, or NK cells and <italic>Citrobacter</italic> in paired experiments directly comparing macrophages and inflammatory DC populations (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that macrophages are capable of producing IFNγ in a TLR signaling-dependent fashion [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Using NK cells isolated from wild type mice, or IFNγ<sup>-/-</sup> animals and BMDM derived from these mice, we measured the contribution IFNγ produced by macrophages and NK cells on CXCL9 release following <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> stimulation. We found that IFNγ expression by both NK cells and macrophages was critical for maximum CXCL9 release in the presence of heat-killed <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C and 5D</xref></bold>). Equivalent CXCL9 levels were released from <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic>-stimulated BMDM from wild type mice when NK cells were absent, or in the presence of IFNγ-deficient NK cells. These data indicated that the release of CXCL9 was dependent upon IFNγ expression by NK cells, and not other co-stimulatory, and/or NK cell-directed alternative cytokine expression mechanisms. Macrophage-derived IFNγ was also important for this response as release of CXCL9 was significantly reduced by ∼50–60% from macrophages unable to produce their own IFNγ (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref></bold>). This was further supported in experiments that showed CXCL9 release from <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic>-stimulated IFNγ<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages was significantly less than CXCL9 levels from wild type macrophages (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1004648.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref></bold>). Together, these data indicated that IFNγ produced by both NK cells and macrophages is necessary to achieve maximal CXCL9 expression in response to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The intestinal tract is an environment that requires a balanced set of immunological responses, capable of tolerating the host’s commensal microbiota, while remaining primed to respond to invasion by pathogenic bacteria. Early immune responses to pathogens are critical for controlling both bacterial burden, and disease pathology, which the host achieves through combined cellular and innate antimicrobial responses. Chemokines are an important facet to this host protection, by linking innate antimicrobial activity with cell homing to the site of infection. We found that CXCL9, a chemokine known previously as an important modulator of CXCR3-dependent cellular homing following <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infections, has an important additional function in innate antimicrobial defense of the gut. This antimicrobial activity is independent of the CXCR3 receptor, or other aspects of adaptive immunity, and helps to control bacterial burden while protecting intestinal crypts from pathogen invasion.</p>
<p>IFNγ<sup>-/-</sup> mice are more susceptible to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The basis for this was thought to be the loss an IFNγ-dependent antimicrobial factor expressed in the colon. Our results are consistent with CXCL9, a chemokine induced by IFNγ in combination with other microbial stimuli, as a likely mediator of host protection in IFNγ-competent hosts. Previous worked showed that p38α expression in T cells regulates host defense against <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This study revealed that T cells lacking p38α had a significant reduction in IFNγ production following <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infection, a decreased infiltration of inflammatory cells into the colon, and yet increased tissue damage, a result that could be linked to the increased invasion of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> in mice with p38α T cell deficiency. Interestingly, treatment of these mice with IFNγ restored host defenses against <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic>, leading to lessened tissue damage, and more importantly, normalization of the tissue-associated bacterial burden. While the authors attributed these findings to increased T cell homing to site of infection, an alternative or additional interpretation, given our current results, is the attendant increase in innate defense mediated by IFNγ-stimulated CXCL9 release.</p>
<p>The increased tissue damage resulting from loss of IFNγ, despite the blunted immune cell infiltration [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], is likely due to the pathogen itself gaining access to the privileged host niche within intestinal crypts. In a typical <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infection of resistant hosts, the host restricts the pathogen to the lumen or epithelial surface. However, depletion of CXCL9, or loss of IFNγ production allows for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> to penetrate deep within the crypts. A correlation between invasion of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> into crypts and increased host pathology has been observed in other studies [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and so protecting this niche against intestinal pathogens is a key function for the innate immune system.</p>
<p>Of note, we found that IFNγ<sup>-/-</sup> mice were capable of producing a modest, but non-protective level of CXCL9 in the colon following <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infection. Although CXCL9 production is typically considered to be dependent on IFNγ, an alternative induction pathway has been described macrophages involving IFNα/ signaling. For example, low-level expression of CXCL9 was described in IFNγ<sup>-/-</sup> mice following infection with vaccinia virus [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition, STAT1 activation by IFNα in primed macrophages also boosts CXCL9 expression [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The quantitative contribution of this IFNγ-independent production of CXCL9 on host protection, however, has not yet been defined.</p>
<p>In this work, we observed that macrophages exhibited greater capacity for CXCL9 expression in the presence of microbial stimuli, and/or IFNγ, compared to DCs. Previous observations attributed the greatest levels of CXCL9 transcript to CD11c+ DCs in the <italic>Citrobacter</italic>-infected colon [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However this study relied upon CD11b and CD11c markers to differentiate phagocytes, typical surface markers routinely used to identify DCs and macrophage populations. However, recently it has become clear that many markers previous attributed to a homogenous phagocyte populations, in particular CD11c and CD11b, are expressed on multiple cell types [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, further examination, and in particular direct cell staining for CXCL9 expression, is necessary to identify the population(s) essential for robust expression of this chemokine. In addition to DCs, various cell types have been found to express CXCL9, including epithelial cells, neutrophils, and macrophages [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Recently, staining for CXCL9-producing cells within the inflamed tonsils also revealed macrophages to be the predominate source of the chemokine [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Preliminary data from our laboratory has shown co-localization of CXCL9 expression with the F4/80 macrophage marker within the colon of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infected mice (data not shown). Given these data, macrophages appear to be a significant source of CXCL9 within the inflamed colon of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> infected mice, however the utility of current molecular tools to investigate the cellular sources of CXCL9 in the gut appear, in our hands, to be limited. This could potentially be overcome by directly labeling native CXCL9 in transgenic mice [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], however additional work is required.</p>
<p>Some host-adapted bacteria have evolved mechanisms of resistance towards antimicrobial host defense peptides through enzymatic cleavage-based mechanisms [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Evidence for bacterial resistance to the antibacterial activity of CXCL9 has also been observed, further implicating it as an innate host defense that can be a selectable target of resistance. For instance, the streptococcal inhibitor of complement (SIC) protein, secreted by <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, can inhibit the antimicrobial activity of the CXCL9 C-terminal domain [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. SufA from <italic>Finegoldia magna</italic> can also block the antimicrobial activity of CXCL9 by cleavage, while leaving its chemotactic activity intact [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> does not appear to have such intrinsic resistance mechanisms; however, it is possible that other host-derived mechanisms may play a role in certain infections. For example, interaction of <italic>Streptococcus dysgalactiae</italic> with human serum albumin blocks some CXCL9-directed killing activity [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Whether such a mechanism is relevant in intestinal infections is not known.</p>
<p>In summary, our data indicate that CXCL9 plays an important role in antimicrobial defense in the infected and inflamed gut. This activity, independent of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 or an adaptive immune response, protects the gut from crypt invasion by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> and the tissue damage that ensues. These data add to the growing body of evidence to support this chemokine as an innate antimicrobial defense molecule at mucosal surfaces.</p>

All animals were housed in a specific pathogen-free unit under Level 2 conditions at the Central Animal Facility at McMaster University. For all infections, mice received 2 x 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mL via orogastric gavage from an overnight culture of <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> (DBS100). For infections, bacteria were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in 10 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 0.9% NaCl. Bacterial burden was monitored at designated time points in feces throughout experiments. At day 10 post infection, mice were sacrificed, and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> burden was determined in the cecum and colon as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For antibody neutralization experiments, mice were given either 200 μg/mL rabbit anti-mouse CXCL9, or 200 μg/mL control rabbit IgG on day -1, 0, 1, and then every 3 days via intraperitoneal injection. All neutralization antibodies were column-purified from rabbit antisera, which was a kind gift from Dr. Cory Hogaboam (University of Michigan/Cedars-Sinai Medical Center).</p>

The <italic>phoPQ</italic> deletion was generated by Lambda Red mutagenesis according to published methods [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] using primers BRT151 (tta gcc gtc ctt ctg ccc cgg ctg ctg tcg gcc aaa aat gac ctc cat gtg tag gct gga gct gct tcg) and BRT152 (atg cgc gtt ctg gtt gtt gag gat aat gcg tta cta cgt cac cac ctg cat atg aat atc ctc ctt a). Stationary phase (16–18h) cultures were sub-cultured 1:50 in LB, and grown at 37°C with shaking until OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.5. Bacteria were pelleted, washed and resuspended in 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) to a concentration of 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mL. Killing was initiated by mixing bacteria with 50 μg/mL human α-defensin (HD5; Prospec), CXCL9 (0.39 μg/mL, or otherwise indicated concentration; Peprotech), or sterile water. Bacteria were incubated at room temperature for 2 h, unless otherwise indicated. Cultures were diluted 1:10 with PBS to quench killing, and viable bacterial counts were assessed on solid agar. All data was normalized to the water control and expressed as survival relative to time zero. For CXCL9 neutralization in the bacterial killing assays, 200 μg/mL antibody (or similarly diluted PBS) was pre-incubated with 5 μg/mL CXCL9 for 20 min prior to the assay.</p>

<title>ANS membrane permeability assay</title>
<p>To assess integrity of bacterial cellular membranes, the fluorescent probe, 8-anilino-1-naphthylenesulfonic acid (ANS; Sigma-Aldrich) was used according to previous published protocols [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In brief, stationary phase cultures of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> were sub-cultured 1:50 in LB, and grown at 37°C with shaking until OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.5. Bacteria were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in sterile 10 mM HEPES Buffer (pH 7.4), 5 μM carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP; Sigma Aldrich), and 5 mM glucose. Bacteria were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. For each sample, 93 μL of bacteria was added to each well of black, clear bottom, 96-well plate (Costar, Corning, Inc.) with 2 μL 3 mM ANS, and fluorescence was monitored on a Synergy HT microplate reader (BioTek) (excitation, 375nm; emission, 510nm). After 5 min, 10 μg/mL CXCL9, 10 μg/mL Polymyxin B (Sigma-Aldrich), or water control was injected and fluorescence was monitored for an additional 30 min.</p>

<title>Histochemical analysis</title>
<p>At 10 days post infection, segments of cecal tip or distal colon were collected and either fixed in buffered 10% formalin, or flash frozen in optimal cutting template compound (OCT; Sakura, Fisher). Segments were fixed for 72 h, paraffin-embedded, sectioned into 6 μm slices, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), anti-CD3 antibody (1:1000; Labvision), or anti-<italic>Citrobacter</italic> antibody (1:4000; Statens Serum Institute). H&amp;E sections were used for assessing pathology according to published scoring protocols [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. All fixed sections were visualized using a Leica microscope. A minimum of 6 views were analyzed for each sample. Evaluation of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> crypt invasion was determined through enumeration of bacterially penetrated crypts from 4–6 views per sample.

<title>CXCL9 quantification</title>
<p>At day 8 post infection, wild type C57BL/6 mice were euthanized, and CXCL9 levels were detected in various tissues. Rectal perfusions were performed with 0.5mL PBS with protease inhibitors (PBS-I, 10 mL PBS per 1 tablet complete Mini, EDTA free (Roche)). Colon was excised, flushed with 5 mL ice cold PBS, and then opened longitudinally. Mucus scrapings were performed by running a razor blade along the length of the open colon according to established protocols [<xref rid="ppat.1004648.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Collected scrapings were diluted 1:10 in PBS-I, and vortexed for 3 min. Remaining colonic tissue was placed in 0.5 mL PBS-I with a metal ball and homogenized in a Mixer Mill (Retsch). Fecal pellets were similarly homogenized in 0.5 mL PBS-I. Solid particulates from all homogenized samples were pelleted through centrifugation prior to addition to ELISA plate wells. CXCL9 was quantified using a Duoset murine CXCL9 ELISA (R&amp;D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>

<title>Cytokine and IgG quantification</title>
<p>At day 10 post infection, cecum and colon were removed, flushed of contents, and washed in ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4. Tissues were cut into 5 mm pieces, and placed in 1 mL RPMI, 50 μg/mL gentamicin. Tissues were incubated for 24 h at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Levels of CXCL9, IFNγ, TNFα, IL-12p40, and IL-10 were assessed using Duoset Quantikine murine ELISA kits (R&amp;D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. For IgG analysis of fecal pellet homogenate supernatants, fresh fecal pellets were collected on day 2 post final injection from naïve, uninfected animals receiving two injections of 200 μg/mL anti-CXCL9 antibody, control IgG, or PBS. Fecal pellets were homogenized as described above, and then centrifuged at 14,000 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min. Supernatants were collected, and frozen at -80°C until analysis. IgG ELISA was performed on samples by coating high-binding 96-well plates overnight at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit anti-IgG antibody (1:10,000; MP Bio). Plates were washed 3 times with PBS (pH 7.4), 0.05% Tween-20, and then blocked with PBS, 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed, and samples were added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. For each sample, a 1:2 dilution (in PBS, 1% BSA) was made, and 100 μL was added to each well. After incubation, the plate was again washed three times. Bound antibody was detected by addition of anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to HRP (1:10,000; GE Healthcare), and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Plates were washed, and developed with 100 μL solution A and B (R&amp;D Systems) for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μL 1N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Plates were read at 450 nm using a plate reader.</p>
