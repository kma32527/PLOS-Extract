<p><italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> is an important pathogen that causes food-borne gastroenteritis in humans. The type III secretion system encoded on chromosome 2 (T3SS2) plays a critical role in the enterotoxic activity of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>. Previous studies have demonstrated that T3SS2 induces actin stress fibers in various epithelial cell lines during infection. This stress fiber formation is strongly related to pathogenicity, but the mechanisms that underlie T3SS2-dependent actin stress fiber formation and the main effector have not been elucidated. In this study, we identified VopO as a critical T3SS2 effector protein that activates the RhoA-ROCK pathway, which is an essential pathway for the induction of the T3SS2-dependent stress fiber formation. We also determined that GEF-H1, a RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), directly binds VopO and is necessary for T3SS2-dependent stress fiber formation. The GEF-H1-binding activity of VopO via an alpha helix region correlated well with its stress fiber-inducing capacity. Furthermore, we showed that VopO is involved in the T3SS2-dependent disruption of the epithelial barrier. Thus, VopO hijacks the RhoA-ROCK pathway in a different manner compared with previously reported bacterial toxins and effectors that modulate the Rho GTPase signaling pathway.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Many bacterial pathogens manipulate the actin cytoskeleton of mammalian cells to establish pathogenesis via invasion, to evade killing by phagocytes, to disrupt a barrier function, and to induce inflammation caused by translocation type III secretion (T3S) effector proteins. We demonstrated that the T3S effector protein (VopO) of the enteric pathogen <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> induced robust actin stress fiber formation in infected host cells. Furthermore, this actin rearrangement induced barrier disruption in a colon epithelial cell line. Although many types of effector proteins have been reported, VopO does not share homology with previously reported effector proteins, and no putative functional motifs could be identified. Finally, we determined that the direct binding of VopO to a RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) is a key step in the induction of stress fiber formation. These findings indicate that VopO plays a unique role in the pathogenicity of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> is a Gram-negative halophilic bacterium that causes acute gastroenteritis in humans after the consumption of contaminated raw or undercooked seafood. The emergence of pandemic strains poses a worldwide health threat [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> possesses two type III secretion systems (T3SSs): T3SS1 and T3SS2 [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A T3SS is a multisubunit molecular system that delivers bacterial proteins known as effectors directly to the plasma membrane or into the cytoplasm of infected host cells. The translocated effectors then modify certain functions of the host cell by disrupting normal cell signaling processes [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p>
<p>T3SS2, which is encoded on chromosome 2, is a major contributor to the enterotoxic effects observed in several animal models [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The T3SS2-related gene cluster is encoded in an 80-kb pathogenicity island (Vp-PAI), which is conserved exclusively in pathogenic strains [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recently, we demonstrated that the F-actin binding T3SS2 effector VopV is necessary for enterotoxicity [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. During the identification of VopV, we identified several candidate effector genes that are encoded in the Vp-PAI region, but their roles in the pathogenicity of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> remain unknown. Consequently, the precise pathogenic mechanisms underlying <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> infections are not fully understood.</p>
<p>Many bacterial pathogens manipulate the actin cytoskeleton of the host cell using diverse mechanisms during infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Tissue culture analysis has shown that <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> T3SS2 causes two dramatic changes in the actin cytoskeleton: the accumulation of F-actin beneath bacterial microcolonies and the induction of actin stress fibers [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. At least three T3SS2 effectors, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., VopV, VopL, and VopC, have been identified as actin cytoskeleton modification effectors. VopV exhibits an F-actin binding activity and is responsible for the F-actin accumulation phenotype [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. VopL contains three Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein homology 2 (WH2) motifs, and it elicits an Arp2/3-independent actin nucleation activity and the induction of actin stress fiber formation when expressed in host cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, Liverman <italic>et al</italic>. reported that <italic>vopL</italic> deficiency only resulted in modest reductions in the amount of stress fibers formed during infection, thereby suggesting that effector(s) other than VopL may contribute to this activity during <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> infection.</p>
<p>Recently, we identified VopC, which deamidates Rac1 and Cdc42, and it is homologous to a cytotoxic necrotizing factor of uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. We found that this effector is involved in the T3SS2-dependent formation of actin stress fibers via the activation of Rac1 [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the absence of VopC, <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> induces the formation of long, branched, and curved F-actin filaments instead of actin stress fibers in Caco-2 cells. This cytoskeletal modification is completely dependent on T3SS2. In addition, the activation of Rac1 alone is not sufficient to induce stress fiber formation in the absence of bacterial infection. These observations suggest that the formation of complete stress fibers by <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> requires the coordinated action of VopC with other T3SS2 effector(s).</p>
<p>In this study, we identified a novel actin cytoskeleton-manipulating T3SS2 effector called VopO. VopO induces a high level of stress fiber formation in the host cell by activating the RhoA-ROCK pathway. We also determined that VopO binds directly to GEF-H1, a RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), and that the GEF-H1-binding activity of VopO is correlated with its stress fiber formation activity. In addition, VopO-dependent stress fiber formation disrupts the epithelial barrier <italic>in vitro</italic>, as observed previously <italic>in vivo</italic> in infected intestinal tissue [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A number of bacterial toxins and effectors that activate or inactivate small GTPases via the direct modification or mimicry of GEFs or GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) have been identified [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], but this is the first report of an effector or a toxin that activates GEFs via direct binding. Overall, these results suggest that VopO is a novel effector with a different mode of action compared with previously reported effectors and toxins that modulate the Rho GTPase signaling pathway.</p>

<title>The RhoA-ROCK pathway is essential for T3SS2-dependent stress fiber formation</title>
<p>Previous studies have revealed that two effectors, VopC and VopL, are involved in T3SS2-dependent actin stress fiber formation. Recently, we demonstrated that VopC deamidates and activates Rac1 in infected cells and promotes stress fiber assembly. However, in contrast to a T3SS2-deficient mutant, the <italic>vopC</italic> deletion mutant still induces the formation of long, branched, and curved F-actin filaments in Caco-2 cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. VopL has been reported to contribute to F-actin stress fiber formation [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, we first investigated whether the induction of T3SS2-dependent stress fibers in HeLa and Caco-2 cells is completely dependent on VopL (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A, B Fig</xref>.).</p>
<p>In agreement with the results of a previous study [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], in both cell types, we observed that the formation of actin stress fibers was somewhat attenuated after infection with a <italic>vopL</italic>-deficient strain (POR-2<italic>∆vopL</italic>) compared with the formation resulting from infection with the parent strain (POR-2). However, stress fibers were still observed in POR-2<italic>∆vopL</italic>-infected cells, whereas no fibers were observed after infection with a T3SS2-deficient strain (POR-2<italic>∆vcrD2</italic>) or in an uninfected control, suggesting that an unidentified effector is essential for stress fiber formation. The small GTPase RhoA and its downstream effector Rho-associated kinase are major mediators of stress fiber formation [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). GTP binding and hydrolysis induce the conversion of RhoA between GTP-bound (active) and GDP-bound (inactive) forms [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The conversion of GTPases from an inactive to an active state is mediated by GEFs. Activated RhoA then propagates downstream signaling by binding to effector proteins such as ROCK. Activated ROCK leads to the formation of contractile bundles of F-actin via the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, to determine whether the RhoA-ROCK pathway is required for T3SS2-dependent stress fiber formation, we employed a ROCK inhibitor (Y27632) and a Rho inhibitor (Rho inhibitor I, a permeable C3 exoenzyme from <italic>Clostridium botulinum</italic> that inhibits RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC in living cells). Treatment with either the ROCK inhibitor or the Rho inhibitor completely abolished the POR-2-induced formation of stress fibers (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.g001" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1B and 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>We also examined the requirement for RhoA in stress fiber formation by silencing RhoA using siRNA (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). RhoA knockdown reduced the stress fiber formation induced by POR-2 infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), indicating that the RhoA-ROCK pathway is essential for T3SS2-dependent stress fiber formation. The T3SS2 effector VopC selectively deamidates and activates Rac1 and CDC42, but not RhoA, in infected cells both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. VopL binds directly to actin and enhances actin filament assembly <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This activity of VopL does not require any Rho GTPases. Furthermore, there are no previous reports of T3SS2 effectors activating RhoA. Overall, these results strongly indicate the existence of an unidentified T3SS2 effector that activates the RhoA-ROCK pathway, thereby inducing stress fiber formation.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Identification of the stress fiber-inducing T3SS2 effector, VopO</title>
<p>Next, we aimed to identify the effector responsible for T3SS2-dependent stress fiber formation. After screening candidate ORFs encoded within the Vp-PAI region, a known pathogenicity island in pathogenic strains [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we observed that deletion of the <italic>vopO</italic> gene (<italic>vpa1329</italic>: Gene ID 1192024) caused a dramatic change in actin stress fiber formation. Stress fibers were not detected when a <italic>vopO</italic>-deficient strain (POR-2<italic>∆vopO</italic>) was used to infect either HeLa cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) or Caco-2 cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>.). The lack of stress fiber induction when cells were infected with the POR-2<italic>∆vopO</italic> strain was rescued by <italic>in trans</italic> complementation with the <italic>vopO</italic> gene (POR-2<italic>∆vopO/pvopO</italic>). Immunoblotting analysis using anti-VopO antibodies revealed that VopO is specifically secreted into the culture medium via T3SS2 (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>.). Deletion of the <italic>vopO</italic> gene had no effect on the secretion of T3SS2 translocon proteins (VopB2 and VopD2) [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the secretion of effector proteins involved in stress fiber formation (VopL and VopC) [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>.), or T3SS2-dependent cytotoxicity against Caco-2 cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which is a characteristic effect of T3SS2 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig</xref>.).</p>

Interestingly, VopO was involved in the T3SS2-mediated cell invasion phenotype, which was recently identified as a phenotype with VopC activity (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2D Fig</xref>.) [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These observations indicate that VopO is not required for the full secretory function of T3SS2 (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>), thereby suggesting that VopO is a T3SS2 effector involved in the induction of stress fiber formation and the invasive activity of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>.</p>
<p>We then examined whether VopO is involved in the activation of the RhoA-ROCK pathway. As a positive control in the subsequent assays, we used nocodazole, a microtubule destabilizer that induces stress fiber formation via the activation of RhoA [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As shown in <xref rid="ppat.1004694.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, RhoA activation by the parent strain (POR-2) was significantly higher than that induced by either its T3SS2-deficient derivative (POR-2<italic>∆vcrD2</italic>) or an uninfected control. However, the level of RhoA activation was significantly lower in cells infected with the <italic>vopO</italic>-deficient strain (<italic>∆vopO</italic>) than that in cells infected with the POR-2<italic>∆vcrD2</italic> strain or in uninfected control cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). This result suggests that balance of the Rho GTPase activation shifted from RhoA to Rac1 and Cdc42 because of activation via the other T3SS2 effector, VopC, which directly activates both Rac1 and Cdc42 [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Similar results were obtained by determining the amount of phosphorylated MLC (pMLC) (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The amount of pMLC increased in a functional T3SS2-dependent manner. However, the amount of pMLC was lower in POR-2<italic>∆vopO</italic>-infected cells than that in cells infected with the POR-2<italic>∆vcrD2</italic> strain or uninfected control cells. These results suggest that VopO has an important role in the T3SS2-dependent activation of the RhoA-ROCK pathway in infected cells.</p>
<p>Next, we used a transfection assay to determine whether VopO itself activates the RhoA-ROCK pathway and subsequently induces stress fiber formation. Both GTP-bound RhoA (GTP-RhoA, the active form of RhoA, <xref rid="ppat.1004694.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) and pMLC (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>) increased significantly when GFP-fused VopO was transiently expressed in HeLa cells. Moreover, the activation of RhoA and the augmentation of pMLC in GFP-VopO-expressing cells coincided with the formation of thick and massive actin fibers at the site of GFP-VopO protein localization (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>, arrowheads). These findings indicate that VopO alone can activate the RhoA-ROCK pathway and induce stress fiber formation.</p>

<title>GEF-H1, a VopO binding partner, is required for VopO-induced stress fiber formation</title>
<p>We demonstrated the importance of the RhoA-ROCK pathway in VopO-dependent stress fiber induction. The transition of a small GTPase from an inactive to an active state is mediated by GEFs (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Sixty-nine types of Rho GEFs have been reported previously [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], some of which contribute to the activation of RhoA [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We observed that T3SS2-dependent stress fiber formation was also blocked in dominant-negative RhoA-expressing cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>.). Therefore, we hypothesized that VopO may interact with at least one molecule located upstream of RhoA. A T3S effector EspG of enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EPEC) induces stress fiber formation and is mediated by GEF-H1 activation [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. GEF-H1 (Lfc in humans), which is a microtubule-regulated Rho GEF, plays a dominant role in RhoA activation [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This information let us to hypothesize that VopO might associate with GEF-H1 to induce the stress fiber. To test this hypothesis, we performed a pull-down assay using purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused VopO (GST-VopO) and a HeLa cell lysate. We observed that GEF-H1 coprecipitated with GST-VopO. By contrast, two other RhoA GEFs, LARG and Ect2 [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], did not interact strongly with VopO (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Interactions were not detected between VopO and RhoA or β-actin. Thus, we confirmed the direct binding of VopO with the recombinant full-length GEF-H1 protein, which was prepared using an <italic>in vitro</italic> translation system.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref rid="ppat.1004694.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, the full-length GEF-H1 protein coprecipitated with GST-VopO. GEF-H1 contains four domains: a zinc-finger motif-containing region (Zn), dbl-homology (DH), pleckstrin homology (PH), and α-helical coiled-coil (CC) domains (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The DH and PH domains are conserved in the Rho GEF family and are required for its GEF activity [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. By contrast, the Zn and CC domains are unique to GEF-H1 and they are involved in the regulation of GEF-H1 activity [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, we used a pull-down assay to identify GEF-H1 domains that contribute to the binding activity to VopO (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). An N-terminally truncated GEF-H1 (∆N) protein retained relatively weak binding activity with VopO, whereas all of the truncated proteins lost their ability to bind to VopO. Because we could not identify a specific VopO-binding domain in GEF-H1, we hypothesize that VopO might specifically recognize the higher-order structure of GEF-H1. We then assessed the requirement for GEF-H1 in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus-</italic>induced stress fiber formation using siRNA. As shown in <xref rid="ppat.1004694.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, no changes in stress fibers were observed when the RhoA GEFs LARG and Ect2 were silenced. By contrast, cells in which only GEF-H1 was silenced exhibited diminished stress fiber formation. Overall, these findings suggest that VopO may target GEF-H1 to induce stress fiber formation. We explored this possibility in the following experiments.</p>

<title>A predicted α-Helix region (H2) in VopO is required for GEF-H1 binding and stress fiber formation</title>
<p>VopO does not share any motifs or any sequence homology with known proteins; however, the Chou-Fasman secondary structure prediction program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cib.cf.ocha.ac.jp/bitool/MIX/" xlink:type="simple">http://cib.cf.ocha.ac.jp/bitool/MIX/</ext-link>) revealed that VopO possesses at least four α-helix regions: H1, H2, H3, and H4 (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>.).

<p>Next, we used cell transfection to evaluate the stress fiber formation activity of these truncated VopO proteins (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). The stress fibers of ∆H1-expressing cells were somewhat weaker than those of the full-length VopO-expressing cells (Figs. <xref rid="ppat.1004694.g002" ref-type="fig">2F</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004694.g004" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>).

In <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-infected cells, the stress fiber-inducing activity of the POR-2<italic>∆vopO</italic> strain was restored completely or partially by complementation with full-length or ∆H1 VopO, respectively (Figs. <xref rid="ppat.1004694.g002" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004694.g004" ref-type="fig">4D</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004694.g004" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>).

Several T3SS effectors, such as EspG, EspG2, and Orf3 from EPEC, release and activate GEF-H1 by disrupting the host microtubule network following stress fiber induction in infected host cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, we explored the possibility that VopO might disrupt the microtubule structure. The transient expression of DsRed-fused VopO in cells induced stress fibers (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A Fig</xref>.) but did not induce the destruction of the microtubule network that is observed during transient EspG expression in host cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B Fig</xref>.) [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

Furthermore, although microtubule disruption is reported to be EspG-dependent in cells infected with EPEC [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], VopO-dependent microtubule disruption was not observed in <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>-infected cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5D Fig</xref>.). Taken together, these results indicate that GEF-H1 is a primary target of VopO during the induction of stress fiber formation. However, the mechanism that allows VopO to activate GEF-H1 is different from that reported for microtubule-destabilizing T3S effectors.</p>

<p>The integrity of the epithelial barrier was evaluated by measuring the trans-epithelial resistance (TER) of polarized Caco-2 cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>T3SS2, which is encoded in Vp-PAI on chromosome 2 of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, is essential for enterotoxicity in several animal models, thereby indicating that it is involved in the pathogenicity of this bacterium [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recently, we identified VopV as an enterotoxic T3SS2 effector in a rabbit loop assay [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the Vp-PAI region encodes many hypothetical ORFs whose biological activities and roles in virulence are not fully understood. In the present study, we determined that a functionally undetermined ORF encoded by Vp-PAI, VPA1329 (VopO), is a novel T3SS2 effector of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, which participates in disrupting the host epithelial barrier by inducing stress fiber formation.</p>
<p>During infection, bacterial pathogens use diverse mechanisms to manipulate the actin cytoskeleton of host cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>, T3SS2 has been reported to induce the accumulation of F-actin beneath bacterial microcolonies and the formation of actin stress fibers within infected host cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this and previous studies, we have demonstrated that at least three T3SS2 effectors, VopO, VopL, and VopC, are involved in T3SS2-dependent stress fiber formation [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although VopL induces stress fiber formation in transfected cells, it is not essential for this process (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A, B Fig</xref>.) [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, the actin filament assembly-enhancing activity of VopL, dose not require any Rho GTPases. A <italic>vopC-</italic>deficient strain caused the formation of long, branched, and curved F-actin filaments with a reticular appearance; these fibers were not observed in cells infected with a T3SS2-deficient strain (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>.) [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The expression of a constitutively active form of Rac1 restored the strain’s capacity to induce normal stress fiber formation. VopO activation of the RhoA-ROCK pathway via GEF-H1 binding is essential for stress fiber formation.</p>
<p>These observations indicate that activation of the RhoA-ROCK pathway by VopO is a requisite first step in the induction of stress fiber formation. The activity of VopL, which nucleates actin filaments, appears to enhance the efficiency of stress fiber formation. Stress fibers are contractile acto-myosin structures, which are attached to focal adhesions at both ends of the fiber. The focal complexes formed in lamellipodia are triggered by Rac1 activation [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Rac1-null primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts cannot form focal adhesion complexes or induce RhoA-regulated actin stress fiber formation [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A <italic>vopC</italic> deletion mutant lacks the ability to induce vinculin foci [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The focal complexes formed by VopC-activated Rac1 may be converted into focal adhesions, and this signaling cascade is necessary for the formation of robust actin stress fibers.</p>
<p>Stress fiber formation plays a role in the maintenance of the epithelial barrier against both pathogen invasion and commensal microbiota [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Inappropriate induction of stress fibers disrupts tight junctions and leads to several diseases [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A recent <italic>in vivo</italic> study demonstrated that <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> disrupts the tight junction complex of small intestinal epithelial cells prior to inducing diarrhea in an infant rabbit oral infection model [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The involvement of VopO in this phenomenon was difficult to determine using a rabbit ileal loop test <italic>in vivo</italic>; however, based on TER measurements and FITC-dextran leakage assays, we detected VopO-dependent disruption of the epithelial barrier (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.g005" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5A and 5B</xref>). These results suggest that VopO is closely involved in the disruption of tight junction complexes, which is consistent with observations in the infant rabbit oral infection model.</p>
<p><italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> is usually considered to be a noninvasive bacterial pathogen, but several recent studies have demonstrated that this bacterium can invade epithelial cells, which depends on VopC before replicating in the cytosol of the host cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In the present study, we found that a <italic>vopO</italic> deficient strain also abolished T3SS2-dependent invasive phenotype (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2D Fig</xref>.). Consequently, we hypothesize that a fairly complex mechanism is required for T3SS2-dependent invasion because the invasive capacity of this bacterium is needed to activate Cdc42, but not Rac1 and RhoA [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and treatment with nocodazole, which disrupts microtubules and activates GEF-H1, inhibited the invasion of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> into HeLa and Caco-2 cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These observations indicate that, unlike VopO-dependent stress fiber formation, activation of the GEF-H1-mediated RhoA-ROCK pathway is not related to <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> cell invasion. Further studies are needed to understand how VopO promotes invasion by <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic>.</p>
<p>T3S effectors activate Rho family small GTPases in diverse ways. Some effectors share the common motif Trp-xxx-Glu (WxxxE) and functionally mimic GEFs [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], whereas other effectors belong to the deamidating toxin family, the members of which directly modify (via deamidation/transglutamination) Rho family small GTPases [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition to these effectors, EspG, EspG2, and Orf3 in EPEC disrupt the microtubule network, thereby resulting in the release and activation of GEF-H1 [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, VopO does not possess a WxxxE motif (or any type of functional motif), shares no sequence homology with these effectors, and does not disrupt microtubule structures in transfected or infected cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B, C, and D Fig</xref>.) [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, the deamidation of RhoA was not observed in cells infected with <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These results suggest that VopO hijacks the RhoA-ROCK pathway in a different manner compared with previously reported effectors and toxins.</p>
<p>In the present study, we clearly demonstrated that VopO binds directly to GEF-H1 and that the stress fiber-inducing activity of VopO was correlated with its GEF-H1 binding activity (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). GEF-H1 is a RhoA GEF, which is regulated by microtubule binding, phosphorylation, and protein-protein interactions [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The interaction between GEF-H1 and microtubules is particularly important for the suppression of GEF-H1 activation, where the unique N- and C-termini of GEF-H1 are responsible for its association with microtubules [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In a previous study, transient expression of either N- or C-terminal-truncated GEF-H1 resulted in higher GEF activity compared with the expression of full-length GEF-H1, thereby suggesting that these domains negatively regulate GEF activity via the DH and PH domains, which are required for the GEF activity of GEF-H1 [<xref rid="ppat.1004694.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Importantly, VopO binds to GEF-H1, which contains the C-terminal domain (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.g003" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3C and D</xref>), but the expression of DsRed-fused VopO did not induce obvious alterations in GFP-GEF-H1 localization according to microscopic analysis (<xref rid="ppat.1004694.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5C Fig</xref>.). In addition, we did not observe any VopO-mediated increase in the activity of GEF-H1 with RhoA according to an <italic>in vitro</italic> Rho GEF exchange assay using mant-GTP. Therefore, the biochemical mechanism that allows VopO to target GEF-H1 and how it coordinates with other <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> T3SS2 effectors during bacterial infection remain unclear. Further research is required to determine how VopO activates the RhoA-ROCK pathway via GEF-H1. A more detailed understanding of the functional mechanism of VopO may provide new insights into how pathogenic bacteria exploit the signaling pathways of Rho family small GTPases.</p>
