<abstract>
<p>Modulation of host cell function is vital for intracellular pathogens to survive and replicate within host cells. Most commonly, these pathogens utilize specialized secretion systems to inject substrates (also called effector proteins) that function as toxins within host cells. Since it would be detrimental for an intracellular pathogen to immediately kill its host cell, it is essential that secreted toxins be inactivated or degraded after they have served their purpose. The pathogen <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> represents an ideal system to study interactions between toxins as it survives within host cells for approximately a day and its Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system (T4SS) injects a vast number of toxins. Previously we reported that the Dot/Icm substrates SidE, SdeA, SdeB, and SdeC (known as the SidE family of effectors) are secreted into host cells, where they localize to the cytoplasmic face of the <italic>Legionella</italic> containing vacuole (LCV) in the early stages of infection. SidJ, another effector that is unrelated to the SidE family, is also encoded in the <italic>sdeC-sdeA</italic> locus. Interestingly, while over-expression of SidE family proteins in a wild type <italic>Legionella</italic> strain has no effect, we found that their over-expression in a ∆<italic>sidJ</italic> mutant completely inhibits intracellular growth of the strain. In addition, we found expression of SidE proteins is toxic in both yeast and mammalian HEK293 cells, but this toxicity can be suppressed by co-expression of SidJ, suggesting that SidJ may modulate the function of SidE family proteins. Finally, we were able to demonstrate both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> that SidJ acts on SidE proteins to mediate their disappearance from the LCV, thereby preventing lethal intoxication of host cells. Based on these findings, we propose that SidJ acts as a metaeffector to control the activity of other <italic>Legionella</italic> effectors.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>A key attribute of many pathogens is their ability to survive and replicate within eukaryotic host cells. One such pathogen, <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>, is able to grow within macrophages in the lungs, thereby causing a form of pneumonia called Legionnaires’ Disease. <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> causes disease by translocating several hundred proteins into the host cell. These proteins are typically referred to as ‘‘effectors’’, as they function as toxins to alter normal host cell function. However, since <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> remains within the host cells for approximately one day, continual poisoning of the eukaryotic cells by the bacterial effectors will result in the premature death of the host cell, thus restricting the growth of the pathogen. Previously the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> secreted protein LubX was described as a “metaeffector”, which has been defined as an effector that acts directly on another effector to modulate its function inside the host cell. LubX accomplishes this task by directing the degradation of another effector, SidH. Here we report a second <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> metaeffector, SidJ, acts in a similar manner to neutralize SidE family effectors by removing them from the intracellular compartment that contains the bacterium. This further establishes the concept of metaeffectors, which are likely to be critical to how <italic>Legionella</italic> and many other pathogens cause disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>, the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that can replicate within fresh water amoeba and mammalian alveolar macrophages [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> survives and replicates within host cells by inhibiting the host endocytic pathway and creating a novel replicative compartment designated as the <italic>Legionella</italic> containing vacuole (LCV) [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Alteration of host function is mediated by the injection of a large number of proteins into the host cell by the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS) [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, inactivation of individual (or even combinations of) Dot/Icm substrates in genetically engineered mutant strains rarely has a strong effect on the intracellular growth of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic>, consistent with extensive functional redundancy between effectors [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
<p>One notable exception to this generalization is the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> SuperΔP170 mutant, which exhibited a substantial growth defect in the amoebae <italic>Acanthamoeba castellanii</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The SuperΔP170 was constructed while studying a locus that encodes multiple Dot/Icm substrates [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and consists of two deletions: the first removes five adjacent genes (<italic>sdeC</italic>, <italic>lpg2154</italic>, <italic>sidJ</italic>, <italic>sdeB</italic>, and <italic>sdeA</italic>) and the second deletes the unlinked gene <italic>sidE</italic>. Four of the encoded proteins, SidE, SdeC, SdeB and SdeA, share extensive homology with each other and are all ∼170 kDa in size, thus they have been referred to as “P170s” [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, they are called the “SidE family”, as SidE was the founding member of this related group of proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The SidE proteins are Dot/Icm substrates that are translocated into the host cell and reside on the cytoplasmic face of the LCV (<italic>Legionella</italic> containing vacuole) [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], although their molecular function is not known. As the intracellular growth defect of the SuperΔP170 mutant could be complemented by expression of just one SidE family protein, SdeA, it was proposed that the SidE-like proteins were functionally redundant and the other two genes, <italic>lpg2154</italic> and <italic>sidJ</italic>, must be dispensable for growth within host cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, subsequently it was shown that inactivation of <italic>sidJ</italic> alone conferred an intracellular growth defect on <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], suggesting the situation is more complicated than initially perceived.</p>
<p>Consistent with this observation is the increasingly appreciated paradigm in pathogenesis that secreted effectors are often subjected to spatiotemporal regulation and that there can be a complex interplay between the functions of different effectors. For example, the <italic>Salmonella</italic> T3SS substrates SopE and SptP, which possess opposing biochemical activities, act at different stage of infection to first induce bacterial uptake and then to down-modulate this effect in order to prevent host cell death [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similarly, the <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> Dot/Icm T4SS effectors SidM/DrrA and LepB exhibit opposing functions. SidM/DrrA recruits and activates Rab1 to mediate fusion of ER microsomes with the LCV (<italic>Legionella</italic> containing vacuole). At later points, LepB inactivates Rab1 resulting in the removal of the GTPase from the LCV [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A third example is represented by the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> effectors SidH and LubX. SidH is a homolog of the effector SdhA, which is required to maintain the integrity of the LCV [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. LubX is a member of the U-box family of E3 ubiquitin ligases and functions as a metaeffector to inactivate SidH by promoting its proteolysis [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Due to their genetic proximity, the surprising phenotype of the Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> mutant, and the existing precedents of complex interplay between other <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> secreted substrates, we hypothesized that there may be a connection between the SidE proteins and SidJ. To test this hypothesis, we examined the phenotypes of a strain lacking just the four SidE proteins (Δ<italic>sdeC</italic> Δ<italic>sdeB</italic> Δ<italic>sdeA</italic> Δ<italic>sidE</italic>) and of an individual Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> mutant and discovered that overexpression of an individual SidE family protein in the absence of SidJ is toxic to host cells. This result, and the experiments that followed, have led to a model wherein SidJ functions as a metaeffector to regulate the activity of the SidE family of toxins.</p>

<p>To examine the connection between SidJ and the SidE family of proteins, we constructed two additional mutant strains. One mutant lacked only <italic>sidJ</italic> and the other mutant contained deletions in each of the four <italic>sidE</italic>-related genes, which we refer to as the “CleanΔP170” mutant. We then compared the intracellular replication properties of the Δ<italic>sidJ</italic>, the CleanΔP170, and the original SuperΔP170 mutant [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which does not express SidJ or any member of the SidE family. Growth was assayed by infecting the amoebae <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic> for various amounts of time, lysing the cells and determining the fold bacterial growth based on the number of CFUs (colony forming units). In this assay, a wild-type strain of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> was able to replicate greater than 1000-fold in forty-four hours whereas a T4SS-deficient strain, Lp03, was unable to grow (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In contrast, the CleanΔP170 strain exhibited a 100-fold growth defect similar to that previously observed for the SuperΔP170 mutant (Figs. <xref rid="ppat.1004695.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004695.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). Likewise, a strain lacking <italic>sidJ</italic> exhibited a similar intermediate intracellular replication deficiency (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The CleanΔP170 growth defect could be complemented by expression of just one SidE family protein, SdeA, consistent with the redundancy previously observed between members of this family (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As expected, the replication defect of the CleanΔP170 mutant could not be complemented by expression of SidJ from a plasmid as this strain already makes SidJ (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Similarly, the strain lacking <italic>sidJ</italic> could be complemented by expression of <italic>sidJ</italic>, but not by <italic>sdeA</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these data suggest that expression of SidJ and at least one member of the SidE family is required for virulence of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> within the environmental host <italic>A</italic>. <italic>castellanii</italic>. But this raised the question of how the original SuperΔP170 mutant strain, which is missing all four members of the SidE family and SidJ, could be fully complemented by expression of only SdeA (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig.</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We hypothesized that this discordance might be related to expression levels from the <italic>sdeA</italic> expression plasmid. However, the <italic>sdeA</italic> complementing clone, pJB3556, did not synthesize aberrant amounts of SdeA and instead made a similar amount to what is normally expressed in <italic>Legionella</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig.</xref>).</p>
<p>Although pJB3556 expresses the appropriate level of SdeA in a cell, it is worth noting that this represents only a portion of the total amount of SidE family proteins expressed in a wild type cell. Therefore, we assayed the effect of expressing higher amounts of SdeA from a new complementing clone, SdeA OP (SdeA “over production”) (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig.</xref>). Expression of SdeA from this new construct had no effect on the growth of the wild type strain Lp02 (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) or the CleanΔP170 mutant (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). On the other hand, over-expression of SdeA remarkably completely inhibited the growth of the Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> mutant to levels similar to that of the T4SS-deficient <italic>dotA</italic> mutant (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). This extent of inhibition was shared with the SuperΔP170 mutant, which also does not express SidJ (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig.</xref>). Thus, inhibition of replication by SdeA over-production occurs only in strains lacking <italic>sidJ</italic>. Interestingly, this inhibitory effect appears to be specific to <italic>Legionella</italic> virulence, as over-expression of SdeA in the Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> mutant results in increased mis-targeting of <italic>Legionella</italic> to a late endocytic/lysosomal compartment (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). In summary, the absence of either the SidE family or SidJ results in diminished growth of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> within amoebae. Furthermore, the partial growth defect of a Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> strain, but not of a wild type strain, can be exacerbated by the over-expression of SdeA, thus establishing a link between SidJ and the SidE family.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>SidJ and SdeA do not affect each other’s secretion into host cells</title>
<p>One possible connection between SidJ and SdeA is that they might modulate each other’s secretion into host cells. To test this hypothesis, we measured the export of the reporter proteins CyaA-SidJ and CyaA-SdeA in different genetic backgrounds. Successful export of <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> CyaA fusions into the host cell cytoplasm is measured by increased cAMP production, since this version of CyaA is activated when it is bound by eukaryotic calmodulin [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Expression of either CyaA-SidJ or CyaA-SdeA in the wild-type strain Lp02 generated a large increase in host cell cAMP as compared to expression in T4SS-deficient Lp03 cells, mock infected cells, or Lp02 expressing only CyaA (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig.</xref>). As previously observed [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], SdeA secretion was strongly dependent on the type IV adaptor IcmS whereas SidJ secretion was only partially dependent. However, export of SdeA was not affected by the absence of <italic>sidJ</italic> nor was SidJ secretion diminished in a strain that did not express any of the SidE family (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig.</xref>). Therefore, SidJ does not appear to regulate the secretion of SidE family members and SidE proteins do not affect the export of SidJ, suggesting that the molecular connection between SidJ and SidE family members likely occurs within host cells.</p>

<p>Since over-expression of SdeA is toxic to amoebae in the absence of SidJ, we chose to explore this phenomenon in more detail within the model eukaryote <italic>Saccharomyces cereviseae</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We began these yeast studies by expressing SdeA and SidJ under the control of the strong, regulated <italic>Pgal</italic> promoter. Yeast cells transformed with <italic>Pgal</italic> vectors carrying <italic>sdeA</italic> or <italic>sidJ</italic> were grown in the presence of glucose, diluted, and spotted onto selective media containing glucose (repressing conditions) or galactose (inducing conditions). Galactose-induced expression of either SdeA or SidJ was extremely toxic to yeast cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, rows 2–3) consistent with previous results [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. To further evaluate this toxicity, we expressed each protein at lower levels using the constitutively expressed, weak promoter <italic>Pcyc</italic>. Expression of <italic>sidJ</italic> under the weaker promoter had only a subtle effect on yeast (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, row 5) whereas it was not possible to construct a yeast strain harboring <italic>Pcyc</italic>-<italic>sdeA</italic>, presumably due to SdeA-mediated toxicity. Strikingly, expression of low amounts of SidJ (<italic>Pcyc</italic>-<italic>sidJ</italic>) was able to partially suppress the toxicity caused by expression of high amounts of SdeA (<italic>Pgal</italic>-<italic>sdeA</italic>) (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, row 7).</p>

<p>We then attempted to recapitulate this result in mammalian cells. Transient transfection of HEK293 cells for 40 hours with mCherry-SdeA resulted in the protein localizing in dense foci in ∼90% of the cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B and 2C</xref>). This result was specific to the SdeA fusion as expression of only mCherry resulted in diffuse, cytoplasmic staining. The longer mCherry-SdeA was expressed in cells, the more toxic it became eventually causing the cells to round up (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig.</xref>). In contrast, expression of YFP-SidJ was not toxic and the protein localized diffusely in the cytoplasm similar to YFP alone (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B and 2C</xref>). Remarkably, the accumulation and toxicity caused by mCherry-SdeA expression was suppressed by co-transfection with YFP-SidJ resulting in dispersal of mCherry-SdeA into smaller foci (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B and 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>To further examine SdeA toxicity in mammalian cells, mCherry-SdeA was expressed for a shorter amount of time (20 hours) and the cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using markers to detect the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, Golgi, endosome/lysosome, actin, and tubulin. Shorter expression of mCherry-SdeA only affected the Golgi resulting in its fragmentation (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-2E</xref>). In contrast, expression of mCherry alone, YFP alone, or YFP-SidJ had no effect on the Golgi. Similar to the redistribution of SdeA, YFP-SidJ was able to suppress the Golgi fragmentation caused by mCherry-SdeA (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D and 2E</xref>). In summary, SdeA expression was toxic to both yeast and mammalian cells and SdeA-toxicity could be suppressed by co-expression of SidJ, implying that SidJ may regulate SdeA function.</p>

<title>SidJ modulates SdeA localization on <italic>Legionella</italic> containing vacuoles</title>
<p>A number of Dot/Icm substrates localize to the outside of the <italic>Legionella</italic> containing vacuole (LCV) at various stages of infection, including members of the SidE family [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. For example, the substrate SidM/DrrA associates with the LCV early during infection but cannot be detected at later time points [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In contrast, the substrate LepB has limited association with the LCV at early points but displays increased co-localization over time. Similar to SidM/DrrA, SidE family proteins can be detected in proximity to the LCV early on but then disappear at later points during infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Based on these results, we hypothesized that SidJ may modulate SidE family association with the LCV as a means of regulating their activity. We began by confirming the observation that SidE family proteins can be detected on the LCV only at the initial stages of infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) were infected for increasing amounts of time with the wild-type <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> strain Lp02, the T4SS-deficient strain Lp03, and the Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> mutant. The cells were fixed and stained with antibodies specific for three Dot/Icm substrates including the SidE family [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], SidM/DrrA, and a protein known to remain on the LCV, LidA [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. As shown in <xref rid="ppat.1004695.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, SidE staining could be detected on wild-type LCVs adjacent to the bacterial poles at 1-hour post infection. The detected SidE signal at 1 hour represented secreted protein, as it was not detected in Lp03-infected macrophages. As previously observed [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], SidE staining decreased as the infection proceeded resulting in less than 10% co-localization with the LCV after 4 hours (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). SidM/DrrA exhibited a similar pattern of localization over time (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In contrast to SidE and SidM/DrrA, the secreted effector LidA was retained on the LCV throughout the infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), thus demonstrating that the disappearance of SidE and SidM/DrrA is not a general phenomenon.</p>

<p>To test our hypothesis that SidJ might mediate SidE family localization, we examined the intracellular position of the three Dot/Icm substrates when secreted from a Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> mutant. The absence of SidJ had no effect on the location of SidM/DrrA or LidA (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). However, the localization of SidE was significantly altered in the Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> strain in a time-dependent manner resulting in retention of SidE on the LCV at later time points of infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The disappearance of SidE proteins from the LCV in a wild-type infection could be due to their degradation and/or their dissociation from the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> phagosome. To test these possibilities, we examined the presence of LCV-associated SidE proteins during an infection where the host cells were first treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Interestingly, MG132 treatment resulted in a significant increase in the amount of retained SidE proteins at later time points (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), similar to that seen with the Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> mutant. In contrast, MG132 had no effect on SidM localization (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), thus demonstrating specificity. In summary, the disappearance of SidE proteins from the LCV at later points of infection is dependent on both SidJ and the proteasome.</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>SidE disappearance from the LCV is not due to general proteolysis of the protein</title>
<p>Based on the MG132 result, it is possible that SidJ removes SidE family proteins from the LCV via induced proteolysis, similar to the action of the metaeffector LubX on the substrate SidH [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To test this theory, we developed a method using the detergent digitonin to measure the total amount of secreted SidE family proteins. Digitonin extracts proteins from mammalian membranes without disrupting bacterial membranes due to the absence of cholesterol in the latter membranes. We then proceeded to infect the human monocytic cell line U937 with wild-type <italic>Legionella</italic>, gently lysed the cells using a dounce homogenizer and removed unbroken host cells via low speed centrifugation. This generated a post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) fraction that was then separated by a high-speed centrifugation step into a pellet fraction, containing host organelles and the LCV, and a soluble cytoplasmic fraction.</p>
<p>In the absence of digitonin, the majority of SidE-like proteins co-localized in the pellet fraction with DotF, an inner membrane protein of the Dot/Icm T4SS that was used as a marker for the LCV (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In contrast, SidJ could be detected in the soluble fraction without digitonin, indicating that the majority of the protein was secreted into the host cytoplasm and not retained on the LCV (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Inclusion of digitonin in the reaction resulted in the solubilization of a large percentage of the SidE proteins, indicating they were secreted into the host cell. DotF could not be extracted and therefore was retained within the digitonin-resistant, bacterial cell wall (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>Using this PNS/digitonin assay, we measured the levels of secreted SidE and SidJ proteins by Western analysis. Rather than observing decreased quantity of digitonin-soluble SidE proteins consistent with proteolysis, their amounts actually increased over the first 5 hours of the infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, WT). The levels of secreted SidJ and LidA were elevated in a similar fashion, although the amount of SidM/DrrA did not significantly increase over time (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B and 4C</xref>, WT). In order to more carefully examine if any of the initial, secreted protein was degraded, we examined the levels of the proteins after inhibition of protein synthesis using the antibiotic chloramphenicol. The initial wave of secreted SidE, SidJ, and LidA remained fairly stable in the presence of chloramphenicol (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, +Cm). In contrast, chloramphenicol-treatment did affect the levels of SidM/DrrA as the infection proceeded, suggesting that continual secretion of SidM/DrrA protein was necessary to maintain the levels of the protein over time (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, +Cm).</p>
<p>Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 resulted in a slight stabilization of SidM/DrrA consistent with the decreased amounts of SidM in the presence of chloramphenicol being due to proteolysis by the proteasome (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, +MG). In contrast, MG132 surprisingly did not alter the levels of SidE proteins (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, +MG), indicating they were not subject to proteasomal degradation. This result was unexpected based on our previous data showing MG132 treatment prevented the disappearance of SidE from the LCV (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Therefore, the situation must be more complex than initially anticipated. For example, there could be two populations of SidE proteins within the cell, a small portion on the LCV and a distinct population located elsewhere, and SidJ mediates the proteasomal-degradation of only LCV-associated SidE proteins.</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>SidE disappears from the LCV and co-localizes with fractions containing host organelles at later time points of infection</title>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we separated the LCV from other cell organelles using discontinuous sucrose gradient analysis. Using this method, we were able to obtain fractions enriched for the cytoplasm (actin), endosomes/lysosomes (LAMP-1), mitochondria (PHB), Golgi (GM130), ER (calnexin), and the LCV (DotF) (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). We then examined the location of SidE proteins and SidJ at 1 hpi (hour post infection) and 3 hpi. Consistent with our immunofluoresence data in <xref rid="ppat.1004695.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, we were able to detect SidE proteins that co-localized with the LCV at 1 hpi (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). However, we also observed a large amount of SidE proteins in fractions that contained host organelles, including endosomes/lysosomes, mitochondria and ER (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Strikingly, at 3-hours post infection there was a significant depletion of SidE proteins in the LCV fraction and instead there was an enrichment of these proteins in the organelle fractions distinct from the peak cytoplasmic fractions containing actin (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). In contrast to SidE proteins, SidJ was found in the cytoplasmic fractions at both 1 and 3-hours post infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Taken together, our data suggests that the SidJ and proteasome-dependent removal of SidE proteins from the LCV is due to localized degradation of protein.</p>

<title>SidJ directly mediates the disappearance of SidE proteins from the LCV</title>
<p>Although the removal of SidE proteins from the LCV requires SidJ, it is possible that this effect is indirect and perhaps due to maturation of the LCV over time. Therefore, we developed an assay to test if purified SidJ protein could remove SidE proteins from LCVs <italic>in vitro</italic>. This assay involved isolating post nuclear supernatants (PNSs) from bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) infected for 1 hour or 4 hours with the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> mutant (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).

The SidJ DD mutant contains mutations in two conserved aspartate residues (D542A D545A) (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B Fig.</xref>), was fortuitously identified based on a fallacious lead using a protein fold recognition server (Phyre), but resulted in a protein that nevertheless failed to complement the intracellular growth defect of a Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> mutant (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6C Fig.</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="ppat.1004695.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A and 6B</xref> (mock), SidE proteins remained associated with the polar sites of the <italic>Legionella</italic> phagosome in the absence of SidJ at both 1-hour and 4-hour post infection. Addition of purified wild-type SidJ to the PNS displaced the SidE proteins from LCVs obtained from either the 1-hour or the 4-hour infection.

<p>The ability of SidJ to remove SidE proteins from the LCV <italic>in vitro</italic> using lysates prepared from either 1 hour or 4 hours infections indicates that their absence is not simply due to LCV maturation but rather is a direct consequence of SidJ action. In addition, concentration-dependence of the reaction is consistent with SidJ accumulation in the host cell cytoplasm at later time points of infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). In summary, these data suggest that the SidE proteins function as toxins during early stages of infection and that SidJ inactivates them by mediating their active removal from the <italic>Legionella</italic>-containing vacuole.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The pathogen <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> serves as an excellent model system to study the interactions between secreted effector proteins, as it exports between 200–300 substrates via its Dot/Icm T4SS [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this study, we examined the relationship between the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> Dot/Icm substrates SidJ and the SidE family. Six lines of evidence support a functional connection between these proteins. First, SidJ and SdeC, SdeB, and SdeA are all expressed from the same locus (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Second, the SuperΔP170 mutant, the CleanΔP170 mutant, and the Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> mutant each have a similar growth defect within host cells (Figs. <xref rid="ppat.1004695.g001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004695.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). Third, expression of low levels of SdeA was able to complement/suppress the intracellular growth defect of the SuperΔP170 mutant, which lacks both the <italic>sidE</italic> family genes and <italic>sidJ</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Fourth, overexpression of SdeA was detrimental for the growth of only strains lacking <italic>sidJ</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Fifth, SdeA toxicity to yeast and mammalian host cells could be suppressed by co-expression of SidJ (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Sixth, SidJ is able to promote the disappearance of SidE proteins from the LCV at later points of infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and this could be reproduced in an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay using purified SidJ (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Based on these results, we propose that the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> SidJ protein functions as a metaeffector to regulate the activity of the SidE protein family.</p>
<p>The concept that intracellular pathogens must regulate the activity of their secreted effectors during an infection is not surprising, as unregulated toxin activity would lead to the premature demise of the host cell. One method of regulation might entail the spatiotemporal delivery and/or control of substrates with opposing activities. For example, <italic>Salmonella’s</italic> SopE and SptP toxins act antagonistically to activate and inactivate Rho-family GTPases CDC42 and Rac1 at different times of infection via a combination of differential activity and temporal stability [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Likewise <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> regulates the activity of Rab1 by using a GEF (SidM/DrrA) and a GAP (LepB) [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition to this general mode of GTPase regulation, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> is able to stabilize Rab1 in an active form using ampylation by the effector SidM/DrrA and then reverse the effect via de-ampylation by SidD [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. <italic>Legionella</italic> also employs two additional effectors with opposing activities, AnkX and Lem3/Lpg0696, to inactivate and then release a separate population of Rab1-GDP via cholination [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
<p>An even more elegant form of effector regulation was recently described, wherein the effector SidH was inactivated by LubX, a <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> secreted E3 ubiquitin ligase that marks SidH for proteasome-dependent proteolysis by polyubiquitination [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The key to effector regulation in this case was the differential translocation of LubX and SidH into host cells, with SidH being rapidly secreted followed by the slower intracellular accumulation of LubX. Based on these results, LubX was described as being a “metaeffector”, which was defined as an effector that regulates another effector protein [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Reminiscent of the differential regulation and secretion described for SidH and LubX, the expression of SidE proteins is induced in early stationary phase allowing export to occur immediately upon host cell infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In contrast, SidJ is expressed constitutively [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and accumulates within the host cell at later time points of infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The gradual accumulation of intracellular SidJ during infection correlates with the decreased level of the SidE proteins on the LCV.</p>
<p>These observations prompted us to propose a model whereby SidJ functions as a metaeffector to modulate the activity of the SidE proteins (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). In this model, SidE proteins are translocated into the host cells by the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> Dot/Icm T4SS at early points of infection and localize on the cytoplasmic face of the immature LCV. Although the precise molecular function of the SidE proteins is not yet known, their early delivery into the host cell suggests they are involved in avoidance of the endocytic pathway and/or maturation of the LCV. As the infection proceeds, the SidJ protein begins to accumulate in the host cell, eventually reaching a critical threshold when it is competent to mediate the removal of the SidE proteins from the LCV (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Based on the inhibition by MG132, the simplest possibility is that SidJ directly targets SidE proteins for degradation by the proteasome (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, top row). Alternatively, it is possible that SidJ mediates the degradation of another component that normally retains SidE proteins on the LCV surface. In the absence of this factor, the SidE proteins would no longer associate with the LCV and thus could redistribute and potentially associate with host organelles (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, middle row).</p>

<title>Model showing SidJ-mediated removal of SidE proteins from the <italic>Legionella</italic> containing vacuole (LCV).</title>
<p>Shown is a time course for the initial hours of an infection by wild-type <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> and a Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> mutant. SidE proteins are indicated with a red letter E, SidJ protein with a purple letter J, a hypothetical protein necessary for retaining SidE proteins on the LCV with a blue letter X, the LCV membrane in green, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> in maroon, the proteasome as a yellow Pac-man, and a host organelle in light blue. In a wild-type infection, SidE proteins localize to the LCV at early time points (1 hpi). At later time points, SidJ removes SidE proteins from the LCV either by localized degradation of SidE (top panel) and/or by degradation of a retention factor, thus leading to the relocalization of LCV-associated SidE proteins to a host organelle (middle panel). In a Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> infection, SidE proteins remain and accumulate on the LCV, which is detrimental for growth (lower panel).</p>

<p>In the absence of SidJ, SidE proteins appear to localize normally to the LCV at early time points of infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004695.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, bottom row). However, as the infection proceeds, the SidE proteins are no longer removed from the LCV, they accumulate to high levels, eventually inhibiting the growth of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic>. Overproduction of SdeA in the absence of SidJ was toxic to both yeast cells and HEK293 cells and inhibited the growth of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> due to delivery of the LCV to the lysosome. The disruption of the Golgi in mCherry-SdeA transfected cells suggests that the target of SdeA is likely to be a component of the secretory pathway.</p>
<p>The failure to eliminate SidE proteins from the LCV in a Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> mutant does not appear to be due to an indirect effect of the LCV not maturing as we can induce removal of SidE proteins from 4-hour LCVs <italic>in vitro</italic> by the addition of wild type SidJ. Rather we prefer the idea that SidJ directly mediates removal of SidE proteins from the LCV, perhaps by some form of post-translational modification. Although we have been unable to reproducibly demonstrate a robust interaction between SidJ and SdeA, it is reasonable that the proteins interact based on the SidJ suppression of SdeA-mediated toxicity in yeast and HEK293 cells. It is also possible that SidJ, which is a large protein of ∼90 kDa, possesses multiple biochemical activities, particularly since a partial ER recruitment defect has been reported for a Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> mutant [<xref rid="ppat.1004695.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, the Dot/Icm substrate SidJ functions as a metaeffector to regulate the activity of the SidE substrates. Similar to the metaeffector LubX, SidJ promotes the removal of Dot/Icm T4SS effectors from the LCV in a proteasome-dependent manner. The presence of dual effectors with opposing activities, and the existence of metaeffectors that modulate the activity of other effectors, may partially explain why <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> translocates such a vast repertoire of T4SS substrates into host cells. Moreover, the discovery of a second metaeffector in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> suggests that the concept of metaeffectors is not unique to LubX and additional pathogens may use similar strategies to highjack host cells.</p>

<title>Expression of SidE family proteins and SidJ in various <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> strains.</title>
<p>Proteins were analyzed in the wild-type strain Lp02, a Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> mutant, the CleanΔP170 mutant, the SuperΔP170 mutant, and the latter two deletion strains expressing wild type levels of SdeA or over producing SdeA (OP). Strains were grown to early stationary phase, harvested and westerns were performed using an antibody to SidE family proteins, SidJ or the constitutively expressed housekeeping protein ICDH. The SidE antibody, originally described in Bardill <italic>et al</italic> 2005, was raised against SdeC and recognizes SdeC, SdeB, and SdeA (SidE cannot be detected and therefore is believed to not be expressed under these conditions). Although the SidE antibody recognizes SdeC, SdeB, and SdeA, it is not clear how efficiently it recognizes each protein, i.e. it is not possible to compare relevant amounts of the three proteins in the westerns. The following results can be observed in this figure: (1) SidE proteins (SdeC, SdeB, SdeA) cannot be detected in the CleanΔP170 mutant or the SuperΔP170 mutant but are normally expressed in the Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> mutant. (2) SidJ cannot be detected in the SuperΔP170 or the Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> mutant but is expressed in the CleanΔP170 mutant. (3) The amount of SdeA normally expressed in a wild-type strain can be observed in the Δ<italic>sdeCB</italic> double deletion (lane 5). (4) pJB3356, the original <italic>sdeA</italic> complementing clone used in Bardill <italic>et al</italic>, expresses wild-type levels of SdeA in both the CleanΔP170 mutant (lane 6) and the SuperΔP170 mutant (lane 7). (5) In contrast, pJB3543 (the over producing SdeA clone) expresses significantly higher amounts of SdeA in both the CleanΔP170 mutant (lane 8) and the SuperΔP170 mutant (lane 9).</p>

<title>There is no secretion dependence between SidJ and the SidE protein SdeA.</title>
<p>U937 cells were infected for 1 hour with strains expressing either CyaA alone or SdeA or SidJ fused to CyaA in the indicated strains. Export was measured by the production of cAMP/well. The levels of cAMP are the means ± SEM obtained from an experiment performed in triplicate. The following strains were used: JV6482 (Lp02 + CyaA), JV2700 (Lp02 + CyaA-SdeA), JV3908 (Lp03 + Cya-SdeA), JV3957 (Δ<italic>icmS</italic> + Cya-SdeA), JV6411 (Δ<italic>sidJ</italic> + Cya-SdeA), JV6702 (Lp02 + CyaA-SidJ), JV6736 (Lp03 + CyaA-SidJ), JV6704 (Δ<italic>icmS</italic> + CyaA-SidJ), and JV6773 (CleanΔP170 + CyaA-SidJ).</p>
