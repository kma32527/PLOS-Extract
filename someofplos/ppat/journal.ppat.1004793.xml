<abstract>
<p><italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterium whose ability to replicate within macrophages and cause disease is strictly dependent upon the coordinate activities of three transcription regulators called MglA, SspA, and PigR. MglA and SspA form a complex that associates with RNA polymerase (RNAP), whereas PigR is a putative DNA-binding protein that functions by contacting the MglA-SspA complex. Most transcription activators that bind the DNA are thought to occupy only those promoters whose activities they regulate. Here we show using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq) that PigR, MglA, and SspA are found at virtually all promoters in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> and not just those of regulated genes. Furthermore, we find that the ability of PigR to associate with promoters is dependent upon the presence of MglA, suggesting that interaction with the RNAP-associated MglA-SspA complex is what directs PigR to promoters in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic>. Finally, we present evidence that the ability of PigR (and thus MglA and SspA) to positively control the expression of genes is dictated by a specific 7 base pair sequence element that is present in the promoters of regulated genes. The three principal regulators of virulence gene expression in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> therefore function in a non-classical manner with PigR interacting with the RNAP-associated MglA-SspA complex at the majority of promoters but only activating transcription from those that contain a specific sequence element. Our findings reveal how transcription factors can exert regulatory effects at a restricted set of promoters despite being associated with most or all. This distinction between occupancy and regulatory effect uncovered by our data may be relevant to the study of RNAP-associated transcription regulators in other pathogenic bacteria.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Most transcription regulators are found only at those promoters they control. Here we show that the most prominent regulators of virulence gene expression in <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> are found ubiquitously at promoters including those they do control and those they do not. Furthermore, we present evidence that these regulators—the RNA polymerase-associated SspA family members MglA and SspA, and the putative DNA-binding protein PigR—exert their coordinate regulatory effects only at promoters that contain a small DNA sequence element. Our findings reveal how transcription factors can associate with many promoters but only exert regulatory effects at a few. They also have implications for how SspA family members and other RNAP-associated transcription regulators might exert their effects in other pathogens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterium and the aetiological agent of tularemia, a disease that can be fatal in humans [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This pathogen is highly infectious, with as few as 10 organisms constituting an infectious dose, and is a potential bioweapon [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The ability of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> to cause disease is dependent principally upon its ability to grow within macrophages [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Prominent amongst those genes that are essential for the intramacrophage growth and survival of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> are those located on the Francisella pathogenicity island (FPI), which are thought to have been acquired through horizontal transfer [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Genes on the FPI encode a type VI secretion system that may secrete effector proteins into cells of the host [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], thereby enabling the organism to escape the so-called Francisella-containing vacuole and to replicate freely within the macrophage cytosol [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Expression of the genes on the FPI is dependent upon the coordinate activities of three regulators [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Two of these, MglA and SspA, belong to the stringent starvation protein A (SspA) family of proteins and form a heteromeric complex that associates with RNA polymerase (RNAP) [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The other is a putative DNA-binding protein called PigR (also known as FevR in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>novicida</italic>) that works in concert with MglA and SspA by contacting the RNAP-associated MglA-SspA complex directly [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. MglA, SspA, and PigR also positively control the expression of virulence genes outside the FPI, and are thought to control the expression of ~100 genes in total, including many whose roles in virulence are not yet known [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The findings that MglA, SspA, and PigR are essential for intramacrophage growth and for virulence underscores the indispensible roles these regulators play in the coordinate control of virulence gene expression in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
<p>According to the current view for how MglA, SspA, and PigR control the expression of virulence genes, PigR functions like a classical transcription activator, binding specifically to a DNA sequence present at the promoters of regulated genes; thus, contact between DNA-bound PigR and the RNAP-associated MglA-SspA complex would stabilize the binding of RNAP to those promoters that contain a PigR binding site [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, it is not known whether the promoters of MglA/SspA/PigR-regulated genes contain a specific sequence element that confers responsiveness to PigR. If PigR were indeed to function like a classical transcription activator it would be expected to be located at only those promoters it regulates, and it would be predicted to bind to DNA recognition sites associated with target promoters regardless of whether or not the MglA-SspA complex were present in the cell. Indeed, most classical transcription activators are thought to bind specific sites on the DNA prior to interacting with RNAP [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Another prediction from the current model is that PigR interacts with the MglA-SspA complex that is associated with the RNAP holoenzyme (the form of the enzyme that contains the σ factor) during transcription initiation [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, it is unknown whether the MglA-SspA complex is associated with the RNAP holoenzyme during transcription initiation or the RNAP core enzyme during transcription elongation, or both.</p>
<p>Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq), we show that PigR, MglA, and SspA are present at virtually all detected promoters in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic>. We also demonstrate that PigR requires MglA (and thus presumably the MglA-SspA complex) in order to specifically associate with promoters. Finally, we present evidence that the promoters of PigR-regulated genes contain a specific sequence motif that is both necessary and sufficient for PigR-mediated control. Our findings reveal that the most prominent regulators of virulence gene expression in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> are found at essentially all promoters but only positively control those that contain a specific sequence element.</p>

<title>Defining promoter regions in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> using ChIP-Seq</title>
<p>In order to address the question of whether PigR specifically associates with the promoters of regulated genes, we first sought to define the locations of promoters on a genome-wide basis in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic>. To do this, we determined the locations of the β′ subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP) on the <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> chromosome using ChIP-Seq. To immunoprecipitate the β′ subunit of RNAP, we constructed a strain of <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> LVS in which the chromosomal copy of the <italic>rpoC</italic> gene was modified to encode β′ with a vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein (VSV-G) epitope tag fused to its C-terminus (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). This results in cells of LVS which synthesize the β′ subunit of RNAP with a VSV-G tag (β′-V) at native levels. Because β′ is a core subunit of RNAP, β′ is expected to be found at both promoter regions and within actively transcribed genes. Thus, in order to use β′-V to specifically identify the locations of promoters, we performed ChIP-Seq after treatment of the LVS β′-V cells with the RNAP inhibitor rifampicin (rif) to effectively trap RNAP at promoters [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). By determining the location of the β′ subunit of RNAP in cells treated with rif, we identified 526 promoter regions in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> LVS (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).</p>

<p><italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> encodes two σ factors: σ<sup>70</sup>, the so-called housekeeping σ factor, and σ<sup>32</sup>, the so-called heat-shock σ factor [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As a complementary approach to identify promoters in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic>, and to determine which promoters are σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent and which are controlled by σ<sup>32</sup>, we performed ChIP-Seq with cells that synthesized epitope-tagged versions of each σ factor. To do this we constructed a strain of LVS that synthesized σ<sup>70</sup> with a VSV-G epitope tag fused to its C-terminus (LVS σ<sup>70</sup>-V), and another strain of LVS that synthesized σ<sup>32</sup> with a VSV-G tag fused to its C-terminus (LVS σ<sup>32</sup>-V). As a control we also constructed a strain that synthesized HipB, a predicted site-specific DNA-binding protein [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], with a VSV-G tag fused to its C-terminus (LVS HipB-V). ChIP-Seq with cells of the LVS σ<sup>70</sup>-V strain identified 333 promoter regions, of which 277 (83.2%) overlap with the locations of promoters defined by determining the location of the β′ subunit of RNAP in cells grown in the presence of rif (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004793.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). ChIP-Seq with cells of the LVS σ<sup>32</sup>-V strain identified only 4 promoter regions (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004793.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). ChIP-Seq with cells of the LVS HipB-V strain revealed that HipB associates with 26 regions of the chromosome (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). By defining a promoter as a region with significant enrichment of σ<sup>70</sup>, σ<sup>32</sup>, or the β′ subunit of RNAP in cells grown in the presence of rif, we identified 581 promoter regions in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> LVS, 495 (85%) of which were intergenic and 86 (15%) of which were intragenic (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>MglA, SspA, and PigR are found at the majority of promoters in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic></title>
<p>Having determined the locations of promoters in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> on a genome-wide basis, we next sought to determine at which promoters PigR, MglA, and SspA were located. To do this we utilized a previously constructed strain in which the native chromosomal copy of <italic>mglA</italic> is altered such that it specifies MglA with a TAP (tandem affinity purification) tag fused to its C-terminus [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We also constructed two additional strains of LVS: one in which the native chromosomal copy of <italic>pigR</italic> had been altered such that it specified PigR with a VSV-G epitope tag fused to its C-terminus (LVS PigR-V); and another in which the native chromosomal copy of <italic>sspA</italic> had been altered such that it specified SspA with a VSV-G epitope tag fused to its C-terminus (LVS SspA-V).</p>
<p>ChIP-Seq with cells of the LVS PigR-V strain, cells of the LVS MglA-TAP strain, and cells of the LVS SspA-V strain revealed that PigR, MglA, and SspA are located at the majority of promoters in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> and not just at the promoters of regulated genes (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004793.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>). The finding that PigR, MglA, and SspA are found at the promoters of both regulated and non-regulated genes is illustrated in <xref rid="ppat.1004793.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A and 2B</xref> which show the occupancies of the β′ subunit of RNAP (in the presence of rif), σ<sup>70</sup>, MglA, SspA, PigR, and HipB at the FTL_0491, FTL_0650, and FTL_0651 promoter regions as determined by ChIP-Seq. Specifically, <xref rid="ppat.1004793.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref> shows that PigR, MglA, and SspA are found at the promoter of the FTL_0491 gene, which is an example of a gene that is positively regulated by MglA, SspA, and PigR [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (see also <xref rid="ppat.1004793.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>), whereas <xref rid="ppat.1004793.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> shows that PigR, MglA, and SspA are found at the promoters of the FTL_0650 and FTL_0651 genes, which are examples of genes that are known not to be positively regulated by MglA, SspA, and PigR [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. HipB was not detected at any of these promoters by ChIP-Seq (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>) indicating the specificity of the observed associations of PigR, MglA, and SspA with these promoters. In contrast, HipB is specifically enriched upstream of the <italic>hipB</italic> gene (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>), suggesting that in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> HipB may control its own expression.</p>

<p>The finding that PigR, MglA, and SspA are found at the majority of promoters in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> is illustrated in <xref rid="ppat.1004793.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref> which shows the locations and degrees of occupancy of the β′ subunit of RNAP (in cells grown in the presence of rif), σ<sup>70</sup>, MglA, SspA, PigR, and HipB over a representative 400 kb region of the <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> chromosome. Comparison between the regions enriched for σ<sup>70</sup>, MglA, SspA, and PigR, together with the relative degree of enrichment, revealed a striking correspondence between the four (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Note that the degree of occupancy of the β′ subunit of RNAP at a particular promoter can differ in the presence and absence of rifampicin (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which may explain why the ChIP-Seq enrichment profile for β′ in cells grown in the presence of rif differs slightly from that of σ<sup>70</sup> in certain locations (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). The concordance among the localization of σ<sup>70</sup>, MglA, SspA, and PigR across the entire <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic> chromosome is demonstrated in <xref rid="ppat.1004793.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref> which represents the 98% of promoter regions identified by ChIP-Seq of σ<sup>70</sup> at which at least one of the three factors, MglA, SspA, or PigR, is found; the Venn diagram shows that MglA, SspA, and PigR are found at the majority of promoters identified by detection of σ<sup>70</sup> (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). The identification of PigR at the majority of promoters suggests that PigR is not a regulator that is only found at the promoters of specific target genes.</p>
<p>ChIP-Seq with cells of the LVS PigR-V strain, cells of the LVS MglA-TAP strain, and cells of the LVS SspA-V strain also revealed that PigR, MglA, and SspA are present at promoters together with σ<sup>70</sup> and are not detected in transcribed regions. This is in contrast to the situation with the β′ subunit of RNAP, which is found both at promoters and within transcribed regions in cells grown in the absence of rif (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). These findings suggest that PigR, MglA, and SspA might not be components of the transcription elongation complex and that PigR, MglA, and SspA likely exert their regulatory effects at the level of transcription initiation.</p>

<title>PigR requires MglA in order to specifically associate with promoters</title>
<p>Interaction between PigR and the RNAP-associated MglA-SspA complex is required in order for PigR to function coordinately with MglA and SspA [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

<p>Comparison of the ChIP-Seq results obtained with ectopically produced PigR with those obtained with native PigR revealed that the ectopic synthesis of PigR does not significantly alter the genome-wide locations of this protein.

<title>A specific sequence motif is found at the promoters of PigR/MglA/SspA-regulated genes</title>
<p>Although PigR (together with MglA and SspA) is present at the majority of promoters, it appears to only positively regulate the expression of a fraction of the corresponding genes. We therefore reasoned that PigR might function as an activator at specific promoters through recognition of a specific sequence element.</p>
<p>To search for a conserved sequence motif in the promoters of genes that are regulated by PigR we first tested whether certain genes previously shown to be regulated by MglA and SspA were also regulated by PigR in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic>.

Using MEME [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we then searched for a specific motif in the promoter regions of genes that (i) were either previously shown to be positively regulated by PigR in LVS by DNA microarray [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], or shown to be positively regulated by PigR in our Nanostring assays (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref>), or both, and (ii) contained a region of PigR enrichment upstream from the translation start site, as determined by our ChIP-Seq studies with cells of our LVS PigR-V strain.

<p>We next asked whether the PRE was found at a specific location relative to the transcription start site of a regulated promoter. To do this we first determined transcription start sites on a genome-wide basis using RNA-Seq [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This gave us 453 candidate transcription start sites (see <xref rid="sec009" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>). This list was parsed further to include only those start sites found within 1 kb upstream of the translational start site of an annotated ORF, and remove from consideration those start sites associated with rRNAs and tRNAs, and those found within repeated sequences annotated as encoding transposases. To obtain a list of transcription start sites that could be independently verified as originating from a detectable promoter we further parsed this list of 197 start sites to include only those found within a region of enrichment for σ<sup>70</sup>, σ<sup>32</sup>, or the β′ subunit of RNAP (in cells grown in the presence of rif) as determined by ChIP-Seq. This gave us transcription start sites with high confidence for 110 promoters, including 3 of the 11 putative promoter regions used to initially identify the PRE through MEME (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref>). We then used primer extension to determine transcription start sites for 2 additional promoters of PigR-regulated genes used in the MEME analysis. Through determining the transcription start sites for the promoters driving the expression of 5 independent PigR-regulated genes we were able to infer the sequences and locations of putative -10 and -35 elements for each of these promoters and found that the PRE was either 6 or 7 bp upstream from the predicted -35 element in each case (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Analysis of the 110 promoters from our high quality data set revealed that only 3 of these contained a PRE (see <xref rid="sec009" ref-type="sec">Materials and Methods</xref>) and are known to be PigR-regulated, whereas 107 do not contain a PRE and are not known to be PigR-regulated [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004793.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004793.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref> Tables). This suggests that the presence and location (6 or 7 bp upstream of the putative -35 element) of the PRE is specific to PigR-regulated promoters, raising the possibility that PigR may bind directly to this site to activate transcription from those promoters that contain it.</p>

<title>The PRE is both necessary and sufficient to confer responsiveness to PigR</title>
<p>Having identified a specific conserved sequence element in the same location in the promoters of PigR-regulated genes we sought to determine whether this sequence rendered a particular promoter responsive to PigR. To do this we first constructed a reporter strain of LVS in which one of the two copies of the PigR/MglA/SspA-regulated <italic>iglA</italic> promoter is transcriptionally fused to <italic>lacZ</italic> using a chromosomal integration vector [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We also made three additional reporter strains of LVS. Two of these contained different mutations at conserved base pairs in the PRE of the <italic>iglA</italic> promoter-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>), whereas the third reporter strain contained mutations in the predicted -10 element of the <italic>iglA</italic> promoter-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion that would be predicted to abolish promoter activity (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Finally, we made an additional three reporter strains in cells of the LVS ∆<italic>pigR</italic> mutant strain that contained the wild-type version, a PRE mutant version, or the -10 mutant version of the <italic>iglA</italic> promoter-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion.</p>
<p>The results depicted in <xref rid="ppat.1004793.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref> show that mutations in the PRE of the <italic>iglA</italic> promoter reduce expression of the linked <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter gene only when PigR is present (i.e. in cells of LVS but not in cells of the LVS ∆<italic>pigR</italic> mutant strain). Consistent with the idea that these differences are due to a decrease in the activity of the <italic>iglA</italic> promoter, cells of the reporter strains containing mutations in the -10 element that are predicted to decrease the activity of the promoter exhibit dramatically reduced <italic>lacZ</italic> expression (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). Note that there are two identical copies of the <italic>iglA</italic> gene in LVS because there are two copies of the FPI in this organism. Only reporter strains carrying wild-type and mutant versions of the <italic>iglA</italic> promoter-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion integrated at the FTL_0111 locus were used in these experiments, ruling out the possibility that any of the observed differences in <italic>lacZ</italic> expression were due to differences in the location of the reporter in the different strains. Taken together, these findings suggest that residues within the PRE of the <italic>iglA</italic> promoter are important in order for PigR to exert a positive effect on expression of the <italic>iglA</italic> gene.</p>
<p>Having established that conserved base pairs within the PRE are important for expression of a PigR-regulated gene we next asked whether the PRE was sufficient to confer control on a promoter that did not ordinarily contain a PRE. To do this we introduced 3 mutations into the FTL_0361 promoter that generated a consensus PRE 6 bp upstream of the putative -35 element (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). We then made reporter strains of LVS and the LVS ∆<italic>pigR</italic> mutant strain that contained the wild-type version, a PRE-containing version, or a -10 mutant version of a FTL_0361 promoter-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion. The results depicted in <xref rid="ppat.1004793.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref> show that addition of a PRE to the FTL_0361 promoter results in an increase in expression of the FTL_0361 promoter-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion only in the presence of PigR (i.e. in cells of the LVS wild-type strain but not in cells of the LVS ∆<italic>pigR</italic> mutant strain). These findings demonstrate that the PRE is sufficient to confer on a promoter the ability to respond to PigR, and by inference, the ability to respond to MglA and SspA.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using ChIP-Seq we have found that PigR, MglA, and SspA are found at the majority of promoters in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic>. We have also found that PigR requires the MglA-SspA complex in order to specifically localize to promoter regions. We infer from this that interaction between PigR and the RNAP-associated MglA-SspA complex directs PigR specifically to promoter regions. Despite their ubiquitous presence at promoters, PigR, MglA, and SspA coordinately control the expression of approximately 5% of known genes and we have uncovered the molecular basis for this specificity. In particular, we have identified a 7 bp sequence element that we have called the PRE (the PigR response element), located approximately 6 bps upstream of the putative -35 element of promoters that are positively regulated by PigR/MglA/SspA. The PRE is both necessary and sufficient to confer control by PigR. Our findings indicate that although PigR, MglA, and SspA are present at essentially all promoters, they control the activities of only those promoters that contain a specific sequence element.</p>
<p>Finding PigR, MglA, and SspA at promoters but not within transcribed regions suggests that these proteins are associated with the RNAP holoenzyme and likely exert their regulatory effects at the level of transcription initiation. Consistent with the idea that the MglA-SspA complex interacts with the σ<sup>70</sup>-containing RNAP holoenzyme, σ<sup>70</sup> together with the core subunits of RNAP and SspA were found to co-purify with MglA in LVS in stoichiometric amounts [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
<p>PigR contains a putative helix-turn-helix motif, suggesting it might exert its regulatory effects through interaction with the DNA [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Based on our findings that PigR, MglA, and SspA are present at the majority of σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoters in <italic>F</italic>. <italic>tularensis</italic>, together with our identification of the PRE, we propose a model for how PigR works in concert with the MglA-SspA complex to positively regulate the expression of a specific set of genes, including many that are required for virulence (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). According to this model, PigR is a transcription activator that associates with all promoters through its interaction with the RNAP-associated MglA-SspA complex. However, only at those promoters that contain a PRE does PigR make sufficiently strong contact with the DNA to further stabilize the binding of RNAP and activate transcription. In essence, the model specifies that PigR is an RNAP-associated transcription activator that functions by providing RNAP with an additional DNA-binding domain, conferring on RNAP the ability to form especially stable complexes at promoters that contain a PRE. Note that in this model, PigR/MglA/SspA-regulated promoters are depicted as being recognized by RNAP holoenzyme containing σ<sup>70</sup> (i.e. are σ<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoters), since our ChIP-Seq studies reveal PigR, MglA, SspA, and σ<sup>70</sup> are present at many of the same promoter regions. Note also that our model explains only how PigR, together with the MglA-SspA complex, exerts positive effects on gene expression; the small number of genes that are negatively regulated by PigR/MglA/SspA [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], may be controlled directly or indirectly by these factors. It is possible that some genes are regulated by PigR/MglA/SspA because they are subject to control by another regulator that is in turn regulated by PigR/MglA/SspA. However, to the best of our knowledge, <italic>pigR</italic> is the only gene encoding a putative DNA-binding protein that is positively regulated by PigR/MglA/SspA [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p>

<p>PigR associates with RNAP through interaction with the RNAP-associated MglA-SspA complex and is consequently found associated with RNAP at the promoters of both non-regulated (A) and regulated (B) genes. (B) PigR is a DNA-binding protein that binds the PRE present within the promoters of regulated genes; contact between RNAP-bound PigR and the DNA stabilizes the binding of RNAP to the promoter, thereby activating transcription specifically from promoters that contain a PRE.

<p>Our model specifies that PigR is a DNA-binding protein that associates with RNAP via the MglA-SspA complex prior to promoter binding, and is therefore associated with all promoters, as is supported by our ChIP-Seq data. According to the classical view, transcription activators that bind the DNA and contact RNAP are found only at the promoters of regulated genes and function by first recognizing their respective target sites on the DNA and then, once tethered to the DNA, by contacting RNAP [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, there is at least one precedent in the literature for a regulator that appears to manifest ubiquitous promoter localization, while exerting effects at only a subset of promoters. In particular, CarD is an essential RNAP-associated transcription regulator in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> that has been found to associate with the majority of promoters [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although the ability of CarD to bind the DNA is necessary in order for this regulator to stimulate transcription initiation, it is not yet known whether CarD exerts its regulatory effects at promoters through recognition of a specific sequence element [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition, in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, members of the MarA family of transcription activators are thought to associate with RNAP prior to DNA-binding and to contact their DNA target sites as a pre-assembled activator-RNAP complex [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, genome-wide location analyses have not been performed on members of the MarA family, and so it is not yet known whether these regulators are found at the majority of promoters in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>.</p>
<p>We note that although PigR is predicted to be a DNA-binding protein, PigR has yet to be shown to be capable of binding the DNA, and need not necessarily exert its regulatory effects through direct interaction with the PRE. It is formally possible that interaction between PigR and the RNAP-associated MglA-SspA complex may enable some other portion of RNAP, such as the C-terminal domain of one of the α subunits [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], or perhaps the MglA-SspA complex itself, to interact productively with the PRE, resulting in transcription activation. However, in relation to the latter possibility, SspA family members do not contain any obvious DNA-binding determinants and have not been shown to bind the DNA directly [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It is important to note that although we found PigR does not specifically associate with the DNA in the absence of MglA, this does not mean that PigR is not a site-specific DNA-binding protein. PigR may need to interact with the MglA-SspA complex in order to specifically interact with the PRE, either because the protein-protein interaction promotes a structural change within PigR that is essential for DNA-binding, or because interaction between PigR and the DNA is too weak to be able to occur in the absence of stabilizing interactions provided by promoter-bound RNAP. Indeed, most sequence-specific transcription regulators bind as dimers to their cognate recognition sites, which are typically 20 bp in length. If PigR does bind the 7 bp PRE directly, this would be more reminiscent of a monomer of a dimeric regulator binding a half-site. Regardless of whether or not the ability of PigR to interact directly with the PRE is essential in order for PigR to exert its regulatory effects, our findings clearly establish the PRE as the sequence element that renders a promoter subject to control by PigR, and thus presumably MglA and SspA as well.</p>
<p>The virulence genes present on the horizontally acquired FPI are the ones that are most strongly regulated by PigR, MglA, and SspA, and it is tempting to speculate that the limited size of the PRE (at 7 bp) may have facilitated the expansion of the PigR/MglA/SspA regulatory network to include these. Only three mutations were required in order to generate a consensus PRE within the FTL_0361 promoter (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). More than three mutations would likely have been required had the PRE been closer to 20 as opposed to 7 bp. The relatively short length of the PRE means that relatively few changes would be required to place a particular promoter under the control of PigR/MglA/SspA, including any promoter that might have been acquired from a foreign source through horizontal transfer.</p>
<p>Our ChIP-Seq studies suggest that PigR interacts with the MglA-SspA complex at the majority of promoters. This raises the possibility that through interaction with the MglA-SspA complex, PigR may modulate the activity of any other regulator that functions through interaction with the RNAP-bound MglA-SspA complex. Indeed, it has been suggested that PmrA, another important regulator of virulence gene expression in Francisella, might function through interaction with MglA and SspA [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It is therefore conceivable that at some promoters PigR may modulate the activity of PmrA, or vice versa, through competition for a binding surface on the MglA-SspA complex.</p>
<p>The role of the MglA-SspA complex in positively controlling the expression of virulence genes appears to be to simply serve as a contact site on RNAP for PigR. Evidence for other SspA family members serving as contact sites for transcription activators comes from studies of bacteriophage P1 late gene expression; in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, SspA evidently functions as a co-activator of P1 late gene expression by making simultaneous contact with RNAP and the phage-encoded sequence-specific DNA-binding protein Lpa [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, in the case of Lpa, it is not known whether this regulator is associated with the majority of promoters in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> or just those driving expression of the P1 late genes. SspA family members have been shown to be important for the virulence of a variety of pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Serving as a contact site on RNAP for a transcription activator may represent a common mechanism by which SspA family members control the expression of virulence genes in numerous pathogens.</p>

<title>VSV-G tagging integration vectors</title>
<p>A modified version of pEX18Kan (provided by Shite Sebastian and Simon Dillon, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States) was used as the vector for VSV-G tagging integration constructs. We have used pEX18Kan for deletion constructs [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; it utilizes a ColE1 origin of replication, which is nonfunctional in LVS, and contains the Tn<italic>903</italic> kanamycin resistance gene (Epicentre) driven by the LVS <italic>groES</italic> promoter. The plasmid pKL01 was generated by first amplifying the last 400 base pairs (bp) of the FTL_1743 locus (<italic>rpoC</italic>), minus the stop codon, by PCR. The 5′ primer contained DNA specifying a KpnI site upstream of the gene fragment. The 3’ primer included DNA containing a NotI site and one extra base pair, encoding a 3 amino acid alanine linker. The linker is followed by DNA specifying the 11 amino acid vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein (VSV-G) epitope tag, followed by a stop codon and DNA specifying an EcoRI site. The corresponding PCR product was digested with KpnI and EcoRI and cloned into pEX18Kan that had been digested with KpnI and EcoRI, generating pKL01. We largely removed the <italic>sacB</italic> gene by digesting with MscI and EcoRV and re-ligating the vector together, resulting in pKL02.</p>
<p>VSV-G tagging integration constructs for <italic>rpoD</italic>, <italic>rpoH</italic>, <italic>sspA</italic>, <italic>pigR</italic>, and <italic>hipB</italic> were generated by amplifying the last 250–400 bp (depending on gene size) of the gene using a 5′ primer containing a KpnI site and a 3′ primer containing a NotI site, which allows each fragment to be fused with DNA specifying the alanine linker and VSV-G epitope tag. Fragments were subcloned into pKL02 that had been digested with KpnI and NotI. Plasmid pKL05 contains the DNA specifying the 3’ end of <italic>rpoD</italic> and was used to generate strain LVS σ<sup>70</sup>-V.

The first library was generated from RNAs carrying a 5’ triphosphate (prepared as described in [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]), the second library was generated from RNAs carrying a 5’ monophosphate (prepared as described in [<xref rid="ppat.1004793.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]), while the third library was generated from RNAs carrying either a 5’ triphosphate or a 5’ monophosphate. The third library was prepared by omitting a single step (treatment with Terminator 5’ exonuclease) from the procedure used to generate RNAs carrying a 5’ triphosphate. To identify high quality transcription start sites we first identified 3,120 genomic loci where 50 or more sequencing reads aligned in one of three libraries generated from RNAs carrying a 5’ triphosphate. Of these 3,120 loci, we identified 452 sites that were significantly enriched in a comparison of libraries generated from RNAs carrying a 5’ triphosphate with libraries generated from RNAs carrying a 5’ monophosphate and significantly enriched in a comparison of libraries generated from RNAs carrying a 5’ triphosphate or a 5’ monophosphate with libraries generated from RNAs carrying a 5’ monophosphate. These 452 sites were further filtered to remove those associated with rRNAs, tRNAs, or repeated sequences annotated as transposases. Among the remaining sites, we identified 110 high quality start sites as those found within 1 kb of a translational start site for an annotated ORF and located within a promoter region defined by ChIP-Seq (<xref rid="ppat.1004793.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref>).</p>
