<abstract>
<p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> accounts for more deaths worldwide than any other single pathogen through diverse disease manifestations including pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis. Life-threatening acute cardiac complications are more common in pneumococcal infection compared to other bacterial infections. Distinctively, these arise despite effective antibiotic therapy. Here, we describe a novel mechanism of myocardial injury, which is triggered and sustained by circulating pneumolysin (PLY). Using a mouse model of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), we demonstrate that wild type PLY-expressing pneumococci but not PLY-deficient mutants induced elevation of circulating cardiac troponins (cTns), well-recognized biomarkers of cardiac injury. Furthermore, elevated cTn levels linearly correlated with pneumococcal blood counts (<italic>r</italic>=0.688, <italic>p</italic>=0.001) and levels were significantly higher in non-surviving than in surviving mice. These cTn levels were significantly reduced by administration of PLY-sequestering liposomes. Intravenous injection of purified PLY, but not a non-pore forming mutant (PdB), induced substantial increase in cardiac troponins to suggest that the pore-forming activity of circulating PLY is essential for myocardial injury in vivo. Purified PLY and PLY-expressing pneumococci also caused myocardial inflammatory changes but apoptosis was not detected. Exposure of cultured cardiomyocytes to PLY-expressing pneumococci caused dose-dependent cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction and death, which was exacerbated by further PLY release following antibiotic treatment. We found that high PLY doses induced extensive cardiomyocyte lysis, but more interestingly, <italic>sub-lytic</italic> PLY concentrations triggered profound calcium influx and overload with subsequent membrane depolarization and progressive reduction in intracellular calcium transient amplitude, a key determinant of contractile force. This was coupled to activation of signalling pathways commonly associated with cardiac dysfunction in clinical and experimental sepsis and ultimately resulted in depressed cardiomyocyte contractile performance along with rhythm disturbance. Our study proposes a detailed molecular mechanism of pneumococcal toxin-induced cardiac injury and highlights the major translational potential of targeting circulating PLY to protect against cardiac complications during pneumococcal infections.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cardiac complications frequently accompany invasive disease caused by the pathogen <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and are associated with significant increases in mortality, however the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we describe a new mechanism by which pneumococci in the blood stream induce elevation of circulating cardiac troponins; proteins that are markers of cardiac injury and cause inflammatory cell infiltration into the myocardium. We demonstrate that this process is mediated by the circulating pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin (PLY). We also show that antibiotic treatment can exacerbate cardiac injury and dysfunction following pneumococcal infection due to bacterial lysis and the release of PLY, which represents a further mechanistic explanation for the process of cardiac scarring and inflammation. We demonstrate that in addition to its role in inducing death of cardiac cells at high concentrations, PLY at lower (non-lytic) concentrations trigger a range of cellular events starting with cellular membrane pore-formation, substantial calcium overload which then mediates mechanical and electrical disturbance to the function of cardiac cells. Our work proposes that novel translational strategies to detect and neutralize circulating PLY during pneumococcal disease could be utilized to assess disease severity and should be targeted for prevention/treatment purposes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (the pneumococcus) is a major human pathogen responsible for severe invasive diseases such as pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis in young children and immunocompromised individuals worldwide [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], while also being the main cause of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the elderly in the UK and USA. There is now growing awareness of associated cardiac events (ACEs) during pneumococcal infection, particularly in the context of CAP in which over a quarter of the patients develop ACEs. These include arrhythmia, cardiac failure and acute coronary syndrome [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which are associated with an increased overall risk of mortality from 13.9% to 36% [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition to these observations, elevated levels of cardiac troponins, which are well-recognized biomarkers of cardiac injury have been shown to adversely affect prognosis in pneumococcal pneumonia [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Pneumococcal infection is also a common cause of severe sepsis and septic shock [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Cardiac depression occurs in 40–50% of patients with severe sepsis and raises the mortality rate to 80–90% [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Cardiomyocyte damage marked by elevated troponin levels occurs in ~61% [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] of patients with severe sepsis. However, the underlying mechanisms of these cardiac complications remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>Increased myocardial oxygen demand, lowered myocardial oxygenation, vascular endothelial dysfunction and the effects of increased inflammatory cytokine levels [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have been proposed as mechanisms contributing to the development of ACEs and cardiac injury in pneumococcal infection. However, these mechanisms are not pathogen-specific. A more direct role is suggested by the finding that pneumococcal pneumonia is much more likely to be associated with acute cardiac complications compared to other pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Importantly, pneumococcal pneumonia is also a strong independent risk factor for the development of cardiac complications, including arrhythmia [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition, the risk of ACEs and associated mortality remains high in the first few days of pneumococcal infection despite appropriate antibiotic treatment [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Recently, a study by Brown <italic>et al</italic> provided new evidence that pneumococci could translocate across the myocardial vasculature to cause microlesions within the myocardial tissue that disrupt cardiac function [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> produces a range of virulence factors that promote bacterial pathogenesis [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. One such virulence factor is the cholesterol-binding haemolytic cytotoxin pneumolysin (PLY), which is a 53 KDa protein that is closely associated with the development of invasive disease and inflammation [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and released by pneumococci upon cell lysis. The cytotoxicity of PLY is attributed to its potent pore-forming ability on cholesterol containing cell membranes and subsequent disruption of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] although it also has a wide range of effects on cell signalling at sub-lytic concentrations, including induction of apoptosis [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics are considered central to cardiac contractile rhythm and force [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As part of the normal physiological adaptation to increased metabolic demands, an increased release of catecholamines takes place to increase both force and rate of cardiac contraction by increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into cardiomyocytes through the inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> current <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub> [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This increment in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is physiological but, beyond certain limits, pathological Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload develops to result in cellular injury as well as electrical and mechanical dysfunction [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As such, the observation that PLY can mediate pathological Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into various mammalian cells may be particularly relevant to cardiomyocyte dysfunction during invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Furthermore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> also regulates pivotal signalling processes in cardiomyocytes including post-translational modification of myofilament proteins and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In particular, cardiac troponin (cTn) phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) has direct functional implications on contractile performance [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and has been widely studied. This leads us to hypothesize that circulating PLY is the key virulence factor to induce cardiomyocyte dysfunction by affecting intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and relevant signalling pathways.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that PLY plays a key role in pneumococcal-induced cardiomyocyte injury and in elevation of circulating cardiac troponins in a mouse model of IPD. The underlying mechanisms are attributed to the pore-forming properties of circulating PLY, which directly cause greatly increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into cardiomyocytes and subsequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload. The profound increase in diastolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> attenuates the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude and enhances activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive pathways that are known to be associated with myocardial dysfunction, such as PKCα-cTnI axis and ER stress to reduce cardiomyocyte contractile performance and also lead to cell injury. Furthermore, this study provides novel therapeutic evidence that neutralization of circulating PLY in mice using specially engineered PLY-sequestering liposomes [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] can significantly attenuate cardiac injury during IPD.</p>

<title>Only PLY-expressing strains induce cardiomyocyte injury <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>To examine the effects of invasive pneumococcal infection on cardiac injury <italic>in vivo</italic>, wild type (WT) <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> serotype 2 (strain D39) or its pneumolysin deficient isogenic strain (PLN-A [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]) (1x10<sup>6</sup> CFU in 50 μl saline) were administered intravenously (i.v.) into mice. We found that cardiomyocyte injury biomarkers, i.e. cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and T (cTnT), were detectable in the circulation of mice infected with D39 as early as 12 h with much higher levels 24 h post-infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). However, neither cTnI nor cTnT were detected in plasma of PLN-A-infected mice (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) suggesting that PLY is key to inducing cardiomyocyte injury during IPD. D39 and PLN-A blood counts were comparable at 12 hours post-infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>), suggesting that the presence/absence of cardiac troponin release was not due to a higher bacterial burden in blood with D39 but instead due to the presence/absence of PLY in the two strains. To confirm this, we performed similar infections with clinical invasive disease isolates of serotype-1 pneumococci of a sequence type producing haemolytic PLY (ST300) and with a sequence type that produces a non-haemolytic PLY (ST306), and found that both cTnI and cTnT are elevated with ST300 but not with ST306 (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). This result suggests that only active PLY-expressing pneumococci are able to induce cardiac injury. Furthermore, infecting mice (i.v 10<sup>6</sup> CFUs) with a clinical invasive disease isolate of serotype 6B produced similar release of cardiac troponins into the circulation (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>), whereas an infection with a complete PLY-deletion mutant (ΔPLY) [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] did not yield cardiac troponin release (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>In a recent publication using a model of peritoneal infection, Brown <italic>et al</italic> reported that myocardial microlesion development was largely dependent on pneumococcal translocation to the myocardial tissue, which required the pneumococcal adhesin Choline binding protein A (CbpA) and that use of a CbpA-deficient pneumococcus on the serotype 4 background (TIGR4) resulted in significant reduction in microlesion formation within 24 h of infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, using a CbpA-deficient pneumococcus (ΔCbpA) on the serotype 2 background (D39) in a model of pneumococcal sepsis, we found that circulating cardiac troponins (I and T) were significantly elevated as early as 12 h post infection, with higher levels at 24 h (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1004836.g001" ref-type="fig">1D</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004836.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A</xref>). Levels of cTnI in the circulation of mice infected with D39, serotype-1 (ST300), serotype 6B and CbpA-deficient pneumococci were comparable and reached levels as high as ~110–200 pg/ml (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>), approximately 10-fold higher than the normal levels observed in humans (~14 pg/ml). These results suggest that the pneumococcal adhesin CbpA has no major role in inducing cardiac injury in our model of IPD and that cardiac troponins are only elevated in the circulation of mice challenged with PLY-expressing pneumococci. Furthermore, we found a significant linear correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.688, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) between pneumococcal burden in the blood and circulating cTnI levels (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>), suggesting an association between the severity of bacteraemia and that of cardiac injury. In recent work, we have shown that circulating PLY as a major source of toxicity during IPD can be directly targeted by specifically engineered liposomes that compete with host cells for PLY-binding and result in significant improvement in mice survival [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We show here that injecting mice i.v. with toxin-sequestering liposomes (100 mg/kg) 30 min after injecting them with WT D39 pneumococci, resulted in a significant reduction in circulating cTnI by 12 and 24 h post-infection to levels as low as 12–15 pg/ml (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1004836.g001" ref-type="fig">1F</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004836.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B</xref>). These results strongly indicate that circulating PLY is the major source of cardiac injury. Seventy percent of D39-challenged mice died within 30 h of infection, whereas none of the PLY-deficient (PLN-A or ΔPLY)-infected mice (0/5) died (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>), in line with results from previous studies [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Interestingly, mice that died within 30 h of D39 infection, had significantly higher circulating cTnI levels at 12 h and 24 h (179±23 pg/ml) than mice that survived (39±10 pg/ml) (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>) suggesting that elevated cardiac troponins in this context could be reflective of greater disease severity and worse outcomes. Collectively, these data suggest that PLY-induced cardiac injury potentially contribute to increased mortality during invasive pneumococcal infection.</p>
<p>Histo-pathological examination of heart sections from mice infected with either serotype 2 (D39) or a highly invasive clinical serotype-1 isolate and serotype 6B, as well as PLY-expressing but CbpA-deficient pneumococci showed no evidence of gross myocardial abnormalities (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1004836.g001" ref-type="fig">1I</xref>, <italic>a-c</italic> and <xref rid="ppat.1004836.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B</xref>) but revealed inflammatory cell infiltration into the myocardium (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1I</xref>, <italic>d-g</italic>). Furthermore, we were unable to identify pneumococcal colonization in any of the heart sections (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1004836.g001" ref-type="fig">1I</xref>, <italic>i-j</italic> and <xref rid="ppat.1004836.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B</xref>). Careful histo-pathological examination of cardiac tissue sections from mice that died between 24 h and 96 h after infection (with D39, serotype-1, 6B and CbpA-deficient pneumococci) showed only minimal numbers of inflammatory cell infiltration in loci around microvessels within the myocardium. We also investigated whether apoptotic changes were affecting the myocardium, but were unable to detect activation of apoptotic markers in murine hearts infected with serotype-2, serotype-1 or 6B even after 96 h of infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1I</xref>, <italic>l-n</italic>). Collectively, our data strongly suggest that circulating PLY, released by pneumococci in the bloodstream, mediates myocardial inflammatory changes and injury but these are not accompanied by pneumococcal colonization or apoptotic changes of the myocardium in our model of IPD.</p>

<title>Circulating pore-performing PLY mediates myocardial injury and death</title>
<p>To test if circulating PLY could cause cardiac injury directly, purified PLY was injected through mouse tail veins with its non-pore forming mutant PdB as a control. We found that injection of PLY (200 ng PLY/g mouse) induced high levels of circulating cTnI and cTnT, 81±6 pg/ml at 12 h and 195±40 pg/ml at 24 h after injection (Fig <xref rid="ppat.1004836.g002" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004836.g002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). In contrast, PdB (400 ng/g) did not produce detectable levels of circulating cardiac troponins in mice (Fig <xref rid="ppat.1004836.g002" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004836.g002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>), indicating that the cellular pore-forming properties of PLY are central to cardiac injury. PLY at a concentration of 400 ng/g caused death in all treated mice within 30 min (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). PLY at 200 ng/g induced a bimodal response causing 5/11 mice to die within the first 6 h and the remainder (6/11) survived until euthanized at 72 h (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Whilst cardiac injury may contribute to the early deterioration seen in approximately half of mice treated with lower dose PLY, it is unlikely to be the only factor and extensive cytolysis is also likely to play a role. We found no evidence of elevated circulating cardiac troponins in mice dying within 6 h post injection of PLY (200 ng/g), but this is unsurprising given that cardiac troponins typically peak in the circulation 12–24 h after cardiac injury [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, histo-pathological examination of the myocardium did reveal signs of inflammatory cell infiltration as early as 6 h post injection of PLY (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref><italic>a</italic>) but these were also observed in mice that survived for up to 24 h (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref><italic>b</italic>) and, as expected, were absent when PdB was injected (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref><italic>c</italic>).

<title>Antibiotics lyse pneumococci to release PLY and exacerbate cardiomyocyte injury</title>

No reduction in viability was seen when PLN-A pneumococci were lysed with antibiotics, clearly suggesting that released PLY was responsible for the effect seen.

<p>A significant decrease in the total number of spontaneously contracting cardiomyocytes was observed following WT D39 infection, with 230±26 cells/microscopic field before treatment reducing to 180±12 cells/field after 2 h of incubation with 5x10<sup>6</sup> CFU/ml D39 (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>).

When cardiomyocytes were incubated with D39 in media containing antibiotics, the reduction in the number of spontaneously contracting cells was even more dramatic with ~10±8 cells/ field within 30 min and no contracting cells after 60 min (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Once again, no such reductions were observed when cardiomyocytes were infected with PLN-A, suggesting that PLY release following D39 lysis was able to severely affect cardiomyocyte function.</p>
<p>Using a cell edge-recognition system (IonOptix) to record real-time changes in cardiomyocyte shortening (i.e. contractility) [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], infection with D39 at 5x10<sup>6</sup> CFU/ml induced slow and irregular beats in a time-dependent manner (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>) suggesting major rhythm disturbance. After 4 h of infection with D39, Peak Shortening (indicator of peak contraction) dropped to 63.6±6.3% (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.015) and the maximum velocity of shortening (+dL/dt) (indicator of maximum velocity of ventricular muscle contraction) fell from 423±25 μm/s (untreated control) to 236±23 μm/sat 4 h (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003).

<title>Sub-lytic concentrations of PLY induce cardiomyocyte dysfunction <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>To investigate whether purified PLY can directly induce cardiomyocyte injury and dysfunction, HL-1 cardiomyocytes were incubated with purified PLY at a range of concentrations. Within 30 min, PLY at 1.5 μg/ml (equal to 150 Haemolytic Units “HU”) significantly reduced cell viability to 76.2±7.0% (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01). Higher PLY concentrations caused a dose-dependent decline in viability (48.2±10.1% and 16.5±7.1% for PLY at 2 and 3 μg/ml, respectively) (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). There was also a time-dependent effect with cell viability continuing to decline to approximately 50% after 2 h incubation with PLY at 1.5 μg/ml (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). These results are consistent with those reported by Brown <italic>et al</italic> in which high lytic doses of PLY caused direct cardiomyocyte lysis [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, at lower <italic>sub-lytic</italic> concentrations of PLY, which did not affect cell viability (1 μg/ml PLY at 100 HU), a significant drop in the total number of spontaneously contracting HL-1 cells (214±18/field at 0 min vs 71±14/field at 30 min) (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>) was observed initially, followed by gradual recovery.

<p>Using Ion-Optix, PLY at 1 μg/ml induced a slow and irregular rhythm in HL-1 cells within a few minutes, with rates of contraction dropping from 4–5 Hz (beat/s) to 2–3 Hz and 1–2 Hz at 10 and 30 min after treatment, respectively (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>).

<title>Sub-lytic concentrations of PLY induce profound calcium influx leading to cardiomyocyte injury</title>
<p>To understand how the pore-forming property of PLY causes cardiomyocyte dysfunction, HL-1 cells were incubated with FITC-labelled PLY. At a high lytic dose (5 μg/ml), propidium iodide (PI) entered cells after PLY binding to the cell membrane (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>) thereby suggesting PLY cytolytic action and subsequent cell death. However, at sub-lytic concentrations (≤1 μg/ml), no PI was noted inside the cells despite obvious FITC-PLY binding to the cell membrane (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). On the other hand, PdB even at a concentration of 5 μg/ml failed to cause any PI influx (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>) further confirming that the pore-forming property of native PLY is essential for cardiomyocyte injury. We also noticed that PdB had a reduced ability to bind to cardiomyocyte membranes (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>) as compared to PLY. This may be attributable to the Trp-433 Phe mutation in PdB, which is within the glycan-binding pocket of PLY and can interfere with the ability of the toxin to bind glycans prior to membrane insertion, as recently reported by Shewell <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, some binding is still detectable with PdB (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>) suggesting that lack of binding alone does not explain the complete absence of toxicity as compared to PLY.

<title>PLY activates pathways associated with sepsis and cardiac dysfunction</title>
<p>Cardiac dysfunction and failure, which is characterized by varying degrees of loss of cardiac function, is frequently associated with activation of signalling events within cardiomyocytes in response to external stimuli [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
<p>The PKC-cTnI axis is a well-characterized Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive pathway that modulates the contractile performance of cardiomyocytes by post-translational modifications of myofilament proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Activation of this signalling pathway is commonly observed in septic patients with cardiac dysfunction [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] but the underlying stimuli remain poorly understood. By measuring the translocation of relevant PKC isoforms from the cytosol to the membrane fraction of HL-1 cardiomyocytes, which is a hallmark sign of their activation [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], we show that PLY caused significant translocation (i.e. activation) of two Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PKC isoforms: PKCα and PKCβII (Fig <xref rid="ppat.1004836.g007" ref-type="fig">7A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004836.g007" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive PKCβI was also investigated but found to be expressed at very low levels in cardiomyocyte lysates and not detectable in sub-cellular fractions (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive PKC isoforms, such as PKCε, PKCδ (novel PKCs) and PKCζ (atypical PKC) were not affected by PLY (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>). We further investigated whether PLY enhanced the localization of these two PKC isoforms to cardiac myofilaments, as this would have functional implications [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. <xref rid="ppat.1004836.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref> demonstrates that PLY increased the association of PKCα and PKCβII with the Triton X-100-insoluble (myofilament) fraction of HL-1 cells. Successful separation of the myofilament fraction from other cellular compartments using Triton X-100 (1%) is demonstrated in <xref rid="ppat.1004836.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3C Fig</xref> (HL-1 cells) and <xref rid="ppat.1004836.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3D Fig</xref> (murine cardiomyocytes). More importantly, PLY induced dose-dependent phosphorylation of (cTnI) at the PKC-dependent phosphorylation sites (S43 and T144) (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>), which is known to reduce myofilament responsiveness to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, actin-myosin cross-bridge cycling velocity with eventual effects on contractile force [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. To test the functional consequences of the activation of PKCα and PKCβII on HL-1 cardiomyocytes, these two isoforms were blocked by 1 h incubation with 5 nM PKCα inhibitor Go6976 (reported IC50 for PKCα is 2.3–5 nM) and 10 nM PKCβII inhibitor LY333531 (reported IC50 for PKCβII is 10 nM) [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] prior to PLY (1.0 μg/ml) treatment. Blocking PKCα resulted in significant attenuation of PLY-induced cTnI phosphorylation (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>) and improvement in Peak Shortening (untreated set as 100%, PLY 70±11%, and PLY+Go6976 90±4%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.012) (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>) and in +dL/dt (untreated 459±68, PLY 185±45 and PLY+Go6976 397±23 μm/s, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7G</xref>) but PKCβII inhibitor did not show significant effects.

<p>Another signalling pathway that is commonly associated with myocardial dysfunction during invasive infections and sepsis is the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. It is now understood that disturbance in the excitation-contraction coupling of cardiomyocytes with abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup> haemostasis activates ER stress [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], which ultimately precipitates cardiomyocyte dysfunction [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Furthermore, if the ER stress is not alleviated in a timely manner apoptosis may ensue through the IRE1-JNK-caspase 3 pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] or p-IF2α-CHOP pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Treating HL-1 cardiomyocytes with PLY for 30 min activated several ER stress markers including eIF2α, IRE1 and the chaperone protein BiP even at sub-lytic concentrations &lt;1.5 μg/ml (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>). Furthermore, JNK and ERK were also similarly activated (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>), however we did not observe activation of the p-38 MAPK. Although it has been previously reported that PLY-induced increment in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] <sub>i</sub> can trigger apoptosis in mammalian cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and Brown <italic>et al</italic> have suggested that PLY may be inducing immune-quiescent cardiomyocyte apoptosis [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], PLY failed to induce the ER-stress associated apoptotic marker, CHOP, or the general apoptosis marker, caspase-3 (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>) (even after 8 hours of treatment with both sub-lytic and lytic doses). These data strongly agree with our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings on the absence of caspase-3 activation in murine hearts exposed to infection with pneumococci (serotype 1, 2 and 6B) or to purified PLY. Nevertheless, alleviating ER stress in HL-1 cardiomyocytes with 10 mM 4-phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA), a chaperon that has previously been shown to efficiently rescue ER stress-induced cardiac dysfunction in various settings [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], significantly attenuated the PLY-induced deficit in peak shortening (UT set as 100%, PLY 72±6% vs PLY+4-PBA 91±10%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.041) (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C</xref>) and in +dL/dt (UT 458±43, PLY 217±41 μm/sec vs PLY+4-PBA 395±29 μm/sec, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8D</xref>). Other parameters of contractile function (TTP, tR<sub>90</sub> and—dL/dt) were also improved by 4-PBA (<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8E</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004836.g008" ref-type="fig">8G</xref>). These data strongly suggest that ER stress is one of the pathways mediating contractile dysfunction following PLY treatment, although we found no evidence to suggest that ER stress progresses to cardiomyocyte apoptosis in response to PLY.</p>

<p>To determine whether <italic>in vivo</italic> cardiac injury was caused by the same mechanisms as demonstrated in cultured cardiomyocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>, the same signalling pathways in murine cardiac muscle cells were examined after exposure to D39 or purified PLY.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have shown that <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and its toxin PLY can induce serious cardiac injury and dysfunction. As unexplained acute cardiac events arising during pneumococcal infection are common and associated with an increased risk of fatality, our findings highlight an important potential explanation. We thereby suggest a new mechanism by which cardiac injury occurs and explain how circulating PLY actively drives acute cardiac injuries in the absence of any pneumococcal colonization of the heart. This also explains why effective antibiotic therapy does not immediately reduce cardiac risk as treatment is associated with bacterial lysis and subsequent release of PLY, which would in turn disrupt normal cardiac function. In our model of IPD, the consistency of our findings using three different pneumococcal serotypes (serotype 1, serotype 2 and 6B) strongly suggest that blood circulating PLY is the major mediator of cardiomyocyte injury, dysfunction and death. We show that intravenous injection of PLY into mice caused substantial release of cardiac troponins; biomarkers of cardiomyocyte injury, into the circulation as quickly as 12 hours post infection, with peak levels at 24 hours post injection, suggesting early and significant cardiomyocyte injury.</p>
<p>Our findings complement and further extend on a recent study by Brown <italic>et al</italic> which provided evidence for myocardial microlesion formation subsequent to pneumococcal translocation across the myocardial vasculature by pneumococcal-endothelial cell interactions mediated by the CbpA-Laminine receptor (LR) and ChoP-Platelet activating factor receptor (PAFR) [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Brown <italic>et al</italic> showed that by use of anti-PLY antibodies, myocardial microlesion formation could be prevented. However, when purified PLY was directly administered by retro-orbital injection into mice, this failed to induce myocardial microlesions suggesting that at least in their model of infection, cardiomyocyte damage occurred remotely possibly via release of pneumococcal toxic mediators such as PLY or other pneumococcal factors such as capsular polysaccharide subsequent to pneumococcal translocation to the myocardium [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Hence, a direct role for PLY was not identified as purified PLY failed to induce microlesions in the myocardium despite causing major inflammation and sloughing of the endothelial cells in the myocardial vasculature [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In contrast, our findings indicate that blood circulating PLY is <italic>key</italic> to cardiomyocyte damage <italic>in vivo</italic>, regardless of pneumococcal translocation or colonization of the myocardium. This is supported by our demonstration that i.v. injection of wild type whole (PLY-expressing) pneumococci, but not PLY-deficient pneumococci, trigger substantial release of cardiac troponins into the circulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate a similar elevation of circulating cardiac injury biomarkers in experiments performed with a PLY-expressing but CbpA-deficient strain, which was unable to adhere to the vascular endothelium or translocate to the myocardium. This finding further indicates that myocardial injury can happen in the absence of direct pneumococcal translocation or infection of the myocardium. It must be highlighted of course that our model of IPD is distinct from that used by Brown <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The bolus injection of pneumococci into the blood stream used in our model could have resulted in rapid disease progression and different host immune responses that may have prevented the development of myocardial infective foci. However, in terms of clinical relevance, our findings are in line with several post-mortem studies performed on patients dying of fulminant pneumococcal sepsis, which showed pneumococci in the blood stream and lungs but documented no myocardial pneumococcal colonization or gross myocardial abnormalities [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. This is in contrast to the recent finding by Brown <italic>et al</italic> documenting myocardial vacuolar lesions in 2 out of 9 (22%) adult human autopsies succumbing to IPD [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Finally, a potential further difference, is that experiments with purified PLY were performed at different concentrations, via different routes of administration (intravenous vs. retro-orbital) with different outcomes (cardiac troponin release vs myocardial microlesion formation) examined in our study compared to Brown <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p>
<p>A key finding of our study was the potential correlation between elevated cardiac troponins in mice and their increased mortality. Mice with high levels of circulating cardiac troponins at 24 hours post exposure to PLY-expressing pneumococci were significantly less likely to survive. This is a significant finding as it is well established that elevated cardiac troponins strongly predict and correlate with cardiac muscle dysfunction as well as prognosis of patients [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. This confirms that PLY plays a pivotal role in cardiomyocyte damage during pneumococcal infections <italic>in vivo</italic> and also suggests that circulating PLY may contribute to the elevated troponin levels frequently detected in patients with CAP [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The clinical implications of our findings are supported by a previous study documenting the high prevalence (41%) of pneumococcal infections in septic patients admitted to the intensive care unit with elevated cardiac troponin levels [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Importantly, we provide a novel therapeutic application for targeting circulating PLY using engineered liposomes that sequester circulating PLY [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] to attenuate cardiac injury and the elevation of cardiac troponins during IPD. This has not been shown before and clearly demonstrates that therapeutic interventions which neutralise circulating PLY and its action, may have significant clinical benefit to patients with pneumococcal disease.</p>
<p>We also demonstrate the ability of pneumococci to directly damage and kill cardiac muscle cells, via PLY release, irrespective of pneumococcal colonization of the myocardium. This is supported by the observations that (1) PLY-deficient pneumococci were completely attenuated in their ability to induce cardiomyocyte dysfunction, (2) using antibiotics in culture to lyse PLY-expressing pneumococci (and therefore release PLY [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]), further exacerbated the toxic effects on cardiomyocytes, an outcome which was absent when antibiotics were used with PLY-deficient pneumococci, (3) the use of PLY-sequestering liposomes in the circulation of mice significantly attenuated cardiac injury subsequent to infection with WT PLY-expressing pneumococci and (4) i.v. injection of purified PLY caused substantial increases in circulating cardiac troponins and myocardial inflammation. We also show strong inflammatory cell infiltration into the myocardial tissue using three different WT pneumococcal serotypes (1, 2 and 6B). This observation remained consistent when we used PLY-expressing but CbpA-deficient pneumococci or purified PLY injections, suggesting that such changes are independent of CbpA-mediated pneumococcal translocation to the myocardium. Such strong inflammatory changes are typically associated with necrotic cell death and this is further supported by the absence of cardiomyocyte apoptosis in our IPD model. Indeed, PLY failed to induce apoptotic markers, such as CHOP or caspase-3, even after prolonged treatment for up to 8 hours, although it did induce ER stress and MAPK pathways (IRE1, p-eIF2α, JNK) that can turn pro-apoptotic in certain cases. Importantly though, we were unable to identify activation of caspase-3 in heart sections from mice dying of IPD between 24 and 96h post infection with pneumococci (serotype-2, serotype-1 6B and CbpA-deficient strains) or post PLY i.v. injection. These findings suggest that apoptosis is unlikely to be the mode of death of cardiomyocytes in these circumstances and that a necrotic cellular death is more plausible, especially given the intense inflammatory cell infiltration into the myocardium and cardiac troponin release without gross myocardial abnormality in our model of IPD.</p>
<p>The major molecular mechanism of PLY cytotoxicity is in its ability to disrupt the cell membrane by binding to cholesterol and causing pore formation. We established the importance of the membrane-binding and pore-forming abilities of PLY to pneumococcal-induced cardiomyocyte dysfunction by demonstrating that a PLY-mutant (pneumolysin toxoid B “PdB”), with significantly reduced membrane-binding and pore forming abilities [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], can still bind to cardiomyocyte membranes but without causing functional consequences. Wild type PLY binds to cardiomyocyte membrane to induce cell death at high concentrations (≥1.5 μg/ml in our experiments). More interestingly, however, we report here that at <italic>sub-lytic</italic> doses, PLY induces a range of cellular events with adverse functional implications including depolarization of the cellular membrane, calcium overload and activation of signalling pathways with known detrimental effects to cardiomyocyte function and wellbeing. These data are consistent with a mechanism whereby sub-lytic concentrations of PLY can disrupt plasma membrane integrity and increase its permeability to ions, whilst high concentrations of PLY can cause large pore formation, cellular lysis and cell death. Indeed, this finding is in agreement with recent reports that PLY can generate multiple conductance (different size) pores in membranes depending on its concentration [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Significant cardiomyocyte depolarization in various settings is known to be associated with reduced excitation and conduction velocity and may contribute to arrhythmogensis [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In our experiments, cardiomyocyte membrane potentials were depolarized by ~50% in response to sub-lytic PLY concentrations. We also observed disturbance of spontaneous rhythm in cultured cardiomyocytes after exposure to PLY, but interestingly this effect may be spontaneously recoverable. The abnormal permeability to ions and resultant membrane depolarization induced by PLY may be a major mechanism of arrhythmia, which frequently occurs in patients with pneumococcal infection. Our observation of significant membrane depolarization and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> strongly indicate PLY-induced permeability changes as exemplified by a strong Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, an effect well-known to mediate PLY toxicity in various mammalian cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. These PLY induced effects have not been reported before for cardiomyocytes or associated with cardiac injury and dysfunction.</p>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload is a major mediator of cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction, injury/death, as well as arrhythmias [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude and activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive signalling pathways, such as PKCα-cTnI, and induction of ER stress both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> may play an important role in reducing contractile performance. Previous studies have documented that PKCα activation and enhanced association with cardiac myofilaments convey negative effects on contractility [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Our finding that PLY-induced cTnI phosphorylation is mainly PKCα-dependent is therefore of significant relevance and in line with previous clinical studies [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] highlighting the potential of PKCα and ER stress inhibition as therapeutic options for cardiac dysfunction. Future studies may be tailored to investigate the potential development of arrhythmias and myocardial contractile dysfunction <italic>in vivo</italic> during IPD and the impact of such complications on survival using electrocardiogram (ECG), echo and intra-ventricular catheters. Such studies will be crucial to exploring the efficacy of liposome-based toxin sequestration therapy [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] as well as PKCα [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] and ER stress [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] inhibition to alleviating cardiac injury during IPD.</p>
<p>Collectively, our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of cardiomyocytes and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of invasive pneumococcal infection demonstrate that pneumococci are toxic to cardiomyocytes and that the pneumococcal toxin (PLY), is the major mediator of cardiomyocyte damage, dysfunction and death. The underlying molecular mechanisms, as summarized in <xref rid="ppat.1004836.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>, provide a novel explanation for cardiomyocyte injury during invasive pneumococcal infection, which often precipitates life-threatening cardiac complications. Depending on its concentration, PLY can mediate extensive cardiomyocyte damage, lysis and death or a wide range of deleterious signalling events driven by pore-formation and calcium overload. Furthermore, our findings open a novel translational pathway of utilizing circulating PLY as a biomarker to predict acute cardiac injury development in patients and for targeting PLY specifically during invasive pneumococcal disease to reduce the risk of development of cardiac complications. Novel translational strategies and techniques to accurately detect and quantify circulating levels of PLY in patients with IPD are therefore exigent. Indeed, we demonstrate here the therapeutic potential of using specifically targeted toxin sequestration therapy against PLY <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], to protect against cardiac injury during IPD.</p>

<title>The mechanisms and effects of PLY on cardiomyocytes.</title>
<p>High lytic concentrations of PLY induce large pore formation to lyse cells. However, <italic>sub-lytic</italic> concentrations of PLY bind cellular membrane to induce smaller pores thereby triggering profound Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into cardiomyocytes. The resulting abnormal increment in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> causes significant membrane depolarization, activation of detrimental signalling pathways (e.g. PKCα-cTnI axis, ER stress) and reductions in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude to cause rhythm disturbance and depression in contractile force. Ultimately, Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload causes cellular injury which may account for cardiac troponin leakage from cardiomyocytes into the circulation. Toxin-sequestering liposomes offer a potential novel therapeutic intervention against the toxic effects of circulating PLY.</p>

<title>Preparation of bacteria and pneumolysin</title>
<p><italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> serotype 2, strain D39 (NCTC 7466), was obtained from the National Collection of Type Culture, London, UK. Its isogenic pneumolysin-negative mutant, PLN-A, was generated by insertion duplication mutagenesis, as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The ΔPLY strain was generated by <italic>ply</italic>-deletion in D39, as described previously[<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The CbpA deletion generated on the serotype 2 (D39) background was a kind gift from Prof. Jeremy Brown (UCL, UK). Serotype 6B (sequence type 138) and serotype-1 (sequence type 300) were both clinical isolates taken from patients with sepsis. Serotype-1 (sequence type 306) was a clinical isolate from a patient with emphysema. Briefly, bacteria from bead stocks were streaked onto blood agar and grown overnight at 37°C. Pneumococci were identified by presence of a zone of alpha haemolysis around each colony and a zone of inhibition around an optochin disc. A sweep of colonies was inoculated into brain heart infusion (BHI) broth and grown statically overnight at 37°C. The next day a small volume of overnight growth was sub-cultured into BHI 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum and grown statically for 4–6 hours until mid-log phase growth (OD500 1.4), at which point broth was divided into 500μl aliquots and stored at -80°C in BHI broth containing 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum for no more than 6 months until use [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Prior to use in experiments, two stock aliquots were thawed at room temperature and plated on blood agar by Miles and Misra dilution to quantify stock concentrations (CFUs). Recombinant wildtype PLY and its derivative PdB (0.1% haemolytic activity of wild type PLY) were expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and purified, as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. After purification, the toxin was passed 3 times through an EndoTrap endotoxin removal column (Profos AG, Germany) after which LPS was undetectable using the PyroGene Recombinant Factor C assay (Lonza; detection limit 0.01 EU/ml). PLY and PdB purities were &gt;97% as determined by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Haemolytic activity of PLY (and PdB) was determined as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] by serial dilution of the toxin into sheep erythrocytes. Unless otherwise stated, the specific haemolytic activity of PLY was 100,000 HU/mg.</p>

Mice were monitored for signs of disease, pain score was determined using the scheme of Morton [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] and animals were euthanized if they reached the experimental endpoint. Liposomes 100 mg/kg of a 1:1 mixture of Cholesterol:Sphingomyelin (66 mol/% cholesterol) and Sphingomyelin only liposomes were injected i.v. 30 min following infection with D39. Blood samples were withdrawn from the tail vein at periodic intervals post-injection for assessment of plasma cardiac troponin levels. Briefly, blood samples were withdrawn from the tail vein before and 12 and 24 h after i.v. injection of D39, PLN-A, serotype-1 (ST300 and ST306), serotype 6B, ΔPLY pneumococci and CbpA-knockout pneumococci (1x10<sup>6</sup> CFU in 50 μl PBS) or PLY (200 ng/g)/PdB (400 ng/g). 3 μl of each plasma sample was mixed with SDS lysis buffer, boiled at 100°C for 10 min and cardiac troponins were measured by Western blotting using specific antibodies against cTnI (Abcam) and cTnT (Cell signalling). cTnI was quantified by running known concentrations of recombinant cTnI together with the samples.</p>

<title>HL-1 cardiomyocyte contractility and Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux</title>
<p>HL-1 cardiomyocyte contractility and Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux were recorded using a video edge-recognition system (IonOptix, MyoCam-S, Dublin, Ireland), as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004836.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Briefly, 10<sup>6</sup> cells were seeded into 35 mm glass-bottom tissue culture dishes (Corning) and cultured at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> until approximately &gt;75% of the cells were spontaneously contracting (2–3 days). Experiments were performed on spontaneously contracting as well as on paced cardiomyocytes (at 5 Hz) and comparable results were obtained. Cells that showed irregular contractions or no response to electrical stimulation were excluded. After one minute of recording, treatment was gently perfused across the cells and contractility was recorded for a period of 30 min. In experiments with chemical inhibitors (Go6976 or LY333531 (Sigma) or 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA, Calbiochem), these were pre-incubated with the cells for 1 h prior to PLY treatment. All recordings were performed at 37°C. Mechanical parameters of contractility (Peak Shortening, TTP, tR<sub>90</sub>, +dL/dt and -dL/dt) were analyzed using the Ion-Wizard 6.0 software.</p>
<p>For Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux recording, Fura-2AM (Invitrogen) (10 μM) was incubated with cells for 45 min, washed and incubated at 37°C for a further 10 min in fully supplemented Claycomb medium to allow the dye to de-esterify. Cells were then mounted into an inverted microscope and intracellular calcium flux was recorded continuously using an Optoscan monochromator fluorescence photometry (Cairn Research, Faversham, Kent, UK) for 30 min after treatment. Fluorescence signals were elicited by alternate excitations with respective wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm at 250 Hz and recorded at 510 nm through a photomultiplier tube. In order to quantify [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, cells were treated with (10 mM) Caffeine (Sigma,UK) to get the maximum (R<sub>max</sub>) and (25 mM) EDTA to get the minimum (R<sub>min</sub>) intensity. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> = Kd*(R-R<sub>min</sub>)/(R<sub>max</sub>-R)*Sf2/Sb2, where Kd is the Fura-2AM dissociation constant (set at 225 nM). The values of Sb2 and Sf2 correspond to fluorescence excited by the denominator wavelength under conditions of saturating calcium levels (bound state) and in the absence of calcium (calcium-free state) respectively.</p>

<title>Preparation of cell lysates and subcellular fractionations</title>
<p>For cell lysates, HL-1 cells were directly lysed using SDS lysis buffer, whilst mouse left ventricular (LV) tissues were homogenised in the lysis buffer. Subcellular fractionation was performed as previously described with slight modifications. In brief, HL-1 cells or homogenized murine LV tissues in homogenization buffer (25 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol) were shredded by passing through 31 gauge needles. The nuclear fraction was removed by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 5 min and resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 g for 45 min to separate cytosolic (supernatant) and membrane (pellet) fractions. For myofilament fraction purification, HL-1 and murine cardiomyocytes were incubated with 1% Triton X-100 in ice-cold PBS with shaking for 10 min. The resultant supernatant, mainly containing cytosolic and membrane fractions, was transferred to a separate tube. This process was repeated 3 times and the remaining Triton X-100-insoluble (myofilament) fraction was lysed with SDS lysis buffer and subjected to Western blotting.</p>
