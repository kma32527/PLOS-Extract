<abstract>
<p>The obligate intracellular bacterium <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> invades into host cells to replicate inside a membrane-bound vacuole called inclusion. Multiple different host proteins are recruited to the inclusion and are functionally modulated to support chlamydial development. Invaded and replicating <italic>Chlamydia</italic> induces a long-lasting activation of the PI3 kinase signaling pathway that is required for efficient replication. We identified the cell surface tyrosine kinase EphrinA2 receptor (EphA2) as a chlamydial adherence and invasion receptor that induces PI3 kinase (PI3K) activation, promoting chlamydial replication. Interfering with binding of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> serovar L2 (<italic>Ctr</italic>) to EphA2, downregulation of EphA2 expression or inhibition of EphA2 activity significantly reduced <italic>Ctr</italic> infection. <italic>Ctr</italic> interacts with and activates EphA2 on the cell surface resulting in <italic>Ctr</italic> and receptor internalization. During chlamydial replication, EphA2 remains active accumulating around the inclusion and interacts with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K to support the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway that is required for normal chlamydial development. Overexpression of full length EphA2, but not the mutant form lacking the intracellular cytoplasmic domain, enhanced PI3K activation and <italic>Ctr</italic> infection. Despite the depletion of EphA2 from the cell surface, <italic>Ctr</italic> infection induces upregulation of EphA2 through the activation of the ERK pathway, which keeps the infected cell in an apoptosis-resistant state. The significance of EphA2 as an entry and intracellular signaling receptor was also observed with the urogenital <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic>-serovar D. Our findings provide the first evidence for a host cell surface receptor that is exploited for invasion as well as for receptor-mediated intracellular signaling to facilitate chlamydial replication. In addition, the engagement of a cell surface receptor at the inclusion membrane is a new mechanism by which <italic>Chlamydia</italic> subverts the host cell and induces apoptosis resistance.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> are major human pathogens causing ocular and sexually transmitted diseases with hundreds of millions of cases per year. <italic>Chlamydia</italic> replicate inside the host cell in a membrane bound vacuole called inclusion. The current concept on how <italic>Chlamydia</italic> communicates with the host cell during its replication is based on the identification of the host protein that interacts with <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Here, we describe that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis-</italic>serovar L2 and D use EphA2, a member of the largest class of human receptor tyrosine kinases, as an adherence and entry receptor that is endocytosed together with the bacteria. Cell surface EphA2 receptor is adopted by <italic>Chlamydia</italic> to function also at the inclusion to support growth and replication and to keep the infected cell in an apoptosis resistant state. Thus, we show that EphA2 is an undiscovered important surface and intracellular signaling receptor that is crucial for chlamydial infection and development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, obligate intracellular human pathogens, cause a broad range of acute and chronic diseases in humans [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> serovars A-C are the cause of infectious blindness called trachoma, serovars D-K cause urinary or genital tract infections and serovars L1-L2 are associated with lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). <italic>C</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> infections can result in community-acquired pneumonia and other respiratory infections. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> has a biphasic developmental life cycle: infectious non-replicating elementary bodies (EB) are taken up by the host and transform into non-infectious reticulate bodies (RB) that reside and replicate inside a vacuole called inclusion. At the end of the cycle, RB differentiate back to EB that are released from the cell and start a new round of infection.</p>
<p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry into cells is a multifaceted process generally initiated by the interactions that occur between outer membrane proteins (OMPs) or type three secreted effectors, such as TARP with cell surface receptor and co-receptor molecules [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. To maintain the life cycle inside the inclusion, <italic>Chlamydia</italic> are believed to secrete various effector proteins via their type three secretion system (T3SS), either into the host cell cytoplasm or through the inclusion membrane. Chlamydial inclusion membrane (Inc) proteins are integrated into the inclusion membrane and have been shown to interact with multiple host proteins and thereby manipulate the host cell [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. <italic>Chlamydia</italic> is able to intercept trafficking vesicles via the recruitment of Rab proteins, which are able to specifically ‚Äúsnatch‚Äù vesicles from the retrograde intra-Golgi trafficking or interact with host organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Host cell surface proteins including the estrogen receptor complex [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and its subunit the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] are involved in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> infection. For other chlamydial species, host cell receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and their associated intracellular signaling cascades have been shown to play a pivotal role in facilitating adherence and regulating the infection. The platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) is involved in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>muridarum</italic> uptake into non-phagocytic cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) is activated upon <italic>C</italic>. <italic>muridarum</italic> infection and is recruited to the cell surface associated EB [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) serves as an invasion receptor for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Several host signaling pathways have been shown to play an essential role for chlamydial development [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Signaling via PI3 kinase is required for normal development of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and to keep the infected cell in an apoptosis resistant state [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To date, the mechanisms of how PI3 kinase is activated in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected cells are not known.</p>
<p>Ephrin receptors and their membrane-bound ligands, Ephrins, constitute the largest known subfamily of RTKs, consisting of 16 receptors and 9 ligands that control important functions during development and adulthood (reviewed in [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]), including embryonic axon guidance, angiogenesis, cell death, migration and differentiation in development [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A unique feature of these receptors is their ability to undergo uni- and bidirectional signaling [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Forward signaling is mediated by the receptor-expressing cells upon ligand interaction, whereas reverse signaling is initiated by the ligand-expressing cell, both often mediating opposite effects. EphrinA2 receptor (EphA2) possess a highly conserved N-terminal glycosylated extracellular ligand-binding domain, a cysteine-rich region and two fibronectin type III repeats on the extracellular portion. The intracellular region of EphA2 is comprised of a juxtamembrane domain, a kinase domain, sterile alpha motif (SAM) and PDZ binding motif [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which are essential to mediate protein-protein interactions. EphA2 and its glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked ligand Ephrin-A1 act at the crosstalk between PI3K, MAPK, Src family kinases, Rho and Rac1 GTPases [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. EphA2 is also considered to be an attractive therapeutic target against several human malignancies [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p>
<p>In the current study, we have identified EphA2 as a receptor for adherence and entry of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic>. Despite a rapid strong upregulation, EphA2 is depleted from the surface of infected cells and accumulates around the inclusion. EphA2 recruits and activates PI3 kinase, which is required for efficient replication of <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Further, interference with EphA2 signaling affects normal infection and renders <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-infected cells sensitive to apoptosis induction. Thus, our results demonstrate that the cell surface receptor EphA2 is adopted by the chlamydial inclusion to support growth and replication.</p>

<title>Adherence assay</title>
<p><italic>Chlamydia</italic> adherence assay was performed by pretreating the cells with rhEphrin-A1 (5 Œºg/ml) or with control for 1 h at 37¬∞C followed by infection with purified EB for 1 h at 4¬∞C in HBSS media (Life Technologies). EB was treated with rhEphA2 or with control (rhPHB) in a serum free media containing 0.1% BSA for 1 h at 37¬∞C and the mixture was added to the cells and incubated for 1 h at 4¬∞C. Cell surface EphA2 was blocked using control (IgG) or antibodies (10 Œºg/ml) against specific proteins for 1 h at 4¬∞C followed by infection with EB for 1 h at 4¬∞C. Before fixing the cells for immunostaining, cells were washed three times with PBS.

<title>EphA2 serves as a host cell receptor for <italic>Ctr</italic> adherence</title>
<p>The broadly accepted concept of the inclusion membrane as a signaling platform that orchestrates <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-host cell interaction prompted us to look for host cell proteins associated with the inclusion membrane using proteome analysis. The role of these proteins in chlamydial replication was analyzed further by RNA interference (RNAi) to identify host proteins that are required for chlamydial replication and development (MR, EG, PS, TR, TFM, in preparation). Unexpectedly, EphrinA2 receptor (EphA2), a cell surface RTK was among these proteins and was further investigated due to its potential presence in the <italic>Ctr</italic> inclusion proteome and its known role as a cell surface receptor.</p>
<p>We first investigated if EphA2 can act as a cellular receptor for adherence of <italic>Ctr</italic> to host cells. Adherence assays were performed at 4¬∞C to prevent uptake of adherent EB as previously described ([<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; see also Materials and Methods ‚Äú<xref rid="sec005" ref-type="sec">Adherence assay</xref>‚Äù for details). We first tested whether EB co-localize with EphA2 and if Ephrin-A1, a known ligand of EphA2 may interfere with EB-EphA2 co-localization. EB co-localized with EphA2 and this co-localization was reduced by 35% upon pre-treating the cells with the recombinant human ligand rhEphrin-A1 (rhEphrin-A1; see Materials and Methods ‚Äú<xref rid="sec004" ref-type="sec">Recombinant proteins</xref>‚Äù for details) (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). These results suggested that EphA2 and EB interact on the surface of host cells in an Ephrin-A1-sensitive manner.</p>

(C, D) Purified EB was incubated with or without rhEphA2 (5 Œºg/ml) in a serum free RPMI media containing 0.1% BSA for 1 h at 37¬∞C. Additionally, rhEphrin-A1-preincubated rhEphA2 was incubated with EB as above. The mixture was centrifuged onto coverslips, washed 3 times with ice cold-PBS, stained and quantified as (B). The data are expressed as a mean percentage of EphA2-associated EB (¬± SD) compared to total EB. *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01. Error bars show mean ¬± SD. (E) Pull-down assay: Purified EB was incubated with rhEphA2 or with rhEphrin-A1 each 10 Œºg/ml in a serum free RPMI media containing 0.1% BSA for 45 min at 37¬∞C in a rotary shaker. Additionally, rhEphrin-A1-preincubated rhEphA2 was incubated with EB as above and the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 x g for 4 min at 4¬∞C. The pellet was gently washed 3 times with ice cold-PBS. <italic>Ctr</italic>-infected cells act as a positive control for full length EphA2 expression. The samples were subjected to WB analysis to determine the full length endogenous EphA2 (~130 kDa) and rhEphA2 (~70 kDa) using N-terminal EphA2 specific antibody. rhEphrin-A1 was expressed at ~55‚Äì60 kDa. Hsp60 acts as a control for EB.

<p>To further verify the direct interaction of EphA2 with EB, we incubated recombinant human EphA2 (rhEphA2) with isolated EB in the absence of host cells. EB and rhEphA2 co-localized in this cell-free assay and this co-localization was reduced when rhEphA2 was pre-incubated with the EphA2-ligand rhEphrin-A1 prior to incubation with EB (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). Direct interaction was further confirmed in a pull-down experiment showing that purified EB interacts with purified rhEphA2 in a rhEphrin-A1-sensitive manner (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). These experiments demonstrated a direct interaction of EphA2 with EB.</p>
<p>Pre-incubation of purified EB with purified rhEphA2 reduced the adherence of these EB to the cell surface by 36% compared to EB pre-treated with an unrelated His-tagged control protein (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). These results suggested that EB adhere to epithelial cells via a bacterial ligand that interacts with EphA2, possibly via the ligand-binding domain of EphA2. Indeed, blocking the ligand-binding domain of EphA2 with an antibody directed against the N-terminus of EphA2 reduced adherence of EB to HeLa cells by 33% confirming a role of the ligand-binding domain in the EB-EphA2 interaction (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>). It was previously shown that blocking cell surface PDI using PDI antibody did not affect the <italic>Ctr</italic> attachment [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, as a known control, we blocked PDI and found no reduction in <italic>Ctr</italic> adherence (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>). Further, blocking an unrelated EphB4 receptor [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] had no effect on adherence of <italic>Ctr</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>).</p>

<title>EphA2 is involved in host cell invasion of <italic>Ctr</italic></title>
<p>We then investigated the role of EphA2 for the uptake of <italic>Ctr</italic> by HeLa cells (referred to 'invasion' here). Invasion was analyzed by infecting cells for 4‚Äì6 h at 35¬∞C to allow the uptake of EB by the host cell (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>). At this time period, EB transform to RB and thus the bacteria do not replicate at this stage of the developmental cycle. After silencing total EphA2 expression by siRNA transfection (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>), <italic>Ctr</italic> invasion was reduced by 30% (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig</xref>). It was previously shown that PDI enzymatic activity is required for <italic>Ctr</italic> entry [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Silencing of PDI (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>) reduced the invasion rate of <italic>Ctr</italic> by 65% and by 87% if both EphA2 and PDI were silenced together (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig</xref>) confirming a role of both proteins in the uptake of EB. Blocking the ligand-binding domain of EphA2 with an antibody directed against the N-terminus of EphA2 reduced invasion of <italic>Ctr</italic> by 30% in a biopsy-derived human fallopian tube epithelial cells (Fimb) which are the primary target cells of chlamydial genital infections (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D Fig</xref>), demonstrating that this is not a cell line specific effect. Thus, EphA2 is required for both efficient adherence as well as invasion of EB suggesting that it directly interacts with <italic>Ctr</italic> on the cell surface and this interaction is followed by the induced uptake of EB by the host cell.</p>
<p>Induced uptake of receptor tyrosine kinases frequently requires the kinase function of the receptor [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To get a first hint whether the kinase of EphA2 is required for <italic>Ctr</italic> entry, a clinically approved small molecule EphA2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dasatinib (DA), was used [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In comparison to the control treatment (DMSO), pretreatment of cells with 2.5 or 5 ŒºM DA significantly reduced the entry of EB by 73% or 97% respectively (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1E Fig</xref>). Although we cannot exclude a role of other DA-sensitive kinases like Src family kinases, BCR-ABL, KIT (a cytokine receptor) and PDGFR [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the drastic reduction in <italic>Ctr</italic> invasion demonstrates the functional relevance of RTKs for <italic>Ctr</italic> invasion.</p>

<title><italic>Ctr</italic> infection induces rapid EphA2 activation and quantitative receptor internalization</title>
<p>Since surface EphA2 is required for <italic>Ctr</italic> adherence and invasion, we next investigated the activation of EphA2 upon <italic>Ctr</italic> infection. Phosphorylation of EphA2 at Ser897 (pEphA2), indicative of receptor activation, was detected close to adhering EB during the entry phase of chlamydial infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), suggesting that interaction of EB induced receptor activation. As shown in <xref rid="ppat.1004846.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, ~23% EB co-localized with pEphA2. Cross-reaction of the pEphA2-specific antibody could be excluded since no signal was detected upon knockdown of EphA2 expression (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). We then asked where the activated EphA2 is located in the infected cell after receptor endocytosis. Interestingly, the internalized active EphA2 receptor not only localized directly to the invaded EB, but also accumulated close to the bacteria at 4‚Äì5 h post infection (p.i.) (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Thus, internalized EphA2 is stabilized and continues to signal after endocytosis in <italic>Ctr</italic>-infected cells.</p>

<p>We then overexpressed EphA2 to further substantiate its invasion supportive function and its association with invaded <italic>Ctr</italic>. The invasion rate of <italic>Ctr</italic> 6 h p.i. in EphA2 overexpressing cells was determined by FACS under permeabilised conditions. Increased EphA2 expression was confirmed in EphA2-pcDNA3-transfected cells compared to the control-transfected cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A‚ÄìS2C Fig</xref>). Invasion of <italic>Ctr</italic> increased about 2-fold if EphA2 was overexpressed (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B and S2C Fig</xref>). Consistent with our previous observation (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>), invaded <italic>Ctr</italic> co-localized with EphA2 inside the cell (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C Fig</xref>, indicated by arrows).

<p>Since our results so far demonstrated that the surface EphA2 is required for <italic>Ctr</italic> adherence and invasion, we next investigated whether surface display of EphA2 changes during <italic>Ctr</italic> entry. Interestingly, surface display of EphA2 increased as early as 30 min p.i., but returned to basal levels by 3 h p.i., as was determined by FACS under non-permeabilised condition measuring surface exposed EphA2 only (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). This raised the question whether the rapid downregulation of surface EphA2 that follows the initial increase results from receptor internalization. FACS analysis under permeabilised conditions to detect surface exposed and internalized proteins showed an increased EphA2 signal at 3 h p.i., (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Since we could not detect EphA2 in the supernatant of cells at this time-point (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>), we concluded that EphA2 was internalized into the cell.</p>

<p>Internalization is probably mediated by binding of EB to the ligand binding domain of EphA2, since Ephrin-A1 ligand-induced aggregation of EphA2 on the cell surface has previously been shown to function as the internalization signal [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This ligand-induced activation of EphA2 results in auto-phosphorylation followed by rapid degradation. In line with receptor activation by <italic>Ctr</italic> infection, we observed an increased EphA2 phosphorylation, reaching a 9-fold increase as early as 15 min p.i. (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Activation of EphA2 depended on viable bacteria since heat-killed <italic>Chlamydia</italic> failed to induce EphA2 phosphorylation (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B Fig</xref>). Interestingly, in contrast to ligand-induced EphA2 degradation ([<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and <xref rid="ppat.1004846.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>), EphA2 was not degraded in the cell during <italic>Ctr</italic> infection. Total levels of EphA2 rather started to increase around 4 h p.i., (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>), implying that EphA2 signaling induced by Ephrin-A1 and EB interaction differs. We, in addition, concluded that the rapid increase and decline in cell surface exposed EphA2 during early infection time-points is independent of changes in total EphA2.</p>

Activated PI3K co-immunoprecipitated with EphA2 and activated EphA2 co-immunoprecipitated with p85-PI3K at 30 min p.i. and the activation of both proteins were increased when immunoprecipitated from cells infected for 2 h (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). The interaction was further verified by microscopy showing the co-localization of EphA2 with activated PI3K after <italic>Ctr</italic> infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>).

<title>Intracellular EphA2 associates with <italic>Ctr</italic> inclusion during mid-phase of the developmental cycle and is prevented from re-translocating to the cell surface</title>
<p>To this point, all data on the role of EphA2 during chlamydial infection were obtained during the early phase of infection and prior to EB-RB transformation. We next determined the levels of EphA2 on the cell surface as well as inside the cell. Surface EphA2 expression was similar at three different time points of <italic>Ctr</italic> infection (14, 20 and 26 h p.i.) whereas permeabilised-infected cells (20 and 26 h p.i.) displayed a clear increase of intracellular EphA2 levels (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>).

<p>We then investigated where the increased and activated EphA2 is located in the infected cell during the mid-phase of <italic>Ctr</italic> infection. Plasma membrane proteins isolated from the infected cells at those time points contained constant levels of total and activated EphA2, suggesting that the basal levels of EphA2 and activated EphA2 at these time points were unchanged at the cell surface (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>).

EphA2 was not detectable in the culture supernatant (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>), confirming that the increase in levels of EphA2 and activated EphA2 is restricted to the intracellular space.</p>
<p>To further define the intracellular localization of EphA2, cells were first transfected with EphA2-pcDNA3 and infected for different time intervals with <italic>Ctr</italic>.

<title>EphA2 is required for long-lasting PI3K activation</title>
<p>The rapid and strong activation of EphA2 by chlamydial infection and the association of EphA2 with inclusion during the replicative phase of the developmental cycle suggested that EphA2 is required for chlamydial development, probably by signaling via PI3K. It is important to note that experiments conducted to investigate the role of EphA2 during the mid-phase of the chlamydial cycle were performed with a low MOI of 1‚Äì2 (in contrast to MOI of 50‚Äì100 for adherence and MOI of 20‚Äì50 for invasion experiments) to ensure similar initial infection irrespective of the EphA2 status (Infectivity assay-<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>).

<title>EphA2 intracellular cytoplasmic domain function is essential for chlamydial development</title>
<p>We next asked whether the intracellular domain function of EphA2 is required for supporting <italic>Ctr</italic> development and PI3K activation. Therefore, an EphA2 deletion mutant lacking the cytoplasmic domain including the kinase domain and SAM domain (EphA2ŒîIC) was constructed (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). EphA2ŒîIC localized to inclusion like the wildtype form and was expected to function in a dominant-negative way by competing with the endogenous EphA2 receptors for binding to EB without activating downstream signaling pathways (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). Transient overexpression of either EphA2 or EphA2ŒîIC had a profound effect on the inclusion size. In cells transfected with full length EphA2, the size of the inclusion appeared bigger compared to the untransfected neighboring cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>, see also <xref rid="ppat.1004846.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004846.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>). In contrast, the inclusion size appeared smaller in EphA2ŒîIC transfected cells compared to untransfected cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>). Interestingly, Akt activation was reduced in EphA2ŒîIC transfected cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>) suggesting that EphA2ŒîIC interferes with signaling of endogenous EphA2 in a dominant negative manner, e.g. by preventing functional dimer formation. These results clearly demonstrate the importance of EphA2 intracellular cytoplasmic domain function for <italic>Ctr</italic> infection.</p>
<p>We then made use of the RTK inhibitor dasatinib (DA) to further investigate the role of the kinase activity of endogenous EphA2 for <italic>Ctr</italic> infection. Pretreatment of cells with DA for 1 h followed by 24 h of infection inhibited EphA2 activation (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>) and strongly affected <italic>Ctr</italic> infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>).

<p>To further substantiate the role of EphA2 kinase activity for chlamydial replication and development, cells were infected with <italic>Ctr</italic> for 14 h followed by 10 h treatment with DA. These conditions allowed normal inclusion formation and EB to RB transition prior to the inhibition of EphA2 kinase during the replicative phase of <italic>Ctr</italic> development. This strategy did not only inhibit the <italic>Ctr</italic>-induced EphA2 activation (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>) but also reduced the <italic>Ctr</italic> infection in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A and 7D</xref>).

<p>Since DA is known to block also other tyrosine kinases, we verified the importance of the EphA2 kinase activity for <italic>Ctr</italic> infection by a dominant negative approach.

However, the effect was not as prominent as in cells expressing EphA2ŒîIC (entire cytoplasmic deletion) (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>) suggesting that the EphA2 cytoplasmic domain besides the kinase activity has additional functions for <italic>Ctr</italic> development.</p>

<title><italic>C. trachomatis</italic>-serovar D utilizes EphA2 for entry and to prevent apoptosis</title>
<p>We next investigated and confirmed that EphA2 is also upregulated and activated in cells infected with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> and other <italic>Ctr</italic> serovars like the ocular serovar A and the urogenital serovar D (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A and S6B Fig</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004846.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A</xref>). We further tested if EphA2 is required for efficient binding and invasion of <italic>Ctr</italic>-serovar D to HeLa cells like observed for serovar L2. After silencing EphA2 expression, <italic>Ctr-</italic>serovar D binding and invasion were reduced by 28% and 30% respectively (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10B</xref>). Interestingly, like previously observed for serovar L2, FACS analysis under non-permeabilised conditions revealed an increased expression of surface EphA2 as early as 30 min p.i., which returned to basal levels by 3 h p.i. (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10C and 10D</xref>). The amount of total EphA2 in contrast was strongly increased at 3 h p.i. as was demonstrated by FACS analysis under permeabilised conditions (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10C and 10D</xref>). Thus, we conclude that <italic>Ctr</italic>-serovar D also utilizes EphA2 to invade host cells. We next also determined the surface and total levels of EphA2 during the mid-phase infection with <italic>Ctr</italic>-serovar D. Like for serovar L2, surface EphA2 expression of cells infected with <italic>Ctr</italic>-serovar D was similar at three different time points of infection (14, 20 and 28 h p.i.) whereas permeabilised-infected cells displayed an increase of intracellular EphA2 levels (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10E</xref>). We then also investigated the role of internalized EphA2 for apoptosis resistance induced by infection with <italic>Ctr</italic>-serovar D. EphA2 silenced cells upon 16 h p.i. were sensitized for TNF-Œ±/CHX-induced apoptosis determined by PARP cleavage (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10F</xref>). Thus, EphA2-mediated signaling is essential for invasion and apoptosis resistance of <italic>Ctr-</italic>serovar D infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>First identified in a cancer cell line called erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], numerous Eph receptors were subsequently detected, exhibiting diverse functions in vascular development, cancer and virus infection. Here, we report on the identification of EphA2 as a key factor of <italic>Ctr</italic> entry and development using an unbiased approach, based on the compilation of data from hypothesis-free proteomics and RNA interference approaches.</p>
<p>The current work demonstrates the significance of EphA2 which mediates the entry of <italic>Ctr</italic> into host cells. We, in addition, showed that the infection-induced ERK signaling is required for EphA2 upregulation and activation. The increased amount of EphA2 in infected cells was, however, not transported to the cell surface but rather gets recruited to the <italic>Ctr</italic> inclusion membrane where EphA2 interacts with pPI3K. We further demonstrated a crucial role of EphA2 for chlamydial development and the induction of apoptosis resistance in infected cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>). Thus, EphA2 is involved in fundamental processes of chlamydial infection.</p>

<p>Similar to viruses, <italic>Ctr</italic> depends on the host cell for replication and survives only for a very limited time outside the host cells. We further show that EphA2 is also employed by <italic>Ctr</italic> to subvert host signaling for extended times after entry to ensure efficient development and protection of the host cell from apoptosis induction. Thus, engagement of cell surface receptors during the entry process may already pre-define the composition of inclusion-associated host proteins required for the propagation of <italic>Ctr</italic>.</p>
<p>The interaction of EB with purified EphA2 and the inhibition of this interaction with recombinant human Ephrin-A1 provide strong evidence that EB directly interact with EphA2. While EphA2 has been identified as receptor for hepatitis C virus [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma-associated herpes virus [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] binding and entry, this is the first time EphA2 has been shown to function as a receptor for a bacterial pathogen. In line with a direct interaction, <italic>Ctr</italic> infection caused a strong activation of EphA2 within minutes, correlating with an unexpected strong increase in surface exposure of the receptor. Since the overall amount of EphA2 did not significantly increase until 3 h p.i., we can speculate that this rapid and strong surface display depended either on reduced receptor recycling or enhanced receptor exposure. Interestingly, at 3 h p.i., the total amount of EphA2 already started to increase and the elevated surface display was reduced to the level of uninfected cells and remained stable until the end of the infection cycle.</p>
<p>Our recent data suggested that <italic>Ctr</italic>-infected cells prevent re-infection to protect the intracellular niche (Karunakaran et al., submitted). The EphA2 overexpressing cells infected for 24 h were further re-infected with new EB for 4 h (re-infection assay). This assay increased 2.5-fold of new EB in EphA2 overexpressing infected cells compared to untransfected-infected neighboring cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A‚ÄìS5C Fig</xref>). Thus, preventing translocation of EphA2 to the cell surface may protect the intracellular niche as well as gaining EphA2 intracellular signals. It may also prevent contact of EphA2 with its ligand Ephrin-A1 on the surface of neighboring cells, which would reverse EphA2 signaling of the infected cell.</p>
<p>This profile of EphA2 surface display and receptor upregulation induced by chlamydial infection is strikingly different from that observed after Ephrin-A1 stimulation. EphA2 is rapidly endocytosed upon Ephrin-A1 ligation and degraded in lysosomes [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This so-called ligand-dependent signaling involves phosphorylation of EphA2 at Tyr594 [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and interferes with the activation of the PI3K and MEK/ERK pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The effect of <italic>Ctr</italic> infection on EphA2 is in line with ligand-independent signaling that causes EphA2 activation, supports PI3K/Akt activation and prevents EphA2 degradation. Activation of PI3K is, however, not completely dependent on activated EphA2 during chlamydial infection which indicates a possible role of other PI3K-inducing pathways. We found EphA2 activation not only at the cytoplasmic membrane during the initial phase of infection but also surrounding the endocytosed bacteria, indicating that this surface receptor continues to activate the PI3K pathway from within the infected cells. Signaling via EphA2 is thus not only important for the induction of bacterial entry but also required for maintaining a favorable niche for the replication of <italic>Ctr</italic>.</p>
<p>We show the recruitment of active EphA2 to the inclusion membrane during the mid-phase of the infection cycle indicating that EphA2-mediated signaling occurs at the cytosolic side of the inclusion membrane. We hypothesize that EphA2 initially remains associated with the endosomal membrane during bacterial entry. We currently do not know how the receptor is recruited to the inclusion at late infection time points and whether this requires secreted chlamydial ligands. Interestingly, in line with our findings, the activation of the PI3K pathway upon <italic>Ctr</italic>-serovar D infection has recently been demonstrated to depend on infection-induced RTK-EGFR phosphorylation [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Further, the EGFR co-localized with F-actin at the periphery of the inclusion [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These findings together with our results strengthen the significance of RTK‚Äôs functioning as intracellular signaling receptors at the inclusion besides being the cell surface receptor in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> infection.</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence support a crucial role of EphA2 in PI3K activation during chlamydial infection. Both chemical inhibition of EphA2 kinase activity (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1E Fig</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004846.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>) and of PI3K [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] prevented <italic>Ctr</italic> infection if the inhibitor was added either prior to or simultaneously with infection. These effects were milder if the inhibitors were applied after the EB to RB transition. We therefore postulate that early activation of the EphA2-PI3K pathway is important for chlamydial development. During this phase of infection, EphA2 levels remain largely unchanged indicating that post-translational modification by phosphorylation is the main mechanism of activation. During the middle and late phase of infection, the PI3K pathway appears to be less important since <italic>Ctr</italic> is able to develop irrespective of whether PI3K is active or not (see Figs <xref rid="ppat.1004846.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004846.g008" ref-type="fig">8A</xref>, [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). The dose-dependent downregulation of mid phase-chlamydial infection by dasatinib, which can inhibit the activity of EphA2, Src, BCR-Abl, KIT and PDGFR [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], did not correlate well with the downregulation of the PI3K pathway (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). However, a kinase inactive EphA2 mutant also affected PI3K activation and <italic>Ctr</italic> infection, demonstrating a role of the EphA2 kinase activity in chlamydial infection. Clearly, the effect of the EphA2ŒîIC (entire cytoplasmic deletion) was stronger suggesting that the cytoplasmic domain of EphA2 in addition to its kinase activity has an important function (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>). Apart from the PI3K, there are several other downstream targets of EphA2 like Ras-GTPase activating protein (RasGAP), Src, Abl family of non-receptor tryosine kinases and Rac1. During chlamydial infection, the Src kinase FYN has been shown to be essential for sphingomyelin trafficking to the <italic>Ctr</italic> inclusion [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, Rac1 activation is involved in chlamydial invasion into the host cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In addition, EphA2 is required for the association of Rab5 with internalized KSHV in the early macropinosome and productive trafficking of KSHV [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Further, Eph-EphA2 complexes are shown to be involved in various forms of endocytosis and cellular trafficking pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Thus, the central role of EphA2 in cytoskeletal regulation and intracellular trafficking may be exploited by <italic>Ctr</italic> for efficient cell entry, replication and development.</p>
<p>We could demonstrate that EphA2 is required to maintain apoptosis resistance during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> serovars L2 and D infection. This function very likely depends on the role of EphA2 in activation of the PI3K pathway, which plays a role in at least two anti-apoptotic signaling pathways activated by <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection: the inactivation of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Bad [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and the stabilization of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is possible that maintaining apoptosis resistance supports the integrity of the host cell during chlamydial replication and thus supports the infection, although direct experimental proof for this hypothesis is missing. The crucial role of EphA2 for chlamydial replication and its long-lasting upregulation in the course of infection may have another important consequence. EphA2 overexpression in the majority of ovarian cancer patients predicts poor clinical outcome connected to shorter overall survival [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Ovarian cancers are heterogeneous at the cellular and molecular levels, however, 90% of the ovarian cancers have epithelial histology and are believed to arise from surface epithelial cells, e.g. from cells lining the fallopian tubes [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> is known to infect and damage the human fallopian tube [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and infection correlates with ovarian cancer [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Our findings of a strong EphA2 upregulation in primary fallopian tube epithelial cells suggests that targeting EphA2 and probably other Eph receptors or its co-receptors could offer a tool to control <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-induced ovarian cancer. <italic>Ctr-</italic>serovar D, cause genital and perinatal infections [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], also requires EphA2 to invade the cell and to prevent apoptosis induced by TNF-Œ± similar to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> serovar L2 (<xref rid="ppat.1004846.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>). Thus, at least two different serovars of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> appear to be capable of interacting with EphA2 to amplify signals crucial for infection.</p>
<p>The current concept on how <italic>Chlamydia</italic> modifies the host cell to support its development and replication assumes a central role of bacterial effector proteins that are secreted via the bacterial type three secretion system into the inclusion membrane or into cellular compartments. These bacterial effector proteins interact with host cellular proteins and subvert the host to a supportive niche for <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. We demonstrate here that the cell surface receptor EphA2 is activated within seconds after bacterial interaction and remains active after endocytosis to support chlamydial development. The continuous signaling of endocytosed EphA2 proposes a new concept of how <italic>Ctr</italic> manipulates its host cell by immediately engaging cell surface receptors and recruiting them to the inclusion for long-term. It is very likely that other receptors, most likely of the Eph-family, are used in a similar way to orchestrate host cell signaling right from the beginning of a <italic>Ctr</italic> infection. Further studies are crucial to identify the chlamydial factor interacting with EphA2 as well as to unravel the downstream targets of EphA2 upon <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection, which benefits <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. It will be worthy to further unravel the complexity of inclusion-associated cell surface receptors that may offer new relevant targets for future anti-chlamydial therapies.</p>

<title>Association of EphA2 with <italic>Ctr</italic> inclusion and generation of <italic>Ctr</italic>-pIncA-flag.</title>
<p>(A) Cells were transfected with EphA2-pcDNA3 and left UN or infected with <italic>Ctr</italic> (MOI-1) for different times as indicated. Cells were immunostained against EphA2 (EphA2, red) and <italic>Ctr</italic> (Hsp60, green). (B) Cells transfected with EphA2-pcDNA3 were infected with <italic>Ctr</italic> (MOI-1) and immunostained against EphA2 (EphA2, red), <italic>Ctr</italic> (Hsp60, green) and DNA (Draq5, blue). <italic>Ctr</italic> inclusion of the untransfected cells (indicated with white arrows) were smaller than the inclusion of EphA2-transfected cells. (A, B) Magnification is indicated in size bar. (C) The vector map of pIncA::SW2 modified from the plasmid pGFP::SW2 [<xref rid="ppat.1004846.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] by replacing GFP:CAT with IncA-HA-Flag. (D) HeLa cells were infected with <italic>Ctr</italic> wild type (WT) or <italic>Ctr</italic>-pIncA-flag for 24 h (MOI-1). Cells were lysed and the indicated proteins were detected by immunoblotting after separation on a 17% SDS PAGE gel to separate the endogenous IncA from <italic>Ctr</italic>-pIncA-flag expressing recombinant IncA.</p>

<title>EphA2 overexpressed in infected cells allow re-infection in 24 h <italic>Ctr</italic>-infected cells.</title>
<p>(A, B) Re-infection assay: Cells transfected with EphA2-pcDNA3 were infected with <italic>Ctr</italic> (MOI-1) for 24 h followed by re-infection using EB (MOI-15) for 4 h. Cells were washed thrice with PBS to remove the unbound bacteria and immunostained against EphA2 (EphA2, red), <italic>Ctr</italic> (Hsp60, green) and Actin filaments (Phalloidin, blue). Microscopic view was made focusing on the newly re-infected <italic>Ctr</italic> (arrows). Nearby untransfected and EphA2-transfected cells (red) were shown in the same image with zoomed in white boxes for better magnification of invaded bacteria in EphA2 transfected cells comparing to the untransfected cells. Arrows were drawn to indicate the newly adhered or invaded <italic>Ctr</italic>. Magnification is indicated in size bar. (C) The total number of re-infected bacteria (both adhered and invaded new EB) in EphA2 overexpressed and untransfected-infected cells were counted for maximum of 30 cells. Shown is the mean ¬± SD of three independent experiments normalized to untransfected-infected cells. **P&lt;0.01. Error bars show mean ¬± SD.</p>

<title>EphA2 expression and activation in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Ctr</italic>-serovar A-infected HeLa cells.</title>
<p>(A, B) HeLa cells were left UN or infected with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> or <italic>Ctr</italic>-serovar A, centrifuged at 910 x g for 30 min and allowed to infect for the indicated time points. The cells were harvested and subjected to WB analysis against pEphA2, Hsp60 and Actin. The blot was stripped and reprobed for total EphA2.</p>
