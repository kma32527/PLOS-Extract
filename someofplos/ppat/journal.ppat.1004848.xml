<abstract>
<p>Mosquitoes are natural vectors for many etiologic agents of human viral diseases. Mosquito-borne flaviviruses can persistently infect the mosquito central nervous system without causing dramatic pathology or influencing the mosquito behavior and lifespan. The mechanism by which the mosquito nervous system resists flaviviral infection is still largely unknown. Here we report that an <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> homologue of the neural factor <italic>Hikaru genki</italic> (<italic>AaHig</italic>) efficiently restricts flavivirus infection of the central nervous system. <italic>AaHig</italic> was predominantly expressed in the mosquito nervous system and localized to the plasma membrane of neural cells. Functional blockade of AaHig enhanced Dengue virus (DENV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), but not Sindbis virus (SINV), replication in mosquito heads and consequently caused neural apoptosis and a dramatic reduction in the mosquito lifespan. Consistently, delivery of recombinant AaHig to mosquitoes reduced viral infection. Furthermore, the membrane-localized AaHig directly interfaced with a highly conserved motif in the surface envelope proteins of DENV and JEV, and consequently interrupted endocytic viral entry into mosquito cells. Loss of either plasma membrane targeting or virion-binding ability rendered AaHig nonfunctional. Interestingly, <italic>Culex pipien pallens</italic> Hig also demonstrated a prominent anti-flavivirus activity, suggesting a functionally conserved function for Hig. Our results demonstrate that an evolutionarily conserved antiviral mechanism prevents lethal flaviviral infection of the central nervous system in mosquitoes, and thus may facilitate flaviviral transmission in nature.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The central nervous system plays a predominant role in organisms associated with cognition and higher-order functions, which is key to their normal behavior and successful survival. Many mosquito-borne flaviviruses particularly invade the central nervous system in vertebrates, resulting in dramatic neural degeneration and damage. As natural vectors, mosquitoes are highly permissive to flaviviral infection that can be persistent in the mosquito nervous system. However, the infection intriguingly does neither lead to significant malignant pathological sequelae, nor dramatically influences mosquito behavior or lifespan, and thus mosquitoes can transmit viruses efficiently. Little is known about the neuron-specific resistant mechanism in viral infection of mosquitoes. Here we report that a neuron-specific factor specifically controls flaviviral replication in the mosquito nervous system by interfering with viral entry, and its activity prevents lethal flaviviral infection of mosquitoes. Our study provides insight into the sophisticated interactions between mosquito-borne viruses and their vectors, and offers an important target for arboviral limitation in nature.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mosquitoes transmit many human pathogens of medical importance throughout the world. Flaviviruses, such as West Nile (WNV), Japanese Encephalitis (JEV), Dengue (DENV) and Yellow Fever (YFV) viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes are the etiologic agents of human hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis and meningitis [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As natural vectors, mosquitoes are very permissive to and allow systematic and persistent flavivirus infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For example, WNV infection is persistent in many tissues of mosquitoes, including the nervous system, salivary glands, midgut, and fat body [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The head of mosquitoes, where the central neural system locates, can maintain productive flavivirus infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Unlike human infection, which can cause severe neurological sequelae, flaviviral infection of the mosquito nervous system intriguingly does not lead to significant malignant pathological consequences, and also does not dramatically influence mosquito behavior or lifespan [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The ability of the neural antiviral mechanisms to control viral replication and to maintain a normal mosquito lifespan may facilitate viral dissemination in nature. However, the machinery that controls flavivirus infection of the mosquito nervous system is still largely unknown.</p>
<p><italic>Hikaru genki</italic> (<italic>Hig</italic>) is predominantly expressed in the pupal and adult nervous system of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and is crucial for the development of neural circuits [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The <italic>Hig</italic> gene encodes multiple immune-related domains, including an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain and five complement control protein (CCP) domains (also designated Sushi repeat domains) [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The Hig protein is therefore speculated to be an immune factor in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, in addition to its role in neural development [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The CCP domain is a signature module present in many mammalian complement proteins and is shown to mediate protein-protein interactions of complement components or to recognize microbial pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Human complement receptor 2, encoding 16 CCPs, serves as a cellular entry receptor for Epstein-Barr virus, and its CCP-1 and -2 domains are required for Epstein-Barr virus binding [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The membrane cofactor protein (MCP), with 4 CCP repeats, has been demonstrated to function as a cellular receptor for Measles virus [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Another complement regulator, Factor H, encoding 20 CCP repeats in the protein, was reported to bind the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) surface glycoproteins gp41 and gp120 [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our previous study also identified that an insect-specific scavenger receptor (SR) with 2 CCP domains in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, designated as AaSR-C, serves as a pattern recognition receptor to efficiently recognize DENV, and consequently recruits mosquito complement components to limit dengue replication [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, a member of the <italic>Culicinae</italic> subfamily, is a natural vector for Dengue and Yellow Fever viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several neurotropic flaviviruses, including WNV and JEV, have also been isolated in native <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> or other <italic>Aedes</italic> species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/transmission/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/transmission/</ext-link>) [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Because these mosquitoes are easy to cultivate and the genome has been characterized, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> is an ideal insect model for viral pathogenesis and immune studies [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this study, we have identified a <italic>hig</italic> homolog gene in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, designated as <italic>AaHig</italic>. <italic>AaHig</italic> is highly expressed in the mosquito nervous system and enriched on the plasma membrane of neural cells. AaHig recognized DENV and JEV to directly interrupt flavivirus internalization into mosquito cells, therefore limiting flaviviral amplification in the mosquito brain. Immuno-blockade of AaHig resulted in a robust viral replication in mosquito brains, increased apoptosis of neural cells, and a dramatic reduction of the mosquito lifespan after flaviviral infection, suggesting that AaHig resists flavivirus spreading in the mosquito nervous system and therefore facilitates mosquito survival in the infection. Moreover, genetic or immune depletion of Hig homologue in <italic>Culex pipien pallens</italic> also significantly increased JEV infection, indicating Hig protein is functionally conserved in mosquitoes. Our study uncovered a previously unappreciated antiviral mechanism for Hig in the mosquito nervous system, which may provide insight into the sophisticated interactions between mosquito-borne viruses and the vector's antiviral immunity.</p>

<title>Identification of a homolog of <italic>Hig</italic> in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic></title>
<p>The complement control protein (CCP) domain is an evolutionarily conserved module that is essential for complement function [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] by mediating the protein-protein interactions of complement components and recognition of pathogenic microorganisms [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our previous work has identified a group of 10 proteins with CCP domains in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, 6 of which play a role in the control of Dengue and Yellow Fever viruses infection of mosquitoes [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], indicating a general antiviral role for the <italic>CCP</italic> genes of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>. We next characterized these six genes by sequence comparison. Herein, a <italic>CCP</italic> gene, <italic>AAEL004725</italic>, was identified as a homologue of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural factor <italic>Hikaru genki</italic> (<italic>DmHig</italic>) (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The <italic>AAEL004725</italic>-encoded protein is predicted to contain 5 CCP domains and 1 immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, which is identical to those of <italic>Drosophila Hig</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). We therefore designated <italic>AAEL004725</italic> as <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti Hig</italic> (<italic>AaHig</italic>) throughout this investigation. The genomic comparison showed that the <italic>Hig</italic> genes are comprehensively expressed in insects, which are widely distributed throughout the orders of <italic>Diptera</italic>, <italic>Coleoptera</italic>, <italic>Hymenoptera</italic> and <italic>Lepidoptera</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). However, no homolog was identified in other arthropods and vertebrates with available genomic information. The amino acid sequences of Hig proteins are evolutionarily conserved among various insect species, suggesting possible similar functions of these proteins.</p>

<title>The specific expression of <italic>AaHig</italic> in the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> nervous system</title>
<p><italic>Drosophila</italic> Hig is a secretory protein that is specifically expressed in the nervous system, which is an essential factor for the development of fly neural circuits [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We therefore assessed the abundance of <italic>AaHig</italic> in different tissues of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>. <italic>AaHig</italic> was highly expressed in the mosquito head, where the central nervous system is located. A mild level of <italic>AaHig</italic> abundance was also detected in the mosquito carcass (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), which may come from the peripheral nervous system, e.g., the neural cells in the ventral nerve cords. To further understand the distribution of the AaHig protein, we expressed and purified a full-length peptide of AaHig in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>) and generated a polyclonal antibody in mice. The antibody was able to recognize S2-expressed recombinant AaHig protein (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>). Consistent with its mRNA expression pattern, the AaHig protein was detected specifically in mosquito heads and carcasses (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1004848.g002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004848.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>).

<p>(A-B) The expression of <italic>AaHig</italic> in various tissues of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>. The abundance of AaHig was assessed via SYBR Green qPCR (A) and immuno-blotting with an AaHig antibody (B). (A) The total RNA was isolated from mosquito tissues to determine <italic>AaHig</italic> expression by SYBR Green qPCR and normalized by <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti actin</italic> (<italic>AAEL011197</italic>).

The detection of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> actin was used as the internal control. (C) Secretory property of AaHig. The full length of AaHig gene (1bp-2436bp) was inserted into the expression vector pAc5.1/V5-His A with a V5 tag. The recombinant DNA plasmid (pAc-AaHig) was transfected into S2 cells. AaHig expression was detected with anti-V5 antibody in the cell lysate and supernatant. (D) AaHig staining in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> Aag2 cells.

AaHig was stained by anti-V5 antibody and anti-mouse IgG Alexa-546 (Red). The plasma membrane was stained by the Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) conjugated with Alexa-488 (Green).

<p>Unlike <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hig, that has a signal peptide [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], AaHig lacks a signal peptide at its N-terminus by sequence prediction (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). To assess whether AaHig is secreted, we cloned the full-length AaHig (1-2436bp) into a pAc5.1/V5-His A expression vector, and the recombinant plasmid was subsequently transfected into <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. AaHig was strongly detected in the supernatant of transfected <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells by Western-blotting (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Abundant AaHig was observed on the surface of transfected <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> Aag2 cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>), indicating that AaHig is secreted and enriches on the plasma membrane (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). To accurately measure the <italic>in situ</italic> localization of AaHig in the mosquito central nervous system, we stained the mosquito brains using an AaHig antibody. An anti-horseradish peroxidase (anti-HRP) antibody, used as a "pan-neuronal" label in insects to detect several epitopes on neuronal processes [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], was selected as a positive marker for the surface staining of mosquito neural cells. AaHig was detected comprehensively in both the antennal and optic lobes of mosquito brains and was enriched on the surface of neural cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). To demonstrate the subcellular localization of AaHig, we collected brain tissues from female <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. The subcellular fractions, including the nucleus, mitochondria, cytoplasm and plasma membrane, were separated. Specific staining for AaHig was observed in the plasma membrane fraction (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>), further confirming the location of AaHig on the cell membrane of mosquito brain cells.</p>

<title>The role of <italic>Hig</italic> in flavivirus infection of mosquitoes</title>
<p>dsRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>AaHig</italic> significantly enhanced the DENV-2 and YFV burdens compared with that found in <italic>green fluorescent protein</italic> (<italic>GFP</italic>) mock dsRNA-treated mosquitoes, suggesting that <italic>AaHig</italic> is an antiviral factor in mosquitoes [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We reproduced the effect of dsRNA-mediated <italic>AaHig</italic> silencing on DENV-2 infection of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>. The intrathoracic inoculation of <italic>AaHig</italic> dsRNA significantly decreased <italic>AaHig</italic> expression in the whole mosquito bodies and heads at both the mRNA (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>) and protein (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6C Fig</xref>) levels. Three days after gene silencing, 10 M.I.D.<sub>50</sub> of DENV-2 were microinjected into the mosquitoes. The viral burden was assessed in whole bodies and heads via qPCR at 3 days and 6 days post-infection. In agreement with our previous observations [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], the knockdown of <italic>AaHig</italic> enhanced the DENV-2 burden in whole mosquitoes (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6D Fig</xref>) and heads (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6E Fig</xref>), confirming the important antiviral activity of <italic>AaHig</italic> in mosquitoes. To rule out any off-target effects of dsRNA-mediated RNA interference and further validate the role of <italic>AaHig</italic> in flaviviral infection, we immuno-blocked the native AaHig by thoracic inoculation of an AaHig antibody for functional investigation. To assess whether the antibody is delivered to the mosquito brain via its circulation system, we inoculated the diluted murine AaHig antibody into mosquito thoraxes, and subsequently tested its distribution in mosquito brains by <italic>in situ</italic> staining. The murine AaHig antibody was clearly detected on the surface of neural cells by fluorescence labeled anti-mouse IgG (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>), demonstrating the successful delivery of the AaHig antibody to the brain. Similar amount of the antibody was distributed in the brains of inoculated mosquitoes (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). Therefore, serially diluted AaHig antibody was premixed with DENV-2 for mosquito microinjection. Neutralization of AaHig significantly enhanced DENV-2 infectivity of whole mosquitoes both 3 days (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, i) and 6 days (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, i) post-infection. Because AaHig is dominantly expressed in the central nervous system of mosquitoes (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>), we evaluated the viral burden in mosquito heads. Similarly, inoculation of AaHig antibody augmented viral replication in the mosquito heads on 3 and 6 days after infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, ii and <xref rid="ppat.1004848.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, ii). Through the approach of viral infection by oral feeding, immuno-blockade of AaHig also significantly enhanced the DENV burden in the whole bodies (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9A and S9B Fig</xref>) and heads (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9C and S9D Fig</xref>) of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>. AaHig antibody does not bind DENV-2 surface E protein or virions, indicating that increased viral load in mosquito heads was not a result of non-specific viral recognition by AaHig antibody. Furthermore, the viral burden in the salivary glands and the midgut was not influenced by the inoculation of AaHig antibody (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>), suggesting that AaHig is a neuron-specific factor that efficiently controls viral replication in the nervous system, regardless of the peripheral tissues.</p>

<p>Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne, neurotropic flavivirus that invades the central nervous system of vertebrates. JEV infection results in severe pathological and physiological damage to the human brain, high mortality and morbidity [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. We therefore investigated the role of <italic>AaHig</italic> in JEV infection, using <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> as a model. Compared to the pre-immune IgG, AaHig antibody treatment significantly enhanced the viral burden in both the whole bodies and heads on 3 (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>) and 6 (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>) days post-infection in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>.

Three days post-dsRNA treatment, JEV was microinjected into the mosquitoes and the viral load was assessed via Taqman qPCR 3 and 6 days post-infection. Consistent with the results of JEV infection of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, the knockdown of <italic>CpHig</italic> significantly increased the JEV load in the whole bodies (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>) and heads (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F and 4G</xref>) of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>pipiens pallens</italic> mosquitoes.

<p>To test if the antiviral activity of AaHig can be extended to other mosquito-borne viruses, we chose Sindbis virus (SINV), a member of the alphavirus genus. SINV was originally isolated from <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes, but a large number of mosquito species, including <italic>Aedes</italic>, are also able to act as vectors for SINV transmission in nature [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>-SINV system has been used extensively as a model for understanding arbovirus-mosquito interactions [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

<title>AaHig prevents flaviviral infection-induced neural apoptosis and lethality</title>
<p>The mosquito lifespan is rarely decreased by persistent flavivirus infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The antiviral factors in mosquitoes are unable to eradicate viruses from mosquitoes, but can limit the viral burden to a tolerable level that does not elicit significant tissue damage. Without these antiviral mechanisms, viral replication could cause damage to the mosquito physiology and therefore decrease the mosquito lifespan [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Previous studies have suggested that arboviral infection leads to apoptosis in mosquito tissues. The midgut epithelial cells of <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> showed apoptosis following infection by WNV [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Apoptosis of the tissues of <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> was observed after WNV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, the level of apoptosis is correlated with viral persistent infection in mosquitoes [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We therefore assessed apoptosis via TUNEL staining in DENV-2 infected mosquito brains with or without AaHig antibody treatment. The number of apoptotic cells in the brains of AaHig antibody/DENV-2-treated mosquitoes was greater than that in the mock controls (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Additionally, the more severe apoptotic damage in the AaHig-depleted mosquito brains was determined by a cleaved caspase-3 antibody for detection of apoptosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). We consequently assessed whether immuno-blockade of AaHig influences mosquito survival upon flavivirus infection. 10 M.I.D.<sub>50</sub> DENV-2 or JEV were premixed with the diluted AaHig antibody for mosquito microinjection, respectively. Pre-immune antibody with the viruses and the antibodies without viruses served as mock controls. Consistent with previous studies, DENV infection was not lethal to mosquitoes when compared to mock infection. However, the infection became lethal when AaHig function was blocked with an antibody (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). Similar results were observed with JEV infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). These data clearly demonstrate that AaHig is a key factor for mosquito survival during persistent flavivirus infection.</p>

We next tested if AaHig employs a similar strategy to control viral infections. The full-length AaHig protein was generated and purified in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell expression system (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). The purified AaHig protein strongly interacted with the DENV-2 E protein in a co-IP assay (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>) and captured DENV-2 virions efficiently by ELISA (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). Moreover, DENV-2 virions were pulled down by ectopically expressed AaHig protein in the infected mosquito Aag2 cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). We next performed immunofluorescence staining of the mosquito brains to explore whether native AaHig interacts with DENV-2 particles. Co-staining of AaHig and DENV was clearly observed on the surface of mosquito neural cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>). The interaction between AaHig and JEV was also measured by ELISA (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12A Fig</xref>) and co-IP (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12B Fig</xref>) assays. We next investigated the details of flavivirus-AaHig interaction. The length of the Dengue E protein is approximately 500 amino acids, of which the N-terminal 400 amino acids form an ectodomain. The ectodomain consists of three domains that are referred to as envelope protein domain I (ED1), ED2, and ED3 [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Both ED1 (1-52AA; 133AA-193AA; 281-296AA) and ED2 (53-132AA; 194-280AA) are structural domains, and the linear motifs of ED1 and ED2 are interlaced. However, the ED3 domain consists of an entirely linear sequence (297AA-400AA) [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Based on these defined domains, we first cloned and expressed two truncated peptides in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells: the ED1+ED2 (1-296AA) and ED3 (297-400AA) peptides (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>). AaHig strongly interacted with the ED1+ED2 peptide, but no interaction was detected between AaHig and the ED3 (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G and 6H</xref>) peptide. To further determine the binding motifs in ED1 and ED2, we next constructed five truncations in which the linear motifs were sequentially deleted from the ED1 and ED2 domains (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6I</xref>). The results indicated that the 53 AA-132 AA motif in ED2 is indispensable for the interaction with AaHig (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6I</xref>). We then assessed whether the 53 AA-132 AA motif is highly conserved among flaviviruses. The motif sequence shares 46%-75% identity among the E proteins of DENV, JEV and YFV. Computational structure modeling also demonstrated that the 53 AA-132 AA motif is conserved among the three flaviviruses, suggesting that a consistent binding mechanism exists between AaHig and different flaviviruses. To examine the physiological relevance of AaHig and DENV binding, the purified AaHig protein together with DENV-2 virions was microinjected into <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and the DENV loads were assessed. Inoculation of AaHig significantly impaired DENV-2 infectivity on 3 (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6J</xref>, i) and 6 days (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6J</xref>, ii) post-infection, validating an important antiviral role for AaHig in mosquitoes.</p>

<p>We next evaluated the importance of the conserved functional domains of AaHig for its antiviral activity.

Both co-IP and ELISA assays showed that deletion of the second C-terminal CCP module (680 AA-742 AA) abrogated the interaction between the AaHig and DENV-2 E proteins, suggesting that this module is necessary for the protein-virus recognition (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>). Aag2 is an <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> cell lineage of embryonic origin [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] that is permissive to many mosquito-borne flaviviruses [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and is thus used as a model for the study of mosquito immunity and viral pathogenesis. However, Aag2 cells did not express AaHig. We then determined the impact of transient expression of AaHig on viral infectivity. The DENV burden was significantly decreased in <italic>AaHig</italic>-transfected Aag2 cells in comparison with that in pAc-GFP transfected cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>).

These results indicate that the binding capacity between AaHig and viruses is essential for the antiviral activity of AaHig in mosquito cells.</p>

<title>The antiviral activity of AaHig requires its plasma membrane localization</title>
<p>Since AaHig is secreted and enriched on the plasma membrane of neural cells, we next investigate the role of membrane localization in the antiviral activity of AaHig. Six truncations (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>) in which the functional domains of AaHig were sequentially deleted were constructed in the pAc5.1/V5-His A vector and expressed in mosquito Aag2 cells. Immunofluorescence staining indicated that these AaHig truncations were localized to the surface of mosquito cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13 Fig</xref>), suggesting that the N-terminal domain (located in AaHig-A) may be responsible for anchoring AaHig in the membrane. We therefore constructed a deletion mutant that lacked the N-terminal sequence (AaHig-G, 323 AA-812 AA) (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7G</xref>). AaHig-G retained the ability to bind to the DENV E protein (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7H</xref>); however, AaHig-G failed to localize to the plasma membrane of mosquito cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13 Fig</xref>). As a result, AaHig-G exhibited no antiviral activity (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7I</xref>), indicating that the antiviral activity of AaHig also relies on its proper association with the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>AaHig is a resistant factor against Dengue infection in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>). To investigate whether the antiviral mechanism of AaHig is specific to mosquito cells, we assessed the role of AaHig in DENV-2 infection of A549 (a human alveolar basal epithelial cell line) and Vero (an African green monkey kidney epithelial cell line) cells. The presence of AaHig failed to reduce the DENV-2 burden in the mammalian cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14A and S14B Fig</xref>). Because <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells are susceptible to DENV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], we determined the effect of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster Hig</italic> (<italic>DmHig</italic>) on DEVN-2 infection of <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. <italic>DmHig</italic> was cloned and expressed in S2 cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14C Fig</xref>). The overexpression of <italic>DmHig</italic> significantly impaired DENV-2 infectivity in both <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> Aag2 (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14D Fig</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14E Fig</xref>) cells, indicating that the antiviral mechanism of Hig proteins is specific to and conserved in insects.</p>
<p>The antiviral activity of AaHig relies on proper localization to the cellular membrane (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1004848.g007" ref-type="fig">7I</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004848.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13</xref>). To determine the reason for the lack of AaHig antiviral activity in mammalian cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14A and S14B Fig</xref>), we determined the ability of AaHig to bind to the surface of Vero cells. AaHig cannot coat on Vero cells, as indicated by an immuno-staining assay (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15 Fig</xref>), suggesting that mammalian cells may not express the membrane receptor(s) for AaHig anchoring.

<title>AaHig limits flavivirus infection by interrupting endocytic viral entry</title>
<p>In the absence of adaptive immunity, mosquitoes employ sophisticated innate immune machineries to detect and limit invading viruses, including RNA interference (RNAi) [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and melanization [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. To uncover the antiviral mechanism of AaHig, we investigated the role of AaHig in the above-mentioned mechanisms. Immuno-blockade of AaHig by antibody inoculation did not alter the expression of the <italic>AMP</italic> genes, RNAi-related genes (<italic>Ago2</italic> and <italic>Dicer2</italic>), or ROS-related genes (<italic>Duox1</italic>, <italic>Duox2</italic>) in mosquitoes (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S16 Fig</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>AaHig</italic> in Aag2 cells did not influence the melanization activity (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S17A and S17B Fig</xref>), and knockdown of <italic>AaHig</italic> was also ineffective for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> release in various mosquito parts (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S17C Fig</xref>). These results indicate that the antiviral activity of AaHig is independent of the known innate immune pathways.</p>
<p>AaHig is enriched on the surface of neural cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>), and also directly interacted with the surface envelope proteins of flaviviruses. Both the viral binding and membrane anchoring were necessary for the antiviral activity of AaHig (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F and 7I</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that AaHig binding to flaviviruses may directly interrupt viral entry into mosquito cells. First, we assessed whether AaHig influenced flavivirus attachment on the surface of Aag2 and C6/36 cells. When virions are added to cells at 4°C, the virions are just tethered on the cell surface, but are not internalized [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. After five washes with cold PBS buffer, the cells were collected to measure the viral burdens by qPCR. Compared to the mock control, incubation of AaHig did not block DENV-2 attachment onto the surface of Aag2 (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>) and C6/36 (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>) cells. Consistent results were also observed for JEV attachment to Aag2 (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S18A Fig</xref>) and C6/36 (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S18B Fig</xref>) cells. We next investigated the role of AaHig in viral internalization. Viruses and the proteins were incubated with the cells at 28°C (Aag2) or 30°C (C6/36) for various times, and viral loads were quantified after a stringent wash. AaHig blocked DENV-2 (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C and 8D</xref>) and JEV (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S18C and S18D Fig</xref>) entry into the mosquito Aag2 and C6/36 cells at all time points post incubation, suggesting that AaHig reduces flaviviral replication by directly interrupting viral internalization into mosquito cells.</p>

<p>DENV enters mosquito cells through clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The viral particles are then transported to endosomes, where the viral genome is released into the cytoplasm, leading to successful infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The entry processes can be dissected into (i) viral recognition by cellular attachment factors/receptors, (ii) viral entry via endocytosis, and (iii) viral membrane fusion with endosomal membranes, leading to the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Our data demonstrated that AaHig does not interrupt DENV attachment to the mosquito cell membrane (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>); however, AaHig significantly blocks the internalization of DENV into mosquito cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C and 8D</xref>), suggesting the AaHig inhibits viral entry. We next determined whether AaHig interferes with the endocytic transport of DENV. The AaHig protein was premixed with DENV-2 and subsequently incubated with Aag2 cells at 28°C for a time course. The same amount of BSA mixed with DENV-2 was used as a mock control. The viral particles were stained and observed using high-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM). The GTPase Rab5 was used as a specific marker for early endosomes [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In the control cells, the viruses were rapidly internalized into early endosomes. In contrast, most of the viral particles in the AaHig-treated cells were retained on the cell surface (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8E</xref>), suggesting that the AaHig protein interferes with early viral endocytosis. To determine whether AaHig is a general inhibitor of endocytic pathway or it specifically directly retains flaviviral particles on the cell surface to prevent viral entry, we used nano-beads with a 10–100 nm diameter, which mimic the size of the viruses, to perform a particle uptake assay in mosquito Aag2 cells. AaHig exhibited no nonspecific interactions with the beads. The number of internalized beads was measured using flow cytometry. Compared to the control groups, AaHig did not reduce particle uptake (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S19 Fig</xref>), indicating that AaHig does not interfere with general endocytosis. AaHig doesn’t interface with the SINV envelope proteins (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11F Fig</xref>). We next explored the role of AaHig in Sindbis entry of human alveolar basal epithelial A549 and mosquito Aag2 cells. However, AaHig did not influence the Sindbis burden in either type of cells in the viral entry assay (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s020" ref-type="supplementary-material">S20 Fig</xref>). In summary, AaHig specifically binds to flaviviral particles, this physical interaction does not interrupt viral attachment or binding to cellular receptors but inhibits receptor-mediated endocytosis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The central nervous system plays a predominant role in organisms associated with cognition and higher-order functions, which is key to their successful survival. Many mosquito-borne flaviviruses particularly invade the central nervous system in vertebrates, resulting in dramatic neural degeneration and damage. As natural vectors, mosquitoes are highly permissive to flaviviral infection, and yet they maintain a normal physiology and life span [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The mosquito’s brain, similarly to the mammalian brain, is sensitive to viral infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and thus its antiviral machinery is supposedly very efficient in limiting the viral burden to a safe level [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, little is known about the neuron-specific antiviral mechanism in mosquitoes. In this study, we report that AaHig controls viral replication specifically in the nervous system by interfering with viral entry, and its activity prevents lethal flaviviral infection of mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Both mammals and insects are equipped with sophisticated immune systems to detect and eliminate invading pathogens before they cause significant physiological damage. Viral recognition by host factors is an essential process for the antiviral response. The complement control protein (CCP) domain is evolutionarily conserved and interfaces with the surface of several pathogenic viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We have identified 6 <italic>CCP</italic> genes against DENV and YFV infections of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>, in which a scavenge receptor (AaSR-C) with 2 CCP modules recognizes DENV and the complement component to exert potent anti-DENV activity [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the current study, we found that a <italic>CCP</italic> factor named <italic>AaHig</italic> is specifically expressed in the nervous system of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>. AaHig is a secretory factor localized to the surface of neural cells. Immuno-blockade of AaHig significantly enhanced flaviviral replication in mosquito heads, and AaHig was capable of efficiently capturing flaviviral particles <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, therefore directly interrupting viral entry into mosquito cells to limit viral replication. The antiviral activity of Hig homologue was also observed in JEV infection of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>pipien pallens</italic>. Both the virus-binding and membrane-targeting ability of AaHig were essential for its antiviral activity. Indeed, the direct blockade of viral entry is a common strategy against viral invasion of mammalian cells. A siRNA-mediated gene silencing screen has identified a family of interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins that restrict the late stage of the endocytic pathway of many enveloped viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Further investigation revealed that IFITMs directly block the entry of viruses by disrupting intracellular cholesterol homeostasis [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], restricting viral membrane fusion [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], or interrupting the formation of viral fusion pores [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Meanwhile, the human collectins, such as mannose binding lectin (MBL) and surfactant proteins (SPs), are able to directly block virus entry. The pre-incubation of serial dilutions of MBL with HIV cell-derived living particles dramatically neutralized HIV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. MBL may directly inhibit HIV entry into T cells mediated by DC-SIGN, a key attachment factor for HIV invasion, via prevention of the direct HIV/DC-SIGN interaction [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. MBL was also reported to interact with the envelope glycoproteins of Ebola and Marburg viruses, resulting in the impairment of viral entry by blocking virus-DC-SIGN interactions [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. SP-D binds Influenza A virus, thereby inhibiting the attachment and entry of the virus by viral aggregation [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Here, our investigation shows that arthropods have evolved a similar machinery to recognize and interrupt viral entry, indicating the common ancestry of the innate immune arm presents in both mammals and arthropods.</p>
<p>Extracellular viruses are easily exposed to and destroyed by host immune effectors, such as antibodies in humans and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in insects. AMPs, regulated by NF-KappaB (REL)-mediated signaling, can directly electrostatically or hydrophobically associate with the viral surface components [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], subsequently resulting in viral inactivation [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].

However, in this study, the <italic>AMPs</italic> expression did not differ between the AaHig antibody-inoculated and pre-immune antibody-inoculated mosquitoes (<xref rid="ppat.1004848.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S16A–S16C Fig</xref>). AaHig is capable of tethering flaviviral particles onto the cell membrane and blocking viral entry into mosquito cells. The virions exposed outside mosquito cells have a greater chance to be eliminated by AMPs and other antiviral effectors. Therefore, the direct blockade of flaviviral entry could be an effective strategy for virus killing in mosquitoes. In addition to killing viruses and infected cells, one goal of the antiviral systems is to protect the uninfected cells from viral invasion. RNA interference (RNAi), which is deemed as the major antiviral machinery in mosquitoes, however only limits viral replication in infected cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004848.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The system cannot function in the extracellular milieu or prevent viral spread among mosquito cells. The AaHig-mediated antiviral mechanism may complement the intracellular antiviral machinery to efficiently control viral dissemination among mosquito cells.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes serve as the principal vectors for a number of flaviviruses in nature. In mosquitoes, the sophisticated antiviral systems successfully limit viral infection to a tolerable level, which protects the tissues from pathological damage by viral infection. Mosquitoes do not die of flaviviral infection in nature and in our experimental system. However, infection becomes lethal to mosquitoes when AaHig function is compromised, suggesting a critical role for AaHig in restricting virus-caused damage. Notably, the AaHig-mediated antiviral machinery is restricted to the brain, and it is dispensable in other tissues such as the salivary glands. In this regard, AaHig may potentially promote flavivirus transmission in nature by enabling mosquito survival and maintaining their normal life span. Characterizing the special antiviral mechanisms of insects may greatly extend our understanding of the sophisticated interactions between mosquito-borne viruses and their vectors and therefore may provide novel strategies for arboviral disease control in the future.</p>
