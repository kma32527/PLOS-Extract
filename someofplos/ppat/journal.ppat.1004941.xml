<abstract>
<p>Naïve anti-viral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (T<sub>CD8+</sub>) are activated by the presence of peptide-MHC Class I complexes (pMHC-I) on the surface of professional antigen presenting cells (pAPC). Increasing the number of pMHC-I <italic>in vivo</italic> can increase the number of responding T<sub>CD8+</sub>. Antigen can be presented directly or indirectly (cross presentation) from virus-infected and uninfected cells, respectively. Here we determined the relative importance of these two antigen presenting pathways in mousepox, a natural disease of the mouse caused by the poxvirus, ectromelia (ECTV). We demonstrated that ECTV infected several pAPC types (macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells (DC), including DC subsets), which directly presented pMHC-I to naïve T<sub>CD8+</sub> with similar efficiencies <italic>in vitro</italic>. We also provided evidence that these same cell-types presented antigen <italic>in vivo</italic>, as they form contacts with antigen-specific T<sub>CD8+</sub>. Importantly, the number of pMHC-I on infected pAPC (direct presentation) vastly outnumbered those on uninfected cells (cross presentation), where presentation only occurred in a specialized subset of DC. In addition, prior maturation of DC failed to enhance antigen presentation, but markedly inhibited ECTV infection of DC. These results suggest that direct antigen presentation is the dominant pathway in mice during mousepox. In a broader context, these findings indicate that if a virus infects a pAPC then the presentation by that cell is likely to dominate over cross presentation as the most effective mode of generating large quantities of pMHC-I is on the surface of pAPC that endogenously express antigens. Recent trends in vaccine design have focused upon the introduction of exogenous antigens into the MHC Class I processing pathway (cross presentation) in specific pAPC populations. However, use of a pantropic viral vector that targets pAPC to express antigen endogenously likely represents a more effective vaccine strategy than the targeting of exogenous antigen to a limiting pAPC subpopulation.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>To induce a protective cell type (CD8+ T cells) following virus infection, it is necessary to present degraded fragments of viral protein in complex with self molecules on the surface of so-called antigen presenting cells (APC). This process can occur in infected or uninfected APC and has been studied and quantified extensively in experimental setups in the lab. However, the extent to which presentation by infected or uninfected cells contribute to the induction of a protective CD8+ T cell response has not been studied extensively during a natural infection in a mouse model. Here we use a natural mouse virus to examine importantly, quantify, the contribution of presentation of the fragments of viral protein by infected or uninfected cells. We find that the presentation by infected cells dwarfs that seen by uninfected cells. The importance of this work lies in the fact that, if infected cells present way more antigen than uninfected cells, successful vaccine design should utilize this observation to make a vaccine where infected cells expressing virus proteins are the prevalent mode of induction of CD8+ T cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the fight against virus invasion, T<sub>CD8+</sub> play an essential role by killing virus-infected cells. Activation of these cells by professional antigen presenting cells (pAPC) is a vital step in generation of an effective adaptive immune response. pAPC are a heterogeneous population comprised of B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells (DC), and specialized subsets of each of those populations. Numerous studies have examined the abilities of these populations and subpopulations to present pMHC-I following virus infection or immunization [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These studies have concluded that certain pAPC populations are specialized for particular functions, leading to multiple strategies targeting particular pAPC populations in vaccine design [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, the extent to which pAPC populations provide sufficient pMHC-I for maximal generation of T<sub>CD8+</sub> depends on factors such as viral tropism for pAPC populations [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], interference with pMHC-I processing pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], or lysis of infected pAPC populations [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
<p>To date, previous studies have relied upon the semi-quantitative activation of T cells, measured either by initiation of proliferation or acquisition of effector functions such as cytokine production or lytic activity. Each measure of T cell activity is quantitative only in the sense that each T cell has undergone proliferation or displayed effector activity, but these activities are affected by many other factors, including the expression of costimulatory and adhesion molecules by T<sub>CD8+</sub> or pAPC, the cytokine milieu and/or modulation of each of these factors by virus infection or pre-activation of the pAPC by other inflammatory stimuli [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Here we have quantitatively examined antigen presentation following infection with a poxvirus, the natural mouse pathogen ectromelia virus (ECTV), which is pantropic for all pAPC populations examined. Our system allowed us to differentiate between presentation of endogenously synthesized antigen by multiple populations of infected pAPC (direct presentation) and presentation of antigen acquired by uninfected pAPC populations (cross presentation). We have demonstrated that presentation of endogenously synthesized antigen results in much higher pMHC-I levels than acquisition of exogenous antigen and that, on a per cell basis, each infected pAPC population produces equivalent pMHC-I levels, irrespective of activation or maturation status. These data have important ramifications for rational vaccine design in that they indicate that a vaccine in which endogenous synthesis of the targeted antigen occurs within multiple pAPC populations is the most effective way to generate the greatest number of effective pMHC-I complexes which, in turn, results in an optimal antigen specific T<sub>CD8+</sub> response.</p>

<title>ECTV infects lymphoid cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, and ECTV-infected cells directly present SIINFEKL on K<sup>b</sup> in a TAP dependent manner</title>
<p>To quantify ECTV infection and subsequent antigen presentation, we utilized a recombinant ECTV virus that encodes a fusion protein (NP-S-EGFP) consisting of the influenza nucleoprotein (NP), an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), and ovalbumin (OVA) residues 257–264 (SIINFEKL) [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This system allows us to identify ECTV-infected and uninfected cells based on the presence and absence of EGFP expression. Following injection with NP-S-EGFP i.d., draining lymph nodes (D-LN) were harvested at 12 h.p.i. from naïve or ECTV-infected mice. A distinct EGFP<sup>+</sup> cell population was observed (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). ECTV-infected cells were resident in the periphery of the D-LN, just below the sub-capsular sinus by 6 h.p.i (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). To assess whether the EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells were infected by ECTV and were not uninfected cells that had engulfed dead or dying EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells or EGFP<sup>+</sup> cellular material, we conducted the following experiment. Splenocytes from C57BL/6.SJL (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>) mice were infected <italic>in vitro</italic> with ECTV NP-S-EGFP or wild type (wt) ECTV to allow expression of viral antigen and then treated with psoralen and UV-C-crosslinking to abolish further virus replication [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>). The infected and psoralen/UV treated cells were injected i.v into C57BL/6 (CD45.2<sup>+</sup>) mice, and spleens subsequently assessed for the presence of recipient-derived EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells. As a positive control, mice were directly infected i.v with a dose of NP-S-EGFP that was 30-fold lower than the number of infected splenocytes injected. We found EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in mice directly infected with ECTV NP-S-EGFP but not in naïve mice or mice immunized with either WT ECTV or a large excess of NP-S-EGFP-infected cells (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Notably, infection of cells by ECTV <italic>in vivo</italic> was dependent on virus replication (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>). These results demonstrate that EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells resulted from ECTV infection, and not from internalization of EGFP<sup>+</sup> material by uninfected cells.</p>

<p>We isolated cells from the D-LN of mice infected with ECTV NP-S-EGFP or NP-EGFP (which lacks the OVA<sub>257-264</sub> SIINFEKL determinant) 12 h.p.i. and stained with an antibody specific for K<sup>b</sup>-SIINFEKL complexes [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Cells from mice inoculated with ECTV NP-EGFP did not show staining above background. Infected cells from ECTV NP-S-EGFP-infected mice expressed measurable levels of K<sup>b</sup>-SIINFEKL complexes (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>) but none of the uninfected GFP<sup>-</sup> cells from mice infected with ECTV NP-S-EGFP displayed antibody staining (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). To ensure that antigen presentation in infected cells occurred via the conventional endogenous processing pathway, we measured antigen presentation following infection of mice lacking TAP1, a vital component of this pathway. Mice lacking TAP1 did not display staining for K<sup>b</sup>-SIINFEKL complexes above background levels (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that this infection allows differentiation between virus-infected and uninfected cells <italic>in vivo</italic> and accurate quantification of specific peptide-MHC complexes on infected cells.</p>

<title>DC, B cells and macrophages are infected by ECTV and directly present antigen that leads to priming of naïve T<sub>CD8+</sub></title>
<p>To examine the pAPC (DC, B cells and macrophages) infected by ECTV, we injected vehicle, NP-EGFP, or NP-S-EGFP i.d., and harvested D-LN at 24 h.p.i. We stained with a panel of antibodies to identify DC (CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD169<sup>-</sup> CD19<sup>-</sup>), B cells (CD19<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>-</sup> CD169<sup>-</sup> B220<sup>+</sup>), and macrophages (CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>-</sup> CD19<sup>-</sup> CD169<sup>+</sup>) (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>). A kinetic analysis indicated that CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages were the first pAPC to be infected, while CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells and CD11c<sup>+</sup> DC were infected by 12 h.p.i. (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>). Therefore, at 24 h.p.i all major populations of pAPC were infected (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>), allowing us to compare the efficiency of antigen presentation by each pAPC population. We compared the fluorescence produced from antigen-conjugated GFP in each pAPC population (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). B cells and macrophages expressed equivalent levels of antigen, but DC expressed significantly more ECTV-encoded antigen on a per cell basis (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, top panel). As above, we found that only infected pAPC stained for K<sup>b</sup>-SIINFEKL. Staining of uninfected B cells, macrophages and DC was indistinguishable from cells isolated from mice infected with control ECTV-NP-GFP. We found higher levels of K<sup>b</sup>-SIINFEKL complexes on the surface of DC than on the surface of B cells, and each was significantly higher than the levels observed on the surface of macrophages (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref> middle panel). The levels of K<sup>b</sup>-SIINFEKL complexes increased with time after infection with NP-S-EGFP (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig</xref>). Because DC express more ECTV antigen than B cells or macrophages (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, top panel) we sought to ascertain the efficiency of antigen presentation in each pAPC population by equalizing for protein expression. Therefore, we calculated the efficiency of direct presentation as a ratio of K<sup>b</sup>-SIINFEKL complexes per EGFP protein, which represents the formation of pMHC-I complexes as a function of the levels of the protein antigen from which the complexes were derived. DC and B cells were equally efficient at producing K<sup>b</sup>-SIINFEKL complexes while macrophages were significantly less efficient (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, bottom panel).</p>

<p>Although K<sup>b</sup>-SIINFEKL complexes were only detected on the surface of infected pAPC populations, levels below the threshold of detection with the 25.D1.16 antibody might still be capable of T<sub>CD8+</sub> stimulation [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, we analyzed the ability of ECTV-infected and uninfected pAPC populations to activate naïve SIINFEKL-specific OT-I T<sub>CD8+</sub> [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Mice were injected in the footpads with either NP-EGFP or NP-S-EGFP, and EGFP<sup>+</sup> or uninfected EGFP<sup>-</sup> B cells, DC and macrophages were sorted from D-LN cell suspensions. Each cell population was co-cultured separately with naïve OT-I T<sub>CD8+</sub> and T<sub>CD8+</sub> proliferation was determined at 60 h post-culture. None of the pAPC populations purified from mice infected with control NP-EGFP, activated OT-I T<sub>CD8</sub> above background (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Only NP-S-EGFP-infected B cells and macrophages robustly activated naive OT-I T<sub>CD8+</sub>, whereas uninfected B cells and macrophages did not stimulate naive OT-I T<sub>CD8+</sub> (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Notably, both ECTV-infected and uninfected DC were capable of activating naïve OT-I T<sub>CD8+</sub> (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref> bottom panel). Thus, although K<sup>b</sup>-SIINFEKL complexes were undetectable with antibody staining on EGFP<sup>-</sup> DC (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D and 2B</xref>), these uninfected DC appear specialized (compared to B cells and macrophages) to express sufficient K<sup>b</sup>-SIINFEKL complexes to stimulate the high affinity TCR on OT-I T<sub>CD8+</sub>.</p>

(Figs <xref rid="ppat.1004941.g003" ref-type="fig">3C–3J</xref>), D-LN were harvested for microscopic analysis. ECTV-infected cells were predominantly located at the periphery of the D-LN just below the sub-capsular sinus at early time points, with a few cells observable in the cortical region (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1004941.g003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004941.g003" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>), as we [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and others [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] have previously described following infection with the related poxvirus vaccinia virus (VACV). However, in contrast to short–lived VACV infection, where the number of GFP+ cells is reduced over time [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], following ECTV infection, EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells were visualized 300 m from the periphery at 24 h.p.i, and the number of infected cells had increased significantly (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1004941.g003" ref-type="fig">3C, 3E, 3G and 3I</xref>), mirroring our flow cytometry analyses (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>). Notably, in D-LN infected with SIINFEKL-expressing virus (NP-S-EGFP), the OT-I T<sub>CD8+</sub> relocated into the peripheral regions of the D-LN (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), presumably, to interact with virus-infected cells. However, in D-LN infected with NP-EGFP (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>), OT-I T<sub>CD8+</sub> were restricted to the T cell zone.</p>

<title>CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC, CD8α<sup>+</sup> DC, and pDC subsets are infected by ECTV and directly present antigen on MHC class I with equivalent efficiency</title>
<p>DC are composed of different subpopulations that are proposed to be specialized to perform differing tasks during antigen presentation [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Several studies have reported a role for individual DC subsets in MHC class I mediated T<sub>CD8+</sub> activation [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, during a virus infection it is vital to account for viral tropism for individual DC subsets versus functional specialization of DC presenting viral antigen. We focused on the three major DC subsets in lymph node and spleen characterized as: CD8α<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>-</sup> B220<sup>-</sup> (hereafter CD8α<sup>+</sup> DC), CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD8α <sup>-</sup> B220<sup>-</sup> (hereafter CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC), and plasmacytoid B220<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>-</sup> (hereafter pDC). To determine whether there is specialization in MHC class I presentation by infected DC subsets, mice were injected with NP-EGFP or NP-S-EGFP i.d., and D-LN were harvested at 24 h.p.i. Cells were stained to identify DC subsets and analyzed by flow cytometry. As NK cells, T cells and B cells share some DC markers and may alter antigen presentation [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] we stained with antibodies to identify NK cells, T cells and B cells, to exclude these lymphoid populations from our analysis. We found that GFP+ cells contained all DC subsets (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). We did not observe staining for K<sup>b</sup>-SIINFEKL complexes on any uninfected cell population.

<title>CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC and pDC stimulate antigen specific T<sub>CD8+</sub> via direct priming, while CD8α<sup>+</sup> DC utilize both direct and cross-presentation pathways</title>
<p>Because uninfected DC stimulated T<sub>CD8+</sub> (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref> bottom panel) we asked whether specific uninfected DC subsets were specialized to present antigen. We compared the ability of uninfected and ECTV-infected DC subsets to activate naive OT-I T<sub>CD8+</sub> following a footpad injection with NP-S-EGFP. Twenty-four h.p.i., D-LN cells were FACS-sorted for EGFP<sup>+</sup> and EGFP<sup>-</sup> DC subsets. Isolated DC sub-populations were co-cultured with naïve OT-I T<sub>CD8+</sub>, and 60 h later T<sub>CD8+</sub> proliferation was determined. Infection with NP-EGFP did not induce proliferation of OT-I T<sub>CD8+</sub> (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). Infected CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC and pDC from mice infected with ECTV-NP-S-EGFP were highly efficient in stimulating naïve OT-I T<sub>CD8+</sub>, but uninfected CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC and pDC did not significantly prime T<sub>CD8+</sub> (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). However, both ECTV-infected and uninfected CD8α <sup>+</sup> DC activated OT-I T<sub>CD8+</sub> (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>), indicating that the T<sub>CD8+</sub> activation by uninfected DC in <xref rid="ppat.1004941.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref> was mediated by cross presentation by CD8α <sup>+</sup> DC.</p>
<p>The inflammatory milieu and expression of costimulatory molecules can also affect the efficiency of T<sub>CD8+</sub> stimulation. Therefore, the inability of EGFP<sup>-</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC and pDC isolated from NP-S-EGFP-infected D-LN to prime naïve OT-I T<sub>CD8+</sub> could be attributed to the lack of or lower expression of co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD80 (B7.1) and CD86 (B7.2), compared to EGFP<sup>+</sup> DC. However, there was no significant difference in expression of CD86 between ECTV-infected and uninfected DC in any of the subsets examined and only minor changes in CD80 expression in the CD11b<sup>+</sup> population (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). Therefore, ECTV infection of DC does not inhibit maturation and changes in costimulatory molecule expression induced by infection are unlikely to account for the differential ability of uninfected DC subsets to present antigen.</p>

<title>Maturation of DC by TLR agonist treatment does not enhance direct presentation <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Maturation of DC has been reported to enhance antigen presentation, and systemic <italic>in vivo</italic> activation of DC by TLR agonists such as LPS, CpG-B, and Poly I:C is reported to block cross presentation of viral antigen by uninfected cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Vaccines aimed at inducing protective T<sub>CD8+</sub> responses have the promise of targeting invariant intracellular proteins that can be used to clear the pathogens encoding the antigens when antibody responses are ineffective. Recent studies have indicated that pAPC, and particularly DC, subpopulations are specialized to induce T cell responses via different antigen presentation pathways. Recent vaccine strategies have specifically targeted exogenous antigen to particular DC populations, often along with ligands known to induce DC maturation, in an attempt to increase the efficacy of T<sub>CD8+</sub> priming [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, our work reveals that for vaccines aimed at inducing protective T<sub>CD8+</sub>, targeting only individual pAPC populations, particularly with exogenous antigens, may drastically reduce the presentation of peptide-MHC complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>, irrespective of DC maturation. In particular, our results indicate that the number of peptide MHC complexes generated from endogenous sources dramatically outnumbers those produced from exogenous sources. Indeed, peptide-MHC complexes produced from exogenous sources were below the level of detection using our specific antibody (&gt;100 complexes per cell [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]) even when mice were immunized with 3 x 10<sup>7</sup> infected cells expressing large quantities of viral protein. Therefore it is clear that if a virus infects a pAPC more peptide-MHC complexes are likely to be produced than if these cells remain uninfected, even if targeted exogenously. This finding may have been hidden by the experimental use of mismatched human virus/murine target combinations where virus tropism is diverted away from pAPC, which are often a Trojan Horse when infected that allow transmission of numerous viruses. The use of the ECTV system reveals that during a fulminant natural infection, direct presentation likely predominates during induction of protective T<sub>CD8+.</sub></p>
<p>Increasing the number of pMHC-I on the surface of an APC <italic>in vitro</italic> causes activation induced cell death and allows survival of only low affinity T<sub>CD8+</sub> [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In contrast, increasing the number of pMHC-I <italic>in vivo</italic> can increase the number of T<sub>CD8+</sub> primed [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] up to a certain point [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and does not reduce the affinity of the responding T<sub>CD8+</sub>. Therefore, a vaccine vector that produces a larger number of cell surface pMHC-I will produce more effective T<sub>CD8+</sub>. The T<sub>CD8+</sub> response to the poxvirus VACV is initiated following antigen presentation by infected APC [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Here we demonstrate that the number of pMHC-I presented by infected pAPC vastly outnumbers the number of complexes presented by uninfected pAPC, even when the antigen is readily available for presentation by both infected and uninfected cells. Therefore, our findings show that the most efficient way to induce a strong T<sub>CD8+</sub> response is to utilize a vaccine in which endogenous expression of antigen within pAPC is optimized.</p>
<p>Here we found that uninfected CD8α<sup>+</sup> DC were able to present exogenously derived viral antigen. Previous studies have implicated CD8 α<sup>+</sup> DC in the presentation of all viral antigen [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], but these studies may reflect preferential infection of certain DC subpopulations by viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], or exclusive presentation of exogenous antigen as pAPC are not infected [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, it has been proposed that some pAPC populations are specialized to present peptides on MHC Class I while other populations are specialized to present on MHC Class II [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Support for this hypothesis comes from gene array analysis describing a paucity of expression of components of the MHC Class I processing pathway in DC populations that did not present exogenous antigen [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Importantly, these studies only examined presentation of exogenous antigen. Virtually all nucleated cells express both MHC Class I and the machinery required to present peptide-MHC complexes derived from endogenous antigens. Specialization of pAPC populations to avoid such presentation would furnish viruses and intracellular bacteria with a location in which they could replicate with relative indifference to the action of the adaptive immune system. Therefore, it is logical that all infected pAPC will present pMHC-I derived from endogenous antigens, and this is indeed what we observe.</p>
<p>We examined the relative efficiency of presentation of endogenous antigens to reveal that DC do not appear to be more efficient at presenting endogenous antigens than B cells, although both appear to be better than macrophages (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). There is no specialization within DC subpopulations, a pronounced difference from the presentation of exogenous antigens, which CD8α<sup>+</sup> DCs are substantially superior at presenting [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This lack of specialization by DC populations is at odds with the gene array data indicating differential expression of MHC Class I processing machinery [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, the supply of antigenic peptide, rather than the expression of any processing components, is limiting in MHC Class I presentation [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, the rate of antigen production and degradation controls the efficiency and amplitude of antigen presentation in infected cells. In the system examined here, DC (of all subsets) produce more fluorescent antigen than other pAPC, and so present a higher number of peptide-MHC complexes per cell. Peptides are generated from endogenous short-lived proteins, termed Defective Ribosomal Products (DRiP) or Rapidly Degraded Proteins (RDPs) [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] much more efficiently than from long-lived proteins, which are the substrates for cross presentation [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. DRiP/RDP are unlikely to be correctly folded and therefore may not be fluorescent in our system. Our calculations of the relative efficiency of antigen presentation are made with the assumption that the proportion of newly synthesized protein within the RDP fraction is equal between pAPC populations. There are no publications that indicate the contrary.</p>
<p>DC that were ECTV-infected following TLR agonist treatment directly presented antigen at equivalent levels to untreated DC, demonstrating that DC maturation does not enhance antigen presentation and so likely does not affect the supply of antigenic peptide. Systemic TLR ligation did block cross presentation, as previously published [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], but it also reduced ECTV infection by around 70% demonstrating that, as with VACV infection, TLR ligation fails to differentiate between antigen presentation by infected and uninfected pAPC [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Pre-treatment of DC with TLR ligands rendered DC resistant to influenza virus infection <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, we did not observe a decrease in virus infectivity when DC were treated with TLR agonists <italic>in vitro</italic>, regardless of MOI. It is possible that this may reflect an overall reduction in DC infectability that is a byproduct of the DC isolation procedure upon infectability with ECTV, but this is unavoidable. Nonetheless, we did not observe an inhibition of infection by TLR treatment in vitro. Thus, systemic TLR ligation may reduce the infectability of pAPC populations via an indirect mechanism, such as the relocalization of DC populations, alteration in virus drainage to reduce cellular exposure to virus, or inhibition of virus replication through induction of innate antiviral pathways.</p>
<p>Using current methodology, it has not been possible to differentiate between infection of DC in the periphery or in the D-LN. However, at early time points following ECTV infection i.d, the ECTV-infected cells in the D-LN were found predominantly below the sub-capsular sinus, and phenotypic analysis showed that these infected cells were CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages. Infection of macrophages found within or below the sub-capsular sinus has been previously reported with VACV and vesicular stomatitis virus infection [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Our kinetic studies of ECTV infection revealed that macrophages were probably the first pAPC to be infected by 6 h.p.i., while B cells and DC were infected by 12 hours post-ECTV infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004941.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). These findings suggest that virus drained from the site of infection into the D-LN and subsequently infected DC, although we cannot exclude the possibility that ECTV-infected DC migrated from the site of infection into the D-LN at later time points [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p>
<p>Although it was expected that only certain infected pAPC populations interact with naïve T<sub>CD8+</sub> we readily identified naïve T<sub>CD8+</sub> interacting with all of the pAPC populations that are presenting antigen. The interaction of macrophages and DC with T<sub>CD8+</sub> during a poxvirus infection has been previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Previous reports also showed that recently triggered antigen-specific T<sub>CD8+</sub> relocated to the peripheral regions in an area termed the “peripheral inter-follicular region” [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This region was just below the LN sub-capsular sinus, and T<sub>CD8+</sub> were shown to interact with DC found in this macrophage-rich region of the LN. Interaction with infected macrophages may induce an intermediate activation phenotype [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The rapid decline in GFP<sup>+</sup> cells following VACV infection indicates that this non-native virus infection rapidly kills the cells that it infects and inefficiently infects other cells in the D-LN, which contributes to our inability to purify significant numbers of VACV-infected cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. All ECTV-infected pAPC populations (including infected B cells) purified from infected mice were able to trigger <italic>in vitro</italic> proliferation of naïve T<sub>CD8+</sub>, and interact with naïve T<sub>CD8+</sub> <italic>in vivo</italic>. The interaction of infected B cells and naïve T<sub>CD8+</sub> observed is surprising, the separation between the T cell zone and the B cell follicle within secondary lymphoid organs is carefully regulated by tightly controlled chemokine gradients. However, poxviruses, including ECTV, encode chemokine-binding proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1004941.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] that likely alter the balance of local chemokines in infected LN. Such an alteration in local chemokine gradient could allow interaction of T<sub>CD8+</sub> with infected B cells. Notably, very few T<sub>CD8+</sub> were visualized in the B cell follicles but were mainly distributed in the cortical region and marginal zones of the LN. This suggests that ECTV-infected B cells may have migrated to the inter-follicular regions where they interacted with antigen-specific T<sub>CD8+</sub>. Our ongoing efforts seek to understand the impact of ECTV-mediated changes in local chemokine gradients on the role of B cells in induction of ECTV-specific T<sub>CD8+</sub> and T<sub>CD4+</sub>.</p>
<p>Overall, our results are of importance for both vaccine design and to appreciate the basic mechanisms responsible for induction of a T<sub>CD8+</sub> response to a fulminant widespread virus infection. In a vaccine the most effective way to induce large numbers of antigen-specific T<sub>CD8+</sub> appears to be expression of antigen endogenously within pAPC populations, as the number of peptide-MHC complexes generated from endogenous antigens far exceeds those produced from exogenous sources. Specific DC populations did not display enhanced presentation capabilities, and prior induction of a T<sub>CD8+</sub> response did not enhance antigen presentation on a cellular level. Our data indicate that a viral vector that effectively infects multiple pAPC populations and induces an inflammatory state via expression of natural pattern recognition receptor ligands may induce an optimal protective T<sub>CD8+</sub> response. In terms of the basic mechanisms responsible for induction of a T<sub>CD8+</sub> response it appears that a widespread natural infection may primarily use direct presentation by infected pAPC to prime naïve T<sub>CD8+</sub>. The predominance of the use of cross presentation in the literature may be a byproduct of the study of human viruses in the mouse or of viruses that specifically avoid infection, even if unproductive, of pAPC populations.</p>
