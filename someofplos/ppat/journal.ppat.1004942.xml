<abstract>
<p>African trypanosomiasis is a deadly neglected disease caused by the extracellular parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>. Current therapies are characterized by high drug toxicity and increasing drug resistance mainly associated with loss-of-function mutations in the transporters involved in drug import. The introduction of new antiparasitic drugs into therapeutic use is a slow and expensive process. In contrast, specific targeting of existing drugs could represent a more rapid and cost-effective approach for neglected disease treatment, impacting through reduced systemic toxicity and circumventing resistance acquired through impaired compound uptake. We have generated nanoparticles of chitosan loaded with the trypanocidal drug pentamidine and coated by a single domain nanobody that specifically targets the surface of African trypanosomes. Once loaded into this nanocarrier, pentamidine enters trypanosomes through endocytosis instead of via classical cell surface transporters. The curative dose of pentamidine-loaded nanobody-chitosan nanoparticles was 100-fold lower than pentamidine alone in a murine model of acute African trypanosomiasis. Crucially, this new formulation displayed undiminished in vitro and in vivo activity against a trypanosome cell line resistant to pentamidine as a result of mutations in the surface transporter aquaglyceroporin 2. We conclude that this new drug delivery system increases drug efficacy and has the ability to overcome resistance to some anti-protozoal drugs.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Drug resistance is complicating the treatment of parasitic diseases including African trypanosomiasis, a fatal disease if left untreated. Development of a vaccine is unlikely due to parasite antigenic variation. Current chemotherapy relies primarily on four drugs. Three of these drugs access the cell’s interior through surface transporters and resistance mechanisms are largely associated with loss-of-function mutations in the involved surface drug transporters. We reasoned that using an alternative drug entrance would circumvent parasite resistance due to mutation in a surface transporter. We have developed a drug nanocarrier that consists of polymeric nanoparticles coated with a single domain antibody that targets the trypanosome surface. This new formulation reduces the minimal curative dose and, most importantly, circumvents drug resistance in a resistant cell line as a result of mutations in the surface transporter that mediate drug uptake. This study presents a proof-of-concept of a novel technology for reversing transporter-related drug resistance with applications to other infectious diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is caused by the flagellated protozoa <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>gambiense</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>b</italic>. <italic>rhodesiense</italic>, which are transmitted by tsetse flies of the genus <italic>Glossina</italic> from human and/or animal reservoirs [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Trypanosomes evade their hosts’ humoral immune response through continuous variation of the variant surface glycoprotein through a process called antigenic variation, hampering the generation of conventional vaccines [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, treatment of African trypanosomiasis with chemotherapy is the only viable control option. HAT chemotherapy relies primarily on four drugs: pentamidine, suramin, melarsoprol and, most recently, eflornithine/nifurtimox combination therapy (NECT) [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. All of them have limitations, ranging from problems with poor efficacy and acute toxicity to drug resistance [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].One of the most promising new therapeutic approaches for improved chemotherapy focuses on the design of polymeric nanostructures as drug delivery systems. Chitosan is a biodegradable and biocompatible compound obtained by partial deacetylation of the natural polymer chitin. Chitosan may be prepared as nanoparticle (NP) drug carriers functionalized with agents such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). Targeted delivery of nanoparticles enhances the effectiveness of the treatment, minimizes toxicity and prevents drug metabolism and elimination [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Active targeting and delivery can be achieved by coupling ligands or antibodies onto the surface of the NPs. For example, the single-domain antibodies (called nanobodies) are small antibodies fragments, derived from camelids heavy chain antibodies through recombinant gene technology, with unique antigen recognition properties; they can be used to target biological structures or specific cell types [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], including African trypanosomes [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we have developed a new polyvalent drug delivery system for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis based on PEGylated chitosan nanoparticles coated with a nanobody that specifically recognizes conserved cryptic epitopes on the parasite surface [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nanoparticles were loaded with the trypanocidal drug pentamidine and its effectiveness was assayed in vitro and in vivo against <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> and a pentamidine resistant cell line.</p>

<title>Generation and characterization of the drug delivery system</title>
<p>We designed a nanocarrier for drugs, consisting of pentamidine-loaded functionalized PEGylated-chitosan nanoparticles, coated by a single-domain antibody (nanobody) derived from camel heavy-chain antibodies, which targets the surface of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. More precisely, this nanobody, known as NbAn33, specifically recognizes a conserved N-linked high mannose oligosaccharide present in most VSGs [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The nanobody epitope is located close the parasite surface membrane, inaccessible for large molecules such as conventional antibodies. Heterofunctional PEG chains were employed to link NbAn33 to chitosan NPs. The molecular weight of the PEG used, 3 kDa, was an important parameter in the design of the nanocarrier. As previously reported [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], its chain length (26 nm) allows the nanobody linked to the NPs to reach its recognition epitope concealed within the densely packed VSG surface coat (about 10–15 nm thick) acting as an anchor rope for the nanoparticle.</p>
<p>Pentamidine-loaded functionalized PEGylated-chitosan nanoparticles coated by NbAn33, NbAn33-pentamidine-chNPs, were generated by a coacervation method [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] which allowed the generation of well-stabilized spherical NPs with an average size of ~ 135 nm in diameter [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). A Zeta (ζ) potential value analysis showed no substantial differences between the surface charge properties of pentamidine loaded NPs and empty NPs, indicating that pentamidine was trapped inside NPs rather than just absorbed at the surface (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). PEGylation of chitosan NPs was qualitatively confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance. The maximum pentamidine concentration loaded into NPs, expressed as entrapment efficiency and drug loading capacity, was 67% and 23%, respectively. The in vitro characterization of pentamidine release showed a biphasic profile at physiological pH: 40% of the encapsulated pentamidine was rapidly released within the first 12 h, while the remaining 60% was released at a constant rate during the following ~5 days (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, the NPs showed a pH-responsive drug release (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>), likely due to swelling/degradation of the NP matrix at acid pH. This behaviour may be advantageous for the intracellular delivery of pentamidine in acidic compartments. Finally, results from blood compatibility studies indicated a broad in vivo safety margin for all the nanoparticulate formulations (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>In vitro trypanotoxicity studies</title>
<p>The-inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) value of free pentamidine for bloodstream trypanosomes was 9.6 ± 0.3 nM (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The trypanolytic effect of pentamidine was significantly improved when it was loaded into NbAn33-pentamidine-chNPs. The IC<sub>50</sub> value was 0.69 nM, which represents an approximately 14-fold reduction in drug concentration relative to free pentamidine (P&lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). To evaluate the contribution of NbAn33 to nanoparticles efficacy, the effect of pentamidine-loaded PEGylated chitosan nanoparticles (pentamidine-chNPs) that had not been coated by the NbAn33 was tested in parallel. The trypanocidal activity of non-coated NPs was still higher than free pentamidine (IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.94 nM; P&lt;0.0001, versus free pentamidine) but lower than NbAn33-pentamidine-chNPs (P&lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). One factor in the relative effectiveness of the uncoated NPs compared to free pentamidine may be the electrostatic interactions between positively charged nanoparticles with the slightly negatively charged surface of the bloodstream forms. As expected, neither unloaded PEGylated chitosan nanoparticles (chNPs-empty) nor empty nanobody-coated PEGylated-chitosan nanoparticles (NbAn33-chNPs) had any effect on parasite viability (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>In vivo therapeutic studies</title>
<p>The minimal full curative dose of pentamidine in a mouse model of acute infection of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> was previously established as four doses of 2.5 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup> administrated daily by intraperitoneal injection in four consecutive days, starting upon detection of parasites in blood (day 3 after infection) [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and this was also curative in our model of infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Mice were intraperitoneally infected with 10<sup>4</sup> parasites. In the group of mice treated with a 10-fold lower dose of free pentamidine (4×0.25 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>) the parasites disappeared from the peripheral blood after the third dose (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). However, the infection relapsed and the mice began to die at day 22 after infection, curing only 20% of the treated animals (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Having established the suboptimal pentamidine curative dose (4×0.25 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>), we treated mice with an equal dose of pentamidine loaded into NbAn33-chNPs. Clearance of parasites from this group was complete after the first dose and the treatment successfully cured 100% of the animals (Fig <xref rid="ppat.1004942.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004942.g001" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Infected mice were also treated with the same pentamidine dose loaded into chNPs that were not coated with the nanobody. In this group parasites disappeared from the blood after the first dose, however 40% of the treated mice succumbed to the infection (Fig <xref rid="ppat.1004942.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004942.g001" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Next, a dose that was 100-fold lower than the minimal curative dose of pentamidine was tested. At that low dosage (4×0.025 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>), free pentamidine did not cure any of the mice from trypanosome infection. Although the parasitemia levels increased less rapidly than in vehicle treated mice the parasites never disappeared from the blood and all mice died after 7–12 days of infection (Fig <xref rid="ppat.1004942.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004942.g001" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). As observed in vitro, pentamidine loaded into non coated NPs was more effective than free pentamidine probably as a consequence of a sustainable drug release from the nanoparticles. Remarkably, treatment with 4 doses of NbAn33-pentamidine-chNPs at 0.025 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup> was able to eliminate the parasitemia after the second dose, curing all treated mice (Fig <xref rid="ppat.1004942.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004942.g001" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). However, the same low dose of pentamidine loaded into chNPs non-coated by the NbAn33, despite clearing the parasites from the blood after the third dose, did not cure mice, with 100% of the treated animals dying from the infection (median survival time 22 days).</p>
<p>In order to investigate the circulation kinetics of NbAn33-chNPs injected intraperitoneally, we compared the percentage of the dose of NbAn33-chNPs in peripheral blood when administered intraperitoneally versus intravenously. Thus, NbAn33-chNPs labelled with the infrared fluorophore (DY-649) were administered intravenously or intraperitoneally and fluorescence in blood was measured at various time points. Nanoparticles concentration in blood at 15 min after intravenous injection was taken as reference value (100%). About 90% of the NbAn33-chNPs intraperitoneally administered was detectable in blood after 60 min post injection (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). These results demonstrated that the intraperitoneal route was suitable for NbAn33-chNPs administration.</p>

<title>Uptake of NbAn33-coated NPs in bloodstream trypanosomes</title>
<p>Three previous studies have shown that NbAn33 is internalized by endocytosis in bloodstream trypanosomes [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, one would anticipate that nanoparticles coated by the nanobody NbAn33 would enter the cell via this route. Nanoparticles uptake was monitored by fluorescence after incubating bloodstream trypanosomes with Alexa-labelled-NbAn33-chNPs at 37°C. As expected, the fluorescence signal concentrates rapidly in the flagellar pocket (FP) (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>) and after in the endocytic pathway colocalizing with fluorescent tomato lectin, a marker of this route in bloodstream African trypanosomes [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Moreover, a comparative study of the trypanocidal actvity of NbAn33-pentamidine-chNPs at 4°C and 37°C showed that at 37°C trypanotoxicity was time dependent (20% and 65% of cell death after 2 and 4 hour of incubation in the presence of pentamidine (30 μM) (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). However, no activity was observed at 4°C under the conditions of the experiment. Together, these results indicate that NbAn33-chNPs internalization depends on the endocytic process.</p>

<title>Effectiveness of pentamidine loaded NbAn33-chNPs in a pentamidine resistant cell line</title>
<p>Resistance to pentamidine in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> is associated with mutations in cell surface transport proteins, specifically in the TbAT1/P2-adenosine transporter [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and in the aquaglyceroporin 2 (AQP2) channel [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, pentamidine loaded into nanoparticles coated by the nanobody NbAn33 is internalized by the endocytic route (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). We reasoned that this alternative drug entrance would circumvent parasite resistance to the drug. To test the hypothesis that the trypanocidal action of encapsulated pentamidine was not dependent on cell surface transporters, a <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> pentamidine-resistant cell line was selected after in vitro exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug (up to 50 nM). The resistant clonal cell line, designated <italic>Tb</italic>R25, was genetically and functionally characterized to determine whether resistance was due to a mutation in one of the known pentamidine transporters in the plasma membrane. The <italic>TbAT1/P2</italic>-adenosine transporter gene was amplified from wild type and <italic>Tb</italic>R25 genomic DNA. No differences in length or sequence were observed between both PCR products. Moreover, no significant change in <italic>TbAT1/P2</italic> expression levels was noted by real-time qRT-PCR analysis between wild type and resistant cell line (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Finally, <italic>Tb</italic>R25 and wild type trypanosomes were equally sensitive to diminazene aceturate (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>), another trypanocidal aromatic diamidine where uptake is almost exclusively mediated by the TbAT1/P2 adenosine transporter [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Together, these data demonstrated that the adenosine transporter was not involved in the resistance to pentamidine in the <italic>Tb</italic>R25 cell line.</p>

<p>We next searched for mutations in the genomic locus encoding the closely related AQP2 and AQP3 aquaglyceroporins. Interestingly, genomic PCR analysis of the <italic>AQP2</italic>/<italic>AQP3</italic> locus showed the deletion of <italic>AQP2</italic> gene in one allele and an <italic>AQP3/AQP2</italic> chimeric gene in the other allele (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004942.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). In the chimera <italic>AQP3/AQP2</italic> the first 453 nucleotides were from <italic>AQP3</italic> and the remaining 462 nucleotides, from <italic>AQP2</italic>. In contrast, the <italic>AQP3</italic> sequence was intact in both alleles. Rearrangements of the <italic>AQP2/AQP3</italic> locus resulting in the loss of the wild-type <italic>AQP2</italic> gene loss also occur in the field, where this genotype is associated with melarsoprol treatment failure [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This result was in agreement with the previous observation that loss of <italic>AQP2</italic> renders <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> much less sensitive to pentamidine [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our results thus suggest that the mechanism of acquired resistance to pentamidine in <italic>Tb</italic>R25 cell line was due to the deletion of <italic>AQP2</italic> in one allele and the presence of the chimera <italic>AQP3/AQP2</italic> in the other allele (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004942.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Although a number of chimeric rearrangements in the AQP2/AQP3 have been reported [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] this is the first rearrangement where it is the amino terminal end is of AQP3 and the carboxy-terminal sequence is from AQP2 rather than the other way around. Recently, it has been published a model of pentamidine permeation through TbAQP2 [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], proposing that three bulky amino acids, present in the TbAQP3 pore but not in the TbAQP2 pore, help explain the difference in pentamidine permeation between these otherwise closely-related proteins. According to this model, the <italic>Tb</italic>R25 rearrangement introduces at least one bulky amino acid, tryptophan 102 of AQP3, into the pore, restricting the passage of the relatively large pentamidine molecule.</p>
<p>Having established that the resistance mechanism was due to the absence of the wild-type coding sequence of <italic>TbAQP2</italic>, we decided to test whether NbAn33-pentamidine-chNPs were able to circumvent this resistant mechanism by avoiding the classical uptake through transporters. The IC<sub>50</sub> value for pentamidine in the pentamidine-resistant strain <italic>Tb</italic>R25 was 115 ± 5 nM (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). However, NbAn33-pentamidine-chNPs reduced the IC<sub>50</sub> to 9.9 ± 0.7 nM, similar to the IC<sub>50</sub> of the wild type strain to free pentamidine (9.6 ± 0.3 nM). Uncoated pentamidine-chNPs were also able to reduce the IC<sub>50</sub> of <italic>Tb</italic>R25, although only 2.1-fold relative to free pentamidine (P&lt;0.001) (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1004942.g001" ref-type="fig">1A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004942.g005" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we tested whether the new delivery system was able to overcome pentamidine resistance in vivo. As observed for other pentamidine resistant trypanosomes [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the <italic>Tb</italic>R25 cell line was significantly less virulent than the wild type. In order to establish infection the mice were subjected to immunosuppression and inoculated with a parasite load 250-fold higher than required with our standard strain AnTat 1.1. Once infected, the animals were treated with the curative dose for wild type trypanosomes (four daily doses of 2.5 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>) of free pentamidine and its equivalent loaded within the chNPS coated with NbAn33. All mice treated with free pentamidine died after infection, whereas 60% of the mice survived following treatment with NbAn33-pentamidine-chNPs, and the mice that did succumb to the infection lived substantially longer than those treated with free pentamidine (<xref rid="ppat.1004942.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). The difference observed in NbAn33-pentamidine-chNPs effectiveness in <italic>Tb</italic>R25 resistant cell line compared to wild type might be related to the loss of virulence and the fact that mice were immunosuppressed before <italic>Tb</italic>R25 infection with 250 times higher parasite load. The cause of this loss of virulence is not known but is independent of mutations in the <italic>AQP2</italic> genes since such mutations are present in field isolates [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, the virulence attenuation phenotype of <italic>Tb</italic>R25 is likely to be associated to laboratory-selected <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>For the continued treatability of African trypanosomiasis, as for many other infectious diseases, the emergence and spread of drug resistance is the major concern together with the absence of vaccines. Most of trypanocidal drugs do not diffuse freely across parasite cell membrane, but several transporters are responsible for their uptake, thereby making a crucial contribution to their selectivity [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In African trypanosomes, resistance mechanisms have generally been associated with mutations that reduce drug import, through loss of function or changes in substrate selectivity. Notably, there is currently little evidence for the involvement of drug export transporters such as multi-drug resistance-associated carriers in acquired drug resistance, as observed for other protozoa such as <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Leishmania spp</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A recent genomic-scale screening has linked most of the current HAT drugs to specific genes encoding surface proteins involved in their uptake [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], confirming some previous results. Eflornithine resistance was associated with loss of amino acid transporter family member AAT6 [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], suramin was linked to invariant surface glycoprotein ISG75, melarsoprol to adenosine transporter TbAT1/P2 [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], pentamidine to P-type H+-ATPases that maintain the proton-motive force across the plasma membrane, and pentamidine/melarsoprol cross-resistance to aquaglyceroporins, specifically to aquaglyceroporin 2, which encodes the High Affinity Pentamidine Transporter (HAPT1) and controls the susceptibility to both drugs [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
<p>The use of chitosan nanoparticles-based therapy allows drug release to be tailored to the specific target site through the choice of various polymer and copolymer combinations and formulation procedures [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. When the nanocarrier was designed, all possible parameters that could influence the grade of success of our nanodevice were taken into account. One of the most important was the pathway that the nanocarrier has to follow to deliver the drug. As shown in <xref rid="ppat.1004942.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, once the nanoparticles reach the surface of the parasite they are taken up by endocytosis in the flagellar pocket. Along the endocytic pathway the pH is decreasing, reaching the lowest value (~pH 5) in the lysosome. Previous reports comparing different polymeric NPs have concluded that drug release from chitosan NPs is pH dependent [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], making chitosan a suitable polymer for this specific nanocarrier.</p>
<p>Pentamidine-loaded poly (D,L-lactide) and polymethacrylate nanoparticles have been previously used against <italic>Leishmania</italic> (<italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum and L</italic>. <italic>major</italic>) [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Pentamidine-loaded nanoparticles were between 3.3 and 6 times more effective than free pentamidine against <italic>Leishmania</italic> in a murine model vivo. By contrast, NbAn33-pentamidine-chNPs were 100 times more effective than free pentamidine against <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> in vivo. However, these results are not directly comparable because <italic>Leishmania</italic> is an intracellular parasite while <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> is extracellular. Another crucial difference is the use of the nanobody NbAn33 for active targeting which notably increases the effectiveness of the formulation as shown in this study.</p>
<p>In summary, the development of chitosan nanoparticles loaded with current trypanocidal drugs coated by a specific nanobody against trypanosomes can reduce the minimal curative dose of these drugs, enhancing their efficacy, minimizing the toxicity and circumventing resistance mechanisms associated to mutation in surface transporters. The significance of the report is not limited to a single nanobody used to demonstrate the technology, nor to a single drug, nor indeed to trypanosomiasis. Due to its versatility, the possibilities that offer this targeted nanobody-system are enormous as it can be adapted to encapsulate any substance with a reported biological action. This opens up a plethora of new possible therapies to treat different infectious diseases. The most urgent issue in the treatment of infectious disease today is that resistance to drugs is spreading much faster than new drugs are being developed and approved. The use of encapsulated, nanobody-targeted drugs as described here has the potential to reverse resistance to many first-line treatments.</p>

<p>The interaction of control (pentamidine unloaded) PEGylated chitosan nanoparticles, NbAn33-chNPs, pentamidine-chNPs, and NbAn33-pentamidine-chNPs, with blood components was investigated in triplicate following a well-defined procedure [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The in vitro effect of the nanoparticulate formulations on erythrocyte lysis was evaluated using PBS as negative control (0% lysis) and the non-ionic surfactant Triton X-100 (1%, w/v) as positive control (100% lysis) of hemolysis. Briefly, EDTA-anticoagulated blood was centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 20 min to remove the plasma fraction. The original volume was then replaced with 150 mM NaCl. Upon repetition of this step, the final suspension was diluted 1:10 with 100 mM PBS. About 100 red blood cells·mL<sup>-1</sup> were incubated at 37°C for 2 h with the nanoparticles (0.05%, w/v) under mechanical stirring (200 rpm), and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 20 min. Hemoglobin release was evaluated by measuring the UV absorbance of the supernatant at 545 nm. Hemolysis (%) was determined as ([absorbance of test sample—absorbance of control] / highest absorbance of positive control) × 100.</p>
<p>Interaction of platelets with nanoparticulate systems may determine their activation (and aggregation) which generates thrombotic complications and blood incompatibilities. This process is quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in terms of soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin) release after incubating the nanoparticles with blood. Blood samples were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 20 min to remove platelet-rich supernatant. Then, blood was again centrifuged and mixed with previously extracted plasma to obtain platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was obtained by centrifuging the remaining blood at 3,000 rpm for10 min. The PRP was then diluted 1:100 with 1% ammonium oxalate, and adjusted to a final platelet concentration of 1·10<sup>8</sup> mL<sup>-1</sup>. A sample of 0.1 mL of PRP was incubated for 1 h with 50 mg of nanoparticles at 37°C. The supernatant was then centrifuged 10 min at 5,000 rpm. Soluble P-selectin concentration in the plasma was determined using ELISA kit (eBioscence,) following to the manufacturer’s indications.</p>
<p>Opsonization of nanoparticles with complement components (i.e., C3a and C5a) leads to blood clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Complement activation was quantified by measuring C3a release upon incubation of the nanoparticles with pooled citrated plasma obtained by blood centrifugation. C3 cleavage was monitored by measuring the formation of its activated peptide (C3a desArg) with Complement C3a des Arg Human ELISA kit (Enzo).</p>
<p>Plasma clotting time was determined following the Howell’s method that evaluates plasma recalcification time (PRT). T<sub>1/2</sub> max was quantified as the time at which half the saturate (maximum) absorbance value was reached. PBS was used as negative control. Each blood sample was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm, 25 min at 8°C to obtain the PPP. Samples of 0.1 mL of PPP were incubated with 50 μg of nanoparticles in PBS for 5 min at 37°C in a 96 well plate. Finally, 0.1 mL of 25 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution was added and the plasma solution was monitored for clotting by manually dipping a silicone-coated stainless-steel wire hook into the solution to detect fibrin threads. Clotting times were estimated as the time at which the first fibrin strand was formed on the hook.</p>

<title>Trypanotoxicity assay</title>
<p>Trypanotoxicity was determined using an adapted version of the resazurin sodium salt method [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Briefly, exponentially growing parasites (monomorphic <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> AnTat 1.1 and pentamidine resistant clonal cell line <italic>Tb</italic>R25) were harvested and prepared at an initial density of 2·10<sup>5</sup> trypanosomes·mL<sup>-1</sup>. 50 μL of this trypanosome suspension was added to each well of a flat-bottom 96-well plate containing doubling dilutions of the drugs (50 μL), excepting for two rows which received only media. Eleven dilution points were tested, ranging from 680 nM to 165 pM in final pentamidine concentration. In the case of diminazene aceturate the range was between 2 μM and 2 nM. Cultured plates were incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 20 h before the addition of 20 μL of the colorimetric viability indicator resazurin sodium salt (Sigma) at 0.5 mM. After a further 4 h of incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μL of 3% SDS in water. The plates were read on a Tecan Infinite F200 reader (Tecan Austria GmbH) using an excitation wavelength of 535 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. The experiment was performed with six replicates per concentration and repeated on at least four independent occasions. The results of fluorescence were normalized to 100% of the no-drug control. The IC<sub>50</sub> was defined as the concentration of drug required to reduce the fluorescence output by 50% and its value was determined by plotting to an equation for a sigmoid curve with a variable slope, of log (test compound concentration) versus the normalized fluorescence, using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software). Statistical significance was determined by unpaired student’s t-test.</p>
<p>For temperature dependent trypanotoxicity assays parasites growing in logarithmic phase (5×10<sup>5</sup> cell·mL<sup>-1</sup>) were treated with NbAn33-pentamidine-chNPs (30 μM of final pentamidine) at 37°C and 4°C respectively. Samples (5×10<sup>5</sup> cells) taken at three different set time points were incubated on ice for at least 5 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with propidium iodide (PI) staining solution (PBS containing 40 μg·mL<sup>-1</sup> PI and 100 μg·mL<sup>-1</sup> ribonuclease A) for at least 20 min on ice. The experiment was performed in parallel with untreated parasites as a control. The analysis was performed with a BD FACScanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software. The experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times.</p>

<title>In vivo therapy experiments</title>
<p>Animal experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Spanish Council of Scientific Research (CSIC). The drug delivery system NbAn33-pentamidine-chNPs was tested in vivo against the monomorphic AnTat1.1 strain using a modification of the approach previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Briefly, five female C57BL/6J mice (8-week-old; Jackson Laboratories) per group were intraperitoneally infected with 10<sup>4</sup> parasites each. Once parasites were detected in the blood, at day 3 after infection, the mice were treated daily on four consecutive days with i.p. injections of pentamidine in physiological saline solution. The dosages used for each group were pentamidine 2.5 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>; pentamidine 0.25 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>; pentamidine 0.025 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>; NbAn33-pentamidine-chNPs 0.25 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>; NbAn33-pentamidine-chNPs 0.025 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>; pentamidine-chNPs 0.25 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup> and pentamidine-chNPs 0.025 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup> (drug concentrations mg·kg<sup>-1</sup> were calculated considering the molecular weight of the isethionate salt). Two control mice groups were either left untreated (injected with the same volume of physiological saline solution) or received pentamidine-free NbAn33-chNPs. We followed the parasitemia by counting the number of trypanosomes in tail-vein blood with an optical microscope with a Neubauer chamber every day during the first week, and afterwards, once per week until 60 days post-infection. Parasite survival was monitored and recorded every day until 60 days post-infection. Mice were considered cured when there was no parasitemia relapse detected in the 60 days period. Animals were humanely sacrificed when they showed severe clinical signs or when the parasitemia reached 10<sup>8</sup> parasites·mL<sup>-1</sup>.</p>

<title>Circulation kinetics of nanoparticles</title>
<p>Fluorescent NbAn33-chNPs were generated as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1004942.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] with some modifications. Briefly, 0.5 mL of NbAn33-chNPs (1 mg·mL<sup>-1</sup>) were fluorescently labeled with 0.18 mM (0.2 mg) of Dy649-NHS (NbAn33-chNPs-Dy649) (Dyomics GmbH) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at RT for 45 min. Labeled NP were washed three times by centrifugation at 14,000 g for 30 min and resuspended in PBS at a final concentration of 1 mg·mL<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
<p>Mice were administered with 0.1 mg of NbAn33-chNPs-Dy649 (1 mg·mL<sup>-1</sup>) intravenously and intraperitoneally. At various time points (15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, 4 h, 24 h and 48 h), 5 μL of blood was collected from the tail and immediately diluted in 200 μL Hanks’ Balanced Salt solution (pH 7.4). The fluorescence of blood samples was measured in a plate reader (excitation 655 nm, emission 676 nm) and correlated with a standard curve of NbAn33-chNPs-Dy649 in whole blood.</p>

<p><italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> AnTat 1.1 bloodstream forms (5×10<sup>4</sup> cells·mL<sup>-1</sup>) were growth in a 24-well plate in the presence of increasing concentrations of pentamidine, ranging from 1 nM to 10 nM. The highest concentration of pentamidine at which growth was detected was 1 nM. Parasites growing at this concentration were diluted to 5×10<sup>4</sup> cells·mL<sup>-1</sup> and sub-cultured into two new wells with fresh medium containing one and half and double the drug concentration, respectively. When cells were growing at 50 nM at a rate comparable to the original (wild type) strain they were diluted to an average density of 0.3 cells·mL<sup>-1</sup> and cultured in a 24 wells plate. Ten clones grew and five were selected for further DNA and RNA content analysis.</p>
