<abstract>
<p>The opportunistic intracellular pathogen <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> is the causative agent of Legionnaires’ disease. <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> delivers nearly 300 effector proteins into host cells for the establishment of a replication-permissive compartment known as the <italic>Legionella</italic>-containing vacuole (LCV). SidC and its paralog SdcA are two effectors that have been shown to anchor on the LCV via binding to phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate [PI(4)P] to facilitate the recruitment of ER proteins to the LCV. We recently reported that the N-terminal SNL (<underline>S</underline>idC <underline>N</underline>-terminal E3 <underline>L</underline>igase) domain of SidC is a ubiquitin E3 ligase, and its activity is required for the recruitment of ER proteins to the LCV. Here we report the crystal structure of SidC (1-871). The structure reveals that SidC contains four domains that are packed into an arch-like shape. The P4C domain (<underline>P</underline>I(<underline>4</underline>)P binding of Sid<underline>C</underline>) comprises a four α-helix bundle and covers the ubiquitin ligase catalytic site of the SNL domain. Strikingly, a pocket with characteristic positive electrostatic potentials is formed at one end of this bundle. Liposome binding assays of the P4C domain further identified the determinants of phosphoinositide recognition and membrane interaction. Interestingly, we also found that binding with PI(4)P stimulates the E3 ligase activity, presumably due to a conformational switch induced by PI(4)P from a closed form to an open active form. Mutations of key residues involved in PI(4)P binding significantly reduced the association of SidC with the LCV and abolished its activity in the recruitment of ER proteins and ubiquitin signals, highlighting that PI(4)P-mediated targeting of SidC is critical to its function in the remodeling of the bacterial phagosome membrane. Finally, a GFP-fusion with the P4C domain was demonstrated to be specifically localized to PI(4)P-enriched compartments in mammalian cells. This domain shows the potential to be developed into a sensitive and accurate PI(4)P probe in living cells.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Legionnaires’ disease is caused by the intracellular bacterial pathogen <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>. Successful infection by this bacterium requires a special secretion system that injects nearly 300 effector proteins into the cytoplasm of host cells. The effector SidC and its paralog SdcA anchor on the <italic>Legionella</italic>-containing vacuole (LCV) and are important for the recruitment of ER proteins to the LCV. Recent data demonstrated that SidC and SdcA are ubiquitin E3 ligases and that their activity is required for the enrichment of ER proteins and ubiquitin conjugates on the LCV. Here we present the crystal structure of SidC revealing the architecture of a novel PI(4)P-binding module. Our biochemical and cell biological studies highlight key determinants involved in PI(4)P-binding and membrane insertion. Characterization of this novel PI(4)P binding module opens a potential avenue for the development of an accurate in vivo PI(4)P probe. Our data also reveals a distinct regulatory mechanism of the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of SidC, which is activated by the lipid molecule, PI(4)P. Furthermore, our results suggest that proper spatial localization of SidC to the cytoplasmic surface of the bacterial phagosome through the binding with PI(4)P is crucial to its function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The gram-negative bacterium <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> is ubiquitously found in natural water systems, where it is a parasite of free-living amoebae [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Upon inhalation of contaminated aerosols by susceptible individuals, this bacterium replicates within human macrophages and causes a severe pneumonia called Legionnaires’ disease [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. During its interaction with host cells, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> delivers approximately 300 effector proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] into the host via its Dot/Icm (<underline>d</underline>efective <underline>o</underline>rganelle <underline>t</underline>rafficking/ <underline>i</underline>ntra<underline>c</underline>ellular <underline>m</underline>ultiplication) type IV secretion system [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Through the collective action of this large array of virulent proteins, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> co-opts various host processes to facilitate bacterial survival and replication within the host. Among the many host cellular pathways, host membrane trafficking is one of the most studied processes manipulated by <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Upon internalization, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> forms a specialized membrane-bound compartment called the <italic>Legionella</italic>-containing vacuole (LCV). Previous data have shown that LCVs undergo a delicately programmed maturation process to evade fusion with lysosomes. The LCV is first covered by ER-derived vesicles at the early stage of its formation [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and is later enriched with resident ER proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and then studded with ribosomes [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This biphasic maturation process converts the plasma membrane-derived LCV into an ER-like compartment and thus allows for the establishment of a replication-permissive niche within host cells [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The recruitment of ER and ER-derived vesicles requires sophisticated interactions between <italic>Legionella</italic> effectors and host factors. For example, Rab1, a small GTPase in the Rab family involved in vesicle trafficking between the ER and Golgi [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] has been shown to be recruited to the LCV by SidM (DrrA) [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Following Rab1 recruitment, a cascade of <italic>Legionella</italic> effectors, including SidM [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], AnkX [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], SidD [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], Lem3 [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and LepB [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], regulate the spatial and temporal dynamics of Rab1 through canonical GEF and GAP activities, as well as protein posttranslational modifications [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Lipid molecules, particularly phosphoinositides (PIs) play crucial roles during the transition of LCVs into ER-like compartments [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. PIs are a collection of lipids that have their inositol headgroup reversibly phosphorylated at the 3’, 4’, and 5’ positions. Although PIs are minor components of cellular membranes, they play fundamental roles in a broad range of cell signaling and membrane trafficking events [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. One of the PI species, phosphotidylinositiol 4-phosphate (or PI(4)P) has been shown to accumulate on the LCV [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The enrichment of PI(4)P on the LCV is facilitated by both <italic>Legionella</italic> effectors and host PI metabolizing enzymes. SidF, the first <italic>Legionella</italic> protein shown to directly modify host PIs [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], anchors on the LCV and specifically hydrolyzes PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> to PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Another <italic>Legionella</italic> encoded PI phosphatase, SidP, likely prevents the accumulation of PI(3)P on the LCV by hydrolyzing this lipid into phosphoinositol [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The <italic>Legionella</italic> effector protein LpnE appears to recruit the host PI-5-phosphatase OCRL to the LCV, which converts PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to PI(4)P [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Meanwhile, host phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (PI4Ks) also play a role in the establishment of PI(4)P-enriched vacuoles [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Lipid remodeling on the LCV is critical for the selective anchoring of effectors to its surface. The specific recruitment of the Rab1 modulator SidM to the LCV is mediated by a C-terminal unique PI(4)P-binding P4M domain [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The recruitment of other LCV-localizing effectors, such as LidA [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and LpnE [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] is likely also mediated by binding to PI(4)P.</p>
<p>Among the currently identified PI(4)P-binding <italic>Legionella</italic> effectors, the protein SidC and its paralog SdcA were shown to anchor on the LCV through a 20 kDa PI(4)P-binding domain called P4C (PI(4)P binding of SidC) to facilitate the recruitment of ER proteins to the LCV [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Deletion of <italic>sidC</italic> and <italic>sdcA</italic> resulted in a delay in the establishment of the replicative vacuole and a delayed appearance of ubiquitin signals on the LCV [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Recent structural studies of SidC revealed a novel N-terminal SNL domain that represents a unique family of ubiquitin E3 ligases [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Interestingly, ubiquitin ligase activity is required for the efficient recruitment of ER vesicles and ubiquitinated protein species to the LCV [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. With the deciphering of the biochemical mechanisms of SidC, an intriguing question emerged as to how the P4C domain of SidC targets and likely regulates the E3 ligase activity of the SNL domain.</p>
<p>Here we report the crystal structure of SidC (aa 1–871) containing the SNL, the P4C. and a C-terminal undefined domain. Although the structure of the SNL domain is similar to the structure of the isolated SNL domain reported previously [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], significant conformational changes were observed. These include a hinge motion between the SNL and the insertion domains, as well as a rearrangement of residues near the catalytic triad of the ubiquitin ligase. We also show the structure of the P4C domain. Unlike any other known PI(4)P-binding domain, the P4C domain of SidC comprise a four α-helix bundle and the PI(4)P binding site resides in a highly positively charged pocket formed at one end of the bundle. Further analyses of the P4C domain both in vitro and in vivo shed light on the molecular mechanism of PI(4)P binding and LCV anchoring of SidC. Our data further provide a mechanistic background for the potential usage of the P4C domain as an accurate PI(4)P probe in general cell biology studies.</p>

<title>Overall crystal structure of SidC</title>
<p>Full-length SidC from the Philadelphia 1 strain of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> is a 106 kDa protein comprised of 917 residues [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. we carried out structural studies of SidC.to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of its biological functions, The N-terminal conserved SNL domain was crystallized and our structure-driven approach successfully showed that the SNL domain is a novel E3 ligase [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We extended our structural studies to full-length SidC. Although thin plate-shaped crystals were obtained, these crystals were poorly diffracted by X-ray beams. Crystals were also obtained with a truncated form of SidC (aa 1–871, from here on referred to as SidC871) in which 46 residues were deleted from the C-terminus. These crystals diffracted up to 2.9 Å and the structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using our previously determined SidC (aa 1–542, SidC542) crystal structure as the search model. Residues of the C-terminal portion of SidC871 were built de novo to the model interspersed with iterative refinement. The final refined model contains two molecules of SidC in the asymmetric unit and each molecule contains all residues from 8 to 864. The structure was refined to a resolution of 2.9 Å with R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub> = 22.7/28.1 and no significant stereochemistry violations (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004965.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>The crystal structure of SidC871 reveals that SidC comprises four distinct domains: the N-terminal SNL domain, the INS domain (which is inserted within the SNL domain), the P4C domain, and a C-terminal unknown domain named CTD (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A–1E</xref>). These four domains are packed in a single arch-like shape with the P4C and the CTD domains in close contact with the SNL domain (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B–1E</xref>). Strikingly, the ubiquitin E3 ligase catalytic site (colored in red in <xref rid="ppat.1004965.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C and 1E</xref>) on the SNL domain is covered by the P4C domain. This observation suggests that the P4C domain is required to move away from the SNL domain in order to access the active site of the ubiquitin ligase. A plausible hypothesis is that the binding of PI(4)P by the P4C may cause the P4C domain to shift away from the catalytic site allowing the exposure of the ubiquitin ligase catalytic site. Testing of this hypothesis will be tested below.</p>

<title>Conformational dynamics of the SNL and INS domains</title>
<p>Structural comparison of the SNL and INS domains in SidC871 with the previously determined SidC542 structure, which contains only the SNL and INS domains [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] revealed three regions with major conformational changes (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). The first area is the loop (residues 42–49) that contains the catalytic cysteine C46 (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). In the SidC542 structure, C46 forms a catalytic triad with its nearby D446 and H444. However, C46 in SidC871 is shifted away from H444 by about 6 Å (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1004965.g002" ref-type="fig">2B</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004965.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). This conformational switch involves large Psi-Phi angle changes of L42, T45, and C46 by the flipping of main chain peptide bonds (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). The second region is a non-conserved loop (residue 59–66) on the interface between the SNL domain and the P4C domain (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). The conformational change of this loop makes room for the P4C domain to pack against the SNL domain. However, the biological role of the structural flexibility of this loop is not clear.</p>

<p>The third major conformational change occurs at the two flexible linkers between the SNL and INS domains. The SNL domain is rotated along a hinge (residue S224 and S328) by about 30<sup>0</sup> in SidC871 compared to the orientation in SidC542 (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). This hinge bending motion is reminiscent of a similar displacement between the N- and the C-lobes of the HECT family ubiquitin ligases [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These observations imply that the INS domain may interact with E2s in the ubiquitin conjugating reaction. To test this hypothesis, we used size exclusion chromatography to analyze the interaction between E2 and SidC. The catalytically inactive C85S mutant UbcH7 was stably charged with ubiquitin (UbcH7~Ub) and incubated with SidC542. The protein mixture was then separated by size exclusion chromatography and elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. UbcH7~Ub, but not UbcH7 alone was able to form a stable complex with SidC542 as indicated by the co-fractionation of SidC542 with UbcH7~Ub, but not with UbcH7. In contrast, although the SidC542 ΔINS mutant behaved well as a mono-dispersed protein [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], it failed to interact with Ub-UbcH7 (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). These data suggest that the INS domain mediates the binding with E2s. Furthermore, like the E2~Ub-HECT E3 ternary complex [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], the covalently linked ubiquitin likely interacts with an area near the E3 catalytic site, thus stabilizing the E2~Ub-SidC ternary complex. Consistent with these results, the SidC542 ΔINS mutant, which failed to bind E2, is completely inactive in ubiquitination assays (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>A novel highly specific PI(4)P-binding domain</title>

Our crystal structure of SidC871 revealed the architecture of this unique domain. The P4C domain (aa. 614–743) mainly comprises four α-helices running in an antiparallel way. These four α-helices form a bundle with one end sealed by a C-terminal short β hairpin. A pocket is created at the other end by two loops (L1 and L2) connecting α1, α2 and α3, α4, respectively (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>).The calculated electrostatic surface potentials revealed that this pocket is highly positively charged (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>) and it is the only area clustered with positive charges in the domain (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>).

<p>To test the specificity of PI binding, we performed liposome floatation assays [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Liposomes were prepared with 80% phosphatidylcholine (PC), 10% Phosphatidylserine (PS) and 10% either PI(4)P or other phospholipids. After incubation with purified GFP-tagged P4C proteins for 30 min, a sucrose gradient centrifugation was performed to separate liposomes from unbound proteins. The floated liposomes were pooled and normalized, and bound proteins were analyzed by Western blot followed by densitometry quantification. A large number of GFP-P4C proteins were recovered in the liposome samples containing PI(4)P. However, almost no GFP-P4C co-floated with liposomes in the absence of PI(4)P or with liposomes containing either PI(3)P, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, or phosphatidic acid (PA) (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). The specific interaction with PI(4)P by the P4C domain can also be directly visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were prepared with lipid compositions similar to those used in the liposome floatation assays. In addition, a Dil dye (Invitrogen) was incorporated into the LUV for fluorescence detection. After a 30 min incubation of GFP-P4C with the liposomes, the samples were imaged under a fluorescence microscope. In agreement with the results from the liposome floatation assay, strong GFP signals were observed on the surface of the liposomes containing PI(4)P, whereas there was almost no detectable GFP signal for the liposomes without PI(4)P (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F and 3G</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that the P4C domain of SidC binds to PI(4)P with a high selectivity.</p>

<title>Determinants of PI(4)P recognition and membrane targeting by the P4C domain</title>
<p>Membrane association by PI-binding proteins is generally governed by the stereospecific recognition of a distinct PI headgroup and the nonspecific insertion of hydrophobic residues into the membrane bilayer [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The structure of the P4C domain highlights these key features for its association with PI(4)P-containing membranes. First, there are two conserved arginine residues (R638 and R652) located in the positively charged pocket of the P4C domain (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1004965.g004" ref-type="fig">4A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004965.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). These two arginine residues contribute to the overall positive charge of the pocket and may be directly involved in PI(4)P binding by making hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with the headgroup of PI(4)P. To test this hypothesis, we constructed mutants in which each of the two arginine residues was replaced with a glutamine. The R638Q mutation significantly reduced the binding to PI(4)P-containing liposomes to ~30% of that of the wild type P4C, while the R652Q mutation nearly completely abolished the PI(4)P binding by the P4C domain (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). The second feature is the hydrophobic nature of the two loops L1 and L2 that surround the PI(4)P binding pocket (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). L1 contains three consecutive hydrophobic residues, W642, W643, and F644 while L2 contains two, W704 and F705. Although these residues are variable, their hydrophobic nature is conserved (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). These hydrophobic residues likely function as a “membrane insertion motif” (MIM). Mutation of these hydrophobic residues to the polar residue serine either in L1 (W642S/W643S/F644S) or in L2 (W704S/F705S) significantly reduced the binding to PI(4)P-containing liposomes, whereas the binding was completely abolished when all five hydrophobic residues were mutated (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). In agreement with the floatation assays, the effects of P4C mutations on liposome binding were further confirmed by direct fluorescence imaging (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>). These data demonstrate that the high affinity PI(4)P binding by the P4C domain of SidC requires both cationic residues, which mediate the recognition of the headgroup of PI(4)P, and the MIM, which enhances membrane association by direct insertion of hydrophobic side chains into the membrane bilayer.</p>

<title>Intracellular localization of the P4C domain in living cells</title>
<p>We further examined the specific PI(4)P binding by the P4C domain in living cells. Wild type and mutant P4C domains tagged with EGFP were expressed in N2A cells by transient transfection (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Wild type GFP-P4C displayed enrichment at both the plasma membrane (PM) and the perinuclear region, presumably the Golgi complex, which are the two major PI(4)P-rich compartments in the cell [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Consistent with the in vitro liposomal binding results, the R652Q mutant showed a cytosolic and nuclear localization, suggesting PI(4)P binding is severely hampered by this mutation. The R638Q, which showed a reduced affinity for PI(4)P in vitro, displayed a similar localization compared to the wild type but with a higher cytosolic distribution. Individual MIM mutations, L1 and L2, also displayed a high level of cytosolic localization, indicating a reduced affinity for the membrane. Strikingly, the L1 and L2 double mutation completely abolished the membrane localization of P4C, rendering the mutant a completely cytosolic protein (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). Similar intracellular localization of wild type and mutant GFP-P4C domains was also observed in other cell lines, such as Cos7 (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>).

<p>To explore the possibility of developing a new PI(4)P probe, we compared the PI(4)P binding and intracellular localization of the P4C domain with other reported PI(4)P probes.

The binding of PI(4)P was analyzed with liposome floatation assays (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). In the floatation experiments, a higher percentage of GFP-P4C co-floated with PI(4)P-containing liposomes than any of the other PI(4)P probes tested (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1004965.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B Fig</xref>).

<p>We then compared the intracellular localization of these PI(4)P probes in living cells. Constructs expressing GFP-tagged probes were co-transfected with either the PM marker, mCherry-PLCδ-PH [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] or the Golgi marker, DsRed-GalT [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] in N2A cells. The GFP-P4C probe displayed a significant co-localization with both the PM marker and the Golgi marker (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C–5E</xref>), indicating that the P4C domain is able to faithfully report the two major pools of PI(4)P in living cells. Although all three of the other probes also co-localized with GalT at the Golgi apparatus, their PM signals were weaker compared to those of P4C. In summary, our data suggest that the P4C probe from SidC has the potential to be developed as a more sensitive and unbiased biosensor for detecting PI(4)P in living cells.</p>

<title>The interface between the P4C and SNL domain</title>
<p>Our crystal structure revealed that the P4C packs against the SNL domain and blocks the accessibility of the E3 catalytic site (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The interaction between the P4C and SNL domains is mainly mediated by extensive hydrophobic interactions between residues L629 and I633 of the P4C domain and a hydrophobic patch consisting of residues V50, I53, A60, I140, and P141 near the ligase catalytic site on the SNL domain (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). To characterize the nature of this intramolecular interaction, we created the L629R mutant with the speculation that the bulky and charged arginine residue would destroy both surface complementarity and the hydrophobic nature at the interface. Thus, this mutation would displace the P4C domain and keep SidC in an open conformation. Indeed, SidC743 C46A/L629R, but not SidC743 C46A, formed a stable complex with UbcH7~Ub as shown by size exclusion chromatography analysis (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>). The formation of the ternary complex is likely due to the open conformation caused by this mutation, which allows for the binding of the ubiquitin moiety to the catalytic site. These data suggest that the intramolecular interaction between the P4C and the SNL domain is not due to crystal packing. Instead, it likely represents an intramolecular regulatory mechanism in which the displacement of the P4C domain from the catalytic site switches the enzyme into an open conformation to release the occlusion at the ligase active site of SidC.</p>

<title>Binding of PI(4)P by the P4C domain stimulates the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of SidC</title>
<p>The intramolecular interaction between the P4C domain and the SNL domain led us to hypothesize that the P4C domain plays a role in regulating the E3 ligase activity. To test this model, we performed ubiquitin ligase activity assays and quantified the reaction by measuring the rate of ubiquitin consumption. SidC542, which lacks the C-terminal P4C domain, showed a similar ubiquitin ligase activity in the absence of liposomes or in the presence of liposomes containing PC/PS or PC/PS/PI(4)P (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). However, SidC743, which contains the P4C domain, exhibited enhanced ligase activity in the presence of PI(4)P-containing liposomes (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>). These data suggest that the binding of PI(4)P may induce a conformational switch of the enzyme to an open form that exposes the catalytic site and stimulates the ligase activity. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that SidC743 L629R, which prefers an open conformation as shown above (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>), is more active even in the absence of PI(4)P-containing liposomes compared to SidC743 (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C–7F</xref>). However, the stimulating effect caused by PI(4)P is abolished in both SidC743 R652Q and SidC743 L1/L2 mutants, which are defective in PI(4)P binding (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7G–7J</xref>). In conclusion, PI(4)P-binding stimulates the ubiquitin ligase activity of SidC presumably through an induced conformational switch from a closed to an open form of the enzyme.</p>

<title>PI(4)P binding by the P4C domain is essential for the recruitment of ubiquitin and ER proteins to the LCV</title>
<p>Shortly after <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic> infection, polyubiquitin conjugates are recruited to the bacterial phagosome [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We have recently shown that the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of SidC, which is mediated by its N-terminal SNL domain, is required for this recruitment [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Here we ask whether the recruitment of ubiquitinated species to the LCV is dependent on the P4C domain-mediated anchoring of SidC to the LCV. U937 macrophages were infected with <italic>Legionella</italic> strains expressing either wild type or SidC mutants. Ubiquitin signals were detected by immunostaining with the FK1 antibody. This recruitment was almost abolished in infections with the Δ<italic>sidC-sdcA</italic> mutant strain, and wild type SidC completely restored the recruitment. However, none of the mutants defective in PI(4)P binding retained this function (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>). Thus, the association of SidC with the LCV via the P4C domain is necessary for the recruitment of ubiquitinated species.</p>
<p>SidC and its paralog SdcA are also important for efficient recruitment of ER proteins to the bacterial phagosome [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Using a <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> strain stably expressing GFP-HDEL [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] (a GFP fusion with the ER retention marker HDEL), we have shown that the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of SidC plays a critical f role in the recruitment of ER components to the bacterial phagosome [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. To address whether the recruitment of ER components is also dependent on the P4C domain-mediated anchoring of SidC to the LCV, <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> cells stably expressing GFP-HDEL were infected with relevant <italic>Legionella</italic> strains. In <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> infected with wild type <italic>L</italic>. <italic>pneumophila</italic>, about 40% of the LCVs were positive for GFP-HDEL two hours after infection (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10A and S10B Fig</xref>). In contrast, nearly no GFP-HDEL signals were detected on LCVs in infections with a Dot/Icm deficient strain or the <italic>ΔsidC-sdcA</italic> mutant. While this defect was restored by a plasmid expressing SidC, all the PI(4)P-binding mutants failed to complement the phenotype (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that P4C-mediated anchoring of SidC to the LCV is critical for the recruitment of ER components to bacterial phagosomes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we report the structure of the nearly full-length SidC (SidC871), which includes the C-terminal P4C domain. Our structure reveals a novel PI(4)P-binding domain with a four-alpha-helix-bundle fold. The PI(4)P binding site resides at a cationic pocket at one end of the bundle. The P4C domain is packed against the SNL domain and covers the ubiquitin E3 ligase active site (colored in red in <xref rid="ppat.1004965.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). This conformation may represent an inactive closed form of the enzyme. We also show that the L629R mutant switches the enzyme from the closed form to an open conformation and activates the enzyme. We demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase activity is regulated by PI(4)P. These observations lead us to propose a model for SidC activation on the LCV surface (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>). In this model, SidC/SdcA is translocated into the host in an inactive conformation. The presence of PI(4)P on the LCV allows for high affinity binding via the P4C domain, thus anchoring SidC to the LCV. The binding of PI(4)P triggers a conformational change that extends the P4C domain, which is connected to the SNL domain through a long linker peptide, away from the SNL domain. The separation of the P4C domain from the SNL domain causes the exposure of the ubiquitin ligase active site. This model further implies a mechanism for the tight control of the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of SidC. It is likely that SidC is active only when it is properly anchored to the surface of the LCV, which allows specific ubiquitination of proteins in the vicinity of SidC. However, the nature of substrates specifically ubiquitinated by SidC/SdcA remains as an interesting question. Since SidC/SdcA is involved in the recruitment of ER-derived vesicles to the LCV, factors that regulate host ER-related membrane trafficking are likely candidates for ubiquitination by SidC/SdcA. The identification of SidC/SdcA substrates will not only aid in understanding the functional role of bacterial virulent effectors, but will also open potential new avenues for the study of host membrane trafficking.</p>

<title>A schematic model of SidC functions at the LCV surface.</title>
<p>SidC/SdcA is translocated into the cytosol through the Dot/Icm apparatus. SidC anchors to the LCV membrane through the binding to PI(4)P by its P4C domain. The binding of PI(4)P allows the P4C domain to move away from the SNL domain and exposes the ubiquitin ligase active site. The activated SidC/SdcA ubiquitinates unknown factors, presumably proteins residing on the LCV that determine the identity of the bacterial phagosome.</p>

</fig>
<p>Compared to the previously reported N-terminal structure of SidC [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], our new structure also shows a hinge motion between the INS domain and the SNL domain. This hinge motion is reminiscent of a similar flexible motion between the N- and C-lobes of the HECT family of ubiquitin ligases [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We hypothesized that the INS domain may directly mediate the binding of E2. Indeed, in our size exclusion chromatography analysis, stable ubiquitin-charged UbcH7 co-fractionated with the wild type N-terminal segment of SidC (1–542), but not with its INS domain-deleted counterpart. These results suggest that the INS domain mediates the interaction of SidC with E2s. This argument also explains our previous observations that SidC and SdcA prefer different E2s for their ligase activity [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. SidC and SdcA are highly homologous at the primary sequence level, except in the INS domain region. The sequence variability of the INS domain is suggestive of the discriminative binding of E2s by SidC and SdcA. However, how SidC/SdcA bind to their preferred E2s remains to be investigated. The E3 ligase IpaH from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> has been shown to bind to E2s at a unique site that is not used by mammalian E3s [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Future studies will pursue a structural complex of SidC with ubiquitin-charged UbcH7 to dissect the molecular mechanism for the interaction between SidC/SdcA with E2s.</p>
<p>Our <italic>Legionella</italic> infection experiments show that the binding of PI(4)P via the P4C domain is required for the anchoring of SidC to, and its function on, the LCV. Although the mutants defective for PI(4)P binding still contain an intact ubiquitin E3 ligase domain, they have lost the ability to facilitate the recruitment of ubiquitinated species and ER proteins to the LCV. These results indicate that proper spatial localization of some effectors is crucial for their function during infection. In agreement with this notion, reducing the levels of PI(4)P on the LCV, which likely interferes with proper effector anchoring, has been shown to impair intracellular bacterial replication [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Mutations in either the cationic pocket or the MIM that totally abrogate PI(4)P binding in vitro do not completely abolish the association of SidC with the LCV. Moreover, a mutant lacking all PI(4)P-binding determinants (R652Q/L1/L2) shows no further reduction of LCV association compared to single mutations (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>). This residual binding of SidC to the LCV can be explained by a possible scenario in which SidC interacts with other LCV associated proteins. In fact, it is common to find that the specific membrane targeting of PI binding proteins is governed by a so-called coincidence detection mechanism [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Nevertheless, the residual binding of SidC mutants to the LCV does not appear to play an important role in infection, as it does not restore either the ubiquitin signals or the ER proteins recruited to the bacterial phagosome governed by SidC/SdcA.</p>
<p>PI(4)P has emerged as a direct regulator of several cellular processes, including anterograde trafficking from the Golgi complex [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The use of fluorescent protein tags fused to protein domains that recognize PI(4)P in vivo has allowed the mapping of this lipid to multiple cellular organelles, such as the Golgi apparatus, the endosomal system, and the plasma membrane [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A sensitive and unbiased PI(4)P probe is essential for the studies of PI(4)P dynamics in living cells. However, current PI(4)P probes have their limitations. For example, the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Four-phosphate-adaptor protein 1 (FAPP1) also interacts with ARF1, a Golgi-localized member of the Ras family of small GTPases, thus biasing its localization towards the Golgi complex [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Similarly, this major caveat is also true for the PH domain of Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Besides interacting with ARF1, the PH domains of FAPP1 and OSBP also recognize PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in vitro [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. These drawbacks indicate these PH domain-based PI(4)P sensors are less accurate probes. Recently, a new PI(4)P probe derived from the <italic>Legionella</italic> effector protein SidM (DrrA) was reported [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The C-terminal P4M domain has a unique structure and has been shown to bind PI(4)P with strong affinity and specificity [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The in vivo application of this novel probe revealed pools of PI(4)P at Rab7-positive late endosomes/lysosomes beyond the Golgi [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Here we provide preliminary evidence that the P4C domain of SidC has a high affinity and specificity for PI(4)P binding. Compared with other commonly used PI(4)P probes, the P4C domain appears to have a stronger affinity for PI(4)P-positive liposomes (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, the P4C domain displays high selectivity for PI(4)P (<xref rid="ppat.1004965.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). The GFP-tagged P4C domain exhibits a high preference for both the Golgi complex and the plasma membrane, where PI(4)P is enriched. Although more quantitative analysis is warranted to demonstrate the superiority of this novel PI(4)P probe, our data suggest that the P4C domain of SidC has a promising potential to be developed into anl accurate and sensitive in vivo PI(4)P probe.</p>

Single or multiple amino acid substitutions of SidC were introduced by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotide primer pairs containing the appropriate base substitutions. SidC542∆INS was generated by ligating two PCR fragments corresponding to residues 1–224 and 324–542.

The <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> strain AX4 stably expressing GFP-HDEL for assessing the ER membrane conversion phenotype was grown and maintained as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. <italic>D</italic>. <italic>discoideum</italic> seeded on glass coverslips in MLB medium [<xref rid="ppat.1004965.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] was infected with properly grown bacteria at an MOI of 10.

<title>Analysis of SidC immuno-fluorescence signals</title>
<p>Images were acquired with an upright Nikon Eclipse 90i laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with a Nikon 60x oil Plan Apo vc objective. The 488 and 561 nm laser lines (Sapphire Coherent) were used to acquire images of SidC and <italic>Legionella</italic> bacteria, respectively. Only cells that contained bacterial vacuoles with overlapping SidC signals were chosen for imaging. At least 50 fields for each of three coverslips (at least 150 cells) were imaged for each condition. To analyze the signal intensity, integrated intensities of the SidC signal within each LCV region were collected from each field and were averaged per coverslip. The three mean values from each coverslip were then averaged to generate a mean of means +/- SEM. Due to the presence of unequal variances between the strains being compared, raw integrated intensities for each vacuole were log-transformed (log[x+1]), and then re-averaged. Data was analyzed with GraphPad Prism 5 software, using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post-hoc test to compare all conditions.</p>
