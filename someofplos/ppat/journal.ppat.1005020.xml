<abstract>
<p>Type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) are widespread multi-component machineries that translocate effectors into either eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells, for virulence or for interbacterial competition. Herein, we report that the T6SS-4 from <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> displays an unexpected function in the transportation of Zn<sup>2+</sup> to combat diverse stresses and host immunity. Environmental insults such as oxidative stress induce the expression of T6SS-4 via OxyR, the transcriptional factor that also regulates many oxidative response genes. Zinc transportation is achieved by T6SS-4-mediated translocation of a novel Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein substrate YezP (YPK_3549), which has the capacity to rescue the sensitivity to oxidative stress exhibited by T6SS-4 mutants when added to extracellular milieu. Disruption of the classic zinc transporter ZnuABC together with T6SS-4 or <italic>yezP</italic> results in mutants that almost completely lost virulence against mice, further highlighting the importance of T6SS-4 in resistance to host immunity. These results assigned an unconventional role to T6SSs, which will lay the foundation for studying novel mechanisms of metal ion uptake by bacteria and the role of this process in their resistance to host immunity and survival in harmful environments.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>One unique feature of type VI secretion system is the presence of multiple distinct systems in certain bacterial species. It is well established that some of these systems function to compete for their living niches among diverse bacterial species, whilst the activity of many such transporters remains unknown. Because metal ions are essential components to virtually all forms of life including bacteria, eukaryotic hosts have evolved complicated strategies to sequester metal ions, which constitute a major branch of their nutritional immunity. Therefore the ability to acquire metal ions is critical for bacterial virulence. This study reveals that the T6SS-4 of <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Yptb</italic>) functions to import Zn<sup>2+</sup> from the environment to mitigate the detrimental effects such as hydroxyl radicals induced by diverse stresses. Expression of the transporter is activated by multiple regulatory proteins, including OxyR and OmpR that sense diverse environmental cues. Zinc ion acquisition is achieved by translocating a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding substrate YezP, which is co-regulated with T6SS-4 by OxyR. Our results reveal a novel role for type VI secretion system, which is important in the study of the mechanism of metal ion acquisition by bacteria and the role of this process in bacterial pathogenesis and survival in detrimental environments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Specialized protein secretion systems are essential for many bacteria to survive in interactions with their hosts or within specific environmental niches. Among these, type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a complex macromolecular apparatus found in more than 25% of sequenced Gram-negative bacteria genomes, ranging from pathogens to environmental species [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Structurally related to the contractile phage tail sheath, the T6SS is composed of 13 conserved proteins and a variable array of accessory elements [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The extracellular components of the T6SS, Hcp (hemolysin-coregulated protein) and VgrG (valine glycine repeat) form a needle-like injection device closely resembling the bacteriophage tail, in which VgrG forms a cell-puncturing tip, and Hcp forms a tail-tube structure through which effector proteins are believed to travel [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. ClpV and IcmF, two conserved components with ATPase activity that powers the T6SS, are crucial for the secretion of Hcp, VgrG and its cognate protein substrates [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p>
<p>A striking feature of T6SS is that many genomes harbor multiple gene clusters coding for evolutionarily distinct T6SSs, which presumably play different roles in the lifecycle of the bacteria [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Several T6SSs associated with pathogens are necessary for full virulence towards eukaryotic host cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic>, T6SS is required for virulence in animal infection or for resistance to predation by amoebae hosts such as <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In <italic>Burkholderia mallei</italic>, the cluster 1 T6SS expressed by this organism is essential for bacterial survival in a hamster model of glanders and the <italic>tssE</italic> mutants exhibit growth and actin polymerization defects in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. On the contrary, some T6SSs appear to be antivirulence factors because mutants lacking such systems are more pathogenic [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Deletion of the T6SS in <italic>Helicobacter hepaticus</italic> led to mutants that adhere and enter epithelial cell at high efficiencies than wild-type bacteria [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In these scenarios, effectors, the T6SS apparatus or its components may stimulate the host immune response to suppress the virulence of wild-type bacteria.</p>
<p>The best-characterized function of T6SSs is to compete in bacterial communities by delivering bacteriolytic toxins to target cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For example, a T6SS in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> delivers at least two families of effectors into target bacterial cells, which function as peptidoglycan hydrolases and phospholipase, respectively [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These effectors mediate antagonistic bacterial interactions in either inter- or intraspecies context to gain a survival advantage in specific niches. Similarly, <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> uses T6SS to translocate antibacterial DNases to attack neighboring bacterial cells in plant hosts [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Interestingly, in each case, the toxicity of the effectors toward the bacterial cell itself is inhibited by specific immunity proteins, which directly interact with the effectors [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Roles of T6SSs in biological processes beyond infection and inter-species competition have also been suggested [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but little is known about the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>Whereas the genomes of many bacteria harbor one to two T6SS gene clusters [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the closely related <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Yptb</italic>) and <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> contain four and five such clusters, respectively [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These systems likely confer distinct functions for specific niches in the lifecycle of the bacterium, thus representing excellent models for the study of the potentially versatile function of T6SSs. Here we found that the T6SS-4 of <italic>Yptb</italic> functions to acquire zinc ions (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) into bacterial cells from the environment, which mitigates the hydroxyl radicals induced by oxidative stresses. Our results reveal that diverse environmental insults activate the expression of T6SS-4 via OxyR, the primary regulatory protein for bacterial oxidative stress and that zinc acquisition is achieved by T6SS-4-mediated translocation of a zinc-binding protein into the extracellular milieu. While it is well established that when appropriately deployed, some T6SSs confer the bacterium surviving advantages in niches with multiple bacterial species by delivering bacteriolytic toxins to competing cells, our results uncover a novel function of T6SS in the acquisition of essential nutrients, which enhances bacterial survival under harsh environments and/or during its interactions with hosts.</p>

<title>Expression of T6SS-4 in <italic>Yptb</italic> is activated by OxyR</title>
<p>To determine the function of the T6SS-4 in <italic>Yptb</italic>, we analyzed its promoter region and identified a DNA element highly similar to the recognition site for OxyR, the primary regulatory protein for bacterial oxidative stress (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). We then examined the interaction between OxyR and this putative operator by electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA). Incubation of a probe containing the T6SS-4 promoter with His<sub>6</sub>-OxyR led to the formation of DNA-protein complexes (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The interactions between His<sub>6</sub>-OxyR and the T6SS-4 promoter are specific because excessive unlabeled probe abolished the formation of the protein-DNA complex; similarly, mutations in the predicted OxyR binding site disrupted the formation of such complexes (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). DNase I footprinting analysis revealed that the putative OxyR binding site was protected from digestion in DNA-OxyR complexes, further indicating the recognition of this DNA element by OxyR (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Thus, OxyR specifically recognizes an operator within the T6SS-4 promoter, most likely to influence its activity.</p>

<p>Next we determined the effects of OxyR on the expression of the T6SS-4 by measuring the transcription of chromosomal <italic>P</italic><sub>T6SS-4</sub>::<italic>lacZ</italic> fusions. Deletion of <italic>oxyR</italic> significantly reduced the activity of the promoter, which can be fully restored by a complementation plasmid expressing the regulatory protein (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Consistent with the operon-like organization of the T6SS-4 structural genes, qRT-PCR analyses revealed that the expression of other T6SS-4 components such as <italic>clpV4</italic> (<italic>ypk</italic>_3559), <italic>hcp4</italic> (<italic>ypk</italic>_3563) and <italic>vgrG4</italic> (<italic>ypk</italic>_3558), also required OxyR, in a manner highly similar to <italic>katG</italic> (<italic>ypk</italic>_3388), one of the established target genes of this regulatory protein (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Further analysis at protein level indicated that similar regulation was observed for protein production of <italic>hcp4</italic>, in which deletion of OxyR diminished its cellular level (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). In contrast, the expression of T6SS1-3 in <italic>Yptb</italic> was not detectably affected by the deletion of <italic>oxyR</italic>, pointing to the specificity of the regulation (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). Thus, OxyR specifically activates the expression of T6SS-4, suggesting that its function is relevant to the environmental cues sensed by this regulatory protein.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>T6SS-4 is required for bacterial resistance to oxidative stress</title>
<p>OxyR is a global oxidative stress regulator that controls the expression of genes such as <italic>katG</italic>, <italic>gorA</italic>, <italic>grxA</italic>, <italic>ahpCF</italic> and <italic>oxyS</italic>, all important in protection against oxidative stress [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The activation of T6SS-4 by OxyR prompted us to examine whether this transporter plays a role in protection against oxidative stress. We thus determined the viability of <italic>Yptb</italic> T6SS-4 mutants after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> challenge. As a control, the <italic>ΔkatG</italic> mutant was expectedly sensitive to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, so were the mutants defective in the Cu/Zn or Fe/Mn superoxide dismutase (SOD) (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). The <italic>ΔoxyR</italic> mutant and mutants lacking essential T6SS-4 structural genes are significantly more sensitive to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than wild-type bacteria (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). For example, about 39.0% wild-type bacteria survived after exposing to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 1 hr, but the survival rates for the <italic>ΔicmF4</italic> mutant were only 10.7% (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Further, the sensitivity of the <italic>ΔclpV4</italic> mutant to oxidative stress can be fully alleviated by expressing wild-type gene but not the E<sup>304</sup>A/E<sup>677</sup>A mutant deficient in hydrolyzing ATP (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>), supporting a role of T6SS-4 in combating oxidative stress. Importantly, the conductance of the T6SS-4 channel is required for such resistance as the VgrG4-GFP fusion known to block T6SS secretion [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] rendered the bacteria sensitive to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>; such inhibition did not occur when VgrG4 was fused to 6 tandem histidine residues (VgrG4-His<sub>6</sub>), a fusion known not to block the function of the transporter [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). In agreement with these observations, similar to <italic>katG</italic>, one of the classical target genes of OxyR, the expression of T6SS-4 was induced by oxidative stress (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>

Among the three fluorescent dyes used, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) detects H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ROO•, 3′-(<italic>p</italic>-hydroxyphenyl) fluorescein (HPF) detects HRs, and 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetylester (CM-H2DCFDA) detects H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, ROO• and HRs [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

<title>Intracellular accumulation of zinc ions under oxidative condition required T6SS-4</title>
<p>Metal ion homeostasis regulates cellular level of HRs [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

To test the hypothesis that T6SS-4 is involved in metal ion homeostasis, we measured the total metal contents in bacteria challenged with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> using inductively coupled plasmon resonance atomic absorption spectrometry (ICP-MS). Our results revealed that deletion of T6SS-4 in the <italic>ΔznuCB</italic> background significantly lowered intracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels and that the expression of <italic>znuCB</italic> or <italic>clpV4</italic> partially restored such defects (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). In contrast, the accumulation of Mn<sup>2+</sup> was not affected in these mutants (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Such defects clearly did not result from potentially lower live bacterial cells because the 20 min treatment did not detectably affect bacterial viability (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). Thus, T6SS-4 likely is involved in Zn<sup>2+</sup> uptake. Consistent with this notion, exogenous Zn<sup>2+</sup> was able to restore the growth of <italic>Yptb</italic> in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> but only in the presence of a functional T6SS-4 or ZnuABC transporter (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>).

<p>The fact that the T6SS-4 participates in zinc acquisition predicts that the vegetative growth rate of the Δ<italic>clpV4</italic>Δ<italic>znuCB</italic> mutant will be affected by Zn<sup>2+</sup> starvation under oxidative conditions. This prediction was confirmed by comparing the growth of the wild-type and the Δ<italic>clpV4</italic>Δ<italic>znuCB</italic> mutant in the presence of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelator TPEN (N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine) under H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). Whereas the growth of all tested strains is nearly identical in YLB medium (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A Fig</xref>), the growth of the Δ<italic>clpV4</italic>Δ<italic>znuCB</italic> mutant is severely impaired compared to the wild-type in the presence of TPEN under H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress. The expression of either <italic>znuCB</italic> or <italic>clpV4</italic> from a complementation plasmid almost completely rescued the sensitivity of the Δ<italic>clpV4</italic>Δ<italic>znuCB</italic> mutant to TPEN (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5C Fig</xref>). Moreover, the growth defect of the mutant was completely rescued by the addition of excessive Zn<sup>2+</sup>, further supporting the role for T6SS-4 in Zn<sup>2+</sup> acquisition (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5D and S5E Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Because the production of HRs contributes to the cellular toxicity under diverse stress conditions [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], we reasoned that if T6SS-4 functions in Zn<sup>2+</sup> uptake, it should be required for maximal bacterial survival under these stresses. Indeed, in the <italic>ΔznuCB</italic> mutant background, T6SS-4 is required for the resistance to diverse stress conditions such as low pH, high temperature, heavy metal, diamide and antibiotic (gentamicin) (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). Taken together, these results point to a role of T6SS-4 in importing Zn<sup>2+</sup> from the environment under diverse stress conditions.</p>
<p>The observation that TSSS-4 is involved in Zn<sup>2+</sup> uptake points to the notion that the expression of this transporter should be responsive to low Zn<sup>2+</sup> conditions. Indeed, the addition of exogenous Zn<sup>2+</sup> repressed the expression of T6SS-4 in wild-type <italic>Yptb</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). Chelating Zn<sup>2+</sup> from the medium by TPEN led to robust expression from the promoter, and such induction can be repressed by exogenous zinc ions (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). Thus, the expression of T6SS-4 is responsive to the levels of Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the environment, which is consistent with its role in acquiring this metal ion from the extracellular milieu.</p>

<title>T6SS-4 translocates a zinc-binding protein substrate</title>
<p>Zinc transport by T6SS-4 can be achieved by direct ion translocation via the secretion channel or by a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding carrier protein translocated by the secretion system. We distinguished between these two possibilities by analyzing predicted proteins adjacent to structural components of T6SS-4 for putative Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding motifs with HHpred [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Such analyses revealed that Ypk_3549, a 117-residue protein encoded by a gene located at the end of the T6SS-4 gene cluster, contains a putative zinc finger motif (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>). No putative promoter can be identified upstream of <italic>ypk_3549</italic>, suggesting that this gene is part of the T6SS-4 operon. Indeed, similar to structural components of T6SS-4, the expression of <italic>ypk_3549</italic> is activated by OxyR under oxidative conditions (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). BLAST analysis revealed that homologs of this gene are present in the genomes of <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> and possibly <italic>Burkholderia oklahomensis</italic>. Because Ypk_3549 is a putative substrate of T6SS-4 that may bind Zn<sup>2+</sup>, we designated it YezP (<underline><italic>Y</italic></underline><italic>ersinia</italic> <underline>e</underline>xtracellular <underline>z</underline>inc-binding <underline>p</underline>rotein).</p>
<p>Analysis with isothermal titration calorimetry [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] revealed that YezP bound Zn<sup>2+</sup> with a <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> of 0.53 μM (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref> upper panel). Importantly, mutation of residue histidine-76 predicted to participate in the formation of the zinc finger reduced its affinity to Zn<sup>2+</sup> for more than 150-fold (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> = 152.14 μM) (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref> lower panel). Unexpectedly, the YezP<sub>H76A</sub> mutant still bound to Zn<sup>2+</sup>, although at a markedly lower affinity. Similar Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding activity of YezP and YezP<sub>H76A</sub> was detected when the interaction was measured with 4-(2-pyridylazo) resorcinol (PAR) [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). However, this protein did not detectably bind to iron ions (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>), which differs from the zincophore yersiniabactin from <italic>Yersinia</italic> spp. capable of binding both zinc and iron ions [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The residual Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding activity of YezP<sub>H76A</sub> may result from a second noncannonical zinc-binding motif in the protein.

Similarly, in line with the fact that low extracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations induced its expression, higher levels of YezP were detected in bacterial culture supernatant when Zn<sup>2+</sup> was sequestered by the chelator TPEN (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>The above results suggest that T6SS-4 is involved in either the secretion or import of YezP. To distinguish between these two models, we expressed YezP-VSVG in relevant <italic>Yptb</italic> strains and examined its secretion. Significant amounts of YezP-VSVG can be readily detected in culture supernatant of wild-type bacteria (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> upper panel). Mutations in T6SS-4 structural genes almost completely abrogated the secretion of YezP; the residual secretion was completely abolished in a mutant lacking all 4 T6SSs in <italic>Yptb</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> upper panel). Furthermore, deletion of <italic>yezP</italic> did not affect the secretion of Hcp4 (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> lower panel), indicating that this protein was not involved in substrate secretion by T6SS-4. Interestingly, akin to YezP, the secretion of Hcp4 was completely abolished only in a mutant lacking all 4 T6SS of <italic>Yptb</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> lower panel), indicating the existence of limited substrate cross recognition among these transporters. These results establish that YezP is a substrate secreted by T6SS-4.</p>
<p>That YezP is a zinc-binding substrate of T6SS-4 suggests that it is required for maximal bacterial survival under oxidative challenge. Indeed, the <italic>ΔyezP</italic> strain exhibited sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at levels similar to those of T6SS-4 mutants and such sensitivity can be fully complemented by wild-type, and partially by the H76A mutant which still retains residual Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding activity (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). We next determined whether recombinant YezP restored the ability of relevant <italic>Yptb</italic> mutants to survive oxidative challenge. Inclusion of recombinant YezP in cultures of the <italic>ΔyezP</italic> strain fully restored its resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). More importantly, recombinant YezP protein also protected the T6SS-4 mutant <italic>ΔclpV4</italic> from toxicity imposed by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>), indicating that after T6SS-4-mediated translocation, zinc uptake by YezP occurs independently of the secretion system. Consistent with its partial Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding activity, YezP<sub>H76A</sub> still detectably conferred resistance to oxidative stress in mutants defective in T6SS-4 or its coding gene (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). In agreement with its role in Zn<sup>2+</sup> acquisition to neutralize HRs, deletion of <italic>yezP</italic> resulted in accumulation of these harmful agents in bacterial cells to levels similar to those observed in T6SS-4 mutants (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>).

<p>We further determined the importance of Zn<sup>2+</sup> sequestration by recombinant YezP by adding the zinc chelator TPEN to the protein solution used for complementation. The inhibitory effects of TPEN can be neutralized by recombinant YezP in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). Although the addition of 0.05 μΜ YezP protein increased the survival rate of the <italic>ΔyezP</italic> mutant treated with 2.5 μΜ TPEN, it did not increase the survival rate of the same mutant in the presence of 5 μΜ TPEN when the concentration of Zn<sup>2+</sup> was 1.0 μM.

<p>The induction of T6SS-4 in primary macrophages suggests that this transporter may be important for the virulence of <italic>Yptb</italic> in animal infection. We thus examined this hypothesis by orogastrically inoculating relevant bacterial strains into C57BL/6 mice. Wild-type bacteria caused more than 50% lethality within two weeks of inoculation. On the other hand, consistent with the stress sensitivity phenotypes, mice infected with mutants lacking T6SS-4 or <italic>yezP</italic> survived better at similar rates (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). Similarly, the mutant lacking the classical zinc transporter <italic>znuCB</italic> that plays important roles in competition with vertebrate host for Zn<sup>2+</sup> is less virulent to mice [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Notably, mutations of <italic>znuCB</italic> together with T6SS-4 or <italic>yezP</italic> resulted in mutants that almost completely lost the virulence against mice (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>), further implying the importance of T6SS-4 in the resistance to host nutritional immunity. Thus, zinc transportation by T6SS-4 plays an important role in the interactions of <italic>Yptb</italic> with mammalian hosts.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The best-studied function of T6SSs is their role in the killing of competing species in specific niches using bacteriolytic effectors [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Previous studies have suggested roles of T6SSs in nonbiological challenges such as stress resistance [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this report, we found that the T6SS-4 from <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pseudotuberculosis</italic> functions to combat multiple adverse stresses and host nutritional immunity by translocating a zinc-binding effector.</p>
<p>Bacterial cells need to deal with insults of distinct origins in different phases of their life cycle or in different environmental niches. The production of detrimental HRs is emerging as a potentially important consequence of diverse environmental challenges [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition to their roles as cofactors in many essential enzymes, transition ions such as Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> are capable of mitigating HRs to reduce their damage [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Consistent with the notion that T6SS-4 functions to combat oxidative stress induced by diverse cues, its expression is also induced by high osmolality and low pH conditions via the osmotic/acid stress regulator OmpR [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which is consistent with its role in the resistance to a broad range of adverse stresses. Similarly, although the mechanism has not yet been well studied, a T6SS in <italic>Vibrio anguillarum</italic> is regulated by the general stress response regulator RpoS and is involved in its resistance to hydrogen peroxide, ethanol and low pH [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The response of T6SS-4 to distinctly different signals via multiple regulatory proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and the role of Zn<sup>2+</sup> in HRs mitigation provide a molecular explanation for “cross-protection”, a phenomenon in which bacterial cells subjected to one stressful condition often became resistant to stress created by distinctly different insults [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Metal ions can be transported into bacterial cells by specific ion transporter [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] or by chelators, such as siderophores, which are high-affinity iron-binding molecules [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our discovery of T6SS in bacterial ion acquisition significantly expanded the function of specialized protein secretion system. Due to their multiple components, the expression and assembly of T6SSs presumably will consume more energy. As a result, this system may only be activated when metal ions imported by the more classical transporters are not sufficient. Alternatively, the expression or activity of the classical metal ion transporters may be inhibited under certain environmental conditions. We proposed a model that under normal conditions, the ZnuCB transporter fulfills the need of Zn<sup>2+</sup> of the cells, and the T6SS-4 in <italic>Yptb</italic> contributes to this process as a Zn<sup>2+</sup> scavenger when the bacterium encounters stress conditions that lead to the production of HRs and potentially other cell damaging mechanisms by oxidative or other adverse conditions capable of activating OxyR (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). The establishment of a role of T6SS in dealing with non-biological challenges may provide an explanation to the wide spread of these protein secretion systems. It will be of great interest to determine whether bacteria not normally associated with a eukaryotic host employ T6SS to facilitate their survival in unfavorable environmental conditions.</p>

<p>For pathogenic bacteria, one benefit of the metal ion acquisition activity of T6SS is to compete for Zn<sup>2+</sup> within the host, or other essential metal ions to fight against nutritional immunity [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Given the essential role of Zn<sup>2+</sup> in bacterial physiology, it is not surprising that the ability of T6SS-4 in acquiring Zn<sup>2+</sup> might offer <italic>Yptb</italic> an advantage in pathogenesis because Zn<sup>2+</sup> in mammalian hosts is strictly sequestered by a defense mechanism termed nutritional immunity [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Indeed, the classical zinc transporter ZnuCB was found to play pivotal roles in competition against vertebrate host for Zn<sup>2+</sup> [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Accordingly, deletion of <italic>znuCB</italic> attenuated the pathogenicity of important pathogens such as <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Consistently, we found <italic>Yptb</italic> T6SS-4 mutants are attenuated in virulence against mice. Notably, mutations of T6SS-4 or <italic>yezP</italic> together with <italic>znuCB</italic> resulted in mutants that are almost completely avirulent in a mouse infection model, indicating the importance of T6SS-4 in the resistance to host nutritional immunity. These results may also explain the observation that mutations in <italic>znuCB</italic> did not affect the virulence of <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Interestingly, the siderophore yersiniabactin has recently been shown to participate in Zn<sup>2+</sup> acquisition in <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Furthermore, mutants lacking both the ZnuABC system and yersiniabactin are defective in virulence [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The fact that the <italic>ybt</italic> locus for yersiniabactin biosynthesis are absent in the <italic>Yptb</italic> strain YpIII used in our current study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/169748796" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/169748796</ext-link>) may explain the strong phenotypes of mutants defective in both T6SS-4 and ZnuCB. It will be interesting to determine whether <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> mutants lacking all three known Zn<sup>2+</sup> acquisition systems display further reduction in virulence.</p>
<p>Zn<sup>2+</sup> transported by T6SS-4 of <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> may compensate the effects caused by the loss of the canonical transporter. Lethal systemic infection by <italic>Yptb</italic> has multiple phases, including initial survival in the gastrointestinal track, invasion through M-cells into the Peyer’s patches and the subsequent trafficking to the deep tissue via macrophages [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The observed loss of virulence can result from impairment in the competitiveness against the microflora prior to infection or by the inability to compete with Zn<sup>2+</sup> sequestration mechanisms in host cells or a combination of both. Hence, this finding provided a new perspective for revealing the mechanisms of T6SS in pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Zinc acquisition by secreted zinc-binding proteins seems to be a mechanism shared by taxonomically diverse microorganisms. Secreted Zn<sup>2+</sup>-chelating compounds (zincophores) analogous to siderophores have been identified in pathogenic bacteria such as <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Recently, the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein Pra1 important for zinc acquisition from hosts by the fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic> was identified [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Similar to Pra1, YezP appears to contain multiple Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding motifs (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). In <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, the type VII secretion system ESX-3 is necessary for optimal growth in zinc-limited conditions, implying the involvement of a similar mechanism in zinc acquisition by this pathogen [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>
<p>The affinity of YezP for Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> = 0.53 μM) is considerably lower than that of canonical Zn importers such as ZnuA (&lt;20 nM) [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and ZinT (22 nM) [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], but it is comparable to or even higher than other Zn importers like YiiP (1000 nM) [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) (865 nM) [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and the membrane zinc transporter (MTP1) (23 μM) [<xref rid="ppat.1005020.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Despite the relatively lower affinity for Zn<sup>2+</sup>, YezP is crucial for <italic>Yptb</italic> survival in stress conditions or for successful colonization of a mammalian host, particularly in the absence of the canonical Zn<sup>2+</sup> transporter ZnuCB. Under our experimental conditions, even in the presence of strong chelators such as TPEN, recombinant YezP was able to provide Zn<sup>2+</sup> sufficient for the cells to survive under oxidative stress (<xref rid="ppat.1005020.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Future elucidation of the mechanism of the transfer of Zn<sup>2+</sup> to the cell by YezP may explain how this protein functions in the presence of a chelator with much higher affinity for the ions. Similarly, the exact mechanism and timing of YezP’s contribution to the infection process needs further investigations.</p>
<p>The Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein substrate YezP represented a novel type of T6SS effectors distinct from those extensively-studied bacteriolytic toxins or eukaryotic cell-targeting effectors. Our study suggests that T6SS-4 secretes a proteinaceous Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelator as a strategy to acquire this nutrient, which implies the existence of a mechanism for subsequent acquisition of zinc from this protein by bacterial cells. Clearly, this process occurs independent of T6SS-4 as recombinant YezP was able to rescue the sensitivity of its mutant to oxidative stress. Evidently, the implication of ion transport by T6SS is broader than bacterial interactions with hosts or competing species. The ability to more effectively acquire nutrients is beneficial to the bacteria, pathogenic or environmental species, when they encounter challenges in specific niches. Future study aiming at the identification of the machinery for importing Zn<sup>2+</sup> from YezP or the Zn<sup>2+</sup>/protein complex surely will lead to a better understanding of mechanism not only for the function of these widely distributed secretion systems, but also for metal ion uptake by bacteria.</p>
