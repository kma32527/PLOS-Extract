<abstract>
<p><italic>Candida</italic> spp. can cause severe and chronic mucocutaneous and systemic infections in immunocompromised individuals. Protection from mucocutaneous candidiasis depends on T helper cells, in particular those secreting IL-17. The events regulating T cell activation and differentiation toward effector fates in response to fungal invasion in different tissues are poorly understood. Here we generated a <italic>Candida</italic>-specific TCR transgenic mouse reactive to a novel endogenous antigen that is conserved in multiple distant species of <italic>Candida</italic>, including the clinically highly relevant <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic>. Using TCR transgenic T cells in combination with an experimental model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) we investigated antigen presentation and Th17 priming by different subsets of dendritic cells (DCs) present in the infected oral mucosa. <italic>Candida</italic>-derived endogenous antigen accesses the draining lymph nodes and is directly presented by migratory DCs. Tissue-resident Flt3L-dependent DCs and CCR2-dependent monocyte-derived DCs collaborate in antigen presentation and T cell priming during OPC. In contrast, Langerhans cells, which are also present in the oral mucosa and have been shown to prime Th17 cells in the skin, are not required for induction of the <italic>Candida</italic>-specific T cell response upon oral challenge. This highlights the functional compartmentalization of specific DC subsets in different tissues. These data provide important new insights to our understanding of tissue-specific antifungal immunity.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Candida</italic> spp. are present in the normal microbiota without causing damage to the host. They can become pathogenic and bear a serious health hazard for individuals with a weakened immune system. The continuous incidence of fungal infections and the increase in resistance against available antifungal drugs urge the development of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies. Knowledge gained from understanding how immunocompetent mammals control <italic>Candida</italic> will help develop new immunotherapeutic and-prophylactic approaches suitable to improve patient prognosis. It is well known that T helper cells, and in particular the Th17 subset, provide resistance against mucocutaneous infections with <italic>Candida</italic>. However, the mechanisms through which T cell-mediated antifungal immunity is induced in such context are not well understood. Here we developed a new experimental system to study the regulation of antigen-specific T cells with high resolution. Our results reveal the interplay of different dendritic cell subsets associated to the oral mucosa of infected mice that directly present fungal antigen to <italic>Candida</italic>-specific T cells and orchestrate a protective Th17 response in a tissue specific manner. Thus, our data highlight important features of immune regulation in the oral mucosa, a tissue that is immunologically not well characterized.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Opportunistic fungal infections cause an increasing medical problem due to the progression in immunosuppression worldwide [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. <italic>Candida</italic> spp. present in the normal human microbiota can cause mucocutaneous infections when cellular immune barriers of the host are breached. As such, HIV<sup>+</sup> individuals with low T cells counts are often affected by oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], indicating that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells play a critical role in preventing disease symptoms. <italic>Candida</italic>-specific memory T helper cells are found in all healthy individuals that have been exposed to the fungus in the normal human microflora and interestingly, they belong predominantly to the subset of Interleukin 17 (IL-17)-secreting Th17 cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The notion that IL-17 plays a key role in protection from fungal infections is further supported by the identification of rare families of patients, in which inborn errors in genes linked to the IL-17 pathway are associated with chronic and recurrent forms of mucocutaneous candidiasis [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although the relevance of Th17 cells in protection from <italic>Candida</italic> is well-documented, the regulation of these cells remains ill-defined. This gap in knowledge is entailed (among other things) by the limited information available about <italic>Candida</italic>-derived T cell epitopes. Out of the &gt;10<sup>15</sup> different T cell receptors (TCRs) that are theoretically generated by gene segment rearrangement, only a minute proportion recognizes <italic>Candida</italic>-derived antigens. The difficulty to identify these few antigen-specific T cells within the entire polyclonal repertoire hampers the study of their activation and differentiation process. The use of TCR transgenic T cells proved useful to elucidate diverse aspects of adaptive immunity in experimental systems of infectious and non-infectious diseases. However, only few TCR transgenic mouse lines specific for clinically relevant pathogens including fungi [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] exist to date. To circumvent this limitation, well-established TCR transgenic T cells specific for model antigens such as ovalbumin or the I-Eα chain have been used in combination with infectious agents engineered to express these model antigens. Although such systems are useful to interrogate the activation of antigen-specific T cells in the context of an infectious setting, they have important limitations, such as restricted availability, processing and presentation of model antigens during T cell priming that result in the inefficient generation of effector and memory T cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. TCR transgenic T cells which recognize endogenous antigen thus represent an important advantage to functionally analyze the pathogen-specific T cell response at high resolution and in a physiological context. No TCR transgenic mouse specific for <italic>Candida</italic> spp. exists to date.</p>
<p>Differentiation of naive T cells into effector T cells depends on antigen presentation, co-stimulation and polarizing cytokines provided in <italic>cis</italic> by antigen presenting cells (APCs) [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In the context of <italic>Candida</italic> infection, Syk- and Card9-coupled C-type lectin receptors including Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 are relevant for the induction of Th17-inducing cytokines in response to fungal recognition [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 are broadly expressed by diverse subsets of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs), many of which can potentially serve as APCs for Th17 induction. MNPs comprise monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Although they are all derived from a common macrophage and DC progenitor (MDP), MNPs comprise developmentally and functionally distinct cellular subsets in different tissues, which are difficult to unambiguously distinguish on the basis of their phenotype [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes differentiate from MDPs and egress from the bone marrow in a CCR2-dependent manner [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. After entering tissues they can give rise to monocyte-derived DCs expressing high levels of CD11c and MHC II under the influence of M-CSF in inflammatory conditions [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. MDP can also give rise to common DC progenitors (CDPs), which develop in response to Flt3 signaling and give rise to two distinct subsets of DCs: Batf3-independent and Batf3-dependent DCs, the latter of which comprises lymphoid tissue CD8α<sup>+</sup> DCs and non-lymphoid-tissue CD103<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>-</sup> DCs [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the skin, Langerhans cells (LCs) constitute a special case. Seeded before birth from fetal liver monocytes [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] they maintain themselves under steady state conditions by self-renewing from local precursors [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Non-lymphoid tissue DCs migrate from the periphery and carry antigens for presentation to T cells in the draining lymph nodes and when activated by inflammatory or infectious stimuli promote the generation of antigen-specific effector T cells.</p>
<p>The oral mucosa shares features with other mucosal tissues and the skin, but it constitutes a unique tissue with its own cellular composition and function [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. LCs, CD103<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>-</sup> DCs and CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD103<sup>-</sup> DCs have all been identified, but their role in immune activation is not well understood. In addition, inflammatory monocytes that give rise to monocyte-derived DCs infiltrate the oral mucosa upon infection and inflammation. Using an experimental model of OPC we show here how these different DC subsets orchestrate the T cell response during oral infection. We made use of a novel TCR-transgenic mouse, whose T cells specifically recognize an endogenous <italic>Candida</italic>-derived antigen, to functionally determine the presentation capacity of individual APC subsets. We found that both monocyte-derived and Flt3L-dependent conventional DCs carry fungal antigen from the site of infection to the draining cervical lymph nodes where they directly present it to T cells. In a partially redundant manner they instruct the activation and differentiation of <italic>Candida</italic>-specific T cells into cytokine-producing effector cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. This indicates that the initiation of an antifungal Th17 response depends on an intricate interplay of different APC subsets in the oral mucosa allowing the generation of a robust response.</p>

Langerin-DTR mice [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] were a kind gift from Björn Claussen and Dr. Kordula Kautz-Neu (Mainz, Germany). All mice were on the C57BL/6 background, kept in specific pathogen-free conditions and used at 6–15 weeks of age. In some experiments, mice were treated with diphtheria toxin via the intraperitoneal route (10 ng per gram body weight, daily starting from 1 day prior to infection to day +2 post-infection). For blocking of CSF1R, 2 mg anti-CSF1R antibody (clone AFS98, kindly provided by Melanie Greter, Zürich) was administered intraperitoneally one day prior infection, followed by a second dose of 1 mg on day 1 post-infection.</p>

<title>Generation of the TCR transgenic mouse line Hector</title>
<p>Splenocytes were isolated from systemically infected B6 mice (infection on day -24 and day -10) and re-activated with GM-CSF-induced bone marrow-derived DCs at a ratio 10:1 in the presence of 2 x 10<sup>4</sup> heat-killed <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> yeast cells. After 3 days cells were fused with BW5147 lymphoma cells (ATCC #TIB48) using polyethylene glycol 1500 (AppliChem) [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] selected in hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine (HAT) medium (Invitrogen). Specificity of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell hybridoma for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> was assessed by co-culturing 5 x 10<sup>4</sup> hybridoma cells with 5 x 10<sup>4</sup> DC<sup>1940</sup> cells that were pulsed with 5 x 10<sup>4</sup> heat-killed fungi. After 24h supernatants were transferred to 1x10<sup>4</sup> CTLL-2 and their viability was assessed by the alamar blue cell viability test (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>-specific hybridoma were subcloned by serial dilution to generate the monoclonal hybridoma cell line 59.8, which was re-screened for specificity. TCR Vα2 and Vβ4 expression was determined by flow cytometry. RNA was isolated form the hybridoma using TRI reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cDNA was generated using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase RNase, H- (Promega). cDNA was amplified with a TCRα-specific primer set [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and a TCRβ-specific primer set [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Sequencing of the PCR products was done by Microsynth and then aligned to the mouse genome using Ensemble database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus</ext-link>) and analyzed with Immunogenetics Information System (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.imgt.org/" xlink:type="simple">www.imgt.org</ext-link>). The identified Vα2Jα53 and Vβ4Dβ1Jβ1 gene segments were amplified from the genomic DNA using the following primers: Vα2 fwd, 5'-tgacccgggagcttcagtctaggaggaatg-3'; Vα2 rev, 5'-atatcggccgctcctgtaatacttacttg-3'; Vβ4 fwd, 5'-tgtctcgagagagatcctatcctgtgtgacactgctatg-3'; Vβ4 rev, 5'-tgcccgcggcatcccacacccaaagaccctcaggccttaccta-3'; digested with <italic>XmaI</italic> and <italic>NotI</italic> or <italic>XhoI</italic> and <italic>SacII</italic>, respectively, and cloned into previously described TCR expression vectors [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

<title>Fungal strain and infections</title>
<p>The <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> laboratory strain SC5314 was used throughout unless stated otherwise.

All fungal strains were grown in YPD medium at 30°C for 15–18 hours. Mice were infected with 2.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> cfu <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> sublingually as described [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] without immunosuppression. In some experiments, mice were treated with 400 μg Fluconazole (Ratiopharm) intraperitoneally on day 2 post-infection and 0.2 mg/ml Fluconazole (Sigma-Adrich) in the drinking water from day 2 post-infection until the mice were sacrificed to prevent fungal overgrowth, which may affect the degree of the T cell response. Mice were monitored for morbidity and weight throughout the course of all experiments. Determining the body weight of infected mice represents a sensitive method for monitoring the control of infection. While all mice sublingually infected with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> strain SC5314 lose 10–15% of their body weight within the first 2 days post-infection, their recovery of the original weight within 5–7 days post-infection correlates with rapid fungal elimination [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For determination of fungal burden, the tongue of euthanized animals was removed, homogenized in sterile 0.05% NP40 in H<sub>2</sub>O for 3 minutes at 25 Hz using a Tissue Lyzer (Qiagen) and serial dilutions were plated on YPD agar containing 100 μg/ml Ampicillin.

<title>Preparation of mannoprotein extract</title>
<p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> strain ATCC14053 was grown YPD medium at 30°C for 16 hours, washed extensively and resuspended in 20mM Na citrate buffer. Samples were autoclaved for 1.5h at 121°C and spun at max speed for 15’. The supernatant, containing highly soluble mannoproteins, was harvested and stored at -20°C. A mix of equal volumes of Fehling solution I (7% hydrate copper(II)sulfate in 100ml H2O) and Fehling solution II (35% potassium tartrate + 10% NaOH in 100 ml H2O) was prepared and added to the thawed supernatant in a 1:1 ratio for 30’. After centrifugation for 15’ at max speed a pellet was obtained that derived from precipitation of mannoproteins. The pellet was dissolved in 3N HCl. Proteins were precipitated upon addition of 8:1 MetOH + Acetic acid, incubation for 1h on a rotating wheal at 4°C and centrifugation (step repeated twice). Finally, two steps of wash/dehydration were performed with MetOH and Ether, respectively. Pellets were dried with a vacuum pump and stored at -80C.

<title>Generation of a TCR transgenic mouse reactive to a novel <italic>Candida</italic>-derived T cell epitope</title>
<p>To study the immune response to <italic>Candida</italic> antigen, we first developed a <italic>Candida</italic>-specific TCR transgenic mouse. In this mouse, dubbed 'Hector', 40–60% of all peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed a transgenic TCR consisting of Vα2 and Vβ4 genes sequenced from the T cell hybridoma 59.8, which was generated from T cells that were isolated from a <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans-</italic>infected C57BL/6J (B6) mouse (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

As positive control, the T cell hybridoma 59.8 exposed to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>-loaded DC<sup>1940</sup> cells produced IL-2, which was quantified using the CTLL-2 bioassay (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The hybridoma was found to react against DC<sup>1940</sup> cells pulsed with a mannoprotein-enriched fraction (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>), indicating that the antigenic determinant was present in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> cell wall. Mass spectrum analysis of the mannoprotein extract revealed the presence of five abundant proteins (yeast wall protein1, YWP1; enolase, ENO1; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, G3PDH; alcohol dehydrogenase, ADH1; fructose bisphosphate 1, FBA1). A peptide pool, consisting of 15-mers overlapping by 10 amino acids covering the entire ADH1 sequence, stimulated IL-2 production from the hybridoma 59.8 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), while no response was detected against peptide pools covering the sequences of YWP1, ENO1, G3PDH or FBA1.

When compared to the populations found in lymph nodes of <italic>Ccr7</italic><sup><italic>–/–</italic></sup>mice, population II could be identified as lymph node resident DCs and population I as migratory DCs.

<p>To define the antigen-presenting capacity in OPC, we FACS-sorted to high purity the three DC populations from cervical lymph nodes of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> infected mice and directly tested their capacity to activate Hector T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> without addition of exogenous antigen. We also tested Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils isolated from the cervical lymph nodes of the same mice in the assay, since previous studies have shown that these cells can present antigen in certain conditions [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Hector T cells responded only very weekly, or not at all, to CD11c<sup>hi</sup> MHC II<sup>int</sup> DCs (population II), CD11c<sup>int</sup> MHC II<sup>int</sup> cells (population III) and Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils. In contrast, they rapidly upregulated CD69 and proliferated strongly when co-cultured with MHC II<sup>hi</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> migratory DCs (population I) (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>). In the assay, the T cell stimulatory capacity was strictly dependent on <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>-derived antigen, since DCs isolated from naïve animals were unable to induce proliferation of Hector T cells. Together with the previous findings, these data indicate that cells within the MHC II<sup>hi</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> migratory population can capture <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>-derived antigen from the peripheral tissue and transport them to the cervical lymph nodes where they are presented to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Consistent with a role of migratory DCs in the induction of Th17 differentiation, cells within population I produced higher levels of IL-6 compared to the other two DC populations in the cervical lymph nodes of OPC-infected mice (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>To further dissect the heterogeneity of the MHC II<sup>hi</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> population in the cervical lymph nodes we performed staining with antibodies to Langerin and CD103.

<p>The large Langerin<sup>−</sup>CD103<sup>–</sup> subset of migratory DCs in the cervical lymph node appeared to be phenotypically homogeneous for all markers analyzed (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). However, the subset may still comprise phylogenetically and functionally distinct cell types, including Flt3-dependent conventional DCs and monocyte-derived DCs that are Flt3-independent but dependent on Csf1R signaling for differentiation from inflammatory monocyte [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Consistent with this notion, we found that in <italic>Flt3l</italic>-/- mice, migratory MHC II<sup>hi</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs, which include the large population of Langerin<sup>−</sup>CD103<sup>–</sup> cells, were strongly reduced in <italic>Flt3l</italic>-/- mice compared to B6 mice (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>).

<p>To assess the role of the Flt3L-independent monocyte-derived DCs we took advantage of the notion that these cells express CCR2 [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. First, we noticed that CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes, which are also Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> and CD11b<sup>hi</sup>, rapidly accumulated in the infected tongue (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). From day 2 post-infection, a proportion of CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes up-regulated CD11c and MHC II and down-regulated Ly6C, indicating that they differentiated to DCs (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). Second, CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes were also found in the cervical lymph nodes of infected mice (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>), and some of them differentiated to DCs, as observed in the peripheral tissue (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>). We also observed that monocyte-derived DCs with the strongest expression of MHC II and CD11c had reduced levels of CCR2 (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>). Because of these characteristic markers, these cells fell in the gate of migratory MHC<sup>hi</sup> CD11c<sup>hi</sup> DCs (population I) and were hardly distinguishable from other migratory DCs such as Flt3L-dependent DCs.</p>
<p>To directly assess the antigen presentation capacity of the CCR2<sup>+</sup>-derived migratory DCs during OPC, we separated MHC II<sup>hi</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs from the cervical lymph nodes of infected mice into three fractions according to their CCR2 expression and exposed them to CD4<sup>+</sup> Hector T cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. We observed T cell activation with all the subsets, irrespective of their degree of CCR2 expression, suggesting that both monocyte-derived DCs (included mainly in the CCR2<sup>hi</sup> and CCR2<sup>int</sup> fractions) as well as CCR2<sup>lo</sup> DCs, most likely reflecting Flt3L-dependent DCs, could directly present <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>-derived antigen (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>).</p>

<title>Monocyte-derived and Flt3L-dependent migratory DCs complement each other for Th17 priming during OPC</title>
<p>To evaluate the relative contribution of CCR2-dependent and Flt3L-dependent migratory DC subsets in T cell priming during OPC <italic>in vivo</italic>, we examined the induction of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>-specific Th17 cell in the cervical lymph nodes of OPC infected <italic>Flt3l</italic>-/- and <italic>Ccr2</italic>-/- mice on day 7 post-infection. While the response was not affected by the absence of Flt3L-dependent DCs (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>), the frequency of IL-17-secreting <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T was strongly reduced in <italic>Ccr2</italic>-/- mice compared to B6 controls (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>).

Alterations in DC and monocyte populations may impair the innate control of the fungus; and an increased fungal burden can augment the extent of the T cell response. Therefore, to exclude the possibility that the results were influenced by differences in the available amount of antigen between the experimental groups, we treated the mice with Fluconazole from day 2 post-infection, a time point when the fungal burden was high and similar in all groups of mice (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). This resulted in comparable weight recovery (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>) and clearance of the fungus to undetectable levels within the period of the experiment, which is indicative of comparable infection control in all experimental groups.</p>

<p>To further support the critical role of monocyte-derived DCs in Th17 priming during OPC, we made use of a CSF1R-specific antibody, which was shown to block the differentiation of monocytes into monocyte-derived DCs [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and led to a significant reduction of CCR2<sup>+</sup> cells within the migratory DC population (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). Th17 induction in response to OPC was considerably lower in mice that were treated with this antibody prior to and during infection than in untreated controls (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>). However, similarly to what we observed in the <italic>Ccr2</italic>-/- mice, the reduction in Th17 response in mice treated with anti-CSF1R antibody was only about 50% compared to the response in controls. This could be explained by inefficient/incomplete blockade with the antibody, while in <italic>Ccr2</italic>-/- mice, monocyte trafficking may be partially compensated by CCR2-independent mechanisms. The impact of monocyte-derived DCs on Th17 priming during OPC may thus be underestimated in our system. An explanation for the partial effect could also be the involvement of other subsets of APCs that might even compensate to a certain extent for the absence of monocyte-derived DCs to promote Th17 priming in anti-CSF1R treated or CCR2-deficient mice. Because Flt3L-dependent DCs contribute to the presentation of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>-derived antigen, at least when presentation was assessed in our <italic>in vitro</italic> assay (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>), we tested the hypothesis that they may play a relevant role in Th17 induction in absence of monocyte-derived DCs. For this we analyzed again the Th17 response to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> in Flt3L-deficient animals and we included a group, in which we blocked the CSF1R prior to infection. All animals were again treated with Fluconazole from day 2 post-infection to minimalize differences in fungal burden between the experimental groups that could affect T cell priming (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). This resulted in a nearly complete blockade of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>-specific Th17 response (<xref rid="ppat.1005164.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). Together, our results demonstrate a contribution of different subsets of APCs to the Th17 response during OPC and highlight the critical role of monocyte-derived DCs and to a lesser extent Flt3L-dependent DCs in this process. While Flt3L-dependent DCs were not essential under normal conditions when monocyte-derived DCs were present, they did critically contribute if these primary APCs were absent.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Th17 cells have emerged as a key component of protective immunity against mucocutaneous candidiasis. In recent years, <italic>Candida</italic>-specific T cells have been studied in detail in humans and in mice leading to the identification of Th17-inducing innate pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], revealing <italic>Candida</italic>-derived antigenic epitopes [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and providing detailed insights into their clonal diversity [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Here we provide new insights in the mechanism that regulates fungus-specific T cell immunity. We generated a <italic>Candida</italic>-specific TCR transgenic mouse model to provide a tool for the detection, enumeration and characterization of antigen-specific T cells during infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using this new tool we identified the cellular players that present fungal antigen and instruct the Th17 response against <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> during oropharyngeal infection. CCR2-dependent monocytes-derived DCs rapidly accumulate in the oral mucosa during infection and directly present <italic>Candida</italic>-derived antigen in the draining lymph nodes. However, they are partially redundant for Th17 induction during OPC and complemented by tissue-resident Flt3-dependent migratory DCs for antifungal T cell priming <italic>in vivo</italic>. Together, this reveals a complex regulation of the antifungal T cell response by a multifaceted network MNPs in the oral mucosa.</p>
<p>T cells of the newly established Hector mouse model are responsive to a native epitope of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> derived from the metabolic enzyme ADH1 that localizes to the fungal cell wall and is also abundant in biofilms [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. ADH1 was reported previously to have immunogenic properties because it bears some structural homology to integrins and can mediate adherence to extracellular matrix [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and ADH1-specific antibodies were detected in <italic>Candida</italic>-exposed individuals and mice [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Here we show that ADH1 determines T cell specificity ADH1 is highly conserved in diverse species of the genus <italic>Candida</italic> and in other Saccharomycotina. The short stretch of amino acids that define the T cell epitope identified here are 100% conserved in multiple clinically relevant species of <italic>Candida</italic> including <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>dubliniensis</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic>. The Hector mouse model thus offers new opportunities for investigating T cell responses against distinct species of <italic>Candida</italic>. Here we explored the regulation of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>-specific T cells during oropharyngeal infection.</p>
<p>The oral cavity is the entry port and the first site of contact with the host for a multitude of microbes. Diverse DC subsets including tissue resident DCs as well as inflammatory DCs accumulating in the oral mucosa in response to infection and inflammation orchestrate T cell outcomes in response to these microbes. DC subsets in the oral mucosa are related to those described in other barrier tissues. However, their relative abundance and distribution as well as their putative function partially differs. Similarly to the skin, Langerhans cells are present in the oral mucosa, but in contrast to what was reported for an epicutaneous model of candidiasis, in which Langerhans cells were shown to be necessary and sufficient for antifungal Th17 priming [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], they are not essential for Th17 induction during OPC. Moreover, while Batf3-dependent DCs promote Th1 and inhibit Th17 cell differentiation during epicutaneous candidiasis [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], absence of Batf3-dependent cells does not affect the T cell response during OPC. Whether monocyte-derived DCs are involved in the T cell response against <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> in the skin had not been examined to our knowledge. The discrepancies observed between the two distinct tissues are likely explained by site-specific differences, including the important difference in abundance of Langerhans cells between the skin and the tongue, but may also be influenced by the different mouse models of Langerhans cell deficiency used in the two studies. In the oral mucosa, Langerhans cells seem to be mainly tolerogenic [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The observed differences in regulation of T cell priming at different sites underline the compartmentalization of the immune response against one and the same fungal organism in different tissue environments. This effect is even more pronounced when antifungal immunity in barrier tissues is compared with the response elicited during systemic candidiasis, which is dominated by type 1 immunity [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Whether the quality of the Th17 response primed in the oral mucosa versus the skin may differ, remains to be established. In the oral mucosa, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>-specific T cells form a stable long-lived population of memory Th17 cells that efficiently responds to secondary infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Similarly, Th17 cells primed in the skin have recently been shown to enhance protection from epicutaneous fungal challenge with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p>
<p>The DCs presenting <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>-derived antigen to T cells in the cervical lymph nodes of OPC-infected mice belong to the CCR7-dependent migratory population. Distinguishing monocyte-derived DCs from other migratory DC subsets in the cervical lymph nodes of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>-infected mice on the basis of their phenotype is difficult as they gradually lose their characteristic expression of Ly6C and CCR2. We therefore used an approach to separate them on the basis of their phylogenetic origin. Direct assessment of antigen presentation by migratory subsets revealed that both monocyte-derived DCs and Flt3L-dependent DCs presented <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>-derived antigen in the cervical lymph nodes of infected mice. They were however redundant for Th17 differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interrupting the differentiation of monocyte into DCs in absence of Flt3-dependent DCs almost abolished T cell priming, supporting the notion that other Flt3-independent DCs such as Langerhans cells are not required and not sufficient for Th17 induction during OPC.</p>
<p>Monocyte-derived DCs gain increasing attention for their role as professional APC to promote T cell responses [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] including those elicited by fungi such as <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> or <italic>Blastomyces dermatitidis</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In addition to priming adaptive immunity, CCR2-dependent cells also contribute to innate immunity against fungi including <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The mechanism by which these cells contribute to acute protection has not been fully established. During OPC, innate lymphoid cells and innate lymphocytes provide important sources of IL-17 during the early phase of infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Whether monocytes and/or monocyte-derived DCs impact on the regulation of innate IL-17 secretion has not yet been established. Here we show that monocyte-dependent DCs, together with Flt3L-dependent DCs, orchestrate the antigen-specific T cell response to a clinically highly relevant fungal pathogen, and may thus have implications for potential future immunotherapeutic approaches and vaccine development against mucosal candidiasis.</p>

<title>Characterization of Hector TCR transgenic mice.</title>
<p>(<bold>A—B</bold>) CD3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> TCR β<sup>+</sup> T cells from the spleen, cervical lymph nodes and thymus of naïve Hector and transgene-negative control mice (B6) were analyzed by flow cytometry for TCR Vα2 and Vβ4 expression. Representative FACS plots of splenic T cells are shown in A. Summary graphs with 6 individual mice are shown in B. (<bold>C</bold>) The proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells within the CD3<sup>+</sup> TCRβ<sup>+</sup> T cell population was analyzed in the spleen, cervical lymph nodes and thymus of naïve Hector and transgene-negative control mice (B6). For the thymus, the frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> double positive (DP) T cells is also indicated. Each symbol represents an individual mouse, the mean ± SD is indicated. Data are pooled from two independent experiments. Note that the different ratio of CD4<sup>+</sup>: CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in spleen and lymph nodes of Hector mice is expected due to allelic exclusion of non-transgenic TCRβ genes and preferential lineage decision towards CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, as observed in other TCR transgenic mice [<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005164.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p>
