<abstract>
<p>White-nose syndrome (WNS) in North American bats is caused by an invasive cutaneous infection by the psychrophilic fungus <italic>Pseudogymnoascus destructans</italic> (<italic>Pd</italic>). We compared transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression using RNA-Seq on wing skin tissue from hibernating little brown myotis (<italic>Myotis lucifugus</italic>) with WNS to bats without <italic>Pd</italic> exposure. We found that WNS caused significant changes in gene expression in hibernating bats including pathways involved in inflammation, wound healing, and metabolism. Local acute inflammatory responses were initiated by fungal invasion. Gene expression was increased for inflammatory cytokines, including interleukins (IL) IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17C, IL-20, IL-23A, IL-24, and G-CSF and chemokines, such as Ccl2 and Ccl20. This pattern of gene expression changes demonstrates that WNS is accompanied by an innate anti-fungal host response similar to that caused by cutaneous <italic>Candida albicans</italic> infections. However, despite the apparent production of appropriate chemokines, immune cells such as neutrophils and T cells do not appear to be recruited. We observed upregulation of acute inflammatory genes, including prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (cyclooxygenase-2), that generate eicosanoids and other nociception mediators. We also observed differences in <italic>Pd</italic> gene expression that suggest host-pathogen interactions that might determine WNS progression. We identified several classes of potential virulence factors that are expressed in <italic>Pd</italic> during WNS, including secreted proteases that may mediate tissue invasion. These results demonstrate that hibernation does not prevent a local inflammatory response to <italic>Pd</italic> infection but that recruitment of leukocytes to the site of infection does not occur. The putative virulence factors may provide novel targets for treatment or prevention of WNS. These observations support a dual role for inflammation during WNS; inflammatory responses provide protection but excessive inflammation may contribute to mortality, either by affecting torpor behavior or causing damage upon emergence in the spring.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>White-nose syndrome is the most devastating epizootic wildlife disease of mammals in history, having killed millions of hibernating bats in North America since 2007. We have used next-generation RNA sequencing to provide a survey of the gene expression changes that accompany this disease in the skin of bats infected with the causative fungus. We identified possible new mechanisms that may either provide protection or contribute to mortality, including inflammatory immune responses. Contrary to expectations that hibernation represents a period of dormancy, we found that gene expression pathways were responsive to the environment. We also examined which genes were expressed in the pathogen and identified several classes of genes that could contribute to the virulence of this disease. Gene expression changes in the host were associated with local inflammation despite the fact that the bats were hibernating. However, we found that hibernating bats with white-nose syndrome lack some of the responses known to defend other mammals from fungal infection. We propose that bats could be protected from white-nose syndrome if these responses could be established prior to hibernation or if treatments could block the virulence factors expressed by the pathogen.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an epizootic disease that has killed millions of bats in North America [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. WNS is caused by the psychrophile <italic>Pseudogymnoascus destructans</italic> (<italic>Pd</italic>) (formerly <italic>Geomyces destructans</italic>), an ascomycete fungal pathogen [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] that affects bats during hibernation. <italic>Pd</italic> grows at temperatures between 2 and 18°C and can infect bats while they hibernate [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. <italic>Pd</italic> is invasive and damages the cutaneous tissues of bats, including the wing [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], forming characteristic cupping erosions that are diagnostic of <italic>Pd</italic> infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Mortality rates due to WNS vary by species. In the little brown myotis, <italic>Myotis lucifugus</italic>, the mortality rate is up to 91% in affected caves [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] whereas WNS resistance has been reported in the big brown bat, <italic>Eptesicus fuscus</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Bats in Europe are exposed to endemic <italic>Pd</italic>, but do not exhibit WNS mortality and appear to be resistant to the disease [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], despite cutaneous invasion by <italic>Pd</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Cutaneous infection by <italic>Pd</italic> causes some species of bats to arouse more frequently from torpor [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although hibernating mammals spend less than 1% of their time euthermic [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], they use up to 90% of their stored energy during these periods [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Because each arousal in little brown myotis utilizes an estimated 108 mg of stored fat [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the increase in arousal frequency caused by WNS explains 58% of the morbidity rate associated with <italic>Pd</italic> infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Other factors that are also associated WNS pathology include effects of <italic>Pd</italic> infection on the integrity of wing tissue [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], electrolyte balance and hydration [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], chronic respiratory acidosis [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], oxidative stress [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and immune function [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The relative importance of each of these mechanisms in causing death in WNS is not clear, and the most likely model that has emerged is a multi-stage progression of WNS with contributions of several of these factors [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Differences in susceptibility to WNS between species in North America may be explained in part by different responses to <italic>Pd</italic> infection such as changes in thermoregulatory behavior. Understanding host responses to <italic>Pd</italic> infection may provide insight that could be useful for improving survival of affected species.</p>
<p>Cutaneous fungal infections in mammals are first recognized by components of the innate immune system, including C-type lectin receptors and Toll-like receptors [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Conserved components of the fungal cell wall activate pattern recognition receptors on phagocytes such as neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells, and on epithelial cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Activation of these cells can lead to induction of the inflammasome, the production of inflammatory cytokines, and generation of reactive oxygen species that can mediate fungal cell killing [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The importance of the innate immune response to the initial recognition of fungal infections is demonstrated by the observation that deficiencies in these signaling pathways can lead to chronic fungal infections in humans [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the absence of invasion, colonization by commensal fungi can be maintained through tolerance mechanisms mediated by interactions with dendritic cells and epithelial cells in the skin [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Local activation of innate immune pathways can slow the growth of invasive pathogenic fungi and promote tolerance, possibly leading to a commensal relationship with the fungus [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], but is not usually sufficient to clear infections. Clearance of infections typically requires T helper (Th) cells, as demonstrated by the susceptibility of patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, immunosuppressant therapy, or chemotherapy to fungal infections [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These T cell responses can be mediated by Th17 cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] or, in some cases, Th1 cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], with Th2 responses typically associated with greater susceptibility [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Th17 responses can contribute to clearance of invasive fungal infections through the actions of IL-17A and IL-22 [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and the further recruitment and activation of neutrophils [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These T cell subsets have not been well characterized in bats, but those T-cell mediated immune mechanisms that have been studied appear to be conserved between bats and other mammals [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>
<p>Fungal infections in animals are typically life-threatening only upon suppression of adaptive immune responses in the host, such as when chytrid fungus (<italic>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</italic>) blocks lymphocyte-mediated inflammatory responses [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Hibernation produces a natural suppression of some immune responses in mammal species where it has been studied. During hibernation, when the conservation of energy is critical, certain immunological mechanisms are downregulated while others remain unaffected [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Changes during hibernation can include depressed antibody responses [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], decreased ability of T and B lymphocytes to proliferate in response to challenge [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and reduced complement activity [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Hibernation does not affect all immune responses equally, as shown in thirteen-lined ground squirrels (<italic>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</italic>) that have a suppressed T-independent antibody response but are capable of mounting a T cell-dependent response during hibernation [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Studies of transcriptome-wide changes during hibernation in squirrels [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] have shown expression changes in genes involved in metabolism, oxidative stress, protein folding, ischemia/hypoxia, and other processes, but these studies were not examining an active immune response. Hibernation is also known to affect the distribution of leukocytes [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and platelets [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. However, we have an incomplete understanding of how hibernation affects the suppression, or subsequent recovery, of immune responses [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], or how immune physiology in bats during hibernation may differ from that of rodents.</p>
<p>The cost of immune suppression during torpor is presumably outweighed by the benefits of energy conservation because most pathogens are not capable of proliferating at the low body temperatures of hibernating animals. However, the psychrophilic nature of <italic>Pd</italic> allows it to infect bats within hibernacula [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The brief euthermic bouts of hibernating bats are shorter than most other hibernating mammalian species [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and it may not be possible for a bat naïve to a pathogen to mount a primary immune response in the few hours that it is euthermic throughout the hibernation season. We have observed antibody responses to <italic>Pd</italic> in bats, but these responses are strongest in active bats exposed to <italic>Pd</italic> after emergence from hibernation [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Therefore, hibernating bats may keep pathogens in check by relying on hypothermia, innate immune responses, and/or memory immune responses. The psychrophilic nature of <italic>Pd</italic> overcomes the first of these barriers to infection and the difficulty in fighting fungal pathogens with innate mechanisms alone may allow <italic>Pd</italic> to proliferate and invade the cutaneous tissues of bats.</p>
<p>The WNS panzootic has created an urgent need to understand if North American bat populations can persist in the presence of the fungal pathogen [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Understanding the complete array of host responses mounted by bats afflicted with WNS may help illuminate sources of variation in survival within and among bat species. To determine which host responses are activated by <italic>Pd</italic> infection, we measured transcriptome-wide gene expression levels in bat wing tissue from hibernating bats affected by WNS. Gene expression was compared to bats that were hibernated in captivity in the absence of <italic>Pd</italic> exposure. We hypothesized that <italic>Pd</italic> infection would cause changes in gene expression that would reveal physiological responses during WNS that might be either protective or pathological. By using next-generation RNA sequencing to examine transcriptome-wide gene expression changes we expected to discover consistent patterns of host responses that occur in <italic>Pd</italic>-infected tissues. Combined with changes in gene expression within the <italic>Pd</italic> pathogen, these results have provided a survey of the host and pathogen interactions occurring during WNS.</p>

<p>To determine the host response mounted by little brown myotis to <italic>Pd</italic> during hibernation, we measured changes in gene expression at the whole transcriptome level. Wing tissue samples were obtained from hibernating little brown myotis with no known exposure to <italic>Pd</italic> and bats exhibiting physical signs of WNS, as shown in <xref rid="ppat.1005168.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Histopathology [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and quantitative PCR (qPCR) for <italic>Pd</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] were used to confirm the WNS status of each bat (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Cupping erosions diagnostic of WNS were found on all 6 bats captured in Kentucky, but on none of the 5 bats from states negative for WNS at the time of capture. Low levels of neutrophilic inflammation were found in all 11 wing samples (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Infl), although this inflammation was not associated with sites of <italic>Pd</italic> infection. All 6 WNS-affected bats tested positive for <italic>Pd</italic> by qPCR, although the fungal load measured on wing swabs (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; qPCR) did not correlate with the number of cupping erosions found by histology (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; WNS). As previously shown [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], WNS-affected bats had significantly lower body condition (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; SMI; p = 0.017, t = 2.9255, df = 9).</p>

<p>Next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed using poly-A selected RNA isolated from each RNAlater-preserved wing tissue sample (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Using expression levels of <italic>Pd</italic>-derived transcripts, we confirmed that all 6 WNS-affected bats had abundant expression of <italic>Pd</italic> genes. The <italic>Pd</italic>-derived transcripts were not present at significant levels in any of the 5 samples from unaffected bats (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>; p = 2.2x10<sup>-6</sup>, t = 21.5, df = 5.33), including the MN090 sample that had tested positive for <italic>Pd</italic> by qPCR in one of the two replicates (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Because high levels of differential expression of <italic>Pd</italic> transcripts would make it more difficult to detect significant changes in host gene expression, the assembly was filtered [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] to remove <italic>Pd</italic>-derived sequences. Comparison of the filtered assembly with the original revealed that removing the <italic>Pd</italic> sequences did not significantly decrease the completeness of the assembly (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>) as determined by BUSCO [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. This filtered assembly (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Dataset</xref>) was used to calculate differential expression in host genes between the unaffected and WNS-affected samples.</p>
<p>We compared host gene expression across all samples (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Dataset</xref>) using DESeq2 [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] to identify transcript clusters that were expressed at a minimum of 2-fold difference and significant at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). We found 1804 transcript clusters that were expressed at higher levels, and 1925 transcript clusters expressed at lower levels, in WNS-affected bat tissues (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). Hierarchical clustering (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) revealed that expression of these transcripts from all 5 bats without WNS was similar to each other. Gene expression in wing tissue from WNS-affected bats was different from unaffected bats and more similar to each other, as predicted. The normalized expression levels of the 3729 identified transcript clusters differentially expressed are listed in <xref rid="ppat.1005168.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>.</p>

<p>Differential expression of individual gene isoforms was further analyzed using EBSeq [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], an empirical Bayesian approach to modeling gene expression. For each transcript cluster identified as differentially expressed by DESeq2, we used EBSeq to determine if any of the individual transcripts were differentially expressed at a posterior probability greater than 0.99 (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). Of the 3729 differentially expressed transcript clusters identified by DESeq2, EBSeq identified at least one differentially expressed transcript for 1427 (38% of total, 43% of upregulated genes and 33% of downregulated genes). These results indicate that differences in gene expression are likely due to alternative splicing or other isoform differences for many of the differentially expressed genes.</p>
<p>To annotate the functions of these genes and identify those likely to be involved with host responses to <italic>Pd</italic> infection, we used the Trinotate pipeline. BLAST was used to identify 1365 upregulated transcripts and 325 downregulated transcripts in WNS-affected tissues with significant homology to known genes from vertebrates in the Swissprot database. Of the 2295 remaining transcripts, 13 were mapped to genes from non-vertebrates in the Swissprot database, presumably due to environmental contamination or incomplete removal of <italic>Pd</italic> transcript sequences. Of the 2842 trinity transcript clusters without a BLASTx match in Swissprot, 2731 (96%) were found to align to sequences (e-value &lt; 0.0001) in the little brown myotis genome. Of the aligned transcripts, 204 (7.4%) were found to correspond to previously identified non-coding RNA sequences. Of the 111 transcript clusters without a transcript that aligned to the little brown myotis genome or Swissprot, BLAST was used to align their transcripts to the UniRef90 database. We found that 7 genes aligned to vertebrate homologs, 9 aligned to fungal homologs, and 15 aligned to other metagenomic sequences. We were unable to identify homologous sequences for any transcripts from 80 (2.1%) of the transcript clusters that were differentially expressed.</p>
<p>Expression levels for the Swissprot-identified transcript clusters with the 100 lowest adjusted p values are shown in <xref rid="ppat.1005168.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> (see <xref rid="ppat.1005168.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref> for all results). Some of the differentially expressed genes with putative functions that were predicted to associate with host responses to a fungal pathogen are listed in <xref rid="ppat.1005168.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. WNS caused dramatic changes in expression of genes involved in inflammation, immune responses, wound healing, metabolism, and oxidative stress, even though the bats were hibernating during the <italic>Pd</italic> infection. Most of these genes were upregulated in WNS-affected tissues, while a much smaller number of identified genes with putative functions in these categories were downregulated (Tables <xref rid="ppat.1005168.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005168.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine if all 6 little brown myotis with WNS exhibit similar changes in gene expression, we performed clustering analysis of the differentially expressed transcripts (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). To confirm the significance of these patterns of gene expression, bootstrap analysis of clustering was performed [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The clustering of the unaffected samples together and the clustering of the WNS-affected samples together was verified with a confidence of 99% (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Principal component analysis was performed to better understand the relationships between the transcripts expressed in the 11 samples (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). All 5 samples from unaffected bats were very similar based on the first three principal components identified, which account for 71% of the variance in these transcripts. The WNS-affected bat samples have more diverse gene expression (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>) and PC1 (accounting for 44% of the variance) differentiates all 6 from the unaffected bat samples. The genes represented by PC1 include those that are more highly expressed in unaffected than WNS-affected wing tissue (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). PC2 (17% of the variance) and PC3 (10% of the variance) distinguish the KY19, KY23, and KY39 samples from the other two WNS-affected samples and from the unaffected samples. The rotation values of principal component analysis (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>) reveal that inflammatory genes made the greatest contribution to PC2. Clustering analysis revealed diverse host responses among the bats infected with <italic>Pd</italic>.</p>

<title>Metabolic and Inflammatory Immune Pathways Associated with WNS</title>
<p>We next examined the functional pathways that were most affected in little brown myotis infected with <italic>Pd</italic>. For this gene ontology analysis, DESeq2 results on transcript isoforms were used with a higher FDR threshold of 0.1, as is typical for this type of analysis. From WNS-affected bat tissue, 3104 upregulated transcripts were aligned with BLAST to the human Uniprot database. Homologs for these transcripts were identified and a list of 1937 unique Ensembl IDs associated with upregulated genes was generated (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Table</xref>). GOrilla [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] was used to determine significantly upregulated gene ontology categories from the Uniprot GO ID database (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005168.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Table</xref>) and REVIGO [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] was used to visualize biological processes that were significantly overrepresented in the WNS-affected transcriptome (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>).

<p>We next examined the <italic>Pd</italic> transcript clusters for additional factors that could affect virulence. Alignment by BLAST to the Swissprot and Uniprot90 databases identified 12 056 transcripts with significant homology to known fungal genes (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref>). For the remaining 67 <italic>Pd</italic> transcript clusters, Trinotate was not able to identify known functional domains or signal peptides present in these previously uncharacterized <italic>Pd</italic> transcripts. The results from the BLAST alignment were examined for genes known to be involved in processes that could affect <italic>Pd</italic> virulence, such as secreted proteases [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], metal binding proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], fungal cell wall remodeling [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], and other virulence factors [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. This analysis identified 46 <italic>Pd</italic> genes that could be involved in pathogenesis (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), including additional secreted proteases that could be involved in tissue invasion.</p>

<p>Because the tissue samples were collected from bats from 6 different hibernacula for this study, it is possible that differences in host or pathogen gene expression reflect differences in the environmental conditions present in each location, including the microbiome. In addition, the housing of the unaffected bats in captivity for 13 weeks prior to analysis could also have affected the microbiome. To examine the differences in the skin microbiome between the bats, we used MG-RAST to identify the lowest common ancestor of metagenomic sequences present (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref>). Although there were some differences observed in the bacterial microbiomes present on the wings of the 11 bats, there were no significant changes between the WNS-affected and unaffected samples when bacteria were identified at the class level. Several strains of <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> isolated from bat tissues have been identified with <italic>Pd</italic> growth inhibiting properties [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. MG-RAST analysis showed that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species are present in all 11 samples (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref>). <italic>P</italic>. <italic>fluorescens</italic> transcripts represented 2.8±0.6% of transcripts identified from gammaproteobacteria and 0.40±0.05% of all bacteria on the wings of unaffected bats and 0.37±0.07% of all bacteria on WNS-affected bats. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>fluorescens</italic> was present on all little brown myotis sampled, but was rare and relative abundance was not statistically different between WNS-affected and unaffected bats (p = 0.49, t = -0.71, df = 9).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The comparison of host gene expression between WNS-affected and unaffected little brown myotis clearly demonstrates that <italic>Pd</italic> infection causes physiological responses in wing tissue, where substantial fungal invasion of the skin occurs in WNS-affected bats [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The changes in transcript levels that we have observed indicate that host responses to fungal infection remain intact during hibernation and are similar to those observed during the initial stages of fungal infection in euthermic mammals [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These host responses include acute inflammation, wound healing, and metabolic changes. Pathogen gene expression varies among bats with WNS, suggesting host-pathogen interactions that mediate pathogenesis. Together, these results lay a foundation to determine which host and pathogen responses contribute to WNS resistance and susceptibility and identify targets to increase survival.</p>

<title>Host Response to <italic>Pd</italic> Infection</title>
<p>The gene expression changes we observed in the wing tissue of WNS-affected bats are similar to those observed in other cutaneous fungal infections [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Cutaneous <italic>Candida albicans</italic> infections in humans and mice typically initiate an immune response by activating pattern recognition receptors of the C-type lectin family [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] and the toll-like receptor family, both of which we found upregulated in WNS-affected bat wing tissue (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). These included C-type lectin domain (CLEC) family members CLEC4D (MCL), CLEC4E (MINCLE), CLEC7A (Dectin-1), CLEC6A (Dectin-2), and Toll-like receptor 9. In mice and humans, protective host responses to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> are usually characterized by many of the same cytokines and chemokines [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] that we have found upgregulated in WNS-affected wing tissue, including the cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, G-CSF, IL-23A, and IL-17C. Little brown myotis infected with <italic>Pd</italic> are increasing transcription of the key genes necessary for initiating a host response that provides protection from fungal infection. This clearly demonstrates that hibernation does not prevent innate immune responses in bats infected with <italic>Pd</italic> and that, although they are not closely related to rodents and primates [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], bats respond to fungal infections similarly to these other mammals.</p>
<p>The responses to <italic>Pd</italic> infection within bat wing tissue may be mediated by keratinocytes in the epithelial tissue. Activation of pattern recognition receptors by fungal ligands is expected to induce keratinocytes to produce many of the cytokines that we have found upregulated at the transcript level in WNS-affected bat wing tissue [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In addition to the cytokines typically involved in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> responses described above, keratinocytes are also known to express the chemokine Ccl2 and the cytokines IL-20 and IL-24 in response to pattern recognition receptor activation [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Keratinocytes and fibroblasts are also known to exhibit a paracrine loop of IL-1 and IL-6 activation [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] that enhances wound healing and host defense to microbial infection and we found evidence of IL-1 and IL-6 receptor activation in the increased RNA levels for transcription factor p65, NFκB, and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). Another important cytokine produced by epithelial cells in response to infection is IL-17C [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. This is an atypical IL-17 family member that is expressed by epithelial cells and causes autocrine responses in the epithelial cells that also express the IL-17RA and IL-17RE heterodimeric IL-17 receptor [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. The wing tissue transcriptomes from WNS-affected and unaffected bats show similar expression levels of both IL-17RA and IL-17RE (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Dataset</xref>) and would, therefore, be expected to be responsive to IL-17C. The gene ontology analysis also found evidence for functional enrichment of genes involved in keratinocyte differentiation, presumably due to wound healing responses. Keratinocytes or other epithelial cells in bat wing tissue appear to have responded to the invasion of the epidermis by fungal hyphae.</p>
<p>Genes for pro-inflammatory mediators characterized the innate immune response that we observed in the wing tissue of <italic>Pd</italic> infected bats. Under euthermic conditions this would be expected to provide protection by the recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils, mediated by G-CSF, IL-23A, Ccl2, IL-17C and IL-6 [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], and the initiation of an adaptive Th17 or Th1 response. However, under the constraints of hibernation, responses that require leukocyte migration do not appear to occur in <italic>Pd</italic>-infected bats. We do not find strong evidence of increased expression for genes characteristic of either innate or adaptive leukocytes, except for L-selectin, which is expressed on T cells, and CD177, which is expressed on neutrophils. Lower than expected levels of monocyte, neutrophil, Th1, and Th17 cell recruitment may be related to the sequestration of leukocytes during hibernation [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, we have observed neutrophil recruitment in hibernating little brown myotis in response to another fungal infection (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the histological examination of the current samples, we found neutrophilic inflammation in both WNS-affected and unaffected wing tissue (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, this inflammation did not occur at the sites of <italic>Pd</italic> infection. Curiously, we found a significant increase in WNS-affected tissue for transcripts for CD3γ and CD45 that could be expressed by gamma-delta T cells or other innate lymphocytes that reside in the skin [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. It is possible that <italic>Pd</italic> is specifically suppressing neutrophil and/or T cell recruitment by interfering with chemotactic signals, similar to the suppression of inflammatory immune responses during chytridiomycosis in amphibians [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, analysis of tissue levels of the cytokines and chemokines is necessary to confirm the secretion of these proteins. Because neutrophils and T cells do not appear to be recruited to sites of <italic>Pd</italic> infection during hibernation, only local inflammatory mediators may be available and they appear to be unable to control the infection in little brown myotis.</p>
<p>In addition to immune responses, hibernating bats also respond to <italic>Pd</italic> infection in other ways. We found transcripts for proteins from many pathways involved in metabolism, signaling, gene expression, transport, migration, and differentiation that were altered in WNS-affected bats (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that some of these differences were due to the different hibernation conditions of the two groups of bats. However, the differential expression of the genes in these pathways demonstrates that they are subject to regulation during hibernation and can respond to infection, tissue damage, and/or environmental changes.</p>
<p>Host responses to fungal infection can be influenced by changes in the pathogen, including gene expression changes in the colonizing fungus, such as <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We found significant variability in the gene expression by <italic>Pd</italic>, which is particularly interesting because all <italic>Pd</italic> in North America is presumed to be a clone of the same mating type [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The pathogen has adopted different gene expression profiles in the 6 bat tissues (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>), perhaps in response to differences in the host environments. Correspondingly, host gene expression patterns also show differences between the WNS-affected tissue samples. Of particular interest is the observation that the cytokine and chemokine genes found in principal component 2 of our PCA analysis (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005168.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Table</xref>) are expressed at very different levels in the 6 <italic>Pd</italic>-infected samples. From this study we cannot determine whether the differences in pathogen gene expression are driven by differences in the host environment or vice versa. Although all 6 WNS-affected bats had visible signs of WNS, had similar <italic>Pd</italic> burdens, and similar histopathology, it is possible that the differences in host or pathogen gene expression that we observed may have affected progression of WNS and survival.</p>

<title>Responses that May Contribute to WNS Mortality</title>
<p>Because the increased frequency of arousals from torpor appears to be a primary cause of WNS mortality [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we considered possible mechanisms that could affect torpor bout length. The increased gene expression of IL-1, IL-6, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines mediates a local acute inflammatory response to <italic>Pd</italic>. These cytokines also have systemic effects that modify behavior and thermoregulation [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. In addition to cytokine and chemokine transcript increases, we also found increased transcripts for the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (prostaglandin G/H synthase 2) and both secreted and cytosolic phospholipase A2 that form critical inflammatory lipid mediators such as prostaglandin H<sub>2</sub>. The eicosanoids generated by these enzymes, along with the actions of the upregulated genes kallikrein-6 and cathepsin S, are expected to generate pain and itching by locally activating neuronal nociceptors [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. This, in turn, could affect torpor bout length and/or behavior during periodic arousals. Indeed, we have documented significantly more grooming in WNS-affected bats infected in the wild [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], although a different study on laboratory-infected bats did not find similar behavior changes [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Together, the upregulated genes will likely generate an inflammatory microenvironment within the wing that may contribute to the robust wound healing response that we observe in WNS-affected bats. However, inflammation can also play a detrimental role in some diseases [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Further tissue damage and subsequent wound healing occurs in surviving bats upon emergence from hibernation [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These local affects of inflammation (pain and itching) as well as systemic effects are likely to play a key role in WNS pathology.</p>
<p>In addition to the gene expression changes that may contribute to acute inflammation locally within the epithelial tissues invaded by <italic>Pd</italic>, the systemic release of febrile cytokines such as IL-6 could affect the signals that control hibernation arousal. However, an exogenous pyrogen, lipopolysaccharide, is not able to provoke arousals in hibernating golden-mantled ground squirrels [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], so it may be unlikely that inflammation or febrile cytokines can directly trigger arousal in WNS-affected bats. Intracerebroventricular injection of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> in golden-mantled ground squirrels induces arousal from torpor and a febrile response during an extended periodic arousal [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Our observation of increased expression of the enzyme that generates prostaglandin H<sub>2</sub> may provide a mechanism that explains the shortened torpor bouts in WNS-affected bats, if it can be shown that this enzyme is active in the tissue and produces enough prostaglandin H<sub>2</sub> to act systemically.</p>
<p>In addition to the changes in expression of genes involved in immune responses and wound healing, we also found significant changes in metabolic genes. We found evidence of gene expression changes consistent with increased fat metabolism, including changes in transcripts for apolipoproteins, lipid transport proteins, protein metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. Of particular interest, we found increases in the expression of hydroxycarboxylic acid receptors 2 and 3 that are known to mediate adiponectin secretion [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. This suggests that infection with <italic>Pd</italic> may directly trigger changes in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism that contribute to WNS pathology. These changes stand in contrast to the changes that have been seen in the brain transcriptome of hibernating horseshoe bats (<italic>Rhinolophus ferrumequinum</italic>) [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] and the brain proteome of hibernating Rickett’s big-footed bats (<italic>Myotis pilosus</italic>) [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], which show decreased fat metabolism during torpor. By leading to premature depletion of fat stores, these gene expression changes could contribute to WNS mortality.</p>
<p>The other changes in host gene expression that we observed are consistent with a multi-stage progression model of WNS [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We also found support for changes in genes involved in oxidative stress [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and body fluid levels, which may contribute to WNS progression. Together, the pattern of gene expression changes that we find in little brown myotis with WNS suggests that a combination of maladaptive responses may contribute to mortality. However, the number of upregulated genes involved in the acute inflammatory response suggests that excessive inflammation may also be a factor contributing to pathology even prior to emergence from hibernation when it is suspected to contribute to wing damage [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec009">
<title>Implications for Future Studies</title>
<p>The changes in host transcript levels that we have found are presumably caused by physiological responses of the host to infection. However, caution must be used when extending these transcriptional responses to functional mechanisms because the current study does not measure protein or metabolite levels directly. Future studies will be necessary to determine which of the gene expression changes observed affect which host response mechanisms.</p>
<p>The little brown myotis chosen for the WNS-affected samples were exhibiting WNS pathology and appeared unlikely to survive at the time of sample collection. For this reason, it is presently uncertain which of the gene expression changes that we have observed are contributing to protection and which are pathological. Another factor that likely contributes to the variation in gene expression that we observed among the samples collected from free-ranging bats is the time since the most recent arousal from torpor. Prior to collection of each wing tissue sample, bats were artificially aroused for 30 to 120 minutes. This period of arousal is similar in duration to the natural arousals during hibernation for little brown myotis [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and presumably of sufficient duration for some innate immune responses to occur and for transcript levels to be altered. One reason for this procedure was to avoid disparities between the elapsed time from the most recent arousal bout until tissue collection. For the WNS-affected bats we could not determine when the most recent natural arousal would have occurred, but it would have likely been more recently than in unaffected animals, as affected animals arouse from torpor more frequently [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the current study we cannot resolve whether the changes in gene expression that we observed occurred during the most recent arousal, during previous periodic arousals, or during torpor. Future studies will be needed to determine which of the changes in gene expression that we observed during WNS in bats in the wild also vary in controlled captive hibernation conditions when prior arousal patterns are known. Further studies are also needed to compare the physiological responses in bats exhibiting WNS morbidity to responses in less susceptible bats, such as European species, North American species that are less susceptible like the big brown bat [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and the remnant populations of little brown myotis that appear to have developed tolerance or resistance to <italic>Pd</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Such studies should point to a path forward for bats in North America to persist in a landscape where <italic>Pd</italic> is endemic.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Little brown myotis mount a host response to <italic>Pd</italic> infection during hibernation. Which components of this response are protective or contribute to WNS pathology remains to be resolved. The innate immune response we have observed would be expected to promote a Th17-directed adaptive immune response that could clear the infection. However, the energetic constraints of hibernation may prevent little brown myotis from execution of the Th17- and neutrophil-mediated phases of the immune response. This may lead to excessive inflammatory responses, either during hibernation or upon emergence. The changes in host gene expression that we observed demonstrate that during <italic>Pd</italic> infection, little brown myotis also alter other defense responses, metabolic pathways, and transcription. Numerous <italic>Pd</italic> genes that may contribute to virulence were identified and these represent potential pathogen responses to host defense. Hibernation does not prevent a host response to infection and a better understanding of the differences between host and pathogen responses in bats susceptible to WNS and those resistant may lead to ways for increasing survival.</p>

<title>Samples</title>
<p>We collected hibernating little brown myotis from cave or mine walls at the locations listed in <xref rid="ppat.1005168.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Bats collected from all locations are expected to be from the same genetic population of eastern little brown myotis [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. For bats unaffected by WNS, little brown myotis were first swabbed on the left forearm for quantitative PCR analysis. After measurements were taken, bats were individually placed in cloth bags and hung in constant temperature thermoelectric coolers (Koolatron PC-3) maintained at ~7°C. Water-saturated sponges were placed in the bottom of each cooler to maintain humidity during transportation to Bucknell University. Bats were housed for 13 weeks in a Percival (model I36VLC8) environmental chamber with conditions set to 4°C and 95% relative humidity. Bats were provided water throughout hibernation. Bats were aroused from hibernation for 30–120 minutes prior to euthanasia. For WNS-affected bats, little brown myotis were collected in the field, measured, swabbed for quantitative PCR, and humanely euthanized after being aroused from hibernation for 60–120 minutes. Scaled mass index (SMI) was calculated using the formula (mass(in g))*(38.01/(forearm length(in mm))^1.406 [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Wing tissue was placed in formalin for histology and placed in RNAlater (Sigma-Aldrich) for gene expression analysis. RNAlater samples were stored at ambient temperature for up to 24 hours before long-term storage at -80°C. RNA was purified from 50 mg of wing tissue using a QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit. All samples used for RNA sequencing had RNA integrity values greater than 7.0 using an Agilent Bioanalyzer.</p>

<title>Verification of WNS Status</title>
<p>Wing skin tissue was removed from the bones of the arm and digits and rolled onto 2 cm paraffin wax logs. The logs were then fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for at least 24 hours. Each log was cut into 3 pieces that were processed into paraffin blocks overnight in a Tissue-Tek VIP processor (Sakura Finetek). The pieces were embedded in paraffin blocks, sectioned at 3 microns, and stained with periodic acid Schiff with a hematoxylin counterstain [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. WNS lesions (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; WNS) were identified as cupping erosions with fungal hyphae and conida present. Inflammatory foci (<xref rid="ppat.1005168.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; Infl) were identified as clusters of infiltrating neutrophils and were not associated with the asymmetrical curved conidia of <italic>Pd</italic>.</p>
<p>To determine presence or absence of <italic>Pd</italic> on bats unaffected by WNS, each swab was tested twice by quantitative PCR [<xref rid="ppat.1005168.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] by Jeffrey T.
