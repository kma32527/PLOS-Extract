<abstract>
<p>A transcriptome analysis identified <italic>Vibrio vulnificus cabABC</italic> genes which were preferentially expressed in biofilms. The <italic>cabABC</italic> genes were transcribed as a single operon. The <italic>cabA</italic> gene was induced by elevated 3′,5′-cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP) and encoded a calcium-binding protein CabA. Comparison of the biofilms produced by the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant and its parent strain JN111 in microtiter plates using crystal-violet staining demonstrated that CabA contributed to biofilm formation in a calcium-dependent manner under elevated c-di-GMP conditions. Genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that CabA was secreted to the cell exterior through functional CabB and CabC, distributed throughout the biofilm matrix, and produced as the biofilm matured. These results, together with the observation that CabA also contributes to the development of rugose colony morphology, indicated that CabA is a matrix-associated protein required for maturation, rather than adhesion involved in the initial attachment, of biofilms. Microscopic comparison of the structure of biofilms produced by JN111 and the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant demonstrated that CabA is an extracellular matrix component essential for the development of the mature biofilm structures in flow cells and on oyster shells. Exogenously providing purified CabA restored the biofilm- and rugose colony-forming abilities of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant when calcium was available. Circular dichroism and size exclusion analyses revealed that calcium binding induces CabA conformational changes which may lead to multimerization. Extracellular complementation experiments revealed that CabA can assemble a functional matrix only when exopolysaccharides coexist. Consequently, the combined results suggested that CabA is a structural protein of the extracellular matrix and multimerizes to a conformation functional in building robust biofilms, which may render <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> to survive in hostile environments and reach a concentrated infective dose.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Biofilms are specialized and highly differentiated three-dimensional communities of bacteria encased in an extracellular polymeric matrix (EPM), and the bacteria’s mechanisms to form biofilm are closely linked to their virulence. The EPM often consists of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. Compared to extracellular polysaccharides, little is known about the protein components in the biofilm matrix of <italic>Vibrio vulnificus</italic>, a foodborne pathogen. In this study, we identified and characterized <italic>cabABC</italic> genes which were preferentially expressed in biofilms. CabA is a calcium-binding protein and is secreted through functional CabB and CabC. Our results indicated that CabA contributes to the development of biofilm and rugose colony morphology under elevated c-di-GMP conditions. CabA is an extracellular matrix protein crucial for the structural integrity of robust biofilm in flow cells and on oyster shells. Calcium binding induces conformational changes and multimerization of CabA that may render the protein functional to build a well-structured matrix. CabA can assemble a functional matrix extracellularly only when exopolysaccharides (EPS) coexist, indicating that both CabA and EPS are required for the scaffold of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> biofilm matrix. This is the first report on a non-polysaccharide matrix component that is essential for the development of the <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> biofilm structure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Biofilm formation provides bacteria with protection from antimicrobial agents and host immune defense systems during infection as well as from a variety of stresses in the environment [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, biofilms of pathogenic bacteria are considered as one of the most important causes for new outbreaks and account for 65% of bacterial infections in humans [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Biofilm formation can be divided into sequential developmental stages beginning from initial surface attachment of planktonic bacteria continuing to multicellular structures (microcolony), subsequent maturation to biofilms, and detachment (dispersal) of bacterial cells from mature biofilms [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Mature biofilms are specialized and highly differentiated three-dimensional communities of bacteria encased in an extracellular polymeric matrix (EPM), the framework contributing to the organization and maintenance of biofilm structure and stability [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The major components of the EPM are polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, which are distributed between the cells in a non-homogeneous pattern [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Changes in colony morphology frequently reflect variations in biofilm matrix production levels, as smooth colony morphology of bacterial cells can switch to rugose (or wrinkled) by producing increased levels of EPM [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Exopolysaccharides (EPS) are the most prevalent component of <italic>Vibrio</italic> EPM and the structure, composition, and function of the <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> exopolysaccharide (VPS) and regulatory networks involved in its production have been studied as a model to delineate the molecular basis of bacterial biofilm formation [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Like many other pathogenic bacteria, <italic>Vibrio vulnificus</italic>, a pathogenic marine bacterium, forms biofilms in natural ecosystems [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There are several lines of evidence supporting that <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> embed themselves in oyster tissues and form biofilms to colonize and to persist in oyster as the primary infection route of the pathogen [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Diverse extracellular polysaccharides are produced by <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> and their functions in the development of biofilms are well characterized [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Among them, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is known to play a role in the initial adhesion of planktonic cells to the surfaces of assay tubes [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A capsular polysaccharide (CPS), which is more tightly associated with the cell envelope than EPS, is also produced after maturation of biofilms [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. CPS contributes to colony opacity and is required for determining biofilm size by limiting continual growth of mature biofilms [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Many, at least three, types of EPS are thought to play essential roles in the development of robust structures of EPM and mature biofilms of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
<p>The structural and regulatory genes involved in the <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> EPS production and, in turn, biofilm formation have been extensively studied [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The structural genes required for EPS production are organized into three clusters, EPS-I, II, and III on chromosome [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The cluster EPS-I consists of the <italic>rbd</italic> genes which are highly homologous to the <italic>syp</italic> genes involved in synthesis of the symbiotic-related polysaccharides of <italic>Vibrio fischeri</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The EPS-I genes were preferentially expressed in the estuarine-like conditions as determined by an RNA sequencing analysis [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The cluster EPS-II contains the <italic>brp</italic> genes (also <italic>wcr</italic> genes) which are organized into <italic>brpT</italic> encoding a putative transcription regulator and the <italic>brpABCDFHIJK</italic> operon required for the synthesis and transport of EPS [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The <italic>brpA</italic> mutant lost the ability to produce EPS, the parent biofilm phenotype, and rugose colony morphology [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Mutational analyses demonstrated that the third EPS cluster, EPS-III, is also involved in the production of EPS and formation of biofilms, but the functions of the EPS-III genes have not yet been addressed in details [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The <italic>rbd</italic> genes are regulated by RbdG [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and all three clusters are positively regulated by NtrC at the transcription level [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Expression of the <italic>brp</italic> genes and production of EPS are regulated by 3′,5′-cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP) [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The secondary messenger c-di-GMP is synthesized by diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) containing the GGDEF domain and degraded by c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs) containing the EAL (or HD-GYP) domain which are ubiquitous in bacteria (for a recent review, [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]).</p>
<p>However, compared to EPS, little is known about the non-EPS components of the <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> EPM. Although a type IV pilin required for the initial adherence to HEp-2 cells and biofilm formation has been reported [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], no matrix proteins essential for the mature biofilm structures have been previously identified. In this study, a transcriptomic comparison of planktonic and biofilm cells of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> led us to identify three genes, named <italic>cabABC</italic>, which are among the genes that are preferentially expressed in biofilms. Genetic, biochemical, and microscopic analyses were performed to demonstrate that CabA is a calcium-binding protein, produced as the biofilm matures, and secreted into the medium of the extracellular matrix through functional CabB and CabC. Construction of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant and evaluation of its phenotypes provided evidences that CabA is a matrix protein that plays a crucial role in the c-di-GMP-induced development of robust biofilm and rugose colony in a calcium-dependent manner. Finally, a possible mechanism by which CabA can assemble a functional matrix was also proposed by examining the extracellular complementation of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant and the <italic>brpA</italic> mutant which lacks EPS, and by determining the influence of calcium on the conformational changes and multimerization of CabA.</p>

<title>Identification of the <italic>cabABC</italic> genes</title>
<p>A whole-genome microarray analysis was used to compare the transcriptional profiles of the biofilm and planktonic cells of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic>. The microarray analysis predicted 321 genes differentially regulated in biofilm cells, of which 177 genes were up-regulated and 144 were down-regulated. A complete list of the 321 genes is shown at Supporting Information (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). Among the genes that were up-regulated in biofilms, three consecutive genes VV2_1571, VV2_1572, and VV2_1573 were identified and annotated to encode a protein with putative calcium-binding motifs, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type transporter, and a membrane-fusion protein (MFP), respectively (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Since the up-regulation of the three genes in biofilms was not previously reported, their preferential expression was experimentally verified. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that expression of the three genes increased 2.7–6.8 fold in biofilms (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). The three genes were named <italic>cabABC</italic> (for <underline>ca</underline>lcium-binding protein in <underline>b</underline>iofilms A to C), since the three genes encode proteins involved in the furnishing of a calcium-binding and matrix-associated protein essential for biofilm development as demonstrated in the later parts of this study. It was noteworthy that the <italic>cabABC</italic> genes were 9–69 fold upregulated by elevated intracellular c-di-GMP levels, indicating that <italic>cabABC</italic> genes are regulated by c-di-GMP in cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>

<title>Genetic organization of <italic>cabABC</italic></title>
<p>Many coding regions that participate in biofilm formation were identified immediately upstream and downstream of the <italic>cabABC</italic> genes from the <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> genome sequence (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>).

To analyze the expression pattern of the <italic>cabABC</italic> genes at the transcriptional level, cDNA was synthesized from the RNA isolated from JN111 (hereafter referred as a parent strain, constructed to manipulate intracellular c-di-GMP levels as demonstrated in the later parts of this study and <xref rid="ppat.1005192.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>) grown with LBS containing 0.01% of arabinose and amplified by PCR using primers RTcabA and RTcabC2 (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, a single band of, approximately 3.5-kb DNA was amplified. Based on the DNA sequence of <italic>cabABC</italic>, the 3.5-kb PCR product corresponded to the expected size of the amplification product between the RTcabA and RTcabC2 primers. This revealed that <italic>cabA</italic>, <italic>cabB</italic>, and <italic>cabC</italic> are transcribed as a single transcriptional unit. A positive control reaction with <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> genomic DNA as a template produced the same-sized 3.5-kb PCR product, and no product was observed when total RNA was directly used as a PCR template (a negative control). Therefore, it appeared that the <italic>cabABC</italic> genes are transcribed as a single operon rather than as three independent genes.</p>

<title>Sequence analysis of CabA, CabB, and CabC</title>

<title>Calcium binding to CabA</title>
<p>To examine whether calcium binds specifically to CabA, the metal content of the purified CabA was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Only calcium was detected in significant amounts (39 μM) in the protein while other metal elements including magnesium, manganese, iron and zinc were not identified (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). The concentration of calcium in the CabA solution (210 μM) indicated that the molar ratio of calcium ion bound to CabA was about 0.19. However, it is noteworthy that the recombinant CabA protein was synthesized in the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cytosol which contains limited concentration of calcium ion around 90 nM [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, the molar ratio of calcium to CabA determined by the ICP-AES does not necessarily reflect actual stoichiometry of calcium bound to CabA. To evaluate calcium-binding parameters for CabA, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were carried out. The calcium-free CabA protein was titrated with calcium, and the ITC data were integrated and fit into a binding model consisting of two sets of binding sites which yields three very tight (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 3 nM) and one weaker (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 11 μM) sites (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). The thermodynamic parameters of calcium binding to CabA determined by ITC are summarized in <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>.</p>

<title>Construction of JN111 and effects of c-di-GMP on the expression of <italic>cabA</italic></title>
<p>Since expression of the <italic>cabABC</italic> genes is regulated by c-di-GMP [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> JN111, in which <italic>dcpA</italic> encoding a DGC is controlled under P<sub><italic>BAD</italic></sub>, was constructed to manipulate the intracellular c-di-GMP levels (Materials and Methods and <xref rid="ppat.1005192.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). The intracellular c-di-GMP levels of JN111, determined using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], were gradually elevated as concentrations of arabinose increased in the growth media (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). The intracellular c-di-GMP level of the wild type CMCP6, in which the expression of <italic>dcpA</italic> was not manipulated, was approximately equivalent to the uninduced (or induced with 0.005% arabinose) JN111 level, indicating that the over-expression of <italic>dcpA</italic> leads to the increase of c-di-GMP well above the wild type level (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). The results indicated that JN111 was an appropriate strain to manipulate intracellular c-di-GMP levels. The cellular levels of the <italic>cabA</italic> transcript and CabA protein in JN111 grown with VFMG-CF (the modified <italic>V</italic>. <italic>fischeri</italic> minimal medium as described in Materials and Methods) containing different concentrations of arabinose were also determined. In the absence of arabinose, the qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses revealed little, if any, expression of <italic>cabA</italic>. However, <italic>cabA</italic> expression increased along with the increased concentrations of arabinose in the growth media (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). The combined results confirmed that <italic>cabA</italic> expression is induced by c-di-GMP and the increased expression of <italic>cabA</italic> in biofilms, as observed in microarray analysis, was probably attributed to elevated c-di-GMP. Strikingly, the presence of more than 0.02% arabinose was detrimental to the biofilm formation of the <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> strains (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Therefore, 0.01 and 0.02% arabinose were used in the hereafter experiments for biofilm and colony morphology analyses, respectively.</p>

<title>Effects of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutation on biofilm formation</title>
<p>Biofilms of JN111 and the isogenic <italic>cabA</italic> mutant were formed in microtiter plates, and quantified using crystal violet (CV) staining assays (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A,4B and 4C</xref>). CV staining revealed that the level of biofilm formation is consistently reduced in the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant under conditions of elevated c-di-GMP (0.01% arabinose) (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). This difference in the biofilm-forming ability of JN111 and the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant was apparent when increasing concentrations of calcium were present in the growth media (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). These results indicated that CabA induced by c-di-GMP plays a role in biofilm formation in a calcium-dependent manner. Complementation with a functional <italic>cabA</italic> gene (pYM1109) restored the biofilm-forming ability of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant to the level comparable to that of JN111 (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Therefore, the reduced biofilm-forming ability of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant resulted from the inactivation of functional <italic>cabA</italic> rather than any polar effects on genes downstream of <italic>cabA</italic>. Noticeably, when grown in the absence of arabinose, JN111 as well as the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant produced very low levels of biofilm (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). Furthermore, no obvious differences in the amounts of biofilm formed by JN111 and the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant in the absence of arabinose were observed. This indicated that the trace amounts of CabA expressed in the cells grown in the absence of arabinose would be not sufficient to contribute to biofilm formation (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Biofilm-forming abilities of the strains, in the same conditions used for <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A and 4C</xref> but in a larger scale in test tubes, were similar to those observed in microtiter plates as determined by the pictures of the resulting CV staining (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). These results demonstrated that CabA contributes to the c-di-GMP-mediated biofilm formation and requires calcium for its optimum activity.</p>

<title>CabB- and CabC-dependent secretion of CabA into extracellular matrix</title>
<p>To get a better understanding on the role of CabA in biofilm formation, the localization of the protein in the biofilms was determined. Biofilms were fractionated to separate cells from the extracellular matrix and subjected to Western blot analyses. As evident from the result shown in <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, CabA was detected in the matrix fraction as well as the cell fraction of the JN111 biofilms, indicating that CabA is a protein secreted to the cell exterior in the matrix of biofilms. In contrast, CabA was detected neither in the cell nor the matrix fractions of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant biofilms. This lack of CabA in the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant biofilms was restored by the introduction of pYM1109. To verify that the fractionation was performed without lysis of cells, a cytosolic regulatory protein IscR [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] was determined in each fraction by Western blot analysis. The result that IscR was found exclusively in the cell fraction ruled out the possibility that CabA in the matrix fraction resulted from cell lysis (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>).</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the deduced amino acid sequences of CabB and CabC share homology with those of MfpB and MfpC which are predicted to constitute a T1SS [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This information prompted us to examine whether CabA secretion to the cell exterior indeed depends on the presence of functional CabB and CabC. For this purpose, the isogenic <italic>cabB</italic> and <italic>cabC</italic> mutants were constructed (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and the CabA localization in biofilms was determined (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Western blot analyses revealed that CabA was detected exclusively in the cell fraction, but not in the matrix fraction, of the <italic>cabB</italic> and <italic>cabC</italic> mutant biofilms. The failure to detect CabA in the matrix fraction is indicative of defects in the secretion of CabA. The defect of CabA secretion in the <italic>cabB</italic> and <italic>cabC</italic> mutant was restored by the introduction of pJN1502 or pJN1403 carrying either recombinant <italic>cabB</italic> or <italic>cabC</italic>, respectively. IscR was detected once again exclusively in the cell fraction (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). The results indicated that CabB and CabC play a critical role in the secretion of CabA, possibly by composing a T1SS. Importantly, the <italic>cabB</italic> and <italic>cabC</italic> mutant failed to accumulate additional CabA in the cell fraction as determined based on band intensity (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). This was not surprising since previous studies have shown that the T1SS-impaired strains prevent accumulation of the protein substrates (effectors) in cells by degrading them by an unknown mechanism [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

<title><italic>In situ</italic> determination of the CabA localization in biofilms</title>
<p>The proteins secreted to the cell exterior might perform diverse functions such as initial attachment to surfaces and subsequent formation of matrix. It has been reported that proper localization of the proteins is crucial for their functions in biofilm formation [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Many, if not all, proteins involved in the initial surface attachment, namely adhesins, are somehow retained on the cell envelope as observed with <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> LapA and <italic>Salmonella enteritidis</italic> SiiE [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, to examine whether CabA is another adhesin, biofilms of the strains were formed on nickel grids and the localization of the functional form of CabA was determined <italic>in situ</italic> with a rabbit anti-CabA antibody and labeled with gold particles. When visualized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), secreted CabA proteins were not concentrated or localized along the cell boundaries, but rather distributed distally from the cells throughout the extracellular medium of the biofilm matrix (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). In contrast, CabA was not detected at all in the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant biofilm, and this absence of CabA was restored when the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant was complemented with pYM1109. The throughout, albeit not uniform, distribution of CabA in the extracellular matrix indicated that CabA is not a cell envelope-localized adhesin. We therefore hypothesize that CabA is a structural component of the extracellular matrix.</p>

<title>Kinetics of biofilm formation and <italic>cabA</italic> expression</title>
<p>Biofilm development of JN111 and <italic>cabA</italic> mutant was assessed at different time points using CV staining. Biofilm formation of both JN111 and the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant initiated at 2 h, reached maximum levels at 44 h, and then steadily decreased during extended periods of incubation (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). During the first 10 h of biofilm development, the amounts of both biofilms of JN111 and the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant were not significantly different. In contrast, the biofilm formation of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant was consistently reduced than that of JN111 after 10 h. The results indicated that CabA is not crucial for the initial surface attachment but plays an important role in the subsequent growth and maturation of biofilms. Consistent with this, <italic>cabA</italic> expression increased greatly at both transcript and protein levels after 12 h (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). Interestingly, the CabA protein increased up to 44 h whereas the <italic>cabA</italic> transcript arrived at the maximum at 12 h and then decreased (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>). The prolonged increase of CabA may result from the accumulation of the protein in the extracellular matrix during biofilm development as observed in <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> biofilms [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These results indicated that CabA is a matrix-associated protein and plays a crucial role as the biofilm matures.</p>

<title>Effects of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutation on colony morphology</title>
<p>In order to determine the role of CabA on colony morphology, JN111 and the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant were grown on the VFMG-CF agar plate supplemented with different concentrations of arabinose and 10 mM of CaCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). When grown in the absence of arabinose, JN111 revealed smooth colony morphology. However, the smooth colony morphology of JN111 switched to rugose (wrinkled) in the presence of 0.02% of arabinose, indicating that elevating c-di-GMP induced the development of the rugose colony morphology. In contrast to JN111, the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant formed smooth colony morphology regardless of the presence of arabinose and the smooth colony morphology of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant did not switch to rugose under conditions of elevated c-di-GMP (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). These results indicated that the rugose colony formation induced by the elevated c-di-GMP is CabA-dependent. Complementation of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant by the introduction of pYM1109 carrying a recombinant <italic>cabA</italic> shifted the smooth colony morphology of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant to the rugose comparable to that of JN111 (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>).

<title>Effects of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutation on biofilm structure</title>
<p>The biofilm biomass of JN111 was less than 2-fold greater than that of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant as determined by CV staining (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). This limited CabA-dependent increase of biofilm formation led us to examine whether the <italic>cabA</italic> mutation has effects on the structure of biofilm. The biofilms produced on the coverslips in flow cells were stained using LIVE/DEAD <italic>Bac</italic>Light Viability Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and visualized by confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). As shown in <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A</xref>, JN111 displayed the structure of robust, large, uniform, and mushroom-shaped biofilms, whereas the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant produced weak, sparse, inconsistent, and markedly unstructured biofilms. JN111 formed much thicker biofilms than the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant in flow cells, and Z-stack measurements indicated that the depths of the JN111 and the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant biofilms were about 112 and 66 μm, respectively. When determined by the flow cell images, the JN111 biofilms were stable and evenly covered the glass coverslip, whereas the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant biofilms seemed to be easily washed away and disintegrated by medium flow, which resulted in uncovered surfaces of the glass coverslip (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A</xref>, upper-right corner). The results indicated that the structure of the CabA-deficient matrix is not robust enough to withstand medium flow in flow cells, and CabA is essential more for the structure rather than the quantity of the <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> biofilm.</p>

<p>To further investigate the role of CabA in biofilm formation, biofilm structures of the strains were examined in more detail using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9B</xref>). JN111 produced compact and thick biofilms in which bacterial cells were bound together and encased within extracellular matrices. Filamentous materials that connect the bacterial cells to each other were visible within the extracellular matrix of JN111. In contrast, the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant cells were scattered without any extracellular filaments binding the cells together. The <italic>cabA</italic> mutant formed only few bacterial cell clusters that were left nearly bare, albeit the occasional appearance of thread-like strands. The observation that the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant made no matrices at all emphasizes the importance of CabA to the extracellular matrix formation. Since the amounts of EPS produced by JN111 and the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant grown on the LBS agar plates were not significantly different as described above (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>), it is reasonable to conclude that CabA appears to be important specifically for the structure of the extracellular matrix.</p>
<p>Biofilms of the strains were grown on oyster shells and their structures were examined using SEM (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>). As observed in flow cells, JN111 formed robust biofilms on the oyster shells with filamentous materials connecting bacterial cells in the extracellular matrix whereas its isogenic <italic>cabA</italic> mutant (YM112D) formed only few bacterial cell clusters with the significantly smaller amount of extracellular filaments (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A</xref>). Similarly, the wild type CMCP6, in which the intracellular c-di-GMP levels were not manipulated, produced markedly greater amounts of extracellular matrix compared to its isogenic <italic>cabA</italic> mutant (YM112) (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10B</xref>). Both <italic>cabA</italic> mutants, YM112D and YM112, were not able to develop considerable amounts of multicellular layers of bacterial cells on the surfaces of oyster shells. These results, combined with the results of <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A and 9B</xref>, suggested that CabA is essential for the structural integrity of the <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> biofilms in the natural environments as well as <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>Exogenous addition of purified CabA rescues the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant</title>
<p>We examined if exogenous CabA can rescue the biofilm defect of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant. The <italic>cabA</italic> mutant in microtiter plates was allowed to form static biofilm in the presence of increasing amounts of purified CabA. Purified CabA was able to restore the biofilm- and rugose colony forming ability of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>). The <italic>cabA</italic> mutant incubated in the presence of purified CabA of more than 0.8 μM formed biofilms that were comparable to that of JN111, in terms of their biomass (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11A</xref>). This CabA complementation of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant to form biofilm exhibited dependence on calcium and was not apparent unless calcium was present in the growth media (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11A</xref>). Similarly, the smooth colony morphology of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant on VFMG-CF agar plate was shifted to rugose in the presence of increasing amounts of CabA (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11B</xref>). However, this CabA complementation of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant to develop the rugose colony morphology was not obtainable when calcium was not added to the growth media (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11B</xref>). The rugose colony morphology developed by JN111 exhibited a similar dependence on the calcium concentration. We interpret these results as an indication that CabA can function properly outside the cell to yield a functional matrix, supporting the previous hypothesis that CabA is a protein released into the extracellular matrix. Taken together, the results led us to reconfirm that CabA is an extracellular matrix protein and requires calcium for its optimum activity.</p>

<title>Calcium-induced conformational change and multimerization of CabA</title>
<p>The inability of CabA to rescue the <italic>cabA</italic> defects in the absence of calcium (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11A and 11B</xref>) postulated that calcium is probably required for the shift of CabA to a conformation functional as a biofilm matrix protein. The analysis of the far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectrum showed that the calcium-free CabA is predominantly unfolded and lacks secondary structures (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig 12A</xref>). However, the secondary structures of CabA were obviously formed upon addition of 10 mM calcium (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig 12A</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The properties of the CabA protein were further assessed by performing size-exclusion chromatography. The calcium-free CabA showed a broader elution pattern than the calcium-binding monomeric CabA, indicating that calcium has an important role in CabA folding (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig 12B</xref>). A monomeric form of CabA showed a tendency to form a multimer (dimer or tetramer) in the presence of high concentration of calcium (above 20 mM) (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig 12B</xref>). By contrast, the multimeric CabA was converted to a monomeric form by reducing calcium concentration (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig 12B</xref>). Collectively, these results led us to hypothesize that CabA undergoes calcium-dependent conformational change and multimerization, which may be linked to the development of biofilm matrix and rugose colony.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The bacterial secondary messenger, c-di-GMP, is a global regulatory molecule that controls multiple phenotype changes in the bacterial world. Among the phenotype changes affected by c-di-GMP, life style switches from free-living planktonic cells to sessile biofilms have been most extensively studied [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although little is known about the c-di-GMP regulation of the phenotype changes of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic>, it has been reported that increased intracellular c-di-GMP levels induced production of EPS, a component of the <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp. biofilm matrix, and subsequent development of biofilm and rugose colonies [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this study, elevated c-di-GMP induced the expression of <italic>cabA</italic> encoding a calcium-binding matrix protein CabA (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). A mutation in <italic>cabA</italic> significantly impaired biofilm development even in the presence of elevated c-di-GMP without reducing the amount of EPS produced (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, and <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g010" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). The results indicated that EPS alone is not sufficient to develop the well-structured robust biofilm and that CabA is another key component of the <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> biofilm matrix.</p>
<p>The data presented here and bioinformatic analysis of CabA suggested that CabA is a structural protein rather than an enzymatic protein modifying or catalyzing other matrix components such as EPS to facilitate biofilm development (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cdd" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cdd</ext-link>). Exogenous addition of purified CabA was able to rescue the biofilm defect of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant only when calcium was available at the same time (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11A</xref>). The ability of exogenously provided CabA to switch the smooth colony morphology of the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant to rugose disappeared when calcium was not added to the growth media (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11B</xref>). These observations suggested that apo-CabA without calcium is not functional as a biofilm matrix component. Calcium-dependent multimerization of CabA, as shown in <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig 12B</xref>, indicated that the multimeric form of CabA could be a functional conformation which is competent as a biofilm matrix component. This calcium dependency of CabA is especially intriguing since calcium is a relatively abundant element in the environment of oyster, the natural niche and primary route of infection for <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, it is a reasonable hypothesis that calcium is an environmental cue that multimerizes CabA to the functional conformation, rendering <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> to switch from a planktonic to a sessile life style, survive in hostile environments, and reach a concentrated infective dose when consumed by humans. Supporting the hypothesis, CabA is essential for the robust structures of the <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> biofilms on oyster shells (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>).</p>
<p>It was noteworthy that calcium was still able to promote biofilm formation under the conditions in which <italic>cabA</italic> expression is limited or deficient (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g004" ref-type="fig">4C</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g011" ref-type="fig">11A</xref>). These results suggested that calcium regulates cellular functions involved in biofilm formation besides mediating the multimerization of CabA. The previous observation that calcium alters the extracellular polysaccharides to a more biofilm-proficient phase in <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> could be a possible explanation for the calcium-dependent, yet CabA-independent, biofilm formation [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p>
<p>The majority of CabA present as a monomer under conditions of low calcium shifted to multimeric form in the presence of increasing concentrations of calcium (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig 12B</xref>). However, the concentrations of calcium required for multimerization of CabA <italic>in vitro</italic> (20–50 mM) were significantly higher than those added externally to induce biofilm formation (10 mM). One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that calcium could be concentrated in the matrix by yet unknown mechanisms and the concentrations of calcium in the microenvironment where CabA multimerization occurs could be higher than those added externally for the biofilm formation experiments (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g010" ref-type="fig">10</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g011" ref-type="fig">11</xref>, and <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g014" ref-type="fig">14</xref>). To test this possibility, the matrix of biofilms was fractionated and the calcium concentration in the matrix was determined using ICP-AES. As shown in <xref rid="ppat.1005192.g013" ref-type="fig">Fig 13</xref>, the calcium concentration in the matrix was 4.8-fold (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) higher than that in the biofilm growth media, indicating that calcium could be concentrated in the matrix. Consistent with this, it has been reported that excess of calcium is accumulated and immobilized within the biofilm matrices of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p>
<p>There are several different mechanisms for structural proteins in the matrix to contribute to biofilm maturation [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recent works demonstrated that an extracellular protein TasA forms amyloid fibers that glue cells together and provide structure to the extracellular matrix in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> biofilms [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>putida</italic> large surface-associated protein LapF, and probably <italic>S</italic>. <italic>enteritidis</italic> BapA, accumulate in certain cell surface regions and interact with each other to promote aggregations of adjacent cells, which lead to microcolony formation and subsequent biofilm maturation [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, the amino acid sequence of CabA is not homologous to that of LapF and BapA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi" xlink:type="simple">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</ext-link>). Furthermore, <italic>in situ</italic> TEM analysis revealed that functional CabA irregularly diffused into the matrix rather than retained on or concentrated along the cell envelopes (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Another mechanism adopted by <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> CdrA, and <italic>V</italic>. <italic>cholerae</italic> RbmC harboring carbohydrate binding domains is that the proteins bind to extracellular polysaccharides and cross-link them to polymers. Polymerization of the polysaccharides promote aggregation of cells and thus increase structural integrity of the biofilm [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Successful formation of biofilms by co-culturing the mutants defective in the synthesis of either EPS or CabA indicates that CabA requires EPS to assemble an apparently functional matrix (<xref rid="ppat.1005192.g014" ref-type="fig">Fig 14</xref>). However, CabA does not harbor carbohydrate binding domains and share homology with any of the proteins in amino acid sequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cdd" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cdd</ext-link>). Additional work is needed to clarify precise mechanisms by which CabA enable cells to build more structured biofilms.</p>
<p>In summary, CabA is a calcium-binding protein contributing to biofilm formation in a calcium-dependent manner and secreted via functional CabB and CabC. CabA is distributed distally from the cells throughout the biofilm matrix and produced as the <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic> biofilm matures under conditions of elevated c-di-GMP. The <italic>cabA</italic> mutant was significantly defective in the development of rugose colony morphology and robust biofilms in flow cells and on oyster shells. Purified CabA, added exogenously along with calcium, was able to restore the <italic>cabA</italic> mutant abilities of forming biofilm and rugose colony morphology. Calcium binding induces conformational changes of CabA to multimeric forms and CabA can assemble a functional matrix when EPS coexist. Consequently, CabA is a calcium-binding protein functional in the extracellular matrix and essential for the development of well-structured mature biofilms and rugose colony of <italic>V</italic>. <italic>vulnificus</italic>.</p>

<p>The purified CabA (210 μM) was digested with concentrated HNO<sub>3</sub> and diluted with distilled water. The diluted CabA solution was nebulized into the plasma using MiraMist nebulizer (Burgener Research Inc., Mississauga, Canada) and the concentrations of five metal ions (Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, and Zn) were measured using ICP-AES (Optima-4300 DV, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA).

<p>ITC experiments were performed to determine calcium-binding parameters for CabA. For this purpose, the calcium-free CabA was reconstituted in 300 mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution was prepared in the same buffer. The protein and CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution were degassed by vacuum aspiration for 20 min prior to loading and titration at 25°C. The calorimetric assays were performed using a VP-ITC (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). The calcium (1.2 mM) in the syringe was titrated against the 0.024 mM CabA in the reaction cell at 25°C. The stirring speed was 270 rpm, and the thermal power was recorded every 15 s. Raw data were processed and plotted using the Origin program (version 7) supplied with the instrument.

<title>Biofilm formation</title>
<p>Biofilms were formed using the procedure developed by O’Toole and Kolter [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] with minor modifications. Briefly, each well of the 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) was inoculated with 200 μl of each culture diluted to an <italic>A</italic><sub>600</sub> 0.05 with VFMG-CF and then incubated for 24 h at 30°C without shaking. Once the planktonic cells were removed, the biofilm cells on the wall were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), and then stained with 220 μl of 1% (w/v) CV solution for 15 min at room temperature. Biofilms were quantified by elution of CV with 220 μl 100% ethanol and measurement of absorbance at 570 nm (<italic>A</italic><sub>570</sub>). When required, VFMG-CF supplemented with various amounts of CaCl<sub>2</sub>, arabinose, and/or calcium-free CabA was used.

<p>EPS was prepared following the procedures previously described by Kim <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Briefly, JN111 cells grown on LBS agar plates containing 0.02% (w/v) arabinose were suspended in PBS, and were vigorously shaken to elute EPS from cells. Cells and debris were removed by centrifugation and EPS in the supernatants was treated with RNase A (50 μg/ml), DNase I (50 μg/ ml with 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), and proteinase K (200 μg/ml). Subsequently, the remained polysaccharide fractions were extracted twice with phenol-chloroform, and precipitated with 2.5× volumes of 100% ethanol and resuspended in distilled water. EPS resuspensions were resolved using a 4% stacking SDS-PAGE, stained with Stains-All (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The gel was subsequently destained as described previously [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], and photographed using a digital camera (PowerShot SX220 HS, Canon, Tokyo, Japan).</p>

Planktonic cells were removed by rinsing gently with PBS, after which the biofilms were collected with a cell scraper (SPL) and resuspended in PBS. Biofilms were disrupted by sonication (VC130 Ultrasonic Processor, Sonics &amp; Materials, Inc., Newtown, CT) and then fractionated into cell fractions (pellets) and matrix fractions (supernatants) by centrifugation as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The calcium concentrations in the biofilm matrix (equivalent to 30 μl) and growth media were determined using ICP-AES (Optima-4300 DV, PerkinElmer) as described above. For Western blot analysis, proteins (10 μg) from the lysates of cell fractions and concentrates of matrix fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].

<title>Flow cells, CSLM, and SEM</title>
<p>For structural analyses, biofilms of the strains were formed in flow cell chambers as described elsewhere [<xref rid="ppat.1005192.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Glass coverslips were attached on polycarbonate flow cells with individual channel dimensions of 1 × 4 × 40 mm.

Then VFMG-CF supplemented with 0.01% (w/v) arabinose and 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> was flowed at a constant rate of 8 ml/h using a Minipuls Evolution peristaltic pump (Gilson, Villiers, France) to grow biofilm for 3 d. The flow cell chambers with grown biofilms were photographed using a digital camera (PowerShot SX220 HS, Canon).</p>
<p>For CSLM analysis, biofilms on the coverslips were stained with LIVE/DEAD <italic>Bac</italic>Light Viability Kit containing SYTO9 and propidium iodide (Invitrogen) for 15 min in the dark and visualized by CSLM (LSM710, Zeiss, Jena, Germany).

Fixed biofilms were washed with distilled water, dehydrated in a series of increasing concentrations of ethanol (50, 70, 80, 90, and 100%), and then dried in hexamethyldisilazane. Dried biofilms were mounted on an aluminum stub, coated with platinum using a sputter coater (BAL-TEC SCD 005, BAL-TEC AG, Balzers, Liechtenstein), and visualized using SEM (Supra 55VP, Zeiss).

<title>CD and size-exclusion chromatography analysis</title>
<p>CD spectroscopy was used to evaluate the effect of calcium on the CabA conformation. The calcium-free CabA (0.05 mg/ml) in 300 mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 was subjected to far-UV CD measurements at 25°C using a 1-mm path length quartz cuvette in a Jasco J-815 CD spectrometer (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). The CabA protein was incubated with 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> for 1 h at room temperature, and its CD spectra were measured under the same conditions. CD Spectra were acquired over the wavelength range of 200–260 nm and converted into mean residue ellipticity (MRE, degree cm<sup>2</sup>/dmol). Blank spectra of the buffer without the protein were subtracted.</p>
<p>Calcium-induced conformational change of CabA was further assessed by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 10/300 GL gel filtration column (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) installed on an AKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare). The multimeric CabA obtained with 100 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> was serially diluted to various calcium concentrations. The diluted samples were then injected onto the pre-equilibrated column with 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and corresponding concentrations of calcium and eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min at room temperature. The effluent was monitored by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. Bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) were used as the molecular weight standards.</p>
