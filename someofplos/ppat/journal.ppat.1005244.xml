<abstract>
<p>Transglutaminase (TG) catalyzes protein-protein crosslinking, which has important and diverse roles in vertebrates and invertebrates. Here we demonstrate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> TG crosslinks drosocrystallin, a peritrophic matrix protein, to form a stable fiber structure on the gut peritrophic matrix. RNA interference (RNAi) of the <italic>TG</italic> gene was highly lethal in flies and induced apoptosis of gut epithelial cells after oral infection with <italic>Pseudomonas entomophila</italic>. Moreover, AprA, a metalloprotease secreted by <italic>P</italic>. <italic>entomophila</italic>, digested non-crosslinked drosocrystallin fibers, but not drosocrystallin fibers crosslinked by TG. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments using recombinant drosocrystallin and monalysin proteins demonstrated that monalysin, a pore-forming exotoxin of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>entomophila</italic>, was adsorbed on the crosslinked drosocrystallin fibers in the presence of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>entomophila</italic> culture supernatant. In addition, gut-specific <italic>TG</italic>-RNAi flies had a shorter lifespan than control flies after ingesting <italic>P</italic>. <italic>entomophila</italic>, whereas the lifespan after ingesting <italic>AprA</italic>-knockout <italic>P</italic>. <italic>entomophila</italic> was at control levels. We conclude that drosocrystallin fibers crosslinked by TG, but not non-crosslinked drosocrystallin fibers, form an important physical barrier against exotoxins of invading pathogenic microbes.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Intestinal homeostasis is ensured by a subtle balance between bacteria and host immunity. Gut epithelial barriers, such as the mucus layer in mammals and the peritrophic matrix in invertebrates, have a protective function for the host, as they are impermeable to invading intestinal microbes. Here we found that, in the fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, transglutaminase (TG), a molecular glue involved in protein-protein covalent bond formation, is essential for peritrophic matrix formation by converting the peritrophic protein drosocrystallin into a stable fiber-like structure and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria. Knockdown of the <italic>TG</italic> gene led to increased permeability of the peritrophic matrix and greatly increased the susceptibility to a toxic bacterial protease. TG contributes to form a stable fiber-like barrier on the peritrophic matrix and increase tolerance to pathogenic microorganisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gut epithelia are the first line of defense against invading microorganisms. <italic>Drosophila</italic> has several gut defense systems, including the production of antimicrobial peptides [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and reactive oxygen species [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], peritrophic matrix formation [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and stem cell activation for cell renewal [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Transglutaminase (TG) is involved in the regulation of antimicrobial peptide production and peritrophic matrix formation [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. TG catalyzes the isopeptide bond formation between lysine and glutamine residues, and has diverse physiologic roles in vertebrates and invertebrates [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila</italic> TG is involved in cuticular formation [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and hemolymph coagulation, which traps invading pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The concept of hemolymph coagulation in invertebrates as a part of the early innate immune system has been extended to vertebrates [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Recently, we reported that systemic and gut-specific <italic>TG</italic>-knockdown flies have a shorter lifespan than control flies, concomitant with severe apoptosis of cells in the gut epithelium [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, we found that TG crosslinks N-terminal Relish in the immune deficiency pathway to suppress antimicrobial peptide expression, thereby enabling immune tolerance against gut microbes. Further, RNA interference (RNAi) of the <italic>TG</italic> gene causes peritrophic matrix defects and penetration of dextran beads from the gut lumen (endoperitrophic space) into the ectoperitrophic space [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p>
<p>The peritrophic matrix in insects is a non-cellular sieve-like structure that lines the midgut epithelium, and comprises chitin fibrils and chitin-binding proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This matrix has a role analogous to that of the mucosal layer of the vertebrate intestine, and is thought to support digestion and provide protection against abrasive food particles and enteric pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The <italic>drosocrystallin</italic> gene, which encodes a 52-kDa glycoprotein with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding ability, was originally identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> eyes, but its function was not clear [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Drosocrystallin was recently reported to have an important role in protecting against entomopathogenic bacteria such as <italic>Pseudomonas entomophila</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Drosocrystallin expression is induced upon oral infection by bacteria, and the peritrophic matrix of <italic>drosocrystallin</italic>-knockout flies is more permeable than that of wild-type flies, demonstrating the essential role of drosocrystallin in peritrophic matrix formation [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Drosocrystallin is a secreted glycoprotein containing a chitin-binding R&amp;R motif [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Cuticular chitin-binding proteins in horseshoe crabs are substrates for TG [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], suggesting that drosocrystallin could be a potential TG substrate. Here we demonstrate that TG enhances the structural strength of the peritrophic matrix by crosslinking drosocrystallin fibers, and that the crosslinked drosocrystallin fibers, but not non-crosslinked drosocrystallin fibers, are essential for protection against exotoxins secreted by gut-invading pathogenic bacteria.</p>

<title>Drosocrystallin is crosslinked by TG in vitro and in vivo</title>
<p>Wild-type drosocrystallin and a lysine-to-arginine substituted mutant (KR) were prepared in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. To examine the functional activity of these recombinants, we evaluated chitin-binding activity. Both recombinants clearly bound to chitin (<xref rid="ppat.1005244.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, left and right panels). The recombinants were then incubated with TG in the presence of monodansylcadaverine (MDC) or biotin pentylamine, an amino-substrate of TG. MDC was incorporated into these recombinants in a time-dependent manner (<xref rid="ppat.1005244.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, left panel). MDC was incorporated into the KR mutant at the same rate as in the wild-type recombinant (<xref rid="ppat.1005244.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>, right panel), because the amino-substrate is incorporated in glutamine residues. The biotin pentylamine-incorporated recombinants were also detected using streptavidin, but incorporation was inhibited in the presence of a TG inhibitor, EDTA (<xref rid="ppat.1005244.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). In wild-type drosocrystallin, a protein band was observed on the stacking gel, but not in the KR mutant in the absence of MDC and EDTA (<xref rid="ppat.1005244.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), indicating that drosocrystallin is covalently crosslinked by TG to form homopolymers. To clarify the crosslinking profile of drosocrystallin <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated systemic <italic>TG</italic>-knockdown flies (<italic>Da&gt;TG IR</italic>). Western blotting using anti-drosocrystallin antibody revealed a protein band on the stacking gel in the gut of control flies (<italic>Da&gt;+</italic>), but not <italic>TG</italic>-knockdown flies (<xref rid="ppat.1005244.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>), indicating that drosocrystallin was covalently crosslinked by TG <italic>in vivo</italic>. In sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), the non-glycosylated wild-type recombinant expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and intact drosocrystallin in the gut had apparent molecular masses of 52 kDa and 75 kDa, respectively (<xref rid="ppat.1005244.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Wild-type drosocrystallin (WT), the KR mutant (KR), or bovine serum albumin (BSA) was incubated with chitin, and each fraction (Fr) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 10% slab gels (left panel). The intensity of each fraction relative to that of the input was summed as the bound fraction. Bars indicate the mean and standard deviations of experiments performed in triplicate (right panel). BSA was used as a negative control. Open bars, unbound fraction; closed bars, bound fraction. (B) Wild-type drosocrystallin (WT) or the KR mutant (KR) was incubated with MDC in the presence of TG, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 10% slab gels. The proteins were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB), and the MDC-incorporated protein was detected by the emission intensity of the dansyl group. Data are representative of three independent experiments (left panel). The relative emission intensity of each fraction compared to that of CBB-stained protein was calculated using ImageJ software (right panel). (C) Wild-type drosocrystallin (WT) or the KR mutant (KR) was incubated with or without biotin pentylamine (BPA) in the presence of TG, and subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% slab gels. Incorporation of BPA was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Loaded recombinant proteins were detected by Western blotting with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-6× His tag antibody. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments.</p>

<p>To identify the pathogenic protease(s) involved in the degradation of non-crosslinked drosocrystallin, the culture supernatant from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>entomophila</italic> was fractionated by gel filtration, and wild-type drosocrystallin was incubated with each fraction. The non-crosslinked recombinant was not detected in the fractions (Nos. 18–36) by Western blotting, possibly due to proteolytic digestion (<xref rid="ppat.1005244.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Metalloprotease AprA [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and three proteases with unknown function, including MucD, C56, and PMP, were identified from one fraction (No. 27) by mass spectrometry, and AprA was the most abundant protease in this fraction (<xref rid="ppat.1005244.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Therefore, we purified AprA from a fraction (No. 26), as described in the Materials and Methods. Wild-type drosocrystallin was completely degraded by the purified AprA (<xref rid="ppat.1005244.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). To confirm the involvement of AprA in the digestion of drosocrystallin, culture supernatant without AprA was prepared using <italic>AprA</italic>-knockout <italic>P</italic>. <italic>entomophila</italic>. The resulting supernatant did not significantly degrade wild-type drosocrystallin (<xref rid="ppat.1005244.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>, upper and lower panels), clearly indicating that AprA is a key protease for the degradation of non-crosslinked drosocrystallin.</p>

To determine whether drosocrystallin forms fibers or a mesh by protein-protein crosslinking of TG activity, wild-type drosocrystallin was incubated on cover glass under several conditions and observed by immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref rid="ppat.1005244.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Interestingly, fiber-like structures were observed in the absence of TG, but the fibers were not detected in the presence of EDTA, indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces non-covalent self-association of drosocrystallin (<xref rid="ppat.1005244.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). This finding is consistent with a previous finding that drosocrystallin exhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding ability [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and suggests that Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required not only for TG activation, but also for non-covalent fiber formation of drosocrystallin. To clarify the importance of covalent crosslinking of drosocrystallin mediated by TG, the effect of culture supernatant including protease AprA from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>entomophila</italic> on the stability of drosocrystallin fibers was observed with or without active TG. In the absence of active TG, the fiber structure of wild-type drosocrystallin gradually collapsed in proportion to the amount of the culture supernatant from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>entomophila</italic> and the fluorescence intensity of the fibers decreased further (<xref rid="ppat.1005244.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). On the other hand, in the presence of active TG, the fiber structure and fluorescence intensity of drosocrystallin were not affected by culture supernatant of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>entomophila</italic>. These findings suggest that TG-mediated covalent crosslinking of drosocrystallin is required for the protection against proteolytic digestion. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>entomophila</italic> secretes another exotoxin, monalysin, that acts as a pore-forming toxin against cell membranes, causing host cell death [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To examine whether the crosslinked fibers of drosocrystallin protect against penetration of monalysin into the peritrophic matrix, crosslinked or non-crosslinked fibers of wild-type drosocrystallin were mixed with wild-type monalysin in the presence or absence of the culture supernatant, and both recombinants were observed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Wild-type monalysin colocalized with the crosslinked fibers of wild-type drosocrystallin (<xref rid="ppat.1005244.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>, left panels of <italic>Pe</italic> sup +). In contrast, the non-crosslinked fibers in the absence of TG were degraded by proteases in the culture supernatant and wild-type monalysin did not colocalize with wild-type drosocrystallin (<xref rid="ppat.1005244.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>, right panels of <italic>Pe</italic> sup +). In the absence of the culture supernatant, however, wild-type monalysin colocalized with both the TG-dependent crosslinked fibers and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced non-covalent associated fibers of wild-type drosocrystallin (<xref rid="ppat.1005244.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>, left and right panels of <italic>Pe</italic> sup −). These findings indicate that the non-covalent fiber formation of drosocrystallin leads to co-localization of monalysin and that the protease-resistant drosocrystallin fibers crosslinked by TG, but not non-crosslinked drosocrystallin fibers, trap monalysin released from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>entomophila</italic> in the presence of proteases such as metalloprotease AprA.</p>

These data indicate that TG is involved in host defense in the fly gut after infection with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>entomophila</italic> to preserve the proteolytic digestion of drosocrystallin.

Flies injected with or ingesting <italic>P</italic>. <italic>entomophila</italic> have a shorter lifespan than untreated flies, because AprA facilitates bacterial survival by degrading antimicrobial peptides produced by host immunity [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and activates monalysin by cleaving the N-terminal pro-peptide [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Drosocrystallin non-covalently self-associated to form fiber-like structures in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Non-crosslinked fibers were not stable and were degraded more quickly by AprA than the crosslinked fibers. TG stabilized the drosocrystallin fibers through intermolecular crosslinking. Such a crosslinking reaction could "mask" potential proteolytic cleavage sites of AprA. Peritrophic matrix proteins, such as insect intestinal mucin and chitin-binding proteins containing multiple chitin-binding domains, are proposed to form a bridge-like structure on chitin fibers on the peritrophic matrix in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>ni</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. There is no genetic evidence for involvement of these peritrophic matrix proteins with multiple chitin-binding domains in peritrophic matrix formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but the TG-catalyzed crosslinked fibers could promote the formation of a rigid peritrophic matrix structure to protect against exotoxins. Importantly, flies die within 5 h after injection of purified AprA into the hemocoel [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Ingestion of a high concentration of AprA has little effect on fly survival, and thus AprA itself is not critical for the virulence of naturally infecting <italic>P</italic>. <italic>entomophila</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These findings suggest that the peritrophic matrix inhibits the penetration of AprA secreted by <italic>P</italic>. <italic>entomophila</italic> from the gut lumen into the ectoperitrophic space. In addition, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran-feeding assays performed in our previous study indicated increased permeability of the peritrophic matrix in systemic <italic>TG</italic>-RNAi flies [<xref rid="ppat.1005244.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the present paper, we did not examine the survival of gut-specific <italic>TG</italic>-knockdown flies after ingesting monalysin and/or AprA, but the TG-mediated crosslinking of drosocrystallin in the peritrophic matrix clearly reduced AprA-mediated peritrophic matrix damage and blocked the movement of monalysin and other virulent factor(s) from the endoperitrophic space into the ectoperitrophic space. The drosocrystallin fibers crosslinked by TG, but not non-crosslinked drosocrystallin fibers, appear to form an important physical barrier against exotoxins of invading pathogenic microbes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gut.</p>
