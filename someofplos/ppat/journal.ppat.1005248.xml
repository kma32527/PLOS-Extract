<abstract>
<p><italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic>, the causative agent of Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis (HGA), is an obligately intracellular α-proteobacterium that is transmitted by <italic>Ixodes</italic> spp ticks. However, the pathogen is not transovarially transmitted between tick generations and therefore needs to survive in both a mammalian host and the arthropod vector to complete its life cycle. To adapt to different environments, pathogens rely on differential gene expression as well as the modification of proteins and other molecules. Random transposon mutagenesis of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> resulted in an insertion within the coding region of an <italic>o</italic>-methyltransferase (<italic>omt</italic>) family 3 gene. In wild-type bacteria, expression of <italic>omt</italic> was up-regulated during binding to tick cells (ISE6) at 2 hr post-inoculation, but nearly absent by 4 hr p.i. Gene disruption reduced bacterial binding to ISE6 cells, and the mutant bacteria that were able to enter the cells were arrested in their replication and development. Analyses of the proteomes of wild-type versus mutant bacteria during binding to ISE6 cells identified Major Surface Protein 4 (Msp4), but also hypothetical protein APH_0406, as the most differentially methylated. Importantly, two glutamic acid residues (the targets of the OMT) were methyl-modified in wild-type Msp4, whereas a single asparagine (not a target of the OMT) was methylated in APH_0406. <italic>In vitro</italic> methylation assays demonstrated that recombinant OMT specifically methylated Msp4. Towards a greater understanding of the overall structure and catalytic activity of the OMT, we solved the <italic>apo</italic> (PDB_ID:4OA8), the S-adenosine homocystein-bound (PDB_ID:4OA5), the SAH-Mn<sup>2+</sup> bound (PDB_ID:4PCA), and SAM- Mn<sup>2+</sup> bound (PDB_ID:4PCL) X-ray crystal structures of the enzyme. Here, we characterized a mutation in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> that affected the ability of the bacteria to productively infect cells from its natural vector. Nevertheless, due to the lack of complementation, we cannot rule out secondary mutations.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Since its discovery in 1994, Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis (HGA) has become the second most commonly diagnosed tick-borne disease in the US, and it is gaining importance in several countries in Europe. HGA is caused by <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic>, a bacterium transmitted by black-legged ticks and their relatives. Whereas several of the molecules and processes leading to infection of human cells have been identified, little is known about their counterparts in the tick. We analyzed the effects of a mutation in a gene encoding an <italic>o-</italic>methyltransferase that is involved in methylation of an outer membrane protein. The mutation of the OMT appears to be important for the ability of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> to adhere to, invade, and replicate in tick cells. Several tests including binding assays, microscopic analysis of the infection cycle within tick cells, gene expression assays, and biochemical assays using recombinant OMT strongly suggested that the mutation of the <italic>o-</italic>methyltransferase gene arrested the growth and development of this bacterium within tick cells. Proteomic analyses identified several possible OMT substrates, and in vitro methylation assays using recombinant <italic>o-</italic>methyltransferase identified an outer membrane protein, Msp4, as a specifically methyl-modified target. Our results indicated that methylation was important for infection of tick cells by <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic>, and suggested possible strategies to block transmission of this emerging pathogen. The solved crystal structure of the <italic>o-</italic>methyltransferase will further stimulate the search for small molecule inhibitors that could break the tick transmission cycle of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> in nature.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic> is an obligately intracellular bacterium classified in the order <italic>Rickettsiales</italic>, and is the causative agent of Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis (HGA) [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. HGA is characterized by high fevers, rigors, generalized myalgias, and severe headache. It is a potentially life-threatening disease, with 36% of patients diagnosed with HGA requiring hospitalization, 7% needing urgent care, and mortality of ~1% [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The incidence of HGA has been increasing steadily, from 348 identified cases in 2000 when it first became reportable to the CDC, to 1761 cases in 2010 [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and 2,782 reported cases in 2013 [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Similar trends are evident in other countries in Europe and Asia [reviewed in [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]]. In addition, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> infects domestic animals such as dogs, cats, and horses, as well as wild mammals from deer and wolves to various rodents [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> is transmitted by ticks of the <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic> complex, with <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> and <italic>Ixodes pacificus</italic> being the most important vectors in the USA [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Transovarial transmission does not occur in these ticks, and has only been reported in tick species and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> strains that are not implicated in human disease [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The natural transmission cycle involves acquisition of the pathogen from small wild rodents by tick larvae, and transstadial transmission to nymphs and adults that may infect a new mammalian host during a subsequent bloodmeal. Therefore, the ability of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> to cycle between ticks and mammalian hosts is imperative for bacterial survival in nature [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The development of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> in <italic>Ixodes</italic> sp. vector ticks remains unknown but has been described in tick cell culture where it is biphasic [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The time required for <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> to complete development in ISE6 cells differs from that observed in HL-60 and endothelial cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Adhesion to ISE6 cells started at 30 min p.i., and by 1 hr p.i the bacteria were attached to the tick cell membrane, initiating the process of endocytosis, which was probably driven by receptor-mediated interactions. By comparison, in HL-60 cell culture, &gt;70% of bacteria were observed binding to host cells in the first 40 min p.i., and at that time, 26% of the bacteria had been internalized [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Internalization in tick cells began at 2 hr p.i. and was complete by 4 hr p.i., whereas in HL-60 cell culture, only 45.5% of the bacteria had entered the cells at this time point [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Replication by binary fission started by 8 hr p.i. in tick cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] whereas in HL-60 cells only a few bacteria had turned into the reticulate form by 12 hr p.i. and initiated replication [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, many of the molecular events involved in the infection of mammalian cells are known [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but much less is known in the tick counterpart [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Studies to understand vector-pathogen interactions have focused on tick responses and tick factors important for successful establishment of the pathogen in ticks [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], but <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> genes and proteins that are important for development in tick cells and ticks remain largely unidentified. Some studies have examined gene expression of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> during infection of <italic>I</italic>. <italic>scapularis</italic> ticks or <italic>I</italic>. <italic>scapularis</italic> ISE6 cells, but have focused on certain periods, such as transmission feeding or late phases of replication [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As a result, little is known about the proteins, and their modifications, necessary for the early phases of infection of tick vector cells by <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic>. Survival in dissimilar hosts such as the arthropod vector and the mammal that present important biological differences requires rapid adaptation of bacteria, and involves proteins and other molecules that are differentially expressed or produced in response to host-specific cues [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, the identification of such factors is crucial to our understanding of the biology of this important pathogen.</p>
<p>Analyses of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> gene expression and proteomics [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] may fail to identify proteins that are not abundant or not directly involved in infection but still play an important role. The intracellular nature of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> has made it difficult to study the function of genes involved in intracellular invasion and replication using genetic techniques such as homologous recombination. Nevertheless, random mutagenesis of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> using the <italic>Himar1</italic> transposase system [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] has become an important tool to probe gene function in these and related bacteria [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Here, we analyzed a mutant, referred to as ΔOMT, with a transposition into genomic locus APH_0584 that contains a gene encoding a member of family 3 S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet or SAM)-dependent <italic>o</italic>-methyltransferases. Transcription of genomic locus APH_0584 was barely detected in HL-60, HMEC-1 or ISE6 cells during late phases of infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the mutation of this gene rendered the bacteria unable to efficiently colonize <italic>I</italic>. <italic>scapularis</italic> (ISE6) cells.</p>
<p>Methyltransferases are involved in important bacterial activities such as cell signaling, cell invasion, and gene expression, as well as in metabolic pathways and pathogenesis [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. They participate in the modification of membrane components, cofactors, signaling and defense compounds [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and have been linked to virulence in several bacteria [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], fungi [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. OmpB proteins from several rickettsial pathogens are methylated at multiple residues by lysine methyltransferases [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], although recombinant OmpB produced by <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> in the absence of a lysine methyltransferase has been shown to mediate adhesion and invasion of HeLa cells in a Ku70-dependent manner [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Methylation of glutamic acid residues in the outer membrane protein OmpL32 of <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> is thought to be involved in its virulence and ability to colonize liver and kidney cells in hamsters [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. To gain insights into its overall structure and the interaction of the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum o</italic>-methyltransferase with cofactors, we solved the crystal structure of the <italic>apo</italic>-enzyme, the enzyme bound to S-adenosine homocysteine (SAH), to SAH and manganese, and to SAM and manganese. This revealed large differences with the nearest homolog in the PDB (<italic>o</italic>-methyltransferase from the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp.; PDB ID: 3CBG). Here, we analyzed the phenotypic and proteomic changes that characterized ΔOMT, and present evidence that the <italic>o</italic>-methyltransferase is involved in adherence to and necessary for replication of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> in tick cells.</p>

<title>Disruption of aph_0584 encoding an OMT results in phenotypic changes</title>
<p>The ΔOMT, selected and maintained in HL-60 cells, was unable to grow in ISE6 cells. The mutant expressed the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFPuv) from a <italic>Himar1</italic> transposon [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Southern blot analysis identified a single insertion site (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Digestion of ΔOMT DNA with <italic>Bgl</italic>II yielded a single band hybridizing to the probe, suggesting a clonal population (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>), although <italic>EcoR</italic>V yielded several smaller bands that were most likely due to incomplete digestion. Recovery of the transposon along with flanking sequences from ΔOMT DNA by restriction enzyme digestion and cloning indicated transposition into <italic>aph_0584</italic> (Gene ID: 3930223; <italic>o</italic>-methyltransferase 3 family member) between nucleotide positions 612707–612706 of the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> strain HZ genome sequence ([<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; <xref rid="ppat.1005248.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).

<title>Determination of transposon insertion site in ΔOMT.</title>
<p>A) Southern blot of ΔOMT DNA hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled probe specific for <italic>gfp</italic><sub>uv</sub> encoded by the transposon (black arrows) to determine the number of insertion sites in the population. From left to right, lanes contain DNA from the following samples: First lane DNA from wild type bacteria digested with <italic>Bgl</italic>II, (negative control); second lane, ΔOMT DNA digested with <italic>Bgl</italic>II; third lane, ΔOMT DNA digested with <italic>EcoR</italic>V. The second and third lanes presented a single band at around 7 Kb, indicating a single insertion event in the population. The fourth lane contains 1 pg of the undigested DNA encoding <italic>gfp</italic><sub>uv</sub> and <italic>aadA</italic> (positive control). B) Graphic representation of the insertion site of the transposon encoding the Amtr promoter (green), the <italic>gfp</italic><sub>uv</sub> gene (yellow), and the spectinomycin resistance gene <italic>aadA</italic> (yellow), within the <italic>himar</italic> repeats (light blue). The coding region of the <italic>o</italic>-methyltransferase gene <italic>APH_0584</italic> (purple) was interrupted at position 612707–612706 (blue arrows). Red arrows represent the direction of transcription for each gene within the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> genome, and the direction of transcription for the inserted genes (blue arrow). Transposition occurred ~1600 bp upstream from the sensor kinase gene (cckA: APH_0582) and ~800 bp downstream from a hypothetical gene encoding APH_0585.</p>

<p>To determine the mechanism whereby the mutation affected the phenotype of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic>, we compared wild-type and mutant bacteria with respect to their ability to invade and replicate in tick and mammalian host cells, determined the timing of wild-type OMT expression and its localization, identified the protein methylated by the enzyme as well as cofactors, and solved the crystal structure of the OMT. First, we analyzed the growth of the mutant in HL-60 and ISE6 cells and compared it to wild-type bacteria under the same conditions. The ΔOMT was not able to replicate in ISE6 cells and qPCR showed that <italic>msp5</italic> (a single copy gene used as a proxy for bacterial numbers) copy numbers decreased significantly over a 12-day period (P = 0.008) (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). This was in contrast to the behavior of ΔOMT bacteria in HL-60 cells, in which they were able to multiply in a manner comparable to wild-type bacteria (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, P = 0.504).

<title>Omt mutation and AdOx treatment reduced <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> binding to ISE6 cells</title>
<p>Because of the rapid decline of ΔOMT numbers noticeable already during the first 24 hr of incubation with ISE6 cells, we tested the ability of the mutant to bind to ISE6. There was a significant reduction (&gt;50%) in binding of ΔOMT (t-value = -4.1011; P = 0.0001) to ISE6 cells from 0.3 bacteria per cell in the wild type to 0.12 mutant bacteria per cell (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). To support these results, an inhibitor of SAM-dependent methyltransferases was used to reproduce the effects of the lack of methylation brought about by the disruption of <italic>omt</italic> on binding of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> to ISE6 cells. Wild-type bacteria were pre-incubated with 20 nM, 30 nM, and 40 nM of adenosine periodate (AdOx) for 1 hr before addition to ISE6 cells and incubated for another hr; untreated bacteria served as controls. All concentrations of AdOx affected the ability of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> to bind to ISE6 cells significantly (P&lt;0.001) (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). In controls, an average of 0.529 bacteria bound per cell, compared to ΔOMT with only 0.156 bacteria per cell. 20 nM AdOx decreased binding to 0.307 bacteria per cell, which was less than the reduction in attachment observed in ΔOMT (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). However, as the concentration of AdOx increased to 30 nM and 40 nM, the effects were stronger than in ΔOMT with only 0.093 and 0.086 bacteria bound per cell, respectively, and these differences were statistically significant when compared to the ΔOMT and the 20 nM AdOx concentration (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). These results corroborated the effects of the inhibition of methylation due to the mutation of <italic>omt</italic> on <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> binding. The greater inhibition of bacterial binding when using 30 nM and 40 nM of AdOx was probably due to inhibition of other methyltransferases. To test this hypothesis, we pre-incubated ΔOMT bacteria with AdOx before addition to ISE6 cells, as described for wild-type bacteria. Incubation of the ΔOMT with 20 nM and 40 nM did not significantly decrease binding to ISE6 cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>), suggesting that no other methyltransferases were involved in tick cell invasion.</p>

<title>Omt is up-regulated during binding and internalization, and the protein localizes to bacteria interacting with tick cells</title>

<p>Because <italic>omt</italic> expression correlated with binding and entry of the bacteria to ISE6 cells, and the mutation of this gene affected the ability of the bacteria to bind to these cells, we investigated the localization of the protein during this step in cell infection. Mouse antiserum against recombinant OMT (rOMT) was produced to label the protein during binding of wild-type <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> to ISE6 (2 hr p.i.), using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). OMT was detected with mouse anti-rOMT serum followed by incubation with anti-mouse IgG conjugated to AlexaFluor647 (red fluorescence). All bacteria were labeled with dog anti-anaplasma serum followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-dog IgG (green fluorescence). Bacteria interacting with ISE6 showed strong OMT expression while bacteria interacting with HL-60 showed only slight expression (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). This was in agreement with the 34-fold up-regulation of the gene seen by qRT-PCR during adhesion to ISE6 cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>).

<title>ΔOMT bacteria are internalized but unable to replicate within tick cells</title>
<p>We conducted a time course comparison of wild-type versus ΔOMT bacteria to identify the stage at which the infection process failed. To increase the chances of detecting differences between the intracellular development of the ΔOMT and wild-type bacteria, we performed an optimized binding assay in which a sparse monolayer of adherent ISE6 cells growing in MatTek dishes was exposed to numerous bacteria (100–300 bacteria/cell) and washed gently to maximize retention of bacteria bound to the cells. This is in contrast with our previous assay that used suspended ISE6 cells, a lower multiplicity of infection (MOI), and vigorous washes so that only strongly bound bacteria remained, which increased the sensitivity of the assay but made it difficult to track intracellular development of ΔOMT.</p>
<p>The development of the ΔOMT was compared to wild-type bacteria using confocal microscopy of fixed and immunofluorescently labeled ISE6 cells in MatTek dishes after 1 hr of exposure to bacteria, and subsequently on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 10. With this method there were no differences observed in binding or internalization between the ΔOMT and wild-type bacteria (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). However, by 44 hr, wild-type bacteria started to form morulae, whereas ΔOMT bacteria remained singly within the cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). By days 3 and 4, the wild-type bacteria had formed large morulae (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>) and on days 5–10, wild-type infections had become asynchronous, with bacteria from lysed cells infecting new cells while other cells harbored large morulae (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F–6H</xref>). ΔOMT bacteria, however, never developed morulae during the 10 days of observation. Only single bacteria were observed within the infected cells throughout (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D–6H</xref>), suggesting that the mutant bacteria were unable to replicate and form morulae within the infected cells even though they were successfully internalized. Observation of ΔOMT bacteria by confocal microscopy identified their location as intracellular.</p>

Subsequently, unbound bacteria were washed away and samples were taken at the indicated times post infection. Panels for each sampling time show wild-type bacteria at left, and mutant at right. A) 1 hr, B) 20 hr, C) 44 hr, D) 3 days, E) 4 days, F) 5 days, G) 7 days, and H) 10 days. Bacteria were labeled with FITC (green), cell nuclei were labeled with DAPI (blue), and samples were viewed by confocal microscopy to compare development of bacteria within ISE6 cells. Saturated binding allowed sufficient numbers of ApΔOMT to be internalized (1 hr panels) so that their development could be visually tracked for 10 days. From 44 hr through 10 days, small to very large morulae developed in ApHZ, while the ΔOMT persisted as individual bacteria within the ISE6 cells and never formed morulae.

<p>To confirm that in fact the ΔOMT bacteria resided inside the tick cells, we performed a trypsin-protection assay, similar to those used to remove uninternalized bacteria and/or beads from cells to examine binding proteins in <italic>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</italic>, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic>, and <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Cultures were used four days after inoculation with either mutant or wild-type bacteria, when wild-type bacteria had formed large intracellular morulae (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A–S2C, S2B and S2C Fig</xref>), whereas mutants persisted as individual intracellular bacteria (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2D, S2E and S2F Fig</xref>). Cultures were treated with trypsin once (wild-type and mutant) or twice (mutant only) to remove any extracellular bacteria, and untrypsinized cells scraped off the growth substrate were used for comparison. As expected, neither mechanical scraping (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>) nor trypsinization affected the wild-type morulae (arrow heads) already formed within ISE6 cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C Fig</xref>). Similarly, when ISE6 cultures that had been exposed to ΔOMT bacteria for four days were scraped off the flask (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2D Fig</xref>), trypsinized once (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2E Fig</xref>) or twice (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2F Fig</xref>), there was no effect on the bacteria, confirming that they were located intracellularly as also indicated by confocal microscopy. As observed in the previous experiment, mutant bacteria remained as individuals (arrows) within the infected cells and were unable to develop to morulae. Additional controls demonstrated that wild-type bacteria adherent to ISE6 cells for 1 hr were removed from the cells by trypsinization (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2G and S2H Fig</xref>), another indication that single ΔOMT bacteria visualized four days p.i. had been internalized.

They were not detected in panels A, B, and C because the brightness of the large wild-type morulae required a shorter exposure during image acquisition than that used to image ΔOMT. Anti-nuclear antibodies have been detected in dogs infected with vector-borne pathogens (Smith et al. 2004), explaining the reactivity of the dog’s antiserum with host cell nuclei.</p>

<title>Mutation of omt affects abundance of several <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> proteins</title>
<p>To globally identify proteins that were differentially represented in the ΔOMT compared with the wild-type bacteria, we used a proteomic approach based on iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation) technology. Peptides in each sample were labeled with different isotopic tags of known mass to quantify the relative abundance of the proteins in each sample. Both ΔOMT and wild-type bacteria were incubated with ISE6 cells for 4 hr at 34°C. Proteins were extracted from bacteria released from host cells, and triplicate samples were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In each replicate, multiple <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> proteins were identified that appeared to be differentially abundant in the mutant (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>). Of these, 23 <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> proteins (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were identified as differentially abundant in all replicates: five proteins were less abundant (hypothetical protein APH_0406, major surface protein 4, anti-oxidant AhpCTSA family protein, and ankyrin (GI88607707)), and 19 appeared more abundant (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Hypothetical protein APH_0406, and major surface protein 4 (Msp4) presented the lowest relative expression ratios (both &lt;0.2), indicating that they were highly expressed in wild-type bacteria during binding to ISE6 cells compared to the mutant (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Several proteins known to be involved in infection of mammalian cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], or highly expressed in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> replicating in human cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], were more abundant in the mutant (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These proteins included several membrane proteins (P44-18ES, an OmpA family protein, P44-1 Outer membrane protein, an OMP85 family outer membrane protein, and hypothetical protein APH_0405) as well as stress response proteins (co-chaperone GrpE, chaperonin GroEL, and chaperone DnaK) (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This suggested that, unlike wild-type <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic>, the ΔOMT failed to respond to interaction with ISE6 cells in a host cell specific manner, and as a result, the repertoire of proteins in its outer membrane remained unchanged. It is also possible that lack of OMT activity disrupted an environmentally responsive regulatory mechanism or sensor that prepares <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> for changes in hosts. Correct quantification of proteins by iTRAQ is problematic (Shirran and Blotting 2010), and to confirm these results, we examined transcription of several genes that were more abundant in ΔOMT than wild-type during bacterial adhesion to tick cells (based on the iTRAQ data) using qRT-PCR. RNA was isolated from ΔOMT and wild-type bacteria purified from HL-60 cells during late stages of infection to investigate transcription before exposure to ISE6 cells, and after a 2 hr incubation with ISE6 cells for comparison. In HL-60 cells, genes encoding OmpA, p44-18ES, and APH_0404 were strongly up-regulated 19-, 267-, and 5-fold, respectively compared to values obtained after 2 hr in ISE6 cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Genes encoding APH_0405 and cytochrome C oxidase subunit II were not regulated (1.5 and 1.3 fold average difference, respectively (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>)), whereas <italic>msp4</italic> expression was down-regulated (0.0033 fold average down-regulation in both the ΔOMT and wild-type bacteria) compared to wild-type bacteria in ISE6 cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Thus, the transcript levels mirrored the protein expression detected using iTRAQ, and suggested that the ΔOMT was not able to change gene expression to adapt to conditions in ISE6. In HL-60, the ΔOMT and wild-type bacteria had similar transcript levels, indicating that the mutation did not affect the expression of these genes.</p>

<title>Identification of possible OMT substrates by iTRAQ</title>

<p>Fifteen tick host cell proteins displayed reduced methylation when inoculated with the ΔOMT as compared to wild-type infected cells, but prolyl 4-hydroxylase alpha subunit (GI:240974259) and flavonol reductase/cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (GI:241703753) were the only two <italic>I</italic>. <italic>scapularis</italic> proteins to be both down regulated as well as to present peptides with reduced methylation in all replicates (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>). Since no OMT was detected in ISE6 cells by IFA during infection with wild-type bacteria (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>), these changes are unlikely to be due to a direct effect of the mutation, but probably reflect an absence of replicating <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic>.</p>

<p>A recombinant version of the complete OMT was produced in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> Rosetta 2(DE3) pLysS and purified by column affinity chromatography. The eluted rOMT was visualized by Coomassie blue staining after electrophoresis in a 4–16% gel for 1 hr. The expected size of rOMT is indicated on the left; the left lane contains lysate from uninduced <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells carrying the plasmid encoding OMT. The right lane contains rOMT His-tag purified from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> carrying the plasmid encoding OMT, following induction with IPTG. B) Enzymatic activity of the rOMT was determined in a methylation assay that measured fluorescence resulting from production of resorufin in each sample. Average fluorescence from three replicates of each sample was plotted against assay time indicated on the X-axis. The blue dotted line represents the reaction using Msp4 as the substrate, which produced a curve expected from an enzymatic reaction. The reactions with APH_0406 (black line), TypA (dotted red line), and p44-16b (dotted gray line) as substrates produced only a minimal increase in fluorescence that was not significant. Green dotted line: negative control. C) Enzymatic activity under different concentrations of additional manganese (as MnCl<sub>2</sub>). (Red = 16 mM, Dark Blue = 8 mM, Green = 2 mM, Purple = 0.5 mM, Brown = 0 mM, Light Blue = Negative control) was tested to determine if Mn<sup>2+</sup> (included at a concentration of 10 mM in the assay kit) was a limiting factor for the OMT. Higher concentrations of MnCl<sub>2</sub> resulted in a proportional increase in velocity of the reaction, indicating that Mn<sup>2+</sup> was a co-factor and required at concentrations greater than 10 mM for optimal enzyme activity. Reactions with 16 mM additional MnCl<sub>2</sub> (17 mM total Mn<sup>2+</sup>) were completed in 90 min with fluorescence levels 25 times higher than with only 10 mM. The line graphs represent the averages from 3 replicates. Standard deviations for substrate testing ranged from 5%–10%, whereas standard deviations for Mn<sup>2+</sup> assays were &lt;5% at all concentrations used.</p>

Of the four proteins tested, only rMsp4 resulted in a significant and rapid increase in resorufin production (expressed as resorufin units, RU) when incubated with rOMT (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). rAPH_0406, rTypA, and rp44-16b produced high background fluorescence that resulted in high initial readings (~1,500–2,000 RU; 1.6–2.1 μM), but did not continue to accumulate a significant number of RU, and only reached values of ~2,200 RU (2.3 μM) (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). By contrast, when rMsp4 was used as the substrate, the fluorescence started at a lower reading (1,200 RU; 1.3 μM) but climbed to higher values (~3,400 RU; 3.6 μM), and reached a plateau at around 210 min after the reaction was initiated (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). Kinetics of the enzyme reaction were tested with 60, 80, and 100 ng of enzyme with a constant concentration of 50 ng rMsp4, and in the presence of 80, 100, and 150 ng of rMsp4 with a constant concentration of rOMT at 40 ng. We expected that if Msp4 was the substrate, the velocity of the reaction would increase with increasing concentrations of the enzyme and substrate, which would result in a shorter time for the reaction to reach Vmax (the maximum initial velocity when all enzyme molecules present in the reaction are in complex with the substrate). As predicted, the reaction reached Vmax in less time with higher concentrations of rOMT or rMsp4 (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). At the time required for the enzyme to reach Vmax, the rOMT had an activity of 0.13 μM/min with a Km of 5.57x10<sup>5</sup> M and the reaction reached Vmax after 46 min of initiation (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Because of the slow reaction kinetics, we suspected that <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> OMT required the addition of specific metal ions to catalyze the reaction, similar other <italic>o</italic>-methyltransferases [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Several concentrations (0.5 mM, 2 mM, 8 mM, and 16 mM) of MnCl<sub>2</sub> were added to the methylation reaction containing 100 ng (17.89 ρmoles) of rOMT and 100 ng (16.61 ρmoles) of rMsp4. This was in addition to the 10 mM Mn<sup>2+</sup> already included in the kit (GBiosciences, pers. comm.). Addition of Mn<sup>2+</sup> resulted in greater fluorescence (higher RU) (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>) and faster reaction times, reaching peak levels of RU by ~100 min after initiation. With the addition of 16 mM of MnCl<sub>2</sub> (17 mM total Mn<sup>2+</sup>), 98,000 RU (53.8 μM) were reached compared to 20,000 RU (11 μM) when the enzyme and substrate were used alone with the 10 mM Mn<sup>2+</sup> supplied in the kit (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>). Similar decreases in reaction time (130 min) were observed with the addition of 8 mM of MnCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>). The higher activity of the enzyme was also evident from the changes in enzyme activity (Km), and in the time to reach Vmax (1.67x10<sup>4</sup>, 1.77 μM/min, and 9:00 min, respectively) (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In preliminary tests, MgCl<sub>2</sub> did not accelerate the activity of the enzyme reaction significantly.</p>

<title>Crystal structures of the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> OMT</title>
<p>Protein for crystallization experiments was produced and purified by Seattle Biomed, a collaborator within the Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Disease (SSGCID), and was crystallized as described in the Materials and Methods section. Although this target has 33% sequence identity to its closest neighbor in the Protein Data Base (PDB), phases for the initial X-ray data from the synchrotron could not be determined by molecular replacement (MR). We initially hypothesized that binding of a substrate or co-factor would alter the conformation of the protein to something more amenable to MR. However, even after co-crystallizing the protein with SAH, phases for the X-ray data still remained recalcitrant to being solved by MR. Therefore, we chose to pursue single wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) phasing by using high concentration soaks (0.5 M) with sodium iodide solution, as it has previously yielded <italic>de novo</italic> phases for many other targets from the SSGCID [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Iodide-SAD data were collected on our in-house X-ray generator (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) and PHENIX HySS was able to find 72 iodide ion sites during its search, but we were able to identify 118 in the final structure using anomalous difference map peaks with a contour level of 3.5 σ. Phases for the <italic>Apo</italic>, SAM-Mn<sup>2+</sup>, and SAH-Mn<sup>2+</sup> datasets (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) were then determined by MR, using the SAH-bound structure as a search model.</p>

<p>AnphA.01233.a has a canonical <italic>o</italic>-methyltransferase fold which consists of a central 7-stranded β-sheet that is flanked on both sides by three α-helices (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). Since the structure was not solvable by MR, we assayed the PDB for structural homologues using the full-PDB SSM search on the PDBeFold website. The nearest homologue was 3CBG, another <italic>o</italic>-methyltransferase from <italic>Cyanobacterium synechocystis</italic>, which had a C<sub>α</sub> RMSD of 1.69 Å<sup>2</sup>. With this much of a difference in structural similarity in the PDB, it is not surprising that MR failed to provide phases. AnphA.01233.a crystallizes as a dimer in both the <italic>Apo</italic> and SAH-bound crystal forms—the <italic>Apo</italic> form has one dimer per asymmetric unit, while the SAH-bound form has three dimers per asymmetric unit (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). The SAH molecule binds at the apex of the β-sheet, and the binding pocket is completely solvent exposed. When aligning a monomer of the <italic>Apo</italic>- and SAH-bound structures, the RMSD for all C<sub>α</sub> carbons is only 0.273 Å<sup>2</sup>, so no large conformational changes occur due to ligand-binding. However, there is a small movement in a helix, composed of residues 31–40, that moves towards that substrate in the SAH-bound form as compared to the <italic>Apo</italic> form (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Enzymatic assays showed that the catalytic activity of the OMT was greatly increased in the presence of the divalent metal ion Mn<sup>2+</sup> at &gt;10 mM concentration. Therefore, we chose to attempt co-crystallization experiments with Mn<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of both SAM and SAH. Crystals formed readily in multiple initial sparse matrix screen conditions within a week and produced higher resolution data than either of the previous datasets collected in the absence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). After molecular replacement and initial refinement of these structures, a positive F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub> map peak at a contour level of 25 σ was observed in both the 4PCA and 4PCL structures, indicating that manganese was bound to the protein in close proximity to the SAH/SAM binding site (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>). The Mn<sup>2+</sup> ion is coordinated by the side-chains of D136, D162, and N163 and waters from the solvent (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>). This places the Mn<sup>2+</sup> ion within 4.5 Å of the CE methyl group to be transferred from the SAM co-factor to the hypothesized glutamate substrate of Msp4. Interestingly, a glutamic acid residue from a neighboring asymmetric unit, E177, inserts into a catalytic site in the SAM- Mn<sup>2+</sup> bound structure. It appears to adopt a slightly different conformation for either chain A or chain B, which contains 2 molecules of OMT per asymmetric unit. In chain A, E177 interacts directly with the manganese ion at a distance of 2.5 Å (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A</xref>), whereas in chain B, interaction of E177 with the Mn<sup>2+</sup> ion is mediated by two water molecules (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9B</xref>). Since the natural substrate of this enzyme is a glutamic acid residue(s) from Msp4, it is likely that the glutamic acid from Msp4 interacts with the OMT enzyme similarly to this.</p>

Within the order <italic>Rickettsiales</italic>, only members of the families <italic>Anaplasmataceae</italic> and <italic>Candidatus</italic> Midichloria mitochondrii (from the new family “<italic>Candidatus</italic> Midichloriaceae”) encoded OMTs related to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> OMT (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A Fig</xref>). However, Δ<italic>-proteobacteria</italic> encoded OMTs that had even closer homology to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> OMT, including OMTs from <italic>Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</italic>, <italic>Gloeocapsa sp</italic>., <italic>Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans</italic>, and <italic>Haliangium ochraceum</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A Fig</xref>). A PSI-BLAST search assigned a better e-value (4e-40) to an OMT from <italic>B</italic>. <italic>bacteriovorus</italic> than to the <italic>C</italic>. M. mitochondrii OMT (2e-36), suggesting that the former enzyme more closely resembled <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> OMT. Furthermore, when the three motif sites detected by MEME (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B Fig</xref>) from the four OMT enzymes were compared, the Δ-<italic>proteobacteria</italic> OMTs appeared to be more similar to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> OMT than the <italic>C</italic>. M. mitochondrii OMT (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B Fig</xref>). Motif 1 of the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> OMT had 48% identity and 66% similarity to <italic>H</italic>. <italic>ochraceum</italic> OMT motif 1, respectively, whereas <italic>C</italic>. M. mitochondrii OMT motif 1 only showed 33% identity and 53% similarity. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> OMT motif 2 exhibited 60% identity and 74% similarity with the corresponding motif in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>bacteriovorus</italic> OMT compared to values of 52% identity and 67% similarity to the motif regions of <italic>C</italic>.

<title>Putative positions of methylated residues in Msp4</title>
<p>The tertiary structure of Msp4 was predicted using Phyre2 [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] that compares conserved residues of a query protein to the sequence of proteins with known crystallized structures. The predicted tertiary and secondary structures were used to predict the probable positions of the methylated residues. Msp4 was predicted to form a β-barrel typical of porins (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7B Fig</xref>), and the glutamic acid residues that are modified by the OMT are predicted to be located at the start of one of the β-strands forming the beta-barrel (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>). Furthermore, transmembrane and signal peptide prediction software suggested that the first ~30 aa residues represented a signal peptide to direct transport of the protein from the cytoplasm to the outer membrane (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7C Fig</xref>). These residues corresponded to the α-helix at the N-terminus (dark blue) that is probably cleaved before the protein is positioned in the outer membrane (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7B Fig</xref>). The protein does not contain predicted transmembrane domains, but it is very likely that its positioning in the outer membrane is similar to that reported for other porins in that the β-barrel spans the membrane, and the portion of the protein with the longest loops is exposed on the outside of the bacteria.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Genetic manipulation of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> and other members of the <italic>Anaplasmataceae</italic> is difficult due to the intracellular nature of these organisms, and currently relies on random mutagenesis to study the role of specific genes during pathogenesis in the mammal and development in the tick [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Targeted mutagenesis in the related organism, <italic>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</italic>, proved ultimately unsuccessful as the transformants obtained were not able to persist <italic>in vitro</italic> for more than six days [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The recent success of targeted mutagenesis in <italic>Rickettsia rickettsii</italic> resulting in the disruption of a major surface protein gene (<italic>ompA</italic>) [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] presumed to be a virulence factor without producing a detectable defect provides impetus to develop this method for other <italic>Rickettsiales</italic>, and serves as a reminder that gene function ultimately must be confirmed by mutational analysis. In this manuscript, we report the effects of the mutation of a specific gene of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> that we suspect abolished its ability to infect tick cells. However, due to the lack of a complementation system in the <italic>Anaplasmataceae</italic>, we cannot completely rule out that this change in phenotype was due to secondary mutations. Nevertheless, our conclusions are supported by the effect of the methylation inhibitor AdOx, which mimicked the mutation at a concentration of 30 nM (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Previously, Chen <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] described an <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> mutant with an insertion in the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase 1 (<italic>lpda1</italic>) gene at the APH_0065 locus, which altered the inflammatory response during infection of mice by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], but had no effect on <italic>in vitro</italic> growth. The mutant (ΔOMT) described here was selected in the human cell line HL-60 in which it replicated in a manner comparable to wild-type bacteria (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The mutant had an insertion in <italic>aph_0584</italic> encoding an <italic>o</italic>-methyltransferase (OMT) family 3 (GI: 88598384; E.C. 2.1.1.24). The inability of ΔOMT to replicate within tick cells highlighted the distinct mechanisms used by <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> for colonization of mammal and tick hosts.</p>
<p>It is interesting that the search for OMTs similar to that encoded by <italic>aph_0584</italic> only identified an OMT in one <italic>Rickettsiales</italic> organism, i.e., in <italic>C</italic>. M. mitochondrii, which is outside the family <italic>Anaplasmataceae</italic>. This intracellular organism develops in the mitochondria of <italic>I</italic>. <italic>ricinus</italic> ticks and is a member of a new family thought to be closely related to, but distinct from, the <italic>Anaplasmataceae</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis showed highest similarity with enzymes from members of the <italic>Δ-proteobacteria</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A Fig</xref>) and analysis of the different motifs present in the OMT indicated that <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> OMT is more similar to the OMT from the Δ<italic>-proteobacterium B</italic>. <italic>bacteriovorus</italic> than to that from <italic>C</italic>. M. mitochondrii (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6B Fig</xref>). <italic>B</italic>. <italic>bacteriovorus</italic> is a predatory bacterium that attacks gram-negative bacteria and, like <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic>, presents a biphasic life cycle with an “attack form” that attaches to the host cell and a “dividing form” that occurs only in the periplasm of its host within a vacuole formed by its own proteins as well as host proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Like <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic>, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>bacteriovorus</italic> differentially expresses genes depending on the phase of development during infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Two OMTs are differentially regulated depending on the phase of infection; one OMT is up-regulated upon entry to Bdelloplast (Bd2861) and another extracellularly (Bd0381) [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Whether or not the up-regulation of the OMT in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>bacteriovorus</italic> during cell invasion is involved in the methylation of proteins important for entry is not known, however its up-regulation indicates that it may play such a role. It is possible that an ancestor of the families <italic>Anaplasmataceae</italic> and “<italic>C</italic>. Midichloriaceae” obtained their OMTs from members of the Δ<italic>-proteobacteria</italic> by lateral gene transfer. This possibility is supported by the absence of members of this enzyme family in the <italic>Rickettsiales</italic>, in which the only enzyme that showed slight similarities with the OMT was a bifunctional methyltransferase (m7G46) present in some <italic>Rickettsia</italic> species, albeit with high e-values of e0.28 –e1.2. These family 3 OMTs existing in <italic>Anaplasmataceae</italic> and the new family “<italic>C</italic>. Midichloriaceae” are evidently not required by other members of the <italic>Rickettsiales</italic> for infection of ticks, which seem to utilize different methyltransferases to carry out similar functions [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p>
<p>OMTs of the type encoded by <italic>aph_0584</italic> methylate free carboxyl groups on glutamic acid residues of bacterial chemoreceptors [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Thus, they are involved in environmental sensing, which could also be the case in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> since a sensor-histidine kinase CckA (<italic>aph_0582</italic>) is predicted to localize to the membrane and to be involved in signal transduction and regulation of transcription (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q2GKC9" xlink:type="simple">http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q2GKC9</ext-link>). Notably, CckA is part of the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> two component system, and is paired with response/regulator transcription factor CtrA, allowing <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> to respond to environmental changes [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A lack in the ability of the ΔOMT to respond when transferred from mammalian to tick cells could explain the continued expression of a set of proteins known to be important for infection of mammalian cells, and to be down-regulated in tick cell culture (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="ppat.1005248.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, it is unlikely that these phenotypic changes are due to a polar effect on the expression of the sensor-histidine kinase (<italic>aph_0582</italic>) since the transposon promoter drives transcription in the opposite direction from <italic>aph_0582</italic> and the insert is located at a distance of around 1600 bp from that gene (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Furthermore, transcription of the flanking genes is independent of the expression of the <italic>omt</italic> gene, and they do not appear to be part of an operon since no bands were amplified from the intergenic regions between these genes (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>). Although methyltransferases modifying glutamic acid residues have recently been identified as being widely conserved in eukaryotes, their targets, poly(A)-binding proteins, are methylated at additional amino acid residues, placing these enzymes in a different class from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> OMT [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Interestingly, the OMT from <italic>B</italic>. <italic>bacteriovorus</italic> (Bd0381) which is homologous to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> OMT (e-value 1e-42) was shown to be up-regulated when the bacteria were extracellular along with several genes involved in chemotaxis and sensing, including a methyl chemotaxis protein (Bd2503), pilS sensor protein (Bd1512), two-component response regulator (Bd0299), and a sensory box histidine kinase (Bd1657) [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Whether the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>bacteriovorus</italic> OMT, Bd0381, is involved in the methylation of the methyl chemotaxis protein is not known. However, it is possible that this OMT plays a role in environmental sensing, and that acquisition of a gene encoding such an enzyme enabled members of the <italic>Anaplasmataceae</italic> family to adapt to environmental changes more efficiently.</p>
<p>Analysis of the behavior of ΔOMT in ISE6 cells demonstrated reduced binding of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> to tick cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), partly explaining the decrease in bacterial numbers seen as early as 1 day p.i. (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). However, binding was not completely abolished by either the mutation or treatment with Adox (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Therefore, we investigated differences in bacterial internalization and intracellular development. Although the ΔOMT that did bind to tick cells were readily internalized between 1–20 hr (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>), the bacteria were not able to form morulae and replicate intracellularly, but persisted as individual bacteria within ISE6 cells for at least 10 days p.i. (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C–6H</xref>). Furthermore, we verified that the ΔOMT bacteria were internalized within ISE6 cells by confocal microscopy and a trypsin-protection assay (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Methylation of outer membrane proteins and virulence factors is increasingly recognized as an essential process during host invasion and infection by several obligately and facultatively intracellular bacteria [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Therefore, we considered that the lack of methylation of glutamic acid residues in Msp4 may have played a role in the reduced adhesion to tick cells and was probably responsible for preventing replication of ΔOMT in tick cell culture. Methylation of proteins that mediate adhesion to host cells has been reported in other members of the <italic>Rickettsiales</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Methylation of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>prowazekii</italic> OmpB by lysine methyltransferases was shown to play a role in adhesion to and infection of endothelial cells, and to be important for virulence [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Nevertheless, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> expressing recombinant OmpB were able to bind to endothelial cells in the absence of methylation [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Likewise, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> transformed to express recombinant Msp4 were able to adhere to ISE6 cells in the absence of the <italic>omt</italic> gene (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9A Fig</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005248.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Text</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> transfected only with <italic>msp4</italic> construct bound more readily than those harboring both <italic>msp4</italic> and <italic>omt</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9A Fig</xref>). Analysis of the OMT protein sequence using Phobius predicted a non-cytoplasmic location of the enzyme, suggesting that methylation of Msp4 occurred in the periplasm of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9B Fig</xref>). It is likely that OMT is not transported to the periplasm in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and methylation is thus not carried out efficiently. Because <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> transfected with only <italic>msp4</italic> were able to bind to tick cells, methylation of the protein was not essential for adhesion, explaining why disruption of <italic>omt</italic> only reduced but did not abolish <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> binding to tick cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Productive infection of cells by <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> requires completion of a multi-step process for efficient invasion and replication to occur. Increased expression of OMT in bacteria bound to ISE6 cells compared to those adhering to HL-60 cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>) suggested that physical contact with the tick cell outer membrane induced OMT expression. Induction of OMT expression happened rapidly, and waned as bacteria passed into the cytoplasm.</p>
<p>iTRAQ identified several potential substrates of the enzyme in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> and <italic>I</italic>. <italic>scapularis</italic> cells, two of which included <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> proteins previously shown to be highly expressed during infection of ISE6 cells, i.e., Msp4 and APH_0406 [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, <italic>in vitro</italic> methylation assays (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>) using recombinant versions of potential substrates only confirmed Msp4 (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>), and identified Mn<sup>2+</sup> as the most effective cofactor, indicating that <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> OMT is a metal dependent methyltransferase. The kinetics of the reaction were comparable to those reported for methyltransferases from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>prowazekii</italic> and <italic>R</italic>. <italic>typhi</italic> in which the linear portion of the reaction curve occupied 50–300 min [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. It is possible that the substrate protein, Msp4, is methylated by OMT as a linear molecule prior to translocation rather than as a folded protein, as used here, and this may further explain the slow <italic>in vitro</italic> assay kinetics. These results confirmed Msp4 as a substrate of the OMT, but whether the enzyme methylates other proteins awaits further investigation. The other proteins that showed differential methylation in the proteomic analysis, but were not methylated <italic>in vitro</italic>, are possibly methylated by other methyltransferases present in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> or in the host cell.</p>
<p>Msp4 is an antigenic protein encoded by a single copy gene that is highly conserved between different strains of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], as well as in other members of the genus <italic>Anaplasma</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. As a member of the Msp2 superfamily of proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], Msp4 is homologous to <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> Msp2 (P44), which has been shown to facilitate binding to mammalian cells, to be a porin and to be post-translationally modified. It is likely that Msp4 and Msp2 (P44) are structurally and functionally similar but that they have evolved to function in the tick vector and mammal, respectively. The most common non-specific bacterial porins form 16-strand β-barrels configd as trimeric peptide subunits [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. More substrate specific bacterial porins are comprised of 18-, 14-, 12-, or 8-strand β-barrels and in some cases are present as monomers (e.g., the 14 beta-stranded porins OmpG and CymA in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>) [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Since Msp4 is predicted to contain a 14-stranded β-barrel (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>), and by homology with the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>marginale</italic> Msp4 is likely monomeric [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], we conclude that it is probably substrate specific, which is supported by its activity exclusively in tick cells. It is interesting to note that the glutamic acid residues (E) of Msp4 that appear to be important for <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> development inside tick cells are close to one of the loops on the outside of the channel (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). Similarly, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>interrogans</italic> OmpL32 contains methylated glutamic acid residues that are important for infection and colonization of kidney and liver cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, more research is needed to determine the exact function of these methyl modifications of Msp4. We realize that structure predictions can be unreliable, and ideally the crystal structure of Msp4 in association with that of OMT should be resolved. We also expect that an <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum msp4</italic> mutant would display a similar or even more severely compromised phenotype than the <italic>omt</italic> mutant, since it is possible that other enzymes participate in methylation of the Msp4. Until such a mutant is available, the predictions serve as a starting point to infer potential implications of this modification for the biology of this bacterium.</p>
<p>The change in phenotype and our proteomic analysis support the conclusion that methylation of Msp4 may be necessary for efficient and productive infection of tick cells. Some porins have been shown to display double functionality, acting also as adhesins and being expressed under specific environmental conditions [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], characteristics that could fit Msp4 [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Partial inhibition of adhesion due to the mutation of <italic>omt</italic> is not surprising, as it is likely that more than one adhesin is involved in binding to tick cells. This has been shown for invasion of mammalian cells by <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic>, where three adhesins have been identified, OmpA, Asp14 and AipA [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. <italic>Rickettsiaceae</italic> possess two additional adhesins besides OmpB and OmpA, named Adr1 and Adr2. These were recently identified by proteomic approaches and also presented putative β-barrel structures [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Adhesins may also serve to protect the bacteria from mammalian complement that is abundantly present in the blood, and consequently ingested with the tick blood meal. <italic>Rickettsia conorii</italic> OmpB β-peptide has been shown to interact with mammalian complement regulatory factor H via the exposed loops extending from the transmembrane β-barrel structure, and a number of bacterial factor H-binding proteins have been identified as adhesins [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic> also evades complement-mediated killing, but it is not known whether this capability is mediated by binding of complement regulatory factors, or by direct interaction with complement [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In the cell-culture system used here, such factors would not be relevant due to the absence of active complement.</p>

<p>The <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> isolate HZ, which was originally cultured from a New York patient [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], was cultivated in HL-60 cells maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Lifetechnologies, New York) supplemented with 10% FBS (BenchMark, Gemini Bioproducts, California), and 2mM glutamine at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in humidified air [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Several transformants were generated to express Green Fluorescent Protein (GFPuv) and were selected and maintained in HL-60 cells as described [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The ability of the transformants to grow in ISE6, an <italic>I</italic>. <italic>scapularis</italic> embryonic cell line, was tested by inoculating purified cell-free bacteria or whole infected HL-60 cells into 25-cm<sup>2</sup> flasks containing confluent cell layers of ISE6 cells. Cultures were maintained in L-15C300 supplemented as described, and the pH was adjusted to 7.5–7.7 with sterile 1N NaOH [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].

<p>A transposon mutant (ΔOMT) deficient for growth in ISE6 cells was cultivated in HL-60 cells as described above by passing 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> infected HL-60 cells into a new flask containing 3–4 x 10<sup>5</sup> uninfected cells and 20 ml of fresh medium every 5 days. Spectinomycin and streptomycin (100 μg/ml each) were added to the cultures for selection of mutants carrying the <italic>aadA</italic> resistance gene encoded on the transposon. The number of insertion sites in the mutant population was determined by Southern blots of DNA purified from a 25-cm<sup>2</sup> flask of infected HL-60 cells, using the Puregene Core Kit A (Qiagen, Maryland) with an additional phenol-chloroform extraction step, and Phase Lock Gel Heavy (5 Prime, Maryland) to separate phases. DNA concentration was measured with a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf, New York), and DNA extracted from HZ wild-type bacteria served as control.

<title>Effects of the mutation on bacterial growth and binding</title>
<p>The ΔOMT and wild-type strains were grown in 25-cm<sup>2</sup> flasks containing HL-60 cells as described above. Bacteria were purified from four flasks containing 25 ml of a &gt;90% infected cell suspension by passing the cell suspension through a bent 27 G needle and filtration of the lysate through a 2 μm pore size filter. Purified bacteria were transferred to two 15 ml tubes, centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 5 min and then resuspended in 3 ml of RPMI medium supplemented as described above. Bacteria were diluted 1:40, 1:100, and 1:400 in 20 ml of uninfected HL-60 cultures, and incubated at 37°C as described above for infected HL-60 cells. Samples of 1.5 ml were taken from each culture every day for a 5-day period, and DNA was extracted as described for DNA samples used in Southern blots. The experiment was repeated in triplicate.</p>
<p>To generate growth curves of ΔOMT and wild-type bacteria in ISE6 cell cultures, bacteria were purified as described above, and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 5 min at 4°C. Supernatant was discarded, and cell free bacteria were diluted in supplemented L15C300 at ratios of 1:6, 1:12, and 1:24. The experiment was done in triplicate. To assess bacterial growth, DNA was extracted from 1.5 ml of mutant and wild-type cultures of bacteria grown in ISE6 cells every 3 days for 12 days as described before.</p>
<p>The number of bacteria per sample was determined by qPCR using the primers msp5 fwd and msp5 rev (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>) that amplify a fragment of the single copy number <italic>msp5</italic> gene. qPCR reactions were performed in an Mx3005p (Agilent, California) cycler, using Brilliant II SYBR Green Low ROX QPCR Master Mix (Agilent, California) under the following conditions: an initial cycle of 10 min at 95°C, 40 cycles of 30 sec at 95°C, 1 min at 50°C, and 1 min at 72°C, and a final cycle of 1 min at 95°C, 30 sec at 50°C, and 30 sec at 95°C. A standard curve was generated using the <italic>msp5</italic> fragment cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, New York).</p>
<p>To examine binding of ΔOMT and wild-type <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> to tick cells, we used two different assays to evaluate adhesion to tick cells and subsequent intracellular growth and development. The first assay was carried out under stringent conditions with a low MOI that permitted sensitive assessment of the effect of the mutated <italic>omt</italic> gene. The second assay (described further below, under “<bold><italic>ISE6 infection time point experiment to evaluate intracellular development of the ΔOMT”</italic></bold>) was designed to allow maximal, saturating binding so that mutant bacteria could be readily observed inside tick cells. For the first assay, bacteria were purified from 20 ml of one fully infected HL-60 culture and were added to about 2.5x10<sup>5</sup> ISE6 cells in 50 μl of supplemented L15C300 medium in a 0.5 mL centrifuge tube. To ensure that only activity induced during binding and not cell entry was measured, bacteria were incubated with host cells for 30 min at room temperature, flicking the tube every 5 min to enhance contact between bacteria and cells. The cells were washed twice in unsupplemented L15C300 and centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 min to remove unbound bacteria. The cell pellet was resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and spun onto microscope slides for 5 min at 60 x g, using a Cytospin 4 centrifuge (Thermo Shandon, Pennsylvania). Slides were fixed in absolute methanol for 5 min and dried at 50°C for 10 min. Bound bacteria were labeled using an IFA with dog polyclonal antibody against <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> and FITC-labeled anti-dog secondary antibodies. DAPI was used to stain the host cell nuclei, and aid in host cell visualization. The number of bacteria bound to 300 cells was counted for each sample. This was repeated in triplicate, and differences were evaluated using Student’s t-test to assess significance with SigmaStats (Systat Software, California).</p>

<title>Inhibition of SAM dependent methyltransferases and effect on the binding of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> to ISE6 cells</title>
<p>To verify that lack of methylation of substrate brought about by the disruption of the <italic>omt</italic> gene was the cause of reduced binding of the mutant to ISE6 cells, we added adenosine dialdehyde (Adenosine periodate Oxidized, or AdOx (Sigma Aldrich, Missouri)), which inhibits SAM-dependent methyltransferases by increasing the concentration of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], to wild-type cultures. Wild-type and ΔOMT bacteria were purified from 50 ml infected HL-60 cells as described. Purified wild-type bacteria were incubated with AdOx at 20 nM, 30 nM, and 40 nM final concentrations for 1 hr at 34°C before adding them to 2x10<sup>5</sup> uninfected ISE6 cells. Controls consisted of wild-type and ΔOMT bacteria purified the same way, but incubated at 34°C for 1 hr without addition AdOx.</p>
<p>The bacteria and ISE6 cells were incubated in 200 μl of supplemented L15C300 medium at 34°C for an additional hr to allow binding. Cells were washed 3 times in supplemented L15C300 medium by centrifugation at 600 xg to remove unbound bacteria. After the final wash, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of supplemented L15C300 medium and 50 μl of the suspension was spun onto microscope slides as described above and fixed in methanol for 10 min. The samples were incubated with dog anti <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> serum and labeled with FITC conjugated anti-dog antibodies. Samples were mounted in Vectashield Mounting medium containing DAPI to aid in host cell visualization (Vector Laboratories, California), and observed using a 100 x oil immersion objective on a Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope. Bacteria were counted as described above for regular binding assays, and differences in the number of bacteria per cell were evaluated using the Student-Newman-Keuls one-way ANOVA on ranks, using SigmaStat.</p>

<title>ISE6 infection time course experiment to evaluate intracellular development of the ΔOMT</title>
<p>Two thousand LifeAct-mCherry expressing ISE6 cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]were seeded onto the glass portion of MatTek dishes (Ashland, Massachusetts) in 250 μl of medium the day before bacterial challenge. ΔOMT and HZ wild-type bacteria were cultured in five million HL-60 cells until &gt; 95% infected, and bacteria were beginning to be released from cells. Cell-free bacteria were prepared by passing the infected cells through a 25 G needle 5 times, and intact cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,110 x g for 5 min. The supernatant was passed through a 2 μm pore size syringe filter to remove cell debris, and the bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 11,000 x g for 5 min. Bacteria were resuspended in 100 μl fresh culture medium and 20 μl of the suspension was inoculated onto ISE6 cell layers after 170 μL of culture medium had been removed. This resulted in a multiplicity of infection of 100–300 bacteria/cell. Dishes were incubated at 34°C in a water saturated atmosphere of 3% CO<sub>2</sub> in air for 1 hr with agitation at 10-min intervals to ensure uniform exposure of cells to bacteria. Unbound bacteria were removed by washing the cells once with 2 ml of medium, and 2 mL fresh medium was added and the cultures returned to the incubator. At each of eight time points (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 10 days), culture medium was removed from MatTek dishes and cells were immediately fixed by flooding with 2 mL methanol (1 min) followed by two additional rinses (1 min) with fresh methanol. Cells were then air dried and stored at room temperature until the bacteria were labeled by IFA.</p>
<p>Cells were blocked with 50% FBS in culture medium for 1 hr at room temperature. Bacteria were labeled with dog anti-<italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> serum for 1 hr followed by FITC-labeled anti-dog antibodies for 1 hr (each diluted 1:1,000).

<title>Confirmation that ΔOMT enters ISE6 cells</title>
<p>LifeAct-mCherry-expressing ISE6 cells cultured in MatTek dishes were challenged with ΔOMT or HZ wild-type bacteria at a high MOI as described above, and then exposed to trypsin to confirm the confocal microscopy finding that the ΔOMT bacteria were located inside the ISE6 cells. Four days following challenge, cells were mechanically dislodged using a cell scraper, spun onto slides, air-dried and fixed in methanol. These samples represented non-trypsin controls. Cells in remaining dishes were suspended in 1 ml 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco) for 3 min, collected by centrifugation (350 x g, 2 min), resuspended in 1 ml culture medium, and 100 μl volumes were spun onto microscope slides. Remaining cells were trypsinized a second time for 2 min, washed in medium and spun onto slides.

A MAGIC 2002 HPLC (Michrom BioResources, Inc., California) was used with a C18 Gemini-NX column, 150 mm x 2 mm internal diameter, 5 μm particle, 110 Å pore size (Phenomenex, California). The flow rate was 150 μl/min with a gradient from 5–35% Buffer B (10 mM ammonium formate, pH 10 in 10:90 water:acetonitrile) over 60 min, followed by 35–60% over 5 min. Fractions were collected every 2 min and uv absorbances were monitored at 215 nm and 280 nm. Peptide containing fractions were divided into two equal numbered groups, labeled “early” and “late”. The first “early” fraction was concatenated with the first “late” fraction by 10 mAU volume equivalents of each fraction from uv = 215 nm and repeated until all fractions were concatenated. Concatenated samples were dried <italic>in vacuo</italic>, resuspended in 98:2O, H<sub>2</sub>O:acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid and 1–1.5 μg aliquots were run on a Velos Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Massachussets) as described previously [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] with the exception that the Higher-energy Collisional Dissociation (HCD) activation energy was 20 msec.</p>
<p>The mass spectrometer RAW data (Proteowizard files) were converted as described previously [<xref rid="ppat.1005248.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].

<title>Identification of differentially methylated proteins</title>
<p>To identify the peptides that differed in methylation, a text file of data for all peptides was imported into Excel (Microsoft, Washington), and entered into TextWrangler (Bare Bones Software, Massachusetts), which is a text editing tool.

<title>Production of recombinant proteins for substrate testing</title>
<p>A functional version of the OMT without the S-tag (rOMTns) was produced and purified. Recombinant proteins of potential substrates identified by iTRAQ were produced using the pET29a vector. Primers to amplify partial or complete coding sequences were designed with restrictions sites for <italic>Nde</italic>I and <italic>Xho</italic>I enzymes (<xref rid="ppat.1005248.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>), and DNA amplified using <italic>pfu</italic> enzyme under conditions listed in <xref rid="ppat.1005248.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The sequence integrity of purified products was confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and DNA cloned into BL21(D3) <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (New England Biolabs) for expression. Proteins were produced in 150 ml of Superior Broth after induction with 200 μM IPTG and used in methylation assays described below. Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA micro protein assay kit (Pierce).</p>
<p>The SAM-fluoro: SAM Methyltransferase Assay (G-Biosciences, Missouri) was used to determine the activity of the enzyme. In this assay, methylation by SAM-dependent methyltransferases is correlated with the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> which can be assessed through the production of fluorescent resorufin from 10-acetyl-3,7,-dihydroxyphenoxazine (ADHP). Resorufin production was monitored using an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 595 nm in a Synergy H1 Hybrid microplate reader (Biotek, Vermont) during a kinetic run measuring fluorescence every two min for 4 hr at 34°C. Reactions were carried out in a 96 well EIA/RIA plate flat bottom plate (Costar, New York) covered with a MicroAmp optical adhesive film (Applied Biosystems, New York) to protect samples from evaporation. Assays were performed with 40 ng (7.14 ρmole) of the enzyme and 50 ng (8.31 ρmole) of substrates. The moles of the substrates were calculated from the theoretical molecular weight in kDa, using Zbionet (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.molbiol.ru/eng/scripts/01_04.html" xlink:type="simple">http://www.molbiol.ru/eng/scripts/01_04.html</ext-link>). Positive controls included the addition of AdoHcy alone or in combination with rOMTns to assay reagents provided by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>To determine enzyme kinetics, the concentrations of the enzyme or the substrate were increased separately. For the first set of reactions, the amount of enzyme was increased to 60 ng (10.71 ρmole), 80 ng (14.29 ρmole), and 100 ng (17.89 ρmole), while the substrate was left at 50 ng. In the second set, the enzyme concentration was left at 40 ng, while the substrate was used at 80 ng (13.29 ρmole), 100 ng (16.61 ρmole), and 150 ng (24.92 ρmole). Each reaction was done in triplicate and the average of the reactions was analyzed. To determine whether the 10 mM Mn<sup>2+</sup> included in the kit was a limiting factor for rOMT activity, additional MnCl<sub>2</sub> was included at 0.5 mM, 1 mM, 2 mM, 4 mM, 8 mM, and 16 mM concentrations in reactions containing 100 ng of the OMT and 100 ng of the substrate. All reactions were carried out in triplicate using the manufacturer’s recommendations, and the kinetics of the enzyme were analyzed using the Michaelis-Menten equation.</p>

<title>Effect of AdOx treatment on <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> HZ and ΔOMT binding to ISE6 cells.</title>
<p>To investigate the possibility that AdOx inhibited methyltransferases involved in infection of ISE6 cells other than the one affected by the mutation, wild-type and ΔOMT bacteria were incubated with different concentrations of the methyltransferase inhibitor AdOx for 1 hr and then binding assays were performed for 1 hr with ISE6 cells. Unbound bacteria were washed away and cells with bound bacteria were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. A significant decrease in binding similar to that observed previously was only seen in wild-type bacteria (purple bars). Addition of AdOx to ΔOMT (green bars) caused only a small additional decrease in binding, suggesting no other methyltransferases were involved. The bars represent the average number of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> HZ wild-type or ΔOMT adherent to ISE6 cells from three replicates.

Wild-type and ΔOMT bacteria were purified from HL-60 cells and inoculated into either ISE6 cells (wild-type) or HL-60 cell cultures (wild-type and ΔOMT). After 5 days p.i., RNA was purified and qRT-PCR was performed.

<p>RT-PCR reactions using primers that amplify A) an ~850 bp segment (+ control, arrow head) within the intergenic regions between the <italic>omt</italic> gene and the gene encoding the sensor histidine kinase (APH_0582), and B) a 702 bp segment within the inter-genic region between the <italic>omt</italic> gene and the hypothetical protein encoding gene <italic>APH_0585</italic> to test whether the genes were transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA. Total RNA was extracted from ISE6 cells infected with wild-type <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic> HZ strain at the indicated times. NRT panel: amplification products without reverse-transcriptase. RT panel: amplification products with reverse-transcriptase. Positive control consisted of genomic DNA purified from wild-type bacteria infecting ISE6 cells. Ladder = molecular weight standard. Results do not support co-transcription of <italic>omt</italic> and flanking regions.</p>

<title>Binding of recombinant Msp4- and OMT-expressing <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to ISE6 cells.</title>
<p>A) To test if methylation of Msp4 was necessary for binding to ISE6 cells, we transformed <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to express either Msp4 alone or the OMT and Msp4. Binding of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> transformed with the empty pET29b vector (negative control), to express Msp4 alone, or both Msp4 and the OMT was measured as the number of bacteria bound per cell. Blue bars represent the average value from three replicates, and the vertical lines indicate the standard deviation. B) Phobius prediction of OMT location within <italic>A</italic>. <italic>phagocytophilum</italic>. Lack of a signal peptide, a greater predicted likelihood of a non-cytoplasmic (blue line) rather than cytoplasmic (green line) location, and absence of transmembrane domains (gray bars) suggested that the OMT might interact with the periplasmic membrane of the bacteria. C) Agarose gel showing RT-PCR amplification of cDNA from <italic>omt</italic> and <italic>msp4</italic> transcripts within transformed <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. Left panel, PCR reaction products using <italic>omt</italic>-specific primers and the following templates: Lanes 1–5, negative controls: lane 1, RNA from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> transformed with the empty expression cassette pET29b; lane 2, RNA from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> expressing Msp4 plus OMT; lane 3, no template; lane 4, cDNA from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> containing empty pET29b; lane 5, cDNA from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> transformed to express Msp4; lane 6, cDNA from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> transformed to express Msp4 and OMT; lane 7 (positive control), DNA from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> transformed to express Msp4 and OMT. Right panel, PCR reaction products using <italic>msp4</italic>-specific primers and the following templates: Lanes 1–5, negative controls: lane 1, RNA from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> transformed with the empty expression cassette pET29b; lane 2, RNA from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> expressing Msp4; lane 3, RNA from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> expressing Msp4 plus OMT; lane 4, no template; lane 5, cDNA from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> containing empty pET29b; lane 6, cDNA from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> transformed to express Msp4; lane 7, cDNA from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> transformed to express Msp4 and OMT; lane 8 (positive control), DNA from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> transformed to express Msp4 and OMT.</p>
