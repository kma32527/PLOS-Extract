<abstract>
<p>Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is one of the most enigmatic proteins of the Dengue virus (DENV), playing distinct functions in immune evasion, pathogenesis and viral replication. The recently reported crystal structure of DENV NS1 revealed its peculiar three-dimensional fold; however, detailed information on NS1 function at different steps of the viral replication cycle is still missing. By using the recently reported crystal structure, as well as amino acid sequence conservation, as a guide for a comprehensive site-directed mutagenesis study, we discovered that in addition to being essential for RNA replication, DENV NS1 is also critically required for the production of infectious virus particles. Taking advantage of a <italic>trans</italic>-complementation approach based on fully functional epitope-tagged NS1 variants, we identified previously unreported interactions between NS1 and the structural proteins Envelope (E) and precursor Membrane (prM). Interestingly, coimmunoprecipitation revealed an additional association with capsid, arguing that NS1 interacts via the structural glycoproteins with DENV particles. Results obtained with mutations residing either in the NS1 <italic>Wing</italic> domain or in the <italic>β-ladder</italic> domain suggest that NS1 might have two distinct functions in the assembly of DENV particles. By using a trans-complementation approach with a C-terminally KDEL-tagged ER-resident NS1, we demonstrate that the secretion of NS1 is dispensable for both RNA replication and infectious particle production. In conclusion, our results provide an extensive genetic map of NS1 determinants essential for viral RNA replication and identify a novel role of NS1 in virion production that is mediated via interaction with the structural proteins. These studies extend the list of NS1 functions and argue for a central role in coordinating replication and assembly/release of infectious DENV particles.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Dengue virus (DENV) is a major arthropod-borne human pathogen, infecting more than 400 million individuals annually worldwide; however, neither a therapeutic drug nor a prophylactic vaccine is currently available. Amongst the DENV proteins, non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is one of the most enigmatic, being required for RNA replication, but also secreted from infected cells to counteract antiviral immune response, thus contributing to pathogenesis. Despite its essential role at early stages of the viral replication cycle, the molecular determinants governing NS1 functions are unknown. Here, we used a combination of genetic, high-resolution imaging and biochemical approaches and found that NS1 additionally plays an important role for the production of infectious virus particles. By using a novel <italic>trans</italic>-complementation system with fully functional epitope-tagged NS1, we show that NS1 interacts with the structural proteins residing in the envelope of the virus particle. An NS1 variant retained in the endoplasmic reticulum still supported efficient DENV particle production, demonstrating that secretion of NS1 is dispensable for virion production. This study expands the list of functions exerted by NS1 for the DENV replication cycle. Given this multi-functional nature, NS1 appears to be an attractive target for antiviral therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dengue is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease affecting around 400 million people worldwide and causing around 25,000 deaths per year [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Dengue virus (DENV) infections can lead to a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. However, in spite of its high medical relevance, no prophylactic vaccines or antiviral therapies are currently available and therefore a better understanding of the flavivirus life cycle is essential to promote the development of effective therapeutic regimens.</p>
<p>DENV has a single stranded RNA genome of positive polarity, encoding for a polyprotein that is co- and post-translationally processed into three structural proteins (capsid, prM, and envelope) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5) [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. After viral entry and release of the genomic RNA into the cytoplasm of infected cells, newly synthesized viral proteins induce massive remodeling of intracellular membranes, creating distinct intracellular structures where viral RNA replication and virion assembly take place [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nucleocapsid formation, thought to occur in close proximity to replication sites, is likely accompanied by acquisition of a lipid envelope via budding into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes enriched in the envelope protein E and prM [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], through as yet undefined mechanisms. Assembled virions, stored within ER stacks in highly ordered arrays, are then released from the cell via the conventional secretory pathway, where cleavage of the prM protein by furin, a protease residing in the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN), renders the viral particles infectious.</p>
<p>Flavivirus NS1 is a multifunctional 48-kDa glycoprotein that is translocated into the ER lumen co-translationally. Within the ER, NS1 promptly dimerizes upon addition of high-mannose carbohydrates [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and is targeted to three destinations: the viral replication sites, the plasma membrane and the extracellular compartment. The majority of secreted NS1 is a soluble, proteolipid particle forming an open-barrel hexameric shell with a central channel occupied by lipids [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The three-dimensional high-resolution structure of the DENV NS1 dimer was recently solved by X-ray crystallography [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], providing valuable insights into the complex NS1 fold (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The dimer contains three domains: first, a small <italic>β-roll</italic> domain formed by two intertwined β-hairpins; second, a <italic>Wing</italic> domain, composed of an α/β subdomain and a discontinuous connector that sits against the <italic>β-roll</italic>; third, a <italic>β-ladder</italic> domain, formed by 18 antiparallel β-strands (9 contributed by each monomer) assembled in a continuous β-sheet that runs along the whole length of the dimer (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, left panel). The protrusion created by the <italic>β-roll</italic> and the connector subdomain renders one side of the dimer hydrophobic, and has been proposed to face the ER membrane and to interact with other transmembrane viral proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Conversely, within the NS1 hexamer, the <italic>β-roll</italic> faces the interior of the lipoparticle, where it associates with the central lipid core (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, right panel). On the opposite side of the <italic>β-roll</italic>, both in the dimeric and the hexameric form, the distal tips of the <italic>β-ladder</italic> and the <italic>Wing</italic> domain loops point outward, and are therefore exposed to the solvent.</p>

<p>Secreted NS1 as well as NS1 residing on the plasma membrane and within cells, plays important roles in immune evasion via binding to complement proteins and modifying or antagonizing their functions [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Besides its immune evasive functions, NS1 modulates early events in viral RNA replication, was shown to co-localize with double strand RNA (dsRNA) and to interact with NS4B [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Indeed, deletion of NS1 from the viral genome completely abrogates replication, but ectopic expression of NS1 <italic>in trans</italic> can efficiently rescue NS1-deleted (ΔNS1) viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Because of its essential role early in RNA replication, genetic studies have thus far provided limited information on the molecular determinants of NS1 responsible for the viral replication cycle and did not investigate possible functions of the protein for assembly and release of infectious virus particles. By using a combination of genetic, high-resolution imaging and biochemical approaches we discovered a novel role of NS1 for the production of infectious DENV particles that is linked to NS1 interaction with the structural proteins, but independent from NS1 secretion.</p>

<title>Identification of critical NS1 determinants required for DENV replication</title>
<p>Sequence analysis and visual inspection of the recently solved three-dimensional crystal structure [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] of NS1 were performed to assess the degree of conservation of amino acid residues and to identify the most relevant positions to be targeted by site-directed mutagenesis (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Based on their distribution within the NS1 dimer and their relative conservation across the <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus, we selected 46 residues for alanine scanning mutagenesis, including five invariant cysteine residues (C4, C55, C179, C291, C312), recently shown to be engaged in disulfide bonds and playing an essential role in stabilizing the protein fold [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To dissect the impact of each individual mutation on the different steps of the viral replication cycle, we assessed viral RNA replication and virus spread by taking advantage of a DVR2A luciferase reporter virus genome (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). VeroE6 cells were electroporated with <italic>in vitro</italic> transcripts of <italic>wild-type</italic> (WT) or a given NS1 mutant and viral replication was assessed by luciferase activity 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h later (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Additionally, a replication-deficient NS5 mutant (GND) with a lethal mutation affecting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity was included as negative control. Based on the replication phenotypes, half of the NS1 mutants displayed only minor defects or replicated comparably to WT (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Conversely, 23 mutations, including those affecting cysteine residues engaged in disulfide bonds, severely or completely blocked viral RNA replication (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005277.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, underlined mutants). Most of these mutations clustered on the core of the <italic>Wing</italic> and <italic>β-ladder</italic> domain, affecting residues that point towards the <italic>β-roll</italic> (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>), which has been proposed to face the ER membrane [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Interestingly, in close proximity to the previously reported di-amino acid motif (N10-K11) suggested to mediate interaction with NS4B and association with ER membranes [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], a mutation targeting W8 within the NS1 <italic>β-roll</italic> domain completely abrogated viral RNA replication. Similarly, mutations within the <italic>greasy finger</italic> loop of the <italic>β-ladder</italic>, namely Y158A and G161A, resulted in a lethal phenotype as already shown for alanine substitutions at residues G159 and F160 [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Altogether, these results provide a comprehensive map of molecular determinants within NS1 essential for viral RNA replication, highlighting an important role for selected residues of the <italic>β-roll</italic> and <italic>β-ladder</italic> domains, clustering on hydrophobic protrusions within the NS1 dimer structure (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Identification of NS1 as a critical factor for infectious particle production</title>
<p>To determine the impact of each mutation on the production of infectious virus particles, culture supernatants of transfected cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>) were harvested 72 h after transfection and used to infect naïve VeroE6 cells. Virus production was determined by luciferase assay 48 h later (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). This experiment revealed a group of mutations (S114A, W115A, D180A, T301A) with minor effects on RNA replication, but massive impairment of virus production (up to ~2.5 Log<sub>10</sub> reduction compared to WT) (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Noteworthy, a mutation targeting T117 within the unresolved stretch of the <italic>Wing</italic> domain and in close proximity to S114 and W115, slightly enhanced particle production. Altogether, these results suggest a previously undiscovered role of NS1 for the production of infectious DENV particles.</p>

<p>Next we wanted to corroborate this observation and rule out that impaired virus production was an indirect consequence of diminished replication fitness rather than a specific defect in assembly or release of viral progeny. To this end, we assessed the impact of these mutations on RNA replication in the context of a sub-genomic reporter replicon (sgDVR2A) that does not support virus production, thus measuring replication independent from a possible contribution of virus spread (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). In this and all subsequent analyses we focused on mutants with selective alterations of virus production (S114A, W115A, D180A, T301A; <xref rid="ppat.1005277.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>) in order to avoid possible indirect effects resulting from impaired replication fitness (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Therefore, NS1 mutants with strong replication defects were excluded (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, since several NS1 mutants with a defect in virus production were slightly impaired in RNA replication we included as control the NS1 mutation R314A that caused minimal defect in replication, but did not affect virus production (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, mutant T117A was included in the analysis because of its increased capacity to produce infectious DENV particles and its close proximity to some of the sites where mutations caused a selective reduction of virus production. VeroE6 cells were transfected with <italic>in vitro</italic> transcripts of the replicon constructs and replication was measured 24, 48 and 72 h later (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). While at early times post transfection we observed a moderate reduction in luciferase activity for S114A, W115A, D180A and T301A compared to WT (2 to 5-fold; 24 h.p.t.), all mutants replicated comparably at 48 and 72 h.p.t., arguing for a minor contribution of RNA replication to the observed reduction in infectious particle production. As already observed in the context of the full-length reporter virus, the T117A mutant exhibited a replication profile comparable to WT also within the subgenomic sgDVR2A replicon whereas R314A exhibited an overall decrease in replication fitness, with a 50% to 75% reduction at any time point. Collectively, these results demonstrate a selective defect for a sub-group of NS1 mutants in assembly and/or release of virus particles.</p>

<p>To investigate further the phenotype of the NS1 mutants with respect to the production of infectious intra- and extracellular virus particles, and to corroborate these observations in human cells, we determined the infectivity profiles of each mutant in the context of a full-length DENV genome transfected into human hepatoma Huh7 cells. Three days post-transfection, titers of infectious virus released into the culture media or contained in cells were determined by limiting dilution assay with naïve cells. The results shown in <xref rid="ppat.1005277.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref> demonstrate that the amounts of intra- and extracellular infectivity were altered in all mutants, albeit to very different degrees. In agreement with the results obtained with the reporter virus genome, we found that alanine substitutions at residues S114, W115, D180 and T301 reduced extracellular infectivity titers up to 100-fold, confirming an essential role of these amino acid residues in NS1 for particle production. Interestingly, the amounts of intracellular virus particles were also reduced 5- to 10-fold. While this impairment argued for a defect of the NS1 mutants in virus assembly or maturation, the higher reduction of extracellular virus titers suggested an additional effect on particle release as inferred from the ratio of intra- to extracellular virus titers and comparison with the WT (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). The R314A mutation reduced the virus titer only ~3.5-fold and did not affect the ratio of intra- to extracellular infectivity, consistent with a subtle effect on assembly or virus maturation (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). Interestingly, the T117A mutant produced 12-fold more intracellular virus than WT, concomitant with a ~5-fold higher titer of extracellular virus particles, indicating accelerated assembly or infectivity maturation and reduced virus particle release. In conclusion, these results suggest that alanine substitutions at position S114, W115, T117, D180 or T301 of NS1 alter the production of infectious virus, supporting the notion that NS1 is a critical determinant for assembly or release of infectious virus particles.</p>

In addition, some studies hypothesized a link between NS1 secretion and virus assembly or release [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; however the lack of genetic tools in those days allowing the selective block of NS1 secretion in the context of a complete replication cycle precluded any functional investigation.</p>
<p>Prior studies have shown that YFV, KUNV and WNV mutants lacking NS1 do not replicate, but can be rescued when NS1 is complemented <italic>in trans</italic> by ectopic expression of the full-length protein [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To elucidate the possible role(s) of NS1 secretion in the DENV replication cycle, we utilized a similar approach and generated a DENV genome containing a 97 amino acids in-frame deletion within the NS1 gene (DVR2A<sup>ΔNS1</sup>). This mutant retained the N-terminal 156 and the C-terminal 99 residues, respectively (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, left panel). In parallel, we engineered a set of helper VeroE6 cell lines, constitutively expressing different NS1 variants after lentiviral transduction of expression vectors containing the complete NS1 coding region (NS1<sup>WT</sup>) or the empty pWPI vector (CTRL) that served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Furthermore, we engineered C-terminally tagged variants carrying a HA-affinity epitope (NS1<sup>HA</sup>) or the well-described KDEL motif (NS1<sup>KDEL</sup>), responsible for retrieval of ER luminal proteins from the Golgi apparatus by retrograde transport (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, right panel). Correct protein expression and secretion of each NS1 variant was confirmed by western-blotting (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). As expected, NS1<sup>HA</sup> had a slower electrophoretic mobility than the WT. Furthermore, both NS1<sup>WT</sup> and NS1<sup>HA</sup> were readily detected in the culture media, while NS1<sup>KDEL</sup> was effectively retained in the ER.</p>

<p>Next, we assessed rescue of viral RNA replication and particle production by the NS1 variants by using transfection of the DVR2A<sup>ΔNS1</sup> genome into each helper cell line. As shown in <xref rid="ppat.1005277.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>, the ΔNS1 genome was able to replicate in NS1<sup>WT</sup>, NS1<sup>HA</sup> and NS1<sup>KDEL</sup> helper cells, while no luciferase activity could be detected in CTRL cells lacking NS1. Of note, when each naïve helper cell line was infected with virus-containing culture fluids harvested 72 h.p.t, comparable levels of luciferase activity were detected in all conditions, indicating that C-terminally HA-tagged NS1 is fully functional (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). Importantly, the rescue of particle production by NS1<sup>KDEL</sup> shows that secretion of NS1 is dispensable for infectious DENV particle production.</p>
<p>To address the relative efficiency of trans-complementation upon virus infection, NS1<sup>WT</sup>-, NS1<sup>HA</sup>- and NS1<sup>KDEL</sup>-expressing VeroE6 cells were infected with trans-complemented DVR2A<sup>ΔNS1</sup> particles (ΔNS1<sup>TCP</sup>), produced in VeroE6_NS1<sup>WT</sup> cells. Culture fluids were harvested 24, 48 and 72 h later and the amounts of produced particles were determined by focus-forming unit (FFU) assay on NS1<sup>WT</sup> cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). Consistent with the luciferase assay data, ΔNS1<sup>TCP</sup> did not produce infectious virus on CTRL cells that do not express NS1, confirming that this mutant fails to replicate in the absence of NS1. Titers of infectious ΔNS1<sup>TCP</sup> particles released from VeroE6_NS1<sup>WT</sup>, NS1<sup>HA</sup> or NS1<sup>KDEL</sup> cells were higher than DVR2A <italic>wild-type</italic> infection on CTRL cells at early times post-infection (24 and 48 h p.i.), with no appreciable differences observed at later time points (72 h p.i.) (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Interestingly, while none of the trans-complemented TCPs gave rise to clearly visible plaques as previously reported [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], DENV-containing foci detected by immunostaining were larger than those produced by the full-length <italic>wild-type</italic> virus (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>, lower panel).</p>

<p>Additionally, lysates and culture supernatants of infected cells were harvested 24, 48 and 72 h p.i. to evaluate protein expression and secretion upon ΔNS1<sup>TCP</sup> infection. Under these conditions, virus replication in the various helper cell lines was comparable as judged by the intracellular protein levels of NS5 (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>; “Intra“). Furthermore, secretion profiles of HA- WT- and KDEL-tagged NS1 resembled those of uninfected cells, with the latter being efficiently retained intracellularly also upon DENV infection (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>; “Extra“).</p>
<p>To unequivocally confirm that the ΔNS1<sup>TCP</sup> system fully recapitulates wild-type DENV infections, we additionally investigated the ultrastructural morphology of NS1<sup>HA</sup> helper cells upon infection with DVR2A<sup>ΔNS1</sup> TCPs by using transmission electron microscopy. In agreement with the replication and infectious particle production data, NS1<sup>HA</sup> cells infected with DVR2A<sup>ΔNS1</sup> TCPs contained the characteristic membrane invaginations which have been proposed to represent viral replication factories (vRFs) [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and electron-dense virus particles forming regular arrays within the ER (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). Moreover, a large number of virus particles were observed on the plasma membrane or accumulating within the extracellular space between adjacent cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>). These structures were absent in both uninfected NS1<sup>HA</sup> cells and ΔNS1<sup>TCP</sup>-infected CTRL cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, these results demonstrate full functionality of HA-tagged and ER-retained NS1 supporting both DENV RNA replication and production of infectious virus particles.</p>

<p>Since NS1 secretion appeared functionally unlinked to infectious particle production, we next hypothesized that NS1 function(s) required for the late steps of the viral replication cycle might involve interactions between NS1 and the structural DENV proteins. To address this hypothesis we took advantage of our ΔNS1<sup>TCP</sup> system using HA-tagged NS1 for trans-complementation. DVR2A<sup>ΔNS1</sup> TCP stocks produced and titered in NS1<sup>WT</sup> helper cells were used to infect NS1<sup>HA</sup> target cells at an MOI of 1. Forty-eight hours later, cell lysates were subjected to HA-affinity capture using anti-HA agarose beads, and purified NS1 protein complexes or whole cell lysates were analyzed by western-blot using C-, prM-, E- and NS5-specific antibodies. Specificity of western-blot and immunoprecipitation analysis was monitored by including VeroE6_CTRL and VeroE6_NS1<sup>WT</sup> cells, respectively. As shown in <xref rid="ppat.1005277.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>, upon infection of NS1 helper cells with ΔNS1<sup>TCP</sup>, comparable amounts of structural proteins accumulated in both NS1<sup>WT</sup> and NS1<sup>HA</sup> cells, confirming that DVR2A<sup>ΔNS1</sup> replicates efficiently in both cell lines. Most interestingly, upon HA-immunoprecipitation, all three structural proteins (E, prM and C) specifically co-precipitated with NS1<sup>HA</sup> arguing for an interaction between NS1 and DENV virions and possibly also subviral particles. In spite of comparable protein amounts in the cell lysates, no specific signal was detected in case of the non-tagged NS1<sup>WT</sup> or for the NS5 protein, confirming specificity of the NS1<sup>HA</sup>-immunoprecipitation.</p>

<p>To corroborate the interaction between NS1 and the structural proteins, we performed analogous pull-down experiments using cells that had been infected with wild-type DENV. VeroE6 cells were mock-infected or infected with DENV-2 at an MOI of 1 and 48 hours later cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using a rabbit pre-immune serum (PIS) or an NS1-specific polyclonal antiserum (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). Interestingly, also under these conditions E and prM were specifically co-immunoprecipitated with NS1 whereas C was not detected. The absence of C might be due to the overall lower efficiency of this immunocapture approach, to suboptimal conditions for antibody binding or to an altered ratio of subviral particles to infectious virions in the TCP system as compared to wild-type virus-infected cells (see <xref rid="sec009" ref-type="sec">discussion</xref>). Nevertheless, the interaction between E and NS1 was confirmed in a reciprocal approach by which the NS1 protein in DENV-2 infected cells could be specifically co-immunoprecipitated with envelope (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). Altogether, these results support the notion that NS1 interacts with the viral envelope glycoproteins.</p>

<title>Mapping of the site in NS1 required for interaction with the DENV envelope glycoproteins</title>
<p>Based on the results described above, we hypothesized that the selective defect in infectious particle production observed for some of the NS1 point mutants was due to an altered association with the envelope glycoproteins. To investigate this hypothesis, we analyzed the association of selected NS1 mutants with the structural proteins by co-immunoprecipitation in the DVR2A<sup>ΔNS1</sup> TCP system, because it allowed highly efficient pull-down of NS1. We engineered stable VeroE6 cell lines expressing HA-tagged forms of the NS1 mutants S114A, W115A, T117A, D180A, T301A and R314A and infected these cell lines with ΔNS1<sup>TCP</sup> at an MOI of 1. Samples harvested 48 h.p.i., together with positive and negative controls, were subjected to HA-specific pull-down and cell lysates, immunocomplexes or culture supernatants were analyzed as described above. All cell lines expressed HA-tagged NS1 variants and despite small variations in the expression levels rescued DVR2A<sup>ΔNS1</sup> replication to similar extents as judged by the abundance of E, prM and C (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>) and the luciferase activity in the cell lysates (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, analyses of NS1<sup>HA</sup>-immunocomplexes revealed marked differences in the interaction profiles of these mutants with the structural proteins. In case of NS1 mutants S114A and W115A, a significant reduction in E and prM co-precipitation, concomitant with a loss of the C-specific signal was observed, arguing for impaired association of these NS1 variants with DENV virions (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>; reduction of Envelope: ~7.5- and 3.8-fold, respectively). In contrast, mutants D180A and T301A exhibited a selective loss of co-precipitated C while retaining high prM and E interaction, suggesting that NS1 contributes to virus production in an additional manner that is independent from interaction with the envelope glycoproteins. Consistent with their higher competence in supporting infectious particle production, T117A and R314A were still able to bind all three structural proteins, although the C-specific signal was lower as compared to wild-type.</p>

<p>These results were further corroborated by co-localization analyses of HA-tagged NS1 mutants with the envelope glycoproteins revealing reduced co-localization in case of the two mutants that were impaired in virus production (S114A and W115A; <xref rid="ppat.1005277.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref>), but no significant change in case of all the other mutants. Importantly, no major differences could be observed with respect to NS1 secretion into the culture supernatants (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C</xref>), strengthening the notion that NS1 secretion is functionally unlinked to its role in the production of infectious extracellular virus particles.</p>

<title>NS1 co-localizes with assembled viral particles</title>
<p>To further investigate the interaction between NS1 and the structural proteins, we used immunofluorescence to visualize the sub-cellular colocalization of NS1 with the structural proteins. To allow detection of putative DENV assembly sites and/or assembled virus particles, we aimed to perform simultaneous immunostaining of capsid, envelope and NS1. Since we were limited by the availability of antibodies allowing for triple staining, we engineered a C-terminally mCherry-tagged NS1 variant (NS1<sup>mCherry</sup>) to be visualized without requirement for antibodies (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A</xref>). In the initial set of experiments, we confirmed correct NS1<sup>mCherry</sup> expression and sub-cellular distribution. Importantly, mCherry-tagged NS1 supported efficient DENV RNA replication and infectious particle production upon infection with ΔNS1<sup>TCP</sup> demonstrating full functionality of the fluorescently tagged NS1 (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9B and 9C</xref>). Taking advantage of this approach, we analyzed infected cells by confocal microscopy and observed several discrete structures where Envelope, Capsid and NS1 colocalized (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9D</xref>). Although the nature of these structures that might correspond to putative assembly sites or assembled virus particles is not clear, this colocalization provides additional evidence for a previously unreported association between NS1 and the structural DENV proteins.</p>

<p>To overcome the inherent limitations of fluorescence microscopy in allocating specific proteins to distinct subcellular structures and to elucidate the nature of these NS1-positive structures we performed correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM) of VeroE6_NS1<sup>mCherry</sup> cells infected with ΔNS1<sup>TCP</sup> (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>).

After alignment of confocal and electron microscopy images we were able to identify NS1-enriched structures. As observed with NS1<sup>HA</sup>, NS1<sup>mCherry</sup>-infected cells also contained the characteristic DENV-induced membrane rearrangements. Indeed, we found that highly fluorescent mCherry-positive areas corresponded to ER, vesicle packets (VPs) and ER-associated bags containing arrays of DENV particles (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9D and 9E</xref>). These results are consistent with our previous studies describing the association of NS1 with VPs as determined by immuno-EM [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Flavivirus NS1 has emerged as one of the most enigmatic proteins forming distinct intra- and extracellular complexes and contributing to pathogenesis as well as viral replication. While soluble and cell-surface–associated NS1 was shown to modulate complement activation pathways through interactions with host proteins, such as the regulatory protein factor H, complement factor C4 or clusterin [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and to induce cross-reacting antibodies to human proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the role of NS1 in the viral replication cycle has so far been elusive. NS1 was initially thought to be involved in virus assembly or maturation, given its subcellular localization within the ER lumen and its secretion profile, largely mirroring that of the structural proteins prM and E [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, this hypothesis was challenged by the co-localization of NS1 with dsRNA, a marker for RNA replication sites and by biochemical and genetic evidences supporting an essential role of NS1 in viral RNA replication [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Additionally, NS1 has been reported to interact with NS4B and/or NS4A, which are assumed to relay NS1 signals to other components of the viral replicase through their ER luminal segments.</p>
<p>In the present study, we used a combination of genetic, biochemical, and imaging approaches to investigate the functional role of intra- and extracellular NS1 in the DENV replication cycle. In addition to the previously reported mutations within the N-linked glycosylation sites [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and the cysteine residues engaged in disulfide bonds [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], we identified 18 additional residues that completely or severely reduced DENV replication. Interestingly, most of these mutations clustered on residues located towards the proposed ER binding site (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Among these, a conserved tryptophan residue at amino acid position 8 (W8A) was found to be essential for RNA replication. This residue is located in close proximity to the previously reported di-amino acid motif (N10K11) within the <italic>β-roll</italic> domain of WNV NS1 that is also critical for efficient RNA replication [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These residues are located in an exposed region of the NS1 dimer suggested to face the ER membrane and possibly mediating the interaction with NS4B. Moreover, within the NS1 hexamer, these residues point towards the inner cavity of the barrel and might contribute to the association of NS1 with its lipid cargo (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. While these results are consistent with the proposed way how the NS1 dimer associates with intracellular membranes and provide a detailed genetic map of NS1 residues essential for viral RNA replication, further studies are required to decipher the impact of these mutations on protein-protein interactions and induction of ultra-structural membrane rearrangements.</p>
<p>Most interestingly, our mutagenesis approach identified a group of NS1 mutants with selective defects in infectious particle production. These mutants (S114A, W115A, D180A and T301A) had only minor or negligible defects in NS1 protein stability and viral RNA replication as judged by their replication kinetics in the context of a sub-genomic replicon (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>), but released up to 100-fold lower amounts of infectious DENV particles than the wild-type (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1005277.g003" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1005277.g004" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Of note, amounts of intracellular infectivity were reduced ~5- to 10-fold, arguing that the NS1 mutations affected both assembly (as evidenced from intracellular virus titers) and release of infectious DENV particles (indicated by titer reduction in cell culture supernatants). Although we cannot precisely comment on the individual contribution of NS1 to virus assembly and particle release, the identification of an additional NS1 mutant (T117A) producing ~12-fold higher amounts of intracellular infectious virus strongly hints towards a primary role of NS1 in the assembly of infectious DENV particles.</p>
<p>Based on previous studies reporting the ability of ectopically-expressed NS1 to trans-complement YFV or WNV NS1 deletion mutants [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], we established a DENV-based ΔNS1<sup>TCP</sup> system to characterize NS1 functions. Taking advantage of this method, we probed the capacity of an intracellularly retained KDEL-tagged NS1 (NS1<sup>KDEL</sup>) to support production and release of viral particles and demonstrate that secretion of NS1 is dispensable for these functions. Of note, KDEL-tagged proteins are shuttling between the ER and the Golgi apparatus and thus, NS1<sup>KDEL</sup> could still assist early vesicular traffic of viral particles, i.e. from virion budding sites (ER) to early secretory compartments (ERGIC) (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>). Recently it has been reported that depletion of the KDEL receptor or a subset of class II Arf proteins reduces secretion of non-infectious sub-viral particles and that prM—KDEL receptor interaction plays a role in virus secretion, arguing that flavivirus release from infected cells is assisted by specific sorting mechanisms [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, additional viral or host factors appear to be required to coordinate these processes, since knock-down of KDEL receptor or Arf4+5 expression reduced YFV and DENV1-3 secretion less than 10-fold and had no effect on DENV4 and WNV particle production. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the possible contribution of NS1 trafficking from the ER to early or intermediate secretory compartments for DENV particle release.</p>

<p>By using HA-tagged NS1 variants (NS1<sup>HA</sup>) and ΔNS1 virus-infected cells, we identified a previously unreported interaction between NS1 and the envelope glycoproteins E and prM. Although more than two decades ago E—NS1 complexes were identified in insect cells infected with a selected group of flaviviruses, the interaction was suggested to result from unspecific protein aggregation, lacking functional significance and not reproducible in DENV-2- and YFV-infected cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In contrast, several lines of evidence suggest that NS1 interaction with these structural proteins is specific and of importance for the production of infectious DENV particles: (i) the co-immunoprecipitation of NS1 with prM and E and, possibly indirectly, with C; (ii) the identification of triple-positive structures enriched in NS1, E and C by confocal microscopy; (iii) the detection of NS1 in compartments containing assembled virions by CLEM. Importantly, immunoprecipitation experiments using lysates of wild-type DENV-2-infected cells and an NS1-specific antibody confirmed the interaction of NS1 with both prM and E glycoproteins. Of note, while in this experimental set-up no specific signal could be detected for the capsid protein, it was well co-precipitated in the DVR2A<sup>ΔNS1</sup> TCP system. This discrepancy might be due to the overall lower NS1 capture efficiency in case of wild-type virus-infected cells. Alternatively, it is possible that in wild-type virus-infected cells subviral particles (SVPs) are produced in higher abundance relative to virus particles, whereas in the DVR2A<sup>ΔNS1</sup> TCP system production of virus particles might be favored relative to SVPs. Consistent with this assumption we observed a much faster and more efficient production of infectious virus particles in our TCP system than with wild-type virus-infected cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). Assuming that NS1 can also interact with prM/E present on the surface of SVPs, in case of their excess production we would still observe coprecipitation of NS1 with the envelope glycoproteins, whereas C would no longer be co-precipitated. In contrast, when virus particles are produced in excess over SVPs, we would observe NS1 co-precipitation with prM/E and C, i.e. virions. This is consistent with the observed colocalization of NS1 with C and E (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>) and the enrichment of NS1 in areas containing fully assembled DENV particles (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>). Moreover, the conclusion is consistent with the membrane topology of E, prM and NS1 that are located in the lumen of the ER, while capsid resides on the cytoplasmic side of ER membranes (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>). Since no tangible interactions between capsid and the glycoproteins were reported to date, the most likely explanation for the apparent NS1-C co-precipitation is an interaction between NS1 and assembled virions. While the precise mechanism remains to be determined, the specificity and functional relevance of these interactions was corroborated by the interaction profiles of NS1 mutants having defects in infectious particle production. Mutations affecting highly conserved residues of the flexible solvent-exposed loop in the NS1 <italic>Wing</italic> domain (S114A and W115A; <xref rid="ppat.1005277.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8D</xref>) simultaneously abrogated C, prM and E association arguing that this NS1 loop is engaged in interaction with DENV virions. In contrast, mutations affecting residues in the <italic>β-ladder</italic> domain (D180A and T301A) preserved glycoprotein binding, but prevented association with capsid arguing for a second function of NS1 in the assembly of DENV particles that is independent from envelope protein interaction. While the exact mechanism remains to be established, it is tantalizing to speculate that NS1 might, directly or indirectly via these residues, interact with other viral or cellular factor(s) required for the formation of infectious DENV particles. Alternatively, NS1 might assist membrane budding or conformational changes in prM/E required for the envelopment of nucleocapsids. This hypothesis is supported by the localization of “capsid non-binder” mutants in the NS1 dimer structure. In fact, D180 resides at the intersection of the <italic>Wing</italic> and <italic>β-ladder</italic> domain and T301 points towards the ER membrane and is solvent exposed (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8D</xref>). These mutations might affect the NS1 dimer fold, its affinity for membranes or its membrane-bending ability, while preserving prM/E-association through the distal tips of the <italic>Wing</italic> domain that points towards the ER lumen. Alternatively, these mutations might induce conformational constraints in prM/E complexes, reducing their plasticity and capability to envelope budding nucleocapsids, affect the recruitment of prM/E to assembly sites or only indirectly affect association with capsid, as a consequence of altered interactions with other viral [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] or host factors playing critical roles in virion morphogenesis. However, ultrastructural analysis of NS1 mutants failed to identify assembly intermediates, the only striking difference to the wild-type being a marked reduction in the overall amount of electron-dense particles found in proximity to or directly at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). These results suggest that nucleocapsid formation and envelopment are coupled or that naked nucleocapsids have an extremely short half-life. Further experiments will be required to dissect the exact role of NS1 in the assembly process of infectious virus particles.</p>
<p>Assembly of flavivirus particles is a poorly understood process (reviewed in [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]). High-resolution imaging approaches have shed some light on the topological arrangement of viral RNA replication and virus particle assembly. The viral replicase machinery is assumed to reside in highly organized membranous structures, designated as vesicle packets (VPs). These structures are formed by ER invaginations containing pores that would allow the release of newly synthesized viral RNA to be used for packaging into virions [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While genetic evidence suggests the involvement of several non-structural proteins and host factors in flavivirus assembly [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], the underlying molecular mechanisms are not known. Besides the lack of tangible interactions between C and the prM/E complex, major limitations are posed by the difficulty to visualize assembly intermediates and the seemingly unspecific incorporation of genomic RNA into nucleocapsids [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Based on the results presented here, it is tempting to speculate that NS1 might assist virion morphogenesis via its lipid-remodeling activity [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], its affinity for membranes [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and its ability to interact with both non-structural [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and structural proteins. In this respect NS1 might provide essential lipids or recruit essential host factor required for the biogenesis of the replication complex, while coordinating the recruitment of E and prM to assembly sites juxtaposed to the viral replicase [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] (<xref rid="ppat.1005277.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study provides a comprehensive genetic map of NS1 determinants important for viral RNA replication and identifies a novel role of NS1 for the production of infectious DENV particles. We demonstrate that NS1 interacts with the envelope glycoproteins presumably on the surface of virions and these interactions are required for efficient production of infectious virus particles. Given its multiple roles in counteracting host defense, promoting RNA replication and enhancing production of virus particles, NS1 exemplifies the genetic economy of flaviviruses and emerges as attractive target for antiviral drugs.</p>

Forty-eight hours later, cell monolayers were scraped into 1 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 0.5% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl and protease inhibitor cocktail (cOmplete, Roche)). After 30 min incubation on ice, cell debris was removed by 15 min centrifugation at 13,800xg and 400 μl of clarified cell lysate was incubated with rabbit pre-immune serum (PIS) or rabbit anti-NS1 antiserum for 6 hours at 4°C in a head-to-head shaker. Samples were incubated with 40 μl of protein A beads slurry (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) for 1 hour at 4°C, washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and protein A-bound complexes were transferred into a fresh tube. After a final wash with 1 ml of lysis buffer for 15 min at 4°C, protein complexes were eluted at room-temperature by two consecutive steps with 75 μl of 0.1 M glycine [pH 2.5] for 5 min. Collected supernatants were immediately neutralized by adding 7.5 μl 1 M Tris-HCl [pH 8] and denatured for 5 min at 95°C in the presence of 33 μl of 6X SDS sample buffer. Alternatively, mouse anti-HA or mouse anti-E antibodies were used in combination with protein G beads slurry (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) and the immunoprecipitation was carried exactly as described above.

For HA-specific affinity capture, samples were incubated with HA-specific agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, USA) for 5 h by continuously inverting the tubes at 4°C. Beads were washed three times for 20 min with large volumes of lysis buffer at 4°C and samples were eluted at room-temperature in two consecutive steps with 3% SDS in PBS for 5 min and PBS for 5 min, respectively. The two eluates were pooled and precipitated over-night at -20°C with 4 volumes of ice-cold acetone. Samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000xg, air-dried, resuspended in 2x SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min at 95°C. Alternatively, 4 h before ΔNS1<sup>TCP</sup> infection, VeroE6 cells stably expressing wild-type NS1 (NS1<sup>WT</sup>) or HA-tagged NS1 (NS1<sup>HA</sup>) were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA 3.1(+) empty vector or pCMV_NS4B-FLAG (encoding a C-terminally Flag-tagged NS4B protein of Hepatitis C virus) by using the TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (MirusBio LLC, Madison, WI, USA) as recommended by the manufacturer.

After a 48 h incubation period, cells were fixed and prepared for transmission electron microscopy as described previously [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. For correlative light-electron microscopy, VeroE6-based helper cell lines expressing NS1<sup>mCherry</sup> were seeded into glass-bottom culture dishes containing photo-etched gridded coverslips (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA) and infected with 1 MOI of DVR2A<sup>ΔNS1</sup>. After 48 hours, cells were fixed with 4% PFA and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, stained with DAPI and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy to acquire optical sections of 0.13 μm as described above. NS1<sup>mCherry</sup>-positive cells were imaged and their position on the gridded coverslip was recorded. Cells were then processed for analysis as described previously [<xref rid="ppat.1005277.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The DAPI signal was used for correlation purposes and images were adapted by using the Image J (version 1.46r) and Adobe Photoshop (version 12.1.1) software packages.</p>
