<abstract>
<p>Iron, an essential co-factor of respiratory chain proteins, is critical for mitochondrial function and maintenance of its redox balance. We previously reported a role for iron uptake in differentiation of <italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic> into virulent amastigotes, by a mechanism that involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and is independent of the classical pH and temperature cues. Iron import into mitochondria was proposed to be essential for this process, but evidence supporting this hypothesis was lacking because the <italic>Leishmania</italic> mitochondrial iron transporter was unknown. Here we describe <italic>MIT1</italic>, a homolog of the mitochondrial iron importer genes <italic>mrs3</italic> (yeast) and <italic>mitoferrin-1</italic> (human) that is highly conserved among trypanosomatids. <italic>MIT1</italic> expression was essential for the survival of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> procyclic but not bloodstream forms, which lack functional respiratory complexes. <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis LMIT1</italic> null mutants could not be generated, suggesting that this mitochondrial iron importer is essential for promastigote viability. Promastigotes lacking one <italic>LMIT1</italic> allele (<italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic>) showed growth defects and were more susceptible to ROS toxicity, consistent with the role of iron as the essential co-factor of trypanosomatid mitochondrial superoxide dismutases. <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> metacyclic promastigotes were unable to replicate as intracellular amastigotes after infecting macrophages or cause cutaneous lesions in mice. When induced to differentiate axenically into amastigotes, <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> showed strong defects in iron content and function of mitochondria, were unable to upregulate the ROS-regulatory enzyme FeSOD, and showed mitochondrial changes suggestive of redox imbalance. Our results demonstrate the importance of mitochondrial iron uptake in trypanosomatid parasites, and highlight the role of LMIT1 in the iron-regulated process that orchestrates differentiation of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> into infective amastigotes.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Leishmaniasis is a serious parasitic disease that affects 12 million people worldwide, with clinical manifestations ranging from self-healing cutaneous lesions to deadly visceralizing disease. A vaccine is not available, and new and less toxic drugs against this protozoan parasite are urgently needed. Following introduction into vertebrate hosts during a sand fly blood meal, <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites undergo extensive changes in morphology and metabolism that are critical for adaptation to life inside host macrophages and replication as amastigotes. Earlier studies identified major events that occur during amastigote differentiation, but the signaling mechanism initiating this process remained poorly understood. Previously we demonstrated a novel role for the reactive oxygen species (ROS) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in initiating amastigote differentiation, a process proposed to be dependent on iron availability inside the parasite’s mitochondria. In this study we identify LMIT1, a <italic>Leishmania</italic> transmembrane protein that functions as a mitochondrial iron transporter and is conserved in other trypanosomatid protozoan parasites. Reduced LMIT1 expression impairs mitochondrial function in the infective amastigote stage, abolishing parasite virulence. Our findings identify LMIT1 as a promising new drug target, and support the conclusion that iron-dependent ROS signals generated in the mitochondria regulate differentiation of virulent <italic>Leishmania</italic> amastigotes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Leishmania spp</italic>., parasitic protozoa from the Trypanosomatidae family, cause a broad spectrum of human diseases collectively referred to as leishmaniasis. An estimated 12 million people worldwide are infected with these parasites, with another 350 million at risk of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref001">1</xref>]. If not treated, the visceral form of leishmaniasis can cause high mortality. With no efficacious vaccines, the emergence of resistance to existing drugs and the lack of less toxic and affordable treatments, the identification of new targets for therapeutic development is urgently needed.</p>
<p>While alternating between mammalian and sand fly hosts <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites experience extreme changes in environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref002">2</xref>]. In mammals, <italic>Leishmania</italic> replicate inside acidic parasitophorous vacuoles (PV) of macrophages as oval-shaped amastigotes with a very short flagellum. When ingested by sand flies during a bloodmeal, amastigotes transform into flagellated promastigotes that replicate in the insect’s digestive tract. As they mature, promastigotes cease to replicate, transform into infective metacyclic stages and migrate to the fly proboscis, from where they are reintroduced into a mammalian host during a blood meal. To adapt to these distinct environmental conditions, <italic>Leishmania</italic> undergo extensive morphological changes and metabolic retooling, orchestrated through genome-wide changes in gene expression and post-translational modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref003">3</xref>]. A shift to pH, temperature, oxygen and nutrient conditions similar to those encountered inside mammalian macrophages has been successfully used to induce promastigote to amastigote differentiation in axenic culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref005">5</xref>]. However, the signaling pathway driving the generation of virulent amastigotes, the most important life cycle form in human infections, is still poorly understood.</p>
<p>Recent developments in redox biology revealed a novel role of reactive oxygen species (ROS), specifically H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, as a signal for differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref006">6</xref>]. While the high levels of ROS generated during oxidative stress cause damage to DNA, proteins and lipids, more subtle variations in ROS levels can be involved in signaling pathways that initiate biological processes. Mitochondria-generated ROS is tightly controlled, and its low level modulation has been implicated in regulation of aging, autophagy, immunity and cell fate determination, particularly the transition between cell growth and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref007">7</xref>]. In agreement with these findings, recent work from our laboratory implicated iron-dependent ROS signaling as a trigger for amastigote differentiation in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref008">8</xref>]. It was suggested that iron deprivation causes “leakage” of electrons from the mitochondrial respiratory chain, generating superoxide radicals that are broken down into H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2,</sub> the signaling molecule for differentiation, in a reaction catalyzed by iron dependent superoxide dismutase (FeSOD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref008">8</xref>]. Since all trypanosomatid SODs utilize iron as an essential co-factor, these initial studies could not distinguish between the role of mitochondrial FeSODA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref009">9</xref>] and the glycosomal FeSODB (equivalent to cytoplasmic SOD in higher eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref010">10</xref>]). To test the hypothesis that mitochondria are the major site where iron-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> responsible for inducing differentiation of infective amastigotes is generated, we investigated the mechanism by which iron enters this organelle in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic>.</p>
<p>Regulation of iron levels is critical for maintaining the mitochondrial redox balance. The ability of iron to transition between various oxidation states makes it an ideal redox-active cofactor, which is utilized by virtually all organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref011">11</xref>]. Iron uptake into mitochondria is essential for the synthesis of two important prosthetic groups, iron-sulfur clusters (ISC) and heme, which are required for the functioning of numerous biochemical processes including the electron transport chain (ETC). However, free ferrous (Fe<sup>++</sup>) iron reacts with oxygen or nitrogen compounds to generate highly toxic reactive radicals via the Fenton reaction. Hence, mitochondrial iron import must be tightly regulated, and coordinated with demand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref012">12</xref>]. In this study we identify and functionally characterize the Leishmania Mitochondrial Iron Transporter-1 (LMIT1), a transmembrane protein with mitochondrial localization that has strong similarity with mitoferrin, a demonstrated mitochondrial iron transporter in several organisms. Our results show that LMIT1 is required for normal mitochondrial function, and is a critical determinant of virulence in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic>.</p>

<title>Identification of <italic>LMIT1</italic> (<underline>L</underline>eishmania <underline>M</underline>itochondrial <underline>I</underline>ron <underline>T</underline>ransporter 1) as a mitochondrial iron transporter</title>
<p>BLAST homology searches of the TriTryp database identified several members of the mitochondrial carrier family as possible homologs of yeast mitochondrial iron transporter protein mrs3 or human mitoferrin-1. The highest identity (E = 3e<sup>-38</sup>) with both human mitoferrin-1 and yeast mrs3 was observed for <italic>LmxM</italic>.<italic>08_29</italic>.<italic>2780</italic> (<italic>L</italic>. <italic>mexicana</italic>), <italic>LinJ</italic>.<italic>29</italic>.<italic>2890</italic> (<italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic>), <italic>LmJ</italic>.<italic>29</italic>.<italic>2780</italic> (<italic>L</italic>. <italic>major</italic>) and <italic>Tb927</italic>.<italic>3</italic>.<italic>2980</italic> (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>). Using <italic>Leishmania mexicana</italic> sequence information, the gene fragment <italic>LMIT1</italic>, coding for a 291 amino acid mitoferrin homolog, was amplified from the <italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic> genome. ClustalW analysis using protein sequences of yeast mrs3, human mitoferrin-1 and their trypanosomatid homologs showed a high degree of conservation (~31% identity and 50% similarity with yeast mrs3; ~33% identity and 48% similarity with human mitoferrin-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Three copies of the Px(D/E)xx(K/)c(K/R) motif and the critical substrate contact point II residues M-N, unique signatures for mitochondrial carrier proteins coordinating iron transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref013">13</xref>], were also conserved in the trypanosomatid proteins.

<p>In contrast to mitoferrin homologs from other organisms, all three trypanosomatid MIT1 proteins lacked any identifiable mitochondrial targeting signals. To investigate this issue, promastigotes of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> were transfected with an episomal plasmid encoding LMIT1-3xFLAG, and subjected to sub-cellular fractionation after solubilization with increasing concentrations of digitonin, a method previous validated for generating mitochondrial fractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref016">16</xref>]. Western blot using antibodies against the cytoplasmic enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref017">17</xref>] and the mitochondrial protein Ldp27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref016">16</xref>] demonstrated that full separation of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins was achieved with 1 mg/ml digitonin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The LMIT1-3xFLAG protein co-fractionated along with Ldp27 in the mitochondria-enriched fraction. To further confirm the localization of LMIT1-3xFLAG, anti-FLAG antibodies were used to stain the parasites after labeling with the mitochondrial marker MitoTracker Red. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, the tagged version of LMIT1 was targeted to the parasite’s mitochondria.</p>
<p>To investigate the function of <italic>LMIT1</italic>, we performed complementation assays on yeast strains lacking the mitochondrial iron carrier proteins mrs3 and mrs4. This double deletion strain has a severe growth defect under low iron that can be restored by <italic>mrs3</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref019">19</xref>]. As expected, under limited iron availability (regular growth medium containing the iron chelator BPS) a plasmid driving mrs3 expression rescued the growth of <italic>Δmrs3Δmrs4</italic> yeast more efficiently than the strain transformed with empty pYES2 vector. Importantly, <italic>Δmrs3Δmrs4</italic> yeast cells expressing LMIT1 grew at rates comparable to cells complemented with mrs3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Since no differences were observed when all three yeast strains were grown in regular iron-containing medium, this result indicates that the rescue of <italic>Δmrs3Δmrs4</italic> growth in low iron can be attributed to the ability of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> LMIT1 to promote iron import into mitochondria.</p>

<title><italic>MIT1</italic> expression is essential for the procyclic, but not the bloodstream form of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic></title>
<p>Given the high sequence identity between <italic>Leishmania LMIT1 (LmxM</italic>.<italic>08_29</italic>.<italic>2780)</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei MIT1</italic> (<italic>Tb927</italic>.<italic>3</italic>.<italic>2980</italic>), we performed conditional RNAi-mediated knockdown of the <italic>TbMIT1</italic> gene in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> to further investigate the importance of this gene in mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial metabolism differs significantly between the two stages of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> lifecycle. The procyclic form has fully functional mitochondria that house the oxidative phosphorylation machinery involved in ATP generation, primarily through proline catabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref020">20</xref>]. In contrast, in the bloodstream form ATP generation occurs mainly through the breakdown of glucose within the glycosome, a peroxisome-related organelle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref022">22</xref>]. Bloodstream stages lack the respiratory complexes III and IV that are present in procyclics, and although complex I appears to be present, there is no evidence that it contributes to electron transport activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref023">23</xref>]. Thus, the lack of <italic>TbMIT1</italic> expression was predicted to have a stronger impact in procyclics when compared to bloodstream forms.</p>
<p>Tetracycline-induced RNAi knockdown of TbMIT1 in procyclics caused an initial decline in parasite growth by day 3, when compared to cultures grown without the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). By days 4 and 5 cell numbers had further declined and morphologically abnormal cells with signs of degeneration (such as extensive vacuolation) were increasingly abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g002">Fig 2A and 2Ed</xref>). Estimation of <italic>TbMIT1</italic> transcript levels by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) confirmed a reduction of &gt;90% 48 h after tetracycline induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). By day 3 major changes could also be seen in the ultrastructure of mitochondria, with swelling, lower electron density and loss of cristae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g002">Fig 2Ee–2Eh</xref>) evident when compared to mitochondria of uninduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g002">Fig 2Ea–2Ec</xref>). The mitochondria of tetracyclin-induced procyclics also frequently contained dark electron dense aggregates and membrane whorls that were previously described as disrupted cristae associated with dysfunctional mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref024">24</xref>]. No obvious abnormalities were noticed in the ultrastructure of other organelles such as the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, flagellum, and acidocalcisomes, suggesting that disruption of MIT1 function specifically affected the mitochondria of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> procyclic forms. In contrast, no significant difference in growth rate was observed between tetracycline-induced and un-induced bloodstream forms subjected to the same RNAi procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Consistent with the limited mitochondrial functionality observed in bloodstream forms, in this life-cycle stage <italic>TbMIT1</italic> transcript levels were significantly lower (&gt;5 fold) than in procyclics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>).</p>

<title>Deletion of a single <italic>LMIT1</italic> allele impairs growth, alters ROS homeostasis and interferes with the ability of promastigotes to undergo iron-dependent differentiation to amastigotes</title>
<p>Unlike <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, <italic>Leishmania</italic> has fully functional mitochondria in all life cycle stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref016">16</xref>]. To understand the role of LMIT1, we proceeded to generate <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> strains lacking both <italic>LMIT1</italic> alleles through homologous recombination, using knockout constructs carrying drug-resistance gene cassettes flanked by 5’ and 3‘ UTR regions of the <italic>LMIT1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005340.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Replacement of a single <italic>LMIT1</italic> allele was achieved using either the <italic>PHLEO</italic> or <italic>NEO</italic> drug resistance gene cassettes. Allelic integration of the knockout construct into the desired gene locus was confirmed by PCR using specific primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005340.s001">S1B Fig</xref>), and the resulting <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> strain showed the expected reduction in <italic>LMIT1</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005340.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). However, repeated attempts to replace the second allele to generate a <italic>LMIT1</italic> null strain were unsuccessful. Even when strains resistant to both Phleomycin and Neomycin were obtained and replacement of the second allele with the targeting drug-resistance marker was confirmed by PCR, amplification of the <italic>LMIT1</italic> gene was still possible with primers specific for its coding region, suggesting the occurrence of gene duplication, as previously reported for other essential <italic>Leishmania</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1 L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> promastigotes showed a normal log phase of growth, but reached stationary phase at a lower cell density (~4–5 x 10<sup>7</sup>/ml) when compared to wild type (~8 x10<sup>7</sup>/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). This defect was partially restored when <italic>LMIT1</italic> was episomally expressed to compensate for the loss of the single <italic>LMIT1</italic> allele (<italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic>+<italic>LMIT1</italic>). This result suggested that LMIT1 plays a role in promastigote survival as they reach the stationary phase of growth, when nutrients (including iron) are depleted from the medium. Ferrozine assays revealed that whole cell lysates of promastigotes that had entered stationary phase (day 4) had a significantly higher iron content when compared to wild type (WT) or complemented <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic>+<italic>LMIT1</italic> cells, indicating a possible over-accumulation of iron in the cytoplasm due to reduced iron transport into mitochondria. However, at this life-cycle stage (stationary phase promastigotes) no difference was observed in the iron content of mitochondria-enriched fractions from the three strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>We previously reported that culture of wild type <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> under low iron conditions promotes ROS generation and a reduction in the ability of promastigotes to sustain replication. Under these conditions, the parasites increased their rate of iron uptake, upregulated activity of the ROS detoxification enzyme FeSOD and entered a differentiation pathway that resulted in the generation of amastigote forms. In contrast, parasites lacking the <italic>Leishmania</italic> plasma membrane iron transporter LIT1 failed to upregulate FeSOD activity and accumulated high levels of superoxide, which resulted in massive cell death. These findings led us to suggest that mitochondria is the major site where ROS is generated during cellular stress, and that iron entry into this organelle is essential for activation of the mitochondrial FeSODA and generation of the signaling agonist H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref008">8</xref>]. To test whether LMIT1 corresponds to the mitochondrial iron transporter involved in this process, we treated promastigotes from wild type, <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> and <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic>+<italic>LMIT1</italic> strains with increasing concentrations of the mitochondrial superoxide generator menadione, and assessed whether loss of one <italic>LMIT1</italic> allele affected the parasite’s ability to survive. <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> promastigotes were more sensitive to menadione when compared to wild type, and <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic>+<italic>LMIT1</italic> showed an intermediate phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>When grown in iron depleted media, <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> promastigotes grew at a faster rate reaching higher concentrations (~3.5 x10<sup>7</sup>/ml) relative to wild type (~1.4 x10<sup>7</sup>/ml) on day 2, followed by a sudden decline in population size after day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). This pattern of initial accelerated growth followed by cell death is similar (but not identical) to what was earlier observed with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> promastigotes lacking the plasma membrane iron transporter LIT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref008">8</xref>]. Microscopic analysis of viable cells in these iron-depleted cultures revealed that while about 30% (day 4) and 55% (day 5) of the wild type parasites had transformed into amastigote-like rounded forms lacking an evident flagellum, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref008">8</xref>]. In contrast, most cells in <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> cultures retained their promastigote-like morphology with long flagella, with only ~20% appearing as round/aflagellate forms on days 4 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). The complemented strain <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1+LMIT1</italic> showed an intermediate phenotype in both assays, confirming the ability of LMIT1 to partially rescue the altered responses of <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> promastigotes to iron depletion. Collectively, these data suggest that iron import into mitochondria by LMIT1 plays an important role in detoxifying superoxide radicals and in iron/ROS-induced differentiation of promastigotes into infective amastigotes.</p>

<p>To check for possible mitochondrial functional abnormalities in metacyclic promastigotes, stationary phase parasites were treated with JC-1, a dye that exhibits membrane potential-dependent accumulation in mitochondria. A reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>), a signature of impending mitochondrial failure, is indicated by a decrease in the 530/590 nm fluorescence emission ratio of JC-1. Although a slight reduction in ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> was observed for <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> parasites when compared to the wild type and add-back <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1+LMIT1</italic> strains, the difference was not statistically significant (Student’s t-test p = 0.47) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). In contrast, a strong ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> drop was observed for all three strains following treatment with CCCP, a mitochondrial membrane potential uncoupler (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Antimycin A, a complex III respiratory chain inhibitor, caused a partial reduction in ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> in the wild type and add-back <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1+LMIT1</italic> strains and a more severe effect in the <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic>strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), suggesting that the mitochondrial function of <italic>LMIT1</italic> single knock-out stationary phase promastigotes is more vulnerable to stress. However, the aconitase activity in mitochondria-enriched fractions prepared from wild type, <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> and <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1+LMIT1</italic> stationary phase promastigotes was very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), indicating that the functionality of Fe-S cluster proteins remained unaffected at this life-cycle stage. Labeling with the mitochondria specific stains MitoTracker Green (which localizes to mitochondria independently of the membrane potential) and MitoTracker Red CMXRos (that accumulates in mitochondria through a mechanism dependent on membrane potential) showed no distinguishable differences in the shape and volume of mitochondria between stationary phase promastigotes from the three strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005340.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). TEM analysis also showed normal ultrastructure, including the presence of normal cristae, in mitochondria from wild type and <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). When purified metacyclics were used to infect bone marrow derived mouse macrophages (BMM), <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> parasites showed a strong defect in intracellular replication as amastigotes, a defect fully rescued in the <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1+LMIT1</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). This result indicates that high levels of LMIT1 protein are likely to be necessary for the intracellular differentiation of metacyclic promastigotes into amastigotes capable of replicating inside PVs of macrophages.</p>

<title><italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> parasites show defective mitochondrial function when induced to differentiate axenically to infective amastigotes</title>
<p>The results discussed above showed that <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> promastigotes are defective in iron/ROS-dependent axenic differentiation into amastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g003">Fig 3E</xref>), and also cannot replicate as intracellular amastigotes after infecting macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Next, we examined whether loss of one <italic>LMIT1</italic> allele also affected the axenic differentiation of <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> promastigotes into amastigotes using the classical differentiation protocol based on shifting late log phase promastigote cultures (pH 7.4 at 26°C) to conditions mimicking the macrophage intracellular environment (pH 4.5 at 32°C). After an initial lag period of 48 h the wild type parasites replicated steadily in amastigote medium, with a doubling time of ~14 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> cells showed a longer delay (up to 72 h) and very little growth subsequently, reaching cell densities about 6 fold lower than what was observed with the wild type strain at 96 h. At the 48 h time point &gt;90% of the wild type population developed the characteristic amastigote morphology (rounding of the body and shortening of flagella) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). In contrast, only ~55% of viable <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> cells underwent a similar morphological change during this period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). The few <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> parasites that succeeded in acquiring the amastigote morphology appeared to be able to replicate axenically, as indicated by the small cell population increase observed by 96 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The complemented <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1+LMIT1</italic> parasites also initiated replication after the first 48 h, and &gt;80% of the parasite population acquired the amastigote morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g005">Fig 5A–5C</xref>). Staining with reporter dyes indicated that after loss of one <italic>LMIT1</italic> allele <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> parasites were still viable by 48 h, based on fluorescein diacetate labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). However, by 48 h amastigote membrane integrity started to get compromised, with ~25% of the <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> parasites staining positive for propidium iodide (PI), compared to less than 3% in wild type or <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1+LMIT1</italic> cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). To avoid any effects of reduced viability, determinations of iron content and aconitase activity were performed in parasites induced to differentiate for only 24 h, incubation at pH 4.5 and 32°C. Ferrozine assays revealed a significant reduction in the iron content of mitochondrial fractions from <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> axenic amastigotes, when compared to wild type and <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1+LMIT1</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Consistent with this result, there was also a significant reduction in activity of the Fe-S cluster enzyme aconitase in mitochondrial fractions of <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> axenic amastigotes, compared to wild type or the <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1+LMIT1</italic> complemented strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Assessment of mitochondrial membrane potential with the JC-1 dye also revealed a significant drop in ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> in 48 h <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> cultures when compared to wild type, a phenotype that was rescued in the complemented <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1+LMIT1</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). The few <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> parasites that appeared able to transform into amastigotes by 96 h were incapable of replicating intracellularly in macrophages when compared to wild type, and this defect was partially reversed in the <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1+LMIT1</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g005">Fig 5H</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> amastigotes, either generated intracellularly or axenically, require high levels of LMIT1 expression for maintenance of normal mitochondrial function, replication and survival.</p>

<title>Inability to upregulate FeSOD activity is associated with mitochondrial damage in amastigotes</title>
<p>The higher sensitivity of <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> promastigotes to the mitochondrial superoxide generator menadione (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) suggested that mitochondrial iron uptake mediated by LMIT1 plays an important role in activation of mitochondrial FeSODA for detoxification of harmful radicals. Given the strong requirement for LMIT1 function in amastigotes, we investigated whether the upregulation of FeSOD activity normally seen during axenic amastigote differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref005">5</xref>] was also affected in the <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> strain. SOD activity was measured in whole extracts of parasites collected at different time points following the pH and temperature shift. Wild type parasites showed a steady increase in SOD activity up to 48 h, after which the activity remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). On the other hand, FeSOD activity in <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> parasites was slightly higher than wild type at the onset of the differentiation process (0 h), but did not increase by 48 h and was lower by 72 h, possibly as a consequence of reduced viability of the cells at that late time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The complemented <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1+LMIT1</italic> strain showed a smaller increase in FeSOD activity when compared to wild type, but reached levels significantly higher than <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> parasites by 48–72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The lack of FeSOD upregulation in <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> parasites undergoing axenic amastigote differentiation correlated with ultrastructural alterations in mitochondria, which appeared enlarged, with lower electron density and containing dense aggregates, when compared to wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Other cellular structures including the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, acidocalcisomes, lipid droplets and flagellum appeared normal in <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> parasites, providing further evidence that reduction in LMIT1 expression levels has a specific deleterious effect on mitochondria, an effect likely to be related to oxidative damage resulting from reduction in iron availability to activate FeSODA.</p>

<title><italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1 L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> has a strong virulence defect <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>To determine how deletion of one <italic>LMIT1</italic> allele affected the ability of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> to infect mice, purified metacyclic promastigotes were injected into footpads of C57BL/6 mice, and cutaneous lesion development was followed for 11 weeks. As expected, the wild type strain induced the formation of progressive lesions during this period. In contrast, no detectable lesions were observed in the mice injected with <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> or with <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1+LMIT1</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Since lesion size is only an indirect reflection of the actual numbers of parasites in the tissues, after the mice were sacrificed 11 weeks after infection footpads were removed and the parasite load was estimated by the limiting dilution method. Consistent with the marked reduction in lesion development, the parasite burden in animals infected with <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> parasites was &gt;10<sup>5</sup> fold lower than in mice infected with the wild type strain. Moreover, despite the lack of detectable lesions in mice injected with the <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1+LMIT1</italic> strain, the tissue load data revealed a 10–100 fold, statistically significant increase in parasite numbers for the add-back strain, when compared to <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Western blot analysis showed comparable levels of episomally expressed LMIT1-HA protein in <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1+LMIT1</italic> parasites injected into footpads and subsequently recovered from the tissues, indicating that there was no loss of LMIT1 expression <italic>in vivo</italic> in the complemented strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, inset). In agreement with this result, when inoculated into the more susceptible Balb/c mouse strain <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1+LMIT1</italic> metacyclics were more efficient than <italic>LMIT1/Δlmit1</italic> in inducing lesions over a 13 week time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g007">Fig 7C</xref>) and showed a &gt;10<sup>9</sup> fold higher tissue parasite load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005340.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). These results suggest that the LMIT1 protein must be expressed at a minimum threshold level to allow the parasites to overcome the stringent conditions encountered in mouse tissues, and survive and replicate intracellularly as amastigotes. The inability to fully restore virulence through episomal expression of <italic>LMIT1</italic> was not surprising, considering that a lack of robust complementation is a common observation in transgenic <italic>Leishmania</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref029">29</xref>].</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this study is the first demonstration that functional mitochondrial iron transporters homologous to mitoferrin are expressed in trypanosomatid parasites. The <italic>Leishmania</italic> LMIT1 protein localizes to the parasite’s mitochondria, rescues the growth defect of a mitoferrin-deficient yeast strain, and its close ortholog <italic>Tb927</italic>.<italic>3</italic>.<italic>2980</italic> in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> is essential for the survival of procyclic forms but dispensable in bloodstream stages that have rudimentary mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref022">22</xref>]. In agreement with the importance of mitochondrial function in all life cycle stages of <italic>Leishmania</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref030">30</xref>], loss of one <italic>LMIT1</italic> allele caused promastigote growth defects, defective amastigote development and severe loss of virulence. Our results are consistent with earlier studies in other systems that identified a direct correlation between rates of mitochondrial iron uptake and increased mitochondrial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>In vertebrates, import of iron into mitochondria occurs via two mitochondrial transporters termed mitoferrin-1 (Mfrn1) and mitoferrin-2 (Mfrn2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref034">34</xref>]. Both carriers are located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mfrn1 is expressed at high levels in erythroid cells and is essential for erythropoiesis, while Mfrn2 is ubiquitously expressed and essential for viability in the absence of Mfrn1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref032">32</xref>]. Loss of <italic>Mfrn1</italic> in zebrafish and in mice results in severe reduction of mitochondrial iron in erythroid progenitor cells, and in impaired heme and ISC synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref032">32</xref>]. In yeast, the mitoferrin homologs <italic>mrs3p</italic> and <italic>mrs4p</italic> are required for iron import into mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref019">19</xref>], and the poor growth of deletion mutants in low iron can be corrected by expression of vertebrate mitoferrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref035">35</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila</italic> has a single mitoferrin gene that causes partial lethality when deleted and impaired spermatogenesis when expressed at low levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref036">36</xref>]. Our inability to generate viable <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis LMIT1</italic> null mutants suggests that mitochondrial iron import is also essential in promastigotes of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic>.</p>
<p>The reduction in growth rate observed as <italic>Leishmania</italic> promastigotes reach stationary phase may be attributed to increased oxidative stress, resulting from the elevated levels of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity observed at this stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref016">16</xref>]. Thus, an early increase in ROS stress might explain why LMIT1 single knockout promastigotes reach stationary phase prematurely, when compared to wild type. A reduced demand for mitochondrial activity due to cessation of promastigote division may have allowed for sufficient mitochondrial function to support development of metacyclics in <italic>LMIT1</italic> single knockout strains. The subsequent drastic reduction in virulence observed after <italic>LMIT1</italic> single knockout metacyclics were used to infect C57BL/6 mice or bone-marrow macrophages suggests that the mitochondrial iron requirement varies during the <italic>Leishmania</italic> life cycle, being particularly important during differentiation to the amastigote form.</p>
<p><italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> promastigotes lacking one <italic>LMIT1</italic> allele were more sensitive to menadione, a drug that causes accumulation of superoxide anion radicals in mitochondria. This phenotype was most likely due to a role of LMT1 in promoting iron entry into mitochondria and activation of FeSODA, the <italic>Leishmania</italic> SOD isoform that catalyzes breakdown of superoxide within mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref009">9</xref>]. Supporting this view, <italic>LMIT1</italic> single knockout strains did not upregulate FeSOD activity when cultivated under axenic conditions that promote promastigote-amastigote differentiation (elevated temperature and acidic pH), a response normally observed in wild type strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref004">4</xref>]. Differentiation into axenic amastigotes was also impaired, and associated with ultrastructural changes in mitochondrial morphology. <italic>LMIT1</italic> single knockout parasites also did not undergo a normal transition from promastigote to amastigote when grown in iron-depleted media, a process that we previously showed to be regulated by iron uptake and FeSOD-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref008">8</xref>]. Thus, our study strengthens the conclusion that mitochondria represent the major site where superoxide anion is generated and then converted into H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref007">7</xref>], which can act as a signaling molecule for differentiation of infective amastigote stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Extensive evidence indicates that access to iron is critical for <italic>Leishmania</italic>, particularly for intracellular amastigotes residing within macrophage PVs. Mutations in Nramp1, a macrophage late endosomal iron transporter, increase host susceptibility to <italic>Leishmania</italic> infections by inhibiting iron removal from PVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref037">37</xref>]. Conversely, <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> lacking the plasma membrane ferrous iron transporter LIT1 have a strong defect in intracellular replication and virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref038">38</xref>]. Infection with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonensis</italic> also inhibits expression of the macrophage iron exporter ferroportin, a process that facilitates amastigote replication by increasing the availability of iron in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref039">39</xref>]. The present study significantly expands our understanding of <italic>Leishmania</italic> iron acquisition mechanisms, by identifying LMIT1 as a mitoferrin-like transporter that promotes iron entry into the parasite’s mitochondria. This conclusion is strengthened by our results showing that LMIT1 is required for normal functioning of the TCA cycle, the respiratory chain, and for upregulation of FeSOD activity.</p>
<p>The conservation of <italic>MIT1</italic> in several trypanosomatid genomes suggests a common mechanism of mitochondrial iron import despite variations in the pathways by which iron initially enters the parasites. <italic>Leishmania</italic> express the plasma membrane proteins LFR1 (ferric iron reductase—[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref040">40</xref>]) and LIT1 (ferrous iron transporter—[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref038">38</xref>]) which promote iron delivery directly into the parasite’s cytosol. In contrast, the bloodstream form of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> acquires iron by endocytosis of holotransferrin through transferrin receptors (Tfr) in the flagellar pocket. Once internalized, holotransferrin is handled similarly as to what occurs in mammalian cells, with translocation of soluble iron from endosomes to the cytosol through the action of an endosomal ferric reductase and a divalent cation transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref041">41</xref>]. How <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> procyclics acquire iron is not yet fully understood, since transferrin uptake is absent in these insect forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref042">42</xref>]. The possible existence in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> procyclics of a <italic>Leishmania</italic>-like machinery for iron uptake has been suggested, based on presence of several putative ZIP domain divalent metal ion transporters, a ferric reductase (LFR1 homolog) and evidence for iron uptake from ferric complexes via a reductive mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref043">43</xref>]. Our identification of the highly conserved MIT1 protein suggests that regardless of the mechanism by which iron enters cells, all trypanosomatids import iron from the cytosol into mitochondria utilizing a mitoferrin-like transporter, similarly to what occurs in vertebrates.</p>
<p><italic>Tb927</italic>.<italic>3</italic>.<italic>2980</italic>, a <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> gene previously identified in a genome-wide mitochondrial carrier inventory and designated as <italic>TbMCP17</italic>, was proposed to correspond to a mitochondrial iron transporter based on its similarity to mitoferrin. However, <italic>TbMCP17</italic> expression and functional information was not available in that initial study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref014">14</xref>]. Our inducible RNAi assays now validate the role of <italic>Tb927</italic>.<italic>3</italic>.<italic>2980</italic> (here designated as <italic>TbMIT1</italic>) as the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> mitoferrin-like mitochondrial iron transporter, by demonstrating that it is essential for viability of the procyclic form. Our assays showed a delay between the loss of <italic>TbMIT1</italic> transcripts (day 2) and appearance of a survival/growth phenotype in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> procyclics (day 4). This may be attributed to a long half-life of the TbMIT1 protein, or to a gradual accumulation of mitochondrial damage that ultimately led to mortality. This latter scenario is in agreement with the limited role of mitochondria in energy transduction reported for African trypanosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref045">45</xref>]. <italic>Leishmania</italic>, in contrast, is heavily reliant on mitochondrial activity throughout its life cycle and particularly as amastigotes, which undergo stringent metabolic adjustments to life inside the PV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref046">46</xref>]. Intracellular amastigotes are more dependent on the TCA cycle and mitochondrial respiration than on glycolysis for energy production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref047">47</xref>]. A functional electron transfer chain was also proposed to be important for maintenance of a neutral intracellular pH (6.5–7.4) in amastigotes replicating in the acidic PV of macrophages (pH 4.5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref048">48</xref>]. Furthermore, the iron-dependent TCA cycle enzyme aconitase is increasingly required to synthesize glutamate, a precursor of the anti-oxidant molecule trypanothione, as transporter-mediated uptake of this amino acid is downregulated in amastigotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref030">30</xref>]. Thus, taken together with the strict iron requirement for activity of FeSODA within mitochondria, these earlier findings are fully consistent with the phenotype we observed in <italic>LMIT1</italic> single knockout mutants, which are partially deficient in that mitochondrial iron transporter.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to determine if the 40% decrease in FeSOD activity that we detected in <italic>LMIT1</italic> single knockout parasites undergoing axenic differentiation can be attributed to changes in mitochondrial FeSODA, without a contribution of the glycosomal FeSODB isoform. In other eukaryotes it is possible to biochemically distinguish between mitochondrial and other cellular SODs, based on the different metals used as cofactors. This distinction is not possible with trypanosomatid enzymes, as both SODs require exclusively iron for activity. However, the mitochondrial alterations we observed in single knockout <italic>LMIT1</italic> parasites incubated at elevated temperature/low pH resemble the previously reported consequences of iron depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref049">49</xref>] or ROS damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref050">50</xref>], increasing the likelihood that lack of iron to activate mitochondrial FeSODA is a major event underlying the phenotype of <italic>LMIT1</italic> single knockout mutants. Studies in yeast revealed a similar role for mitoferrin in activating mitochondrial FeSOD of bacterial origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref031">31</xref>]. Further supporting this view, superoxide generation generated by mitochondrial hyper-polarization during exposure of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>infantum</italic> to elevated temperature could be countered by overexpression of mitochondrial FeSODA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref051">51</xref>]. In this study, by identifying and characterizing LMIT1 as a mitochondrial iron importer, we established a direct connection between iron uptake, mitochondrial redox balance and the development of virulence in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, significantly expanding future options for controlling these serious human infections.</p>

Following a four-part ligation using PCR amplified 5’ and 3’ flanking sequences, drug resistance cassettes and the plasmid backbone, positive clones were identified by analyzing SfiI restriction digests of plasmid DNA samples and confirmed by sequencing with specific primers as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref056">56</xref>]. The targeting fragment was liberated by PacI digestion, gel purified and used to transfect <italic>L</italic>. <italic>amazonesis</italic> promastigotes by electroporation as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref038">38</xref>]. <italic>LMIT1</italic> single knockout clones were isolated based on the ability of transformants to grow on agar plates containing Phleomycin (50 μg/ml) or neomycin (50 μg/ml) and analyzed by PCR to verify integration of the drug cassette in the desired location.</p>
<p>For generation of a rescue plasmid expressing <italic>LMIT1</italic> with C-terminal hemaglutinin (HA) tag, a two-step PCR amplification strategy was employed. In the first round, a 873 bp fragment of the <italic>MIT1</italic> ORF was amplified from pLamMIT1 with primers (<italic>FD-Mitoferritin HA</italic>: AA<underline>CCCGGG</underline>ACAT<italic>ATG</italic>TCTGGCAGCACCTCACC (SmaI site underlined) and <italic>RV-Mitoferritin HA</italic>: AGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAAAGCAAGAGACTCTTGT) that allowed for removal of the endogenous stop codon and introduction of an in-frame HA tag.

<title>Assays for mitochondrial activity</title>
<p>Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>) was measured using the MitoProbe JC-1 assay kit (Invitrogen). Mitochondrial import of the JC-1 lipophilic cationic dye depends on the mitochondrial potential and is independent of the size or shape of the organelle. The green fluorescence (emission 530 nm) of the monomeric dye at low concentration changes to red (emission 590 nm) as it accumulates and forms aggregates. Mitochondrial potential is thus determined by calculating the ratio of 590nm/530nm fluorescence readings, which provides an accurate quantitation of the amount of dye imported into the mitochondria. Promastigote cells (1x10<sup>7</sup>) were incubated with 10 μM JC-1 for 15 min at 27°C, washed and resuspended in PBS. Fluorescence measured at 530 and 590 nm using a SpectraMax M5<sup>e</sup> microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices) was used to determine the ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> (530/590 ratio).</p>
<p>To visualize mitochondria and assess their membrane potential, 1x10<sup>7</sup> promastigotes were incubated with 0.1 μM MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Invitrogen) and 0.2 μM MitoTracker Green (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 27°C. After washing the cells with PBS, fluorescence for each dye was measured in a fluorimeter per manufacturer’s protocol (MitoTracker Red: excitation at 579 nm and cut-off filter at 599 nm; MitoTracker Green: excitation at 490 nm and cut-off filter at 516 nm). The stained promastigotes were also were placed in glass-bottom dishes (MatTek corporation) for live imaging on a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope with a 100x NA 1.4 objective (Nikon) equipped with a Hamamatsu C9100-50 camera and mCherry and FITC filters.

<title>Iron measurements and aconitase activity assay</title>
<p>Mitochondria isolation and fractionation was done as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref016">16</xref>] using 5x10<sup>8</sup> promastigotes from stationary phase culture or parasites undergoing axenic differentiation into amastigotes (pH 4.5 at 32°C temperature). The cells were washed three times with MES (20 mM MOPS pH7.0, 250 mM sucrose and 3mM EDTA) and resuspended in 500 μl of MES supplemented with 1 mg/ml digitonin and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Following 5 min incubation at RT, cell suspensions were centrifuged for 5 min (10,000g at 4°C). The supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was washed once with MES buffer and used for further analysis as the mitochondrial fraction.</p>
<p>Estimation of intracellular iron content was performed using a colorimetric ferrozine-based assay described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005340.ref008">8</xref>] using 10<sup>8</sup> parasites. The mitochondrial iron load was determined using mitochondrial-enriched pellets as described earlier. Briefly, whole cells or mitochondrial fractions were lysed with 100 μl of 50 mM NaOH followed by addition of 100 μl 10 mM HCl. 100 μl of iron-releasing solution (prepared by mixing equal volumes of 1.4 M HCl and 4.5% potassium permanganate) was added to the lysates followed by incubation at 60°C for 2 h and addition of 30 μl iron detection reagent containing 6.5 mM ferrozine, 6.5 mM neocuproine, 2.5 M ammonium acetate and 1 M ascorbic acid in water. After 30 min of incubation at RT, 280 μl of each sample was transferred to a 96-well plate, and absorbance at 550-nm wavelength was measured. Iron contents were determined from standard curves generated using ferric chloride solutions of known molarity (0–75 μM).</p>
<p>To measure aconitase activity, the mitochondrial pellet was washed twice with ice-cold 50 mM Tris pH 7.4 buffer containing 0.2 mM sodium citrate, resuspended in 0.2mM sodium citrate and briefly sonicated for 20 s. The suspension was then assayed using the Bioxytech Aconitase-340 assay kit (Precipio Biosciences). Aconitase activity in the mitochondrial lysate converted citrate into isocitrate, which was further converted into α–ketoglutarate by isocitrate dehydrogenase present in the assay mix, with concomitant formation of NADPH from NADP<sup>+</sup> the rate of which was measured by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 340nm.</p>
