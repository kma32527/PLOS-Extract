<abstract>
<p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is capable of infecting nearly every organ in the human body. In order to infiltrate and thrive in such diverse host tissues, staphylococci must possess remarkable flexibility in both metabolic and virulence programs. To investigate the genetic requirements for bacterial survival during invasive infection, we performed a transposon sequencing (TnSeq) analysis of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> during experimental osteomyelitis. TnSeq identified 65 genes essential for staphylococcal survival in infected bone and an additional 148 mutants with compromised fitness <italic>in vivo</italic>. Among the loci essential for <italic>in vivo</italic> survival was SrrAB, a staphylococcal two-component system previously reported to coordinate hypoxic and nitrosative stress responses <italic>in vitro</italic>. Healthy bone is intrinsically hypoxic, and intravital oxygen monitoring revealed further decreases in skeletal oxygen concentrations upon <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infection. The fitness of an <italic>srrAB</italic> mutant during osteomyelitis was significantly increased by depletion of neutrophils, suggesting that neutrophils impose hypoxic and/or nitrosative stresses on invading bacteria. To more globally evaluate staphylococcal responses to changing oxygenation, we examined quorum sensing and virulence factor production in staphylococci grown under aerobic or hypoxic conditions. Hypoxic growth resulted in a profound increase in quorum sensing-dependent toxin production, and a concomitant increase in cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells. Moreover, aerobic growth limited quorum sensing and cytotoxicity in an SrrAB-dependent manner, suggesting a mechanism by which <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> modulates quorum sensing and toxin production in response to environmental oxygenation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that bacterial hypoxic responses are key determinants of the staphylococcal-host interaction.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a leading cause of infectious death, yet is also capable of harmlessly colonizing healthy individuals. These disparate observations imply that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> can modulate its growth and virulence in response to different host environments. To characterize the staphylococcal genetic programs required to sustain invasive infection, we applied a technique known as TnSeq to experimental osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis is one of the most common invasive manifestations of staphylococcal infection, and a better understanding of the bacterial factors required to colonize and destroy bone will aid in vaccine and antimicrobial development. TnSeq identified more than 200 genes important for invasive staphylococcal infection of bone. Two of these genes encode a bacterial two-component system, SrrAB, which is known to help <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> survive in low oxygen. Consistent with this finding, we discovered that oxygen levels in bone decrease during osteomyelitis. Furthermore, we discovered that staphylococcal virulence is augmented by environmental oxygen levels, suggesting one strategy by which <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> can respond to different host environments. Collectively, our results define the genetic and metabolic programs required for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> to sustain invasive infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a major human pathogen, capable of causing a variety of life-threatening, invasive diseases and infecting nearly every organ in the human body. Yet <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> also innocuously colonizes the skin and nares of one-third to one-half of the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref001">1</xref>]. These facts suggest a remarkable flexibility in terms of metabolic and virulence programs, allowing staphylococci to adapt to diverse and changing host environments during invasive infection, while also enabling a commensal lifestyle characterized by low virulence and immunotolerance. The mechanisms by which bacterial pathogens adapt to changing host environments are poorly understood, in part due to the technical difficulty in measuring adaptive responses <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, recent advances in high-throughput sequencing have enabled an unprecedented evaluation of the host-pathogen interface. Transposon sequencing (TnSeq) is a sensitive and high-throughput tool combining highly-saturated transposon mutant libraries with massively-parallel sequencing to calculate the fitness of all nonessential bacterial genes under a given selective pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref002">2</xref>]. TnSeq has been successfully used to determine the bacterial genes required for survival in a number of different <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions and infection models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref007">7</xref>]. More recently, a TnSeq library was generated in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> and used to determine genes contributing to fitness in abscess and infection-related ecologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref008">8</xref>]. These studies illustrate the power of TnSeq analyses to determine the genetic requirements for bacterial adaptation to diverse host environments.</p>
<p>One of the most common invasive disease manifestations of staphylococcal infection is osteomyelitis, and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> is by far the most common pathogen causing musculoskeletal infection. Osteomyelitis causes enormous morbidity, including functional disabilities, the requirement for invasive procedures, and the propensity to evolve into chronic infection even with appropriate management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref010">10</xref>]. Two factors contribute to the therapeutic recalcitrance of osteomyelitis. First, skeletal tissues are intrinsically hypoxic, and bacterial infection further disrupts the vascular architecture of bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref013">13</xref>]. Second, the human skeleton is constantly being remodeled through the opposing actions of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. The kinetics of bone remodeling are affected dramatically by bacterial infection through osteo-immunologic crosstalk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref016">16</xref>]. Thus, pathogens invading the bone must adapt to hypoxia as well as constant shifts in the available host substrates for adhesion and nutrient acquisition. While these factors would seemingly create an inhospitable environment for bacterial proliferation, bone is one of the most common locations of metastatic infection following <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> bacteremia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref017">17</xref>]. One mechanism by which bacterial pathogens adapt to potentially hostile host environments is through the actions of one or more two-component systems (TCSs). Bacterial TCSs consist of a membrane bound histidine kinase sensor, which upon binding of its cognate ligand phosphorylates a response regulator. Response regulators most often function as transcriptional factors, and differentially coordinate changes in gene expression in response to a given stress. We therefore hypothesized that the ability of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> to adapt to changes in available oxygen and shifts in substrate availability in inflamed skeletal tissues may rely on one or more TCSs, and that these responses would be key determinants of pathogenesis during osteomyelitis.</p>
<p>In this study, we employed TnSeq analysis during acute murine osteomyelitis to determine the genetic requirements for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> survival during invasive infection. A large number of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> genes were identified as essential for growth within bone, some of which have previously been implicated in hypoxic responses. Intravital oxygen monitoring was utilized to define changes in tissue oxygenation during osteomyelitis. Finally, we evaluated the effects of changing oxygenation on <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> quorum sensing and virulence factor production. Collectively, these studies determine the staphylococcal genes essential for survival during invasive infection of bone, define shifts in tissue oxygenation during invasive infection, and interrogate the mechanisms by which <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> can modulate its virulence in response to changes in oxygen availability.</p>

<title>Identification of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> genes essential for invasive infection by transposon sequencing (TnSeq) analysis of experimental osteomyelitis</title>
<p>In order to characterize the genes required for invasive <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infection, TnSeq analysis was performed during experimental osteomyelitis using a recently described <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> transposon insertion library in strain HG003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref008">8</xref>]. To identify potential bottlenecks in bacterial survival during osteomyelitis, a timecourse infection was first performed by inoculating murine femurs with strain HG003. An inoculum of 5x10<sup>6</sup> CFU was chosen based on direct comparison with strain LAC, which has served as the wildtype strain in prior osteomyelitis analyses and is representative of the most common lineage (USA300) of strains causing osteomyelitis in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref018">18</xref>]. At days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 12 post-infection, infected femurs were harvested and processed for CFU enumeration. After an initial period of replication from day 1 to day 3 post-infection, decreases in bacterial burdens were noted by days 5 and 12 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005341.s005">S1 Fig</xref></bold>). Day 5 was therefore chosen for TnSeq analysis of acute osteomyelitis, as it likely represents the first bottleneck encountered by invading bacteria. For TnSeq analysis of osteomyelitis, mice were infected with the TnSeq library by direct inoculation into the femur. Five days post-infection, femurs from infected mice were processed for genomic DNA extraction. One limitation of TnSeq analysis during invasive infection is the requirement for an outgrowth step after the recovery of bacteria from infected tissues. Although <italic>in vitro</italic> outgrowth could potentially confound fitness calculations, it is necessary to decrease host DNA contamination and allow for efficient sequencing of microbial DNA, and thus has become a standard practice during TnSeq analysis of invasive infection models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref023">23</xref>]. We opted for a short outgrowth in liquid media to minimize any confounding effects on fitness calculation. For an <italic>in vitro</italic> comparator, an equivalent volume of the osteomyelitis inoculum was grown <italic>in vitro</italic> for 24 hours prior to collection and genomic DNA extraction. To determine mutants with compromised <italic>in vivo</italic> fitness, a “dval” was calculated for each gene in each condition (inoculum, <italic>in vitro</italic> comparator, or osteomyelitis).</p>
<p>A total of 65 genes were found to be essential for survival during osteomyelitis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005341.s001">S1 Table</xref></bold>) but not <italic>in vitro</italic> growth, and mutations in an additional 148 genes resulted in significant <italic>in vivo</italic> compromise relative to the <italic>in vitro</italic> comparator (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005341.s002">S2 Table</xref></bold>). Of the 213 genes identified by TnSeq, 39 essential and 73 compromised genes encode hypothetical proteins, respectively. Of the remaining 101 genes, 12 essential genes and 32 compromised genes have Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) identifiers. Thirty-two of the 44 genes with KEGG identifiers can broadly be categorized into metabolic pathways, with specific pathways represented including carbon metabolism (9 genes), amino acid biosynthesis (7 genes), and the TCA cycle (5 genes). In the TCA cycle, mutations in genes <italic>sucB</italic> (SAOUHSC_01416), <italic>sucC</italic> (SAOUHSC_01216), and <italic>sucD</italic> (SAOUHSC_01218), which encode enzymes responsible for the conversion of α-ketoglutarate to succinate, each resulted in compromised growth during osteomyelitis. Moreover, genes encoding enzymes in pathways that feed into the TCA cycle were also important for intraosseous growth, including pyruvate carboxylase (SAOUHSC_01064 <italic>pyc</italic>), pyruvate dehydrogenase (SAOUHSC_01040 <italic>pdhA</italic>), and a putative malic enzyme (SAOUHSC_01810). Mutations in 7 <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> genes encoding amino acid biosynthesis enzymes compromised bacterial growth during osteomyelitis, yet did not significantly impair growth <italic>in vitro</italic>. These genes encode enzymes in the biosynthetic pathways for tryptophan (SAOUHSC_01369 <italic>trpC</italic>, SAOUHSC_01367 <italic>trpG</italic>, and SAOUHSC_01377), cysteine (SAOUHSC_00488 <italic>cysK</italic>), lysine (SAOUHSC_01868), leucine (SAOUHSC_02288 <italic>leuD</italic>), and the conversion of serine to glycine (SAOUHSC_02354 <italic>glyA</italic>). Mutations in 6 genes encoding components of purine and pyrimidine metabolic pathways resulted in significant <italic>in vivo</italic> compromise during osteomyelitis. Two of these genes (SAOUHSC_02126 <italic>purB</italic>, SAOUHSC_02360 <italic>tdk</italic>) were essential for staphylococcal survival in bone. A substantial portion of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway was also found to be necessary for staphylococcal growth during osteomyelitis. Four of the 12 essential genes with KEGG identifiers and 1 of the mutants with compromised growth are involved in oxidative phosphorylation, including components of quinol oxidase complexes (SAOUHSC_01000 <italic>qoxC</italic>, SAOUHSC_01032 <italic>cydB</italic>), and 3 subunits of the F-type ATPase (SAOUHSC_02340 <italic>atpC</italic>, SAOUHSC_02343 <italic>atpG</italic>, SAOUHSC_02346 <italic>atpH</italic>). Collectively, the results of TnSeq analysis during experimental osteomyelitis suggest broad adaptations in metabolism and energy production are required for staphylococcal survival during invasive infection of bone.</p>
<p>In contrast to an abundance of genes encoding hypothetical proteins or metabolic pathways, relatively few genes encoding known or putative virulence factors were identified by TnSeq as important for staphylococcal survival in bone. Phosphatidylglycerol lysyltransferase, encoded by <italic>mprF</italic> (SAOUHSC_01359), catalyzes the modification of phosphatidylglycerol with L-lysine and contributes to bacterial defenses against neutrophils, cationic antimicrobial peptides, and certain antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref024">24</xref>]. The <italic>mprF</italic> gene was essential for growth during osteomyelitis, suggesting that resistance to antimicrobial peptides and neutrophils are important components of staphylococcal survival in bone. A second virulence-associated gene identified by TnSeq as essential for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> osteomyelitis was <italic>isdF</italic> (SAOUHSC_01087), which encodes a component of the iron-regulated surface determinant heme uptake system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref025">25</xref>]. Interestingly, mutation of the ferric uptake regulator (SAOUHSC_00615 <italic>fur</italic>) gene also resulted in compromised intraosseous growth, illustrating a potential role for iron acquisition in the pathogenesis of staphylococcal osteomyelitis. Mutation in the genes encoding thermonuclease (SAOUHSC_00818 <italic>nuc</italic>), a fibrinogen-binding protein (SAOUHSC_01110), the repressor of toxins (SAOUHSC_01879 <italic>rot</italic>), and two serine proteases (SAOUHSC_01935 <italic>splF</italic>, SAOUHSC_01938 <italic>splD</italic>) also compromised the survival of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> during osteomyelitis.</p>
<p>The genes identified by TnSeq as critical for staphylococcal osteomyelitis encode diverse metabolic processes, hypothetical proteins, and select virulence factors. These results suggest that complex bacterial adaptations occur in response to invasive infection of bone. One mechanism by which bacterial pathogens sense and ultimately respond to host-imposed stresses is through TCSs. We therefore hypothesized that staphylococcal TCSs might coordinate the complex adaptations observed during osteomyelitis. Strikingly, TnSeq analysis identified only one <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> TCS as required for intraosseous survival. The staphylococcal respiratory response (SrrAB) system is involved in coordination of the staphylococcal response to hypoxia and other stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref026">26</xref>], and has been shown to directly regulate select virulence factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref027">27</xref>]. Both the histidine kinase (<italic>srrB</italic>) and the response regulator (<italic>srrA</italic>) components of the SrrAB locus were essential for staphylococcal survival in bone, implying that this TCS might be particularly important for coordination of the metabolic and virulence adaptations to intraosseous growth (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005341.s001">S1 Table</xref></bold>). In total, these results reveal the power of TnSeq analysis to identify <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> genes required for invasive infection of bone.</p>

<title>SrrAB differentially regulates <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> genes under aerobic and hypoxic growth, and is required for survival during osteomyelitis</title>
<p>Among the mutants that exhibited decreased survival in the osteomyelitis model, we identified a single TCS, SrrAB, which coordinates responses to hypoxia and nitrosative stress <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref026">26</xref>]. Moreover, mutations in two additional genes regulated by SrrAB specifically under conditions of nitrosative stress, <italic>cydB</italic> and <italic>qoxC</italic>, also resulted in significantly decreased fitness during osteomyelitis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005341.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005341.s002">S2</xref> Tables</bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref026">26</xref>]. Bone and bone marrow are intrinsically hypoxic, leading to the hypothesis that SrrAB contributes to osteomyelitis pathogenesis by sensing and responding to changes in environmental oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref028">28</xref>]. Because the SrrAB regulon was previously defined under conditions of nitrosative stress, we sought to further define the oxygen-dependent SrrAB regulon by performing global transcriptional analysis of a clinically relevant strain (LAC) in comparison to a mutant strain lacking <italic>srrAB</italic> expression (Δ<italic>srrA</italic>) in both aerobic and hypoxic growth conditions. Inactivation of <italic>srrAB</italic> under aerobic conditions resulted in the differential regulation of 64 genes (39 transcripts increased in abundance and 25 decreased in abundance upon inactivation of <italic>srrAB</italic>) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005341.s003">S3 Table</xref></bold>). Under hypoxic growth conditions, <italic>srrAB</italic> inactivation led to differential regulation of 78 genes (22 transcripts increased in abundance and 56 decreased in abundance) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005341.s004">S4 Table</xref></bold>). Of the genes differentially regulated by SrrAB under aerobic or hypoxic conditions, only 16 were previously identified as members of the SrrAB regulon under nitrosative stress, suggesting that specific stresses might invoke different SrrAB-dependent transcriptional responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref026">26</xref>]. Moreover, by defining the SrrAB regulon under aerobic versus hypoxic conditions, we discovered that an additional 7 genes important for survival during osteomyelitis in the TnSeq dataset are also SrrAB-regulated (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005341.s003">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005341.s004">S4</xref> Tables</bold>). The requirement of multiple genes in the SrrAB regulon for survival during osteomyelitis suggests that the SrrAB TCS is an important orchestrator of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> stress responses in inflamed skeletal tissues.</p>
<p>Previous reports have demonstrated a significant defect in the growth of an <italic>srrAB</italic> mutant under anaerobic conditions but not under hypoxic growth conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref029">29</xref>]. To confirm that SrrAB was not found to be essential in the TnSeq analysis simply because of a defect in growth, the Δ<italic>srrA</italic> polar transposon mutant and mutations in known genes of the SrrAB regulon (<italic>pflA</italic>, <italic>pflB</italic>, <italic>qoxA</italic>, and <italic>qoxC</italic>) were analyzed in the LAC strain background. The growth rate of each mutant under aerobic or hypoxic conditions was monitored over time. Under aerobic and hypoxic growth conditions, Δ<italic>srrA</italic> had an enhanced lag phase compared to WT but reached equivalent optical densities to WT by 8 hours (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005341.s006">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). The Δ<italic>qoxA</italic> and Δ<italic>qoxC</italic> mutants were unable to reach maximal optical densities as previously reported due to disruption of the electron transport chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref026">26</xref>]. These results indicate that an <italic>srrAB</italic> mutant is not impaired for growth under hypoxia, further validating our TnSeq methods.</p>
<p>To investigate the role of SrrAB in osteomyelitis in a clinically-relevant background without the potentially confounding influence of competition from other mutants in the TnSeq library, groups of mice were infected with either WT or Δ<italic>srrA</italic> in the LAC background. At 5 or 14 days post-infection, femurs were either processed to quantify bacterial burdens or subjected to micro-computed tomography (microCT) imaging (day 14) for quantification of cortical bone destruction. Inactivation of SrrAB resulted in a significant reduction in bacterial burdens in infected femurs at both 5 and 14 days post-infection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005341.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). Moreover, murine femurs infected with Δ<italic>srrA</italic> sustain significantly less cortical bone destruction than WT-infected femurs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005341.g001">Fig 1B–1D</xref></bold>). These results demonstrate that SrrAB is critical for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> survival in infected bone and for induction of pathologic changes in bone remodeling during osteomyelitis. Furthermore, the data suggest that staphylococci encounter hypoxic and/or nitrosative stresses during osteomyelitis.</p>

<title><italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> osteomyelitis triggers reduced oxygen availability in skeletal tissues</title>
<p>Normal bone and bone marrow are intrinsically hypoxic, with a physiologic oxygen concentration range of 11.7 to 48.9 mmHg (1.5–6.4% O<sub>2</sub>), compared to atmospheric oxygen at approximately 160 mmHg (21% O<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref028">28</xref>].

In order to determine the oxygen concentrations of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infected murine femurs during osteomyelitis, an Oxylite monitor was used to record oxygen tensions at the inoculation site at various times post-infection.

As infection progressed, the infectious focus became increasingly hypoxic, with an average oxygen tension of 14.3 mmHg at 10 days post-infection. This decreased oxygen tension was not due to the trauma induced by the inoculation procedure, as mock-infected bone showed an elevated mean pO<sub>2</sub> of 77.5 mmHg by 4 days post-procedure (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005341.g002">Fig 2</xref></bold>).

<title>Neutrophil depletion rescues the intraosseous growth defect of an <italic>srr</italic> mutant</title>
<p>Intravital oxygen monitoring revealed hypoxia of skeletal tissues upon infection with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, suggesting that inflammation triggers a reduction in skeletal oxygen concentrations. Neutrophils are a significant source of both oxidative and nitrosative stresses <italic>in vivo</italic> and contribute to formation of oxygen-limited abscesses in response to staphylococcal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref030">30</xref>].

<title><italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> modulates quorum sensing and exotoxin production in response to oxygenation</title>
<p>The observation that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infection of murine skeletal tissues leads to dramatically reduced oxygen concentrations prompted further evaluations of how oxygenation impacts the production of staphylococcal virulence factors. We previously demonstrated that secreted toxins regulated by the accessory gene regulator (<italic>agr</italic>) locus are particularly important for the pathogenesis of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> osteomyelitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref033">33</xref>]. The <italic>agr</italic> locus (<italic>agrABCD</italic>) encodes a quorum sensing system coupled to a TCS, and is responsible for growth phase-dependent regulation of a number of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> virulence factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref034">34</xref>]. The response regulator of the <italic>agr</italic> locus, AgrA, directly regulates the production of alpha-type phenol soluble modulins (PSMs), which contribute significantly to the pathology of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> osteomyelitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref035">35</xref>]. Indeed, alpha-type PSMs were found to be the sole mediators of cytotoxicity in concentrated culture supernatant towards murine and human osteoblasts <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref032">32</xref>]. However, a recent report demonstrated that alpha-type PSM expression is directly linked to alpha toxin (Hla) expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref036">36</xref>]. To verify that PSMs are the sole mediators of cytotoxicity toward osteoblastic cells in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> concentrated supernatants, strain LAC<italic>Δpsmα1–4</italic> (Δ<italic>psm</italic>) containing the overexpression vector pOS1-<italic>p</italic>lgt driving <italic>hla</italic> expression in trans was tested for cytotoxicity towards osteoblastic cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005341.s007">S3 Fig</xref></bold>). While WT supernatant displayed maximum cytotoxicity, Δ<italic>psm</italic> and Δ<italic>psm</italic> pOS1-<italic>p</italic>lgt-<italic>hla</italic> did not show significantly different cytotoxicity from control.

This decrease was partially SrrAB dependent, as aerobically grown Δ<italic>srrA</italic> strains demonstrate a 2-fold higher expression of <italic>agr</italic>P3 than aerobic WT cultures (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005341.g006">Fig 6B</xref></bold>). To further confirm these results, quantitative RT-PCR was conducted on aerobically and hypoxically grown cultures of WT and Δ<italic>srrA</italic>. Transcription of <italic>agrA</italic> was increased relative to aerobically grown WT for both Δ<italic>srrAB</italic> and hypoxically grown cultures. Hypoxically grown cultures also demonstrated significantly elevated levels of <italic>psmα</italic> and <italic>RNAIII transcripts</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005341.g006">Fig 6C</xref></bold>). Inactivation of SrrAB resulted in an over 30-fold increase in <italic>psmα1–4</italic> transcription and a near 20-fold increase in <italic>RNAIII</italic> expression under aerobic conditions. Under hypoxic conditions, inactivation of <italic>srrAB</italic> resulted in a 3000-fold and 160-fold increase in <italic>psmα1–4</italic> and <italic>RNAIII</italic> transcript levels, respectively. Collectively, these data indicate that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> quorum sensing and resultant cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells is modulated in an SrrAB-dependent manner in response to changing oxygen availability, and further define SrrAB as an important regulator of metabolic and virulence adaptations during invasive infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>TnSeq analysis during experimental osteomyelitis revealed <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> genes essential for invasive infection. Among the mutants with reduced <italic>in vivo</italic> fitness was one TCS, SrrAB, which was previously characterized as a coordinator of hypoxic and nitrosative stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref026">26</xref>]. SrrAB was originally identified as a regulator of oxygen-dependent toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) expression, and was noted to have homology to the global respiratory regulator ResDE in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref038">38</xref>]. Subsequent analyses revealed that SrrA is capable of binding to the <italic>agr</italic> P2 and P3 promoter regions, and that overexpression of SrrAB reduces virulence in a rabbit endocarditis model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref027">27</xref>]. These findings indicate a link between SrrAB and quorum sensing and suggest that oxygenation could impact staphylococcal virulence. Yet the specific signal(s) that activate SrrAB, and the mechanism by which this system modulates quorum sensing have yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that aerobic growth of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> limits quorum sensing and <italic>agr</italic>-dependent virulence factor production in a manner that is partially dependent on SrrAB. Conversely, hypoxic growth results in significantly increased cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells. Since equivalent bacterial densities were achieved under conditions of hypoxic and aerobic growth, these results imply that the output of quorum sensing can be functionally uncoupled from bacterial density by changes in culture oxygenation. Such uncoupling could be particularly advantageous for quenching of virulence factor production in environments with higher oxygen availability, such as during colonization of the skin or nares. Since inactivation of SrrAB under aerobic conditions failed to fully restore quorum sensing and cytotoxicity to the levels observed with hypoxic growth, it is likely that this phenomenon is a result of multiple factors. Additional studies are therefore needed to determine the SrrAB-dependent and SrrAB–independent mechanisms by which oxygenation regulates quorum sensing. To this end, it has previously been demonstrated that both the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> autoinducing peptide (AIP) and AgrA can be functionally inactivated by oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref040">40</xref>], suggesting a potential SrrAB-independent mechanism for modulation of quorum sensing by oxygen. Moreover, the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> genome is known to encode other redox-sensitive regulators such as Rex, MgrA, SarA, and AirSR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref045">45</xref>]. It is therefore possible that environmental oxygen is not a direct regulator of quorum sensing, but rather that a change in the redox status of the bacterial cell or oxidative damage triggers changes in virulence factor production. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that shifts in available oxygen, as well as the inherent differences in physiologic oxygen concentrations in various host tissues, could have a significant impact on staphylococcal virulence. Additionally, these data highlight the importance of <italic>in vitro</italic> culture conditions on the study of staphylococcal virulence.</p>
<p>Global transcriptional analyses defined the SrrAB regulon of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> under conditions of aerobic and hypoxic growth. Interestingly, although some overlap was noted with the previously reported SrrAB nitrosative stress regulon, we identified additional SrrAB-regulated genes under conditions of changing oxygenation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref026">26</xref>]. Although these findings may relate to technical issues or strain-dependent differences in gene regulation, they suggest that SrrAB may integrate multiple environmental signals, or that oxidative and nitrosative stress trigger a common endogenous bacterial pathway that activates SrrAB. In order to begin defining the host components that trigger hypoxic or nitrosative stress responses in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, we examined the role of neutrophils during osteomyelitis. Neutrophils impose nitrosative and oxidative stress to invading pathogens through the respiratory burst, which generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Moreover, neutrophils contribute to tissue hypoxia through abscess formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref030">30</xref>]. In support of the role of SrrAB in resisting such hypoxic and nitrosative stresses, we found that neutrophil depletion partially rescued the virulence defect of an <italic>srrA</italic> mutant. Additional studies are needed to parse out the effects of neutrophil-derived reactive oxygen and nitrogen species versus abscess-associated tissue hypoxia on the survival of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. Furthermore, it is likely that other innate and adaptive immune responses contribute to changes in tissue oxygenation and thus the redox status of invading pathogens.</p>
<p>In addition to the genes encoding SrrAB and its targets, TnSeq analysis during osteomyelitis revealed a large number of staphylococcal mutants with compromised fitness <italic>in vivo</italic>. Many of the genes identified as essential or compromised during <italic>in vivo</italic> growth can be broadly classified as associated with metabolism. In contrast, very few prototypical virulence factors were identified as essential for osteomyelitis. The lack of traditional secreted virulence factors identified through TnSeq analysis is not surprising due to the nature of the technique. Infection with a pooled transposon library allows for mutants deficient in a particular gene to potentially co-opt bacterial factors from other mutants. Indeed, this phenomenon has been characterized for the exchange of metabolic intermediates in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, and it is conceivable that secreted virulence factors could be “shared” in a similar manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref033">33</xref>]. An additional limitation of TnSeq analysis is the requirement for a short outgrowth step in liquid media following harvest of the transposon library from infected bone. This outgrowth step could potentially confound our results by altering the fitness of mutants recovered from infected tissues. However, a brief outgrowth step is necessary to decrease the amount of murine DNA present in the femur homogenate and allow for effective sequencing of bacterial DNA, and is a common adjustment in TnSeq analyses of infected tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>TnSeq analysis of staphylococcal osteomyelitis paralleled a previous TnSeq analysis of staphylococcal growth in soft tissue abscesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref008">8</xref>]. In fact, 40 of the 65 genes identified as essential for growth during osteomyelitis were also essential for growth in murine abscesses. This observation is consistent with our previous data showing that osteomyelitis is characterized by exuberant abscess formation in the bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref032">32</xref>], and suggests common stresses are encountered by staphylococci in neutrophil-rich inflammatory lesions. However, 25 of the 65 genes essential for intraosseous survival were not found to be essential for abscess growth, and may reflect unique adaptations to colonization of skeletal tissues.</p>
<p>Of the genes required for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> survival during invasive infection, many encode hypothetical proteins or proteins without a previously characterized role in virulence. This observation highlights the power of TnSeq analysis as an unbiased evaluation of the genetic requirements for bacterial survival in host tissues. In summary, the results of this study elucidate bacterial survival strategies during invasive infection, link changes in environmental oxygen to staphylococcal quorum sensing and virulence, and provide a firm foundation to identify new targets for antimicrobial and vaccine design.</p>

<title>Transposon sequencing analysis of experimental acute osteomyelitis</title>
<p>The <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> TnSeq library in the HG003 background has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref008">8</xref>]. In order to identify potential bottlenecks in the murine osteomyelitis model that could confound TnSeq analysis, groups of mice were first infected with strain HG003 using an inoculum of 5x10<sup>6</sup> CFU and then at various times post-infection the infected femurs were collected and processed for CFU enumeration. Day 5 was chosen as a timepoint for TnSeq analysis of acute osteomyelitis as it likely represents the first bottleneck encountered by invading bacteria. To prepare the TnSeq library for inoculation into murine femurs, an aliquot of the library containing 5x10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml was thawed and inoculated into 100 ml of BHI media in a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask. This culture was incubated at 37°C for 12 hours and then back-diluted 1:100 into fresh BHI at the same flask to volume ratio and grown an additional 3 hours. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS to a concentration of 7x10<sup>6</sup> CFU in 2 μl PBS. This inoculum dose failed to cause mortality or severe morbidity requiring euthanasia when administered to five wildtype mice by retro-orbital injection (mice were monitored for a total of 4 days). Genomic DNA was prepared from the inoculum using a Qiagen DNeasy Kit with 40 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> lysostaphin added to the lysis buffer. The inoculum was used to initiate experimental osteomyelitis in groups of mice as above. Another equivalent aliquot of the inoculum was seeded into a 50 ml BHI culture in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask. This culture was grown for 24 hours, after which time the bacterial cells were harvested and genomic DNA was prepared as above. This genomic DNA served as the <italic>in vitro</italic> comparator for TnSeq analysis. At 5 days post-infection, mice inoculated with the TnSeq library were euthanized, and the infected femurs were harvested and homogenized in 1 ml of PBS. 500 μl of this homogenate was archived by freezing at -80°C in 20% glycerol and the remaining 500 μl of the homogenate was seeded into 4ml of BHI media and cultured at 37°C and 180 rpm shaking for 5.5 hours. Bacteria were then collected by centrifugation and subjected to genomic DNA preparation as above. Recovered bacteria from 2 mice were pooled, and 3 biologically independent groups of mice were analyzed separately. Genomic DNA samples were subsequently prepared for sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Tufts University Genomic Core Facility). Sequencing, data analysis, and fitness calculations were performed as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref008">8</xref>]. Briefly, a “dval” was calculated for each gene in each condition (inoculum, <italic>in vitro</italic> comparator, or osteomyelitis). The dval represents the observed number of mappable reads of insertions in a gene, divided by the number of mappable reads of insertions predicted for that gene based on its size relative to the genome and the total number of mappable reads obtained for that experiment. Genes with dval of ≤0.01 were considered “essential” in a given condition. Genes with dval of &gt;0.01 but ≤0.1 were considered “compromised” in a given condition, whereas genes with dval &gt;0.1 were considered “fit”. A dval ratio was calculated by dividing the dval of a given gene in osteomyelitis by the dval of the same gene during <italic>in vitro</italic> comparator growth.</p>

Cell lines in suspension were centrifuged at 3000 x g for 5 minutes prior to intoxication. Cell viability was assessed with CellTiter AQueous One (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) per the manufacturer’s instructions at 24 hours post-intoxication.</p>

<title>YFP fluorescence measurements</title>
<p>For fluorescence analysis, overnight cultures of WT and Δ<italic>srrA</italic> containing the pDB59 reporter plasmid were back-diluted 1:1000 into 10 ml of RPMI + 1% CA with chloramphenicol in 50ml Erlenmeyer flasks and grown either aerobically or hypoxically as above. YFP was measured using an excitation of 485/20 and emission of 528/20 in a BioTek Synergy HT 96-well plate reader at 0, 6, 9, 12, and 15 hours after back-dilution.</p>

<title>Quantitative RT-PCR</title>
<p>Bacteria were grown for 15 hours as for YFP fluorescence measurements, mixed with 1:1 acetone:ethanol, and stored at -80°C until processed for RNA isolation. RNA isolation was performed as for Genechip analysis. Reverse transcription using 2 μg of RNA and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Ca, USA) and the cDNA generated above for each primer pair, including a no reverse transcriptase negative control for 16S rRNA. PCR was conducted on a CFX96 qPCR cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Ca, USA). The cycling program was carried out as recommended by the manufacturer with an annealing temperature of 56°C. Fold-changes were calculated from Ct values averaged from three technical replicates for at least three biological replicates after normalizing to 16S rRNA. The qRT-PCR primer sequences for <italic>agrA</italic>, <italic>hla</italic>, and <italic>RNAIII</italic> were previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005341.ref058">58</xref>].
