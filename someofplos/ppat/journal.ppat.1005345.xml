<abstract>
<p>Dengue virus (DENV) is the most common mosquito-transmitted virus infecting ~390 million people worldwide. In spite of this high medical relevance, neither a vaccine nor antiviral therapy is currently available. DENV elicits a strong interferon (IFN) response in infected cells, but at the same time actively counteracts IFN production and signaling. Although the kinetics of activation of this innate antiviral defense and the timing of viral counteraction critically determine the magnitude of infection and thus disease, quantitative and kinetic analyses are lacking and it remains poorly understood how DENV spreads in IFN-competent cell systems. To dissect the dynamics of replication versus antiviral defense at the single cell level, we generated a fully viable reporter DENV and host cells with authentic reporters for IFN-stimulated antiviral genes. We find that IFN controls DENV infection in a kinetically determined manner that at the single cell level is highly heterogeneous and stochastic. Even at high-dose, IFN does not fully protect all cells in the culture and, therefore, viral spread occurs even in the face of antiviral protection of naïve cells by IFN. By contrast, a vaccine candidate DENV mutant, which lacks 2’-O-methylation of viral RNA is profoundly attenuated in IFN-competent cells. Through mathematical modeling of time-resolved data and validation experiments we show that the primary determinant for attenuation is the accelerated kinetics of IFN production. This rapid induction triggered by mutant DENV precedes establishment of IFN-resistance in infected cells, thus causing a massive reduction of virus production rate. In contrast, accelerated protection of naïve cells by paracrine IFN action has negligible impact. In conclusion, these results show that attenuation of the 2’-O-methylation DENV mutant is primarily determined by kinetics of autocrine IFN action on infected cells.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a global health problem for which no selective therapy or vaccine exists. The magnitude of infection critically depends on the induction kinetics of the interferon (IFN) response and the kinetics of viral countermeasures. Here we established a novel live cell imaging system to dissect the dynamics of this interplay. We find that IFN controls DENV infection in a kinetically determined manner. At the single cell level, the IFN response is highly heterogeneous and stochastic, likely accounting for viral spread in the presence of IFN. Mathematical modeling and validation experiments show that the kinetics of activation of the IFN response critically determines control of virus replication and spread. A vaccine candidate DENV mutant lacking 2’-O-methylation of viral RNA is profoundly attenuated in IFN-competent cells. This attenuation is primarily due to accelerated kinetics of IFN production acting on infected cells in an autocrine manner. In contrast, accelerated protection of naïve cells by paracrine IFN action has negligible impact. Thus, attenuation of the 2’-O-methylation DENV mutant is primarily determined by kinetics of autocrine IFN action on infected cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-transmitted pathogen infecting ~390 million people each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref001">1</xref>]. In ~500,000 cases, predominantly in children, the infection leads to more severe disease characterized by vascular leakage and hypovolemic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref003">3</xref>]. As vector control methods are inefficient and neither approved vaccines nor antiviral therapies are available, DENV infections are an unmet global health problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>The five serotypes of DENV belong to the genus <italic>Flavivirus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref005">5</xref>] and have a capped single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity. The genome encodes for a polyprotein that is cleaved proteolytically into three structural proteins (capsid protein, prM and envelope) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref007">7</xref>]). The NS proteins are required for viral RNA replication in the cytoplasm in close association with intracellular membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>DENV is recognized by the innate immune system of the human host. During DENV replication, double-stranded viral RNA is sensed by the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene I) and Mda5 (Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref012">12</xref>]. Their activation induces the expression of type 1 interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β) and type 3 IFNs (IFN λ1, λ2 and λ3, also referred to as IL29, IL28A and IL28B, respectively, and IFN-λ4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref017">17</xref>]. Upon release from infected cells, IFNs signal in an autocrine and paracrine manner, causing the expression of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in target cells via phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref020">20</xref>]. ISGs block virus replication in the cytoplasm at multiple steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>DENV counteracts the IFN response through several mechanisms (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref007">7</xref>]). A key mediator of IFN escape is NS5 that contains a C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and N-terminal RNA methyl-transferase (MTase) and guanylyl-transferase (GTase) activities. The latter two enzymatic activities mediate the capping of the DENV RNA genome in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref023">23</xref>], where cellular orthologs of these enzymes are not available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref025">25</xref>], as well as internal RNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref026">26</xref>]. The latter activity affects the 2’-OH group of the ribose and impedes both the detection of viral RNA by PRRs and its sequestration by the ISG IFIT1 (IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref033">33</xref>]. In addition, NS5 induces the proteasomal degradation of STAT2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref037">37</xref>] via the interacting host cell protein UBR4 (ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref037">37</xref>], thus preventing ISG induction by IFN.</p>
<p>Hence, on one hand, DENV impairs the host’s innate immune response by inhibiting the induction of IFNs, abrogating IFN-induced signaling through the JAK-STAT1/2 pathway, and escaping the action of ISGs. On the other hand, DENV potently induces IFNs and other antiviral cytokines and is sensitive to multiple ISGs whose expression confers protection against DENV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref038">38</xref>]. Interestingly, the abrogation of a single escape mechanism, namely the 2’-O-methylation of the viral RNA, strongly attenuates the closely related West Nile virus <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref027">27</xref>]. Therefore, DENV mutants unable to perform 2’-O-methylation have been proposed as vaccine candidates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref040">40</xref>]. However, the mechanisms by which viral 2’-O-methylation mutants of DENV are attenuated are not clear. For the West Nile virus, Daffis and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref027">27</xref>], in agreement with further studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref041">41</xref>], have described sequestration of mutant virus RNA by IFIT1, but did not detect enhanced IFN expression in response to mutant virus. By contrast, Zust and colleagues, who worked with human and mouse coronaviruses, observed higher type 1 IFN expression induced by mutants lacking 2'-O-methyltransferase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>These contrasting findings, along with the potential medical relevance of the DENV 2'-O-methylation mutant, beg for a mechanistic explanation of how wildtype DENV spreads in IFN-competent host cells and why the mutant is attenuated. Previous studies reported the sensitivity of DENV replication and virus production to IFN treatment or impairment by IFN-effector proteins under steady-state conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref043">43</xref>] or visualized either only DENV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref044">44</xref>] or only the IFN response to a non-spreading virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref045">45</xref>]. Here, we have established a live cell imaging system to monitor simultaneously the dynamics of DENV spread and IFN response and quantified the interplay of these two processes by data-driven mathematical modeling. Our results reveal an early window of opportunity during which the IFN response can curb DENV replication by acting on already infected cells. Thus, the timing of IFN induction is a decisive factor of viral replication and spread that critically determines attenuation of the 2'-O-methylation mutant.</p>

<title>IFN pre-treatment renders cultured cells resistant against DENV infection</title>
<p>We reasoned that the efficiency of virus spread and ultimately the outcome of infection should depend on the dynamics of virus replication versus activation of the IFN response. To study the dynamics of this interplay we utilized A549 cells that are permissive for DENV and capable of producing type 1 and 3 IFNs. In the first set of experiments, we determined the time-dependency of DENV-2 (strain 16681) IFN sensitivity by treating cells with 100 IU/ml IFN-α prior to (-4 and -2 h) or after DENV infection (2, 4, 6 and 8 h) with MOI 10 TCID<sub>50</sub>/cell. Cells were fixed 24 h post infection and the fraction of NS5-expressing cells was determined by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). In the absence of IFN treatment, ~60% of the cells were infected. However, pre-treatment of cells with IFN-α 4 h prior to infection reduced the number of DENV-positive cells to ~15%. This number steadily increased when IFN treatment was delayed until 6 h post infection and, after this time point, inhibition of DENV replication was no longer detectable. A similar time-dependent IFN sensitivity was observed with the same concentration of IFN-α after DENV infection with MOI 0.1 TCID<sub>50</sub>/cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s002">S1A Fig</xref>), a condition used later on in live cell imaging. Measurement of the titers of virus released from cells revealed a ~2 log decrease when cells were treated with IFN-α prior to or until 2 h after infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s002">S1B Fig</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To correlate DENV replication and STAT2 degradation, we infected A549 cells with the virus and harvested the cells right after inoculation up to 96 h post infection. In agreement with earlier reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref034">34</xref>], Western blot analysis revealed rapid STAT2 degradation that was detectable already 6 h after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). From 26 h post infection onwards STAT2 abundance increased again, most likely due to continued growth of uninfected cells expressing normal levels of STAT2 (~40% as deduced from the infection efficiency of cells that had not been treated with IFN; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In addition, as STAT2 is an ISG, the increase of this protein might be due to IFN released from infected cells and enhancing expression of STAT2 in cells responding to IFN.</p>
<p>In summary, these data show that IFN curbs DENV infection, yet the virus efficiently spreads in IFN-competent A549 cells. As the effectiveness of IFN depended on the time of its delivery relative to the infection, these results suggested that the kinetics of virus replication and spread versus kinetics of activation of the IFN response likely determine the outcome of DENV infection.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Establishment and characterization of reporter cells suitable to monitor IFN response at the single cell level and in live cells</title>
<p>In order to monitor the dynamics of the IFN response as well as DENV replication and spread in real time and at the single cell level, we established IFN-competent A549 reporter cell lines. Cells were stably transfected with modified genes encoding for the ISGs Mx1 or IFIT1 contained in bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). This system allowed the expression of the respective ISGs under control of the authentic gene regulatory elements (used BACs contained 49,417 bp and 84,599 bp upstream of the coding sequence of Mx1 and IFIT1, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). To enable the detection of Mx1 and IFIT1, they were each fused in-frame to the destabilized enhanced green fluorescent protein (deGFP) containing C-terminally the degradation domain of mouse ornithine decarboxylase that was used to reduce stability of the respective ISG (see below).

<p>Kinetic analyses of biological responses require reporter proteins with rather short half-lives. Both IFIT1 and Mx1, are very stable (e.g. <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>1/2</italic></sub> of the mouse MxA is ~2.3 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref047">47</xref>] and <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>1/2</italic></sub> of IFIT1 &gt;24 h; A. Pichlmair, personal communication). For this reason, we fused these genes C-terminally with deGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and assessed the stability of these fusion proteins by using cycloheximide (CHX) treatment of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref048">48</xref>]. Stable A549 reporter cells were treated with IFN-α for 15 h to induce expression of the reporter protein prior to addition of CHX. Cells were harvested at various time points after CHX addition and lysates were analyzed by Western blot or flow cytometry. We determined a half-life of only ~2 h for IFIT1deGFP and ~4 h for Mx1deGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g002">Fig 2F</xref>, left and right panel, respectively). Thus, the cell lines stably expressing the BAC-encoded deGFP fusion proteins are suitable for studying the dynamics of the IFN response.</p>

<title>Variability of the IFN response at the single cell level</title>
<p>We next determined the IFN response at the single cell level by using flow cytometry of the reporter cell lines. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, we observed discrete IFIT1-expressing cell populations upon IFN-α treatment with the fraction of IFN-responding cells increasing continuously with IFN-α dose. However, even at highest IFN-α concentration ~5% of cells did not respond, consistent with stochasticity of the IFN response as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref046">46</xref>]. To determine whether IFN-α responsiveness is a stable property of individual cells, we sorted A549-IFIT1deGFP cells treated with either 10 or 100 IU/ml IFN-α into deGFP-expressing and non-expressing fractions. Sorted cells were seeded and treated again with IFN-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Nearly all cells that had responded to the first IFN-α treatment responded to the second treatment, possibly as a result of the higher abundance of signal-transduction molecules such as STAT1/2 and IRF-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref049">49</xref>]. However, cells that did not respond to primary IFN-α treatment showed practically the same dose response as naïve cells during primary IFN-α application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). This result indicates that a stochastic process is involved in ISG expression.</p>

<p>Next we investigated the kinetics of ISG induction upon IFN-α treatment in single cells by time-lapse microscopy. For this purpose we utilized A549-IFIT1deGFP cells that stably express a nuclear localized far-red fluorescent protein to allow automatic tracking of individual cells. We started imaging 1 h after addition of 10 or 100 IU/ml IFN-α and, during a 72 h-observation period, determined for each time point total intensity of IFIT1deGFP in individual cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, the level of the short-lived IFIT1deGFP reporter fluctuated in the responding cells over time. However, after switching IFIT1deGFP expression on, the majority of cells remained IFIT1deGFP positive (a more comprehensive presentation of larger cell numbers is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s005">S4 Fig</xref>). The time of IFIT1deGFP induction varied widely with nearly all positive cells switching within 24 h after the IFN-α stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our data show that a fraction of cells does not respond to IFN with IFIT1 expression. Moreover, cells that do respond exhibit a broad range of delays for IFIT1 induction, but once it is switched on, IFIT1 expression is sustained.</p>

<title>Characterization of the faR reporter DENV</title>
<p>To study the interplay between the IFN response and the kinetics of DENV replication and spread, we constructed a genetically modified DENV reporter virus genome encoding the far red fluorescent protein TurboFP635 (“faR”) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). This reporter matures rapidly, is pH- and photo-stable and has high signal intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref050">50</xref>]. The reporter virus, designated DENV-faR, was derived from the DENV-2 isolate 16681 by using the monocistronic construct design we have described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref051">51</xref>]. Replication fitness and virus production of this reporter genome was only slightly lower as compared to the parental DENV wildtype (DENV-wt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Importantly, reporter virus spread was readily detected in A549 cells. This is best demonstrated by the robust increase of reporter protein-positive cells upon infection with this virus as compared to infection with virus-like particles that support only a single round of infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s006">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>).</p>

The first 103 nucleotides of the capsid coding sequence were duplicated, because they contain the circularization sequence 1 (CS1; blue bar) that is essential for DENV RNA replication. Thus, the far red reporter is fused N-terminally with ~34 amino acid residues of the capsid protein that contains a nuclear localization sequence and C-terminally with the sequence encoding for the 2A cleavage factor (PCS) of the Thosea asigna virus, thus generating the authentic N-terminus of the capsid protein.

</fig>
<p>To verify that faR protein detection is a reliable marker for DENV-infected cells we infected A549 cells with the reporter virus and determined the kinetics of production of dsRNA, a well-established marker for active virus replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref052">52</xref>] and faR-expression in the same cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s006">S5C Fig</xref>). We found that faR protein expression was only slightly delayed as compared to the appearance of dsRNA, and the presence of dsRNA in a given cell correlated well with faR expression. Thus this reporter virus is a reliable tool to study the dynamics of DENV replication and spread in our A549 ISG reporter cells.</p>
<p>During the setup of the experimental system we found that concentrated DENV-faR virus stocks prepared directly from culture supernatants contained cytokines that induced our reporter ISGs, although the virus was propagated in VeroE6 cells assumed to be IFN-deficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref053">53</xref>]. These cytokines were antiviral as inferred from a HCV-based replication inhibition assay, but could be removed by ultracentrifugation of concentrated DENV-faR stocks through a 20% sucrose cushion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s007">S6 Fig</xref>). Using these purified virus stocks we assessed the replication properties of DENV-faR by establishing a single-step growth curve in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). RNA replication became first detectable ~8 h after inoculation and infectious virus was released into culture supernatant from ~16 h post infection onwards (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s008">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>), reaching its half-maximum at ~30 h (note that high amounts of viral RNA and infectivity at early time points are due to residual inoculum sticking to cells even after stringent washing). In agreement with these results, we found an increase of IFIT1 mRNA starting 12 h p.i. and release of IFN-λ from 18 h p.i. onwards reaching its half-maximum at 26 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). We additionally determined the decay of infectious viral particles in the culture medium and found a half-life of 1.7 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s008">S7C Fig</xref>). We also detected IFN-β in culture supernatants of infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s009">S8 Fig</xref>), whereas IFN-α production was not detectable. These results show that DENV-faR replication induces IFN secretion from A549 cells.</p>

<title>Single cell kinetics of IFN response in DENV-faR-infected A549 reporter cells</title>
<p>Taking advantage of our reporter cells and virus system, we determined the kinetics of DENV replication/spread and activation of the IFN response by time-lapse microscopy. Experiments were conducted with A549-IFIT1deGFP and A549-Mx1deGFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g005">Fig 5</xref>), using low MOI to allow for viral spread through secondary infection events. In both cell lines DENV-faR-expressing cells were first detected 22 h after infection, reflecting the delay from infection to the rise in intracellular viral RNA and expression of the reporter protein to a detectable level (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Given that infected cells start to produce viral particles from 16 h post infection (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g004">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s008">S7B Fig</xref>) and that infection takes ~20 h to become visible with the faR reporter, the majority of cells becoming DENV-faR-positive between 36 and 72 h p.i. likely reflects viral spread by secondary infection events. Consistent with these kinetics we found that A549-IFIT1deGFP reporter cells infected with the reporter virus at high MOI (10 TCID<sub>50</sub>/cell) displayed a faster onset of faR expression concomitant with a lower number of IFIT1deGFP-positive cells, likely as a result of the JAK-STAT signaling block (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s010">S9 Fig</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>As deduced from the expression kinetics of our reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g005">Fig 5B and 5D</xref>), during this time period many cells became protected against viral infection by induction of ISGs. Based on calculations derived from the histograms, the first onset of ISG-reporter expression was delayed relative to the appearance of DENV-faR-positive cells by 4.75 h, reflecting the minimal time that is required to activate the IFN response by DENV. Previous studies suggested that IFIT1 expression can be stimulated directly by the IRF3 signaling cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref055">55</xref>] and thus, should be induced in DENV-infected cells independent of exogenous IFN. However, in only ~10% of DENV-faR positive cells, we found also IFIT1deGFP expression arguing that IFIT1 expression is induced primarily by IFN, at least in our cell culture system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g005">Fig 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s017">S1 Movie</xref>). Alternatively, the low expression of IFIT1deGFP in DENV-containing cells might be due to viral blockade of the IRF3 pathway. In contrast to IFIT1, the induction of Mx1 requires IFN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref048">48</xref>] and indeed, only very rarely we detected Mx1deGFP–DENV-faR double-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g005">Fig 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s018">S2 Movie</xref>). Moreover, the fact that DENV-faR-expressing cells did not induce Mx1deGFP is consistent with an efficient block of JAK-STAT signaling in DENV-infected cells.</p>
<p>Overall, the time courses of IFIT1deGFP and Mx1deGFP induction were similar, further supporting that secreted IFNs are the primary inducers of the antiviral response. With only rare exceptions, cells expressing either ISG reporter remained DENV-faR negative, showing that IFN produced from DENV-infected cells protected naïve cells against virus infection. However, at the same time viral spread occurred, showing that the protection of cells through the IFN response is not sufficient to curb DENV spread.</p>

<title>Quantitative model of viral spread and IFN response</title>
<p>To understand which parameters control the kinetics of viral spread and the IFN response, we developed a data-based mathematical model. This model describes the rates of naïve cells becoming infected by extracellular DENV or protected by the action of IFNs released from infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The model takes into account that in infected cells, DENV replicates after a time delay <italic>τ</italic><sub>R</sub> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). After a time delay <italic>τ</italic><sub>V</sub>, which considers the additional time necessary for viral protein expression and particle assembly, infectious virions are released. Moreover, infected cells secrete IFN after time delay <italic>τ</italic><sub>F</sub> that corresponds to the time necessary for viral recognition, downstream signal transduction as well as IFN-gene transcription, mRNA translation and IFN secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Released IFNs protect susceptible cells (i.e. cells that are sensitive to infection) from infection (solid green arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Importantly, IFNs inhibit virus replication in infected cells if acting early, i.e. prior to DENV-induced shut-off of JAK-STAT signaling (dashed green arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g006">Fig 6A</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>).</p>

In particular, potential IFN effects on infected cells were incorporated into the value of the virus production rate per cell, <italic>v</italic><sub>V</sub>. The extracellular diffusion coefficients of DENV and IFN are of the order of 10<sup>4</sup> μm<sup>2</sup> h<sup>–1</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> μm<sup>2</sup> h<sup>–1</sup>, respectively; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref059">59</xref>]; thus, within one hour DENV and IFN diffuse over distances ~100 μm and ~315 μm, respectively. As virus production and IFN secretion evolve over several hours (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g004">Fig 4</xref>), we can assume spatial mixing of both DENV and IFN over many cell diameters and therefore neglected spatial gradients in the model. Hence, the numbers of susceptible, infected and protected cells and the extracellular concentrations of DENV and IFN are described by a system of delay-differential equations (DDEs) with time delays for virus replication, virus production and IFN secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g006">Fig 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s001">S1 Supplementary Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>We determined the parameters of the model by fitting time courses of the model variables (infected, susceptible and protected cells as well as extracellular IFN concentration) to time-resolved experimental data. To this end, we infected A549-IFIT1deGFP reporter cells with DENV-faR at very low MOI (0.1 TCID<sub>50</sub>/cell), so that initially few cells are infected and viral spread can readily be observed. We performed time-resolved flow cytometry measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g006">Fig 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s011">S10A Fig</xref> for the Mx1deGFP reporter) along with quantification of IFN-λ, the most prominent IFN species in this cell system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s009">S8 Fig</xref>). For the purpose of parameter estimation, we found time-resolved flow cytometry more informative than live cell imaging, because the former gave an accurate count of susceptible cells (double negative) in addition to infected (DENV-faR positive) and protected (ISG reporter-positive) cells. Similar to the time-lapse microscopy, we observed a strong rise of infected cells with a time delay (~60 h), which, given the low MOI, should be due to secondary spread of the virus from initially infected cells. Cell death was not prominent during the observation period.</p>
<p>We determined an optimal set of model parameters (including the independently measured virus half-life, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s008">S7C Fig</xref>, and the IFN half-life in the extracellular medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref045">45</xref>]) such that it makes the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) the most likely outcome of an experimental measurement (maximum-likelihood estimate). Using these parameters, we found that the model fitted the time course data well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Next, we studied whether the experimental data constrain the model parameters by computing the profile likelihoods for all parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref060">60</xref>]. The model parameters were fully identified from the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g007">Fig 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s014">S1 Table</xref>) and thus, the model is suitable for making quantitative predictions.</p>

<p>To test the validity of the model, we examined three critical parameters using independent experimental data. First, we noted that the delay for intracellular virus replication was estimated from the flow cytometry data to be 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, top row; <italic>τ</italic><sub>R</sub>), which equals the delay after which DENV became visible in infected cells by using live cell imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g005">Fig 5B and 5D</xref>). Second, the delay for the production of DENV particles was 31 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, top row; <italic>τ</italic><sub>V</sub>), which accurately reflects the independently measured half-time of DENV secretion, i.e. the middle of the log phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Thus, the delay for virus production in the model corresponds to this half-time rather than the time of first appearance of viral particles (~16 h). Also note that the estimated time difference of ~8 h between the appearance of replicated viral RNA and secreted infectious DENV is consistent with the estimated delays in the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g004">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s008">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>). The fact that the delays for virus replication and production from the model fit match the experimentally observed times at which infected cells become visibly virus-positive (in live cell imaging) and reach their half-maximal virus production rate (as determined by TCID<sub>50</sub> assay), indicates that DENV spread requires substantial production of infectious virus particles. As a third test of the model, we considered the simulated response of the cells to an external application of IFN-λ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s004">S3B Fig</xref>). Again, the model prediction matches these independent data well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). In summary, the mathematical model agrees with key data obtained in independent experiments that were not used for model fitting.</p>

<p>To quantify the effect of this mutation on virus replication and IFN response, we infected A549-IFIT1deGFP and A549-Mx1deGFP cells with the DENV-faR E217A mutant (MOI of 0.1 TCID<sub>50</sub>/cell) and performed kinetic analyses analogous to the ones conducted with the wildtype virus. By using FACS-based analyses, in both A549-IFIT1deGFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g008">Fig 8B</xref>) and A549-Mx1deGFP cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s011">S10B Fig</xref>), we observed a strong reduction of virus spread as compared to the wildtype virus. Moreover, the analogous impairment of spread of this mutant was found when we analyzed the cells by live cell imaging (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s012">S11 Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s019">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s020">S4</xref> Movies). We reasoned that four key parameters might vary between wildtype DENV and the E217A mutant: As the translation of mutant RNA is impaired because of its sequestration by IFIT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref041">41</xref>] both the viral production and, possibly, also the delay in virus production after infection could be altered. Moreover, as 2’-O-unmethylated RNA is recognized more readily by Mda5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref029">29</xref>], infected cells might produce IFNs with shorter delay and/or higher rate. To fit the mathematical model to the data obtained with the mutant, we allowed these rates and delays of virus production and IFN secretion to be mutant-specific, but otherwise used the parameters previously established for wildtype DENV. We found agreement of the model with the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g008">Fig 8C</xref>) and, using profile-likelihood analysis, established confidence bounds on the mutant-specific parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g008">Fig 8D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s015">S2 Table</xref>). Only two out of these four parameters differed strongly from the wildtype value: the virus production rate was decreased 8-fold for the E217A mutant and the delay from infection to IFN production was decreased 4-fold, by ~24 h. Importantly, for the mutant DENV, IFN production sets in prior to virus production whereas the timing of the two events roughly coincides for the wildtype.</p>

<title>Autocrine IFN action on infected cells is the key determinant for attenuation of the E217A mutant</title>
<p>Although the model identified the parameters most critical for the attenuation of the E217A mutant, their relative importance was not clear. Specifically, the IFN production delay and the virus production rate might not be independent parameters (as assumed for simplicity in the previous analysis), because virus replication could be affected by IFN in a time-dependent manner through the early induction of ISGs before STAT2 degradation takes effect (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g001">Fig 1</xref>). To account for this possibility, we extended the mathematical model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g009">Fig 9A</xref>): The inhibition of virus production by IFN was described explicitly and could take place through ISG induction in an initial phase after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g009">Fig 9A</xref>, solid green inhibition link), assumed to be 8 h. Compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, this somewhat extended time window accounts for the fact that the initial infection dose in the time-course experiments (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g006">6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g008">8B</xref>) is much lower, likely delaying the average onset of viral replication. If an infected cell does not perceive IFN within this time period, it becomes a virus producer, albeit with a somewhat reduced production rate (~50% of wildtype DENV), to account for the possibility that basal IFIT1 expression inhibits translation of DENV mutant RNA. With these modifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s016">S3 Table</xref>), the model fitted the kinetics of both wildtype and mutant DENV replication and IFN response as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g008">Fig 8C</xref>), but could now account for ISG induction and the resulting inhibition of viral replication within an early window of opportunity after infection.</p>

<p>We systematically varied the mutant-specific parameters and found that the IFN-independent reduction of the virus production rate attenuates viral spread, but this attenuation was strongly enhanced by the acceleration of IFN secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, left panel). When we retained the autocrine IFN effect on virus-infected cells in the model, but cancelled the paracrine IFN signaling branch protecting susceptible cells, the result was virtually unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, middle panel). By contrast, the simulation of only the paracrine IFN effect resulted in much less attenuation of the DENV mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, right panel), which is not consistent with the experimental data. Thus, the model predicts that autocrine IFN action on infected cells is critical for the attenuation of the E217A mutant whereas paracrine IFN action has negligible impact.</p>
<p>These computational results indicate that IFN can quench DENV spread by reducing the viral production rate early on in infected cells. While early IFN production by the E217A DENV mutant enables this effect, IFN production in response to the wildtype virus sets in too late for quenching virus production. We then asked how robust these conclusions are, given that the model has been parameterized using a specific experimental setting. Therefore, we systematically varied each model parameter and quantified its effect on the extent of viral spread, using the response coefficients <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> defined as ratio of the fold change of virus-infected cells to the fold change of model parameter <italic>i</italic>. The spread of wildtype virus is controlled only by virus-related processes: production, decay in the medium and infection of susceptible cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g009">Fig 9C</xref>; note that a negative response coefficient implies that viral spread decreases as the respective parameter is increased). The parameters of the IFN response do not have a noticeable effect on viral spread, including faster (paracrine) protection of susceptible cells (<italic>r</italic><sub>F</sub>). This is in stark contrast to the E217A mutant where the timing of the IFN response (<italic>τ</italic><sub>F</sub>) and the time window during which IFN can act on infected cells (<italic>τ</italic><sub>P</sub>) have the dominant control on viral spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g009">Fig 9D</xref>). The dependence of spread of the E127A mutant on the parameters of virus production and infection is very similar to wildtype virus. Together, the results of this sensitivity analysis of the model show that (1) viral spread is consistently controlled by the rates of virus production and infection and (2) a sufficiently early, autocrine IFN response, as elicited by the E217A mutant, curbs DENV spread.</p>
<p>Consistent with these results, our experimental data revealed a large fraction of susceptible cells that persisted throughout the entire observation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g010">Fig 10A</xref>; overall cell numbers are higher in the case of infection with the E217A mutant, because virus spread is low and hence growth of cells is largely unimpeded). Thus, a large fraction of cells neither becomes infected by the virus nor protected by upregulation of ISGs, implying that the availability of susceptible cells is not a limiting factor for the spread of mutant DENV. This observation is consistent with the live cell imaging results showing that antiviral protection is always incomplete due to high cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the induction of ISGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g005">Fig 5</xref>).</p>

<p>To validate experimentally the enhanced IFN sensitivity of the DENV mutant, we transfected IFN-competent A549 cells and IFN-incompetent BHK-21 cells with RNA of the DENV-faR wildtype or the DENV-faR E217A mutant. By using electroporation of the respective RNA genome, we hit the vast majority of cells, thus allowing determination of predominantly autocrine IFN effects. In agreement with our model prediction, we observed strong attenuation of replication and virus production of the E217A mutant in A549 cells whereas in BHK-21 cells this impairment as measured by the limiting dilution assay was almost 75-fold lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g010">Fig 10B</xref>). Consistent with this result, we found that 72 h post electroporation, the E217A mutant had infected ten times less A549 cells than wildtype virus whereas the respective reduction in BHK-21 cells was only fourfold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g010">Fig 10C</xref>). The low-level reduction of mutant virus production in BHK-21 cells might be due to IFN-independent expression of IFIT1 that blocks translation of 2’-O-non-methylated RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref054">54</xref>].</p>
<p>With the aim to determine whether these properties are unique to the E217A mutant or are linked to impaired replication fitness in general, we compared induction of the IFN response between DENV wildtype, the E217A mutant and a mutant that owing to an amino acid change in NS4B (mutant P23A) was impaired in RNA replication relative to wildtype to a degree that was comparable to the relative reduction observed with the E217A mutant in IFN-incompetent cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref061">61</xref>]. We infected the cells with high MOI to monitor the replication kinetics of the three DENV-faR reporter viruses largely independent from virus spread. We found that kinetics of virus replication and activation of the IFN response were well comparable between the wildtype and the NS4B mutant P23A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s013">S12A and S12B Fig</xref>). Consistent with our live cell imaging data, replication of the E217A 2’-O-methyltransferase mutant was very much reduced and only ~10% of cells were faR positive 96 h post infection, in contrast to ~60% in case of wildtype and the NS4B mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s013">S12C Fig</xref>). Moreover, in spite of this low number of E217A mutant-positive cells, ~90% of the cells mounted an IFN response which was ~20% higher than in cell cultures infected with the wildtype or the NS4B mutant 96 h post infection. Thus, the enhanced IFN sensitivity of the DENV 2’-O-methyltransferase mutant is a unique property that is not linked to replication fitness.</p>
<p>Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that attenuation of the E217A mutant is linked primarily to the magnitude and kinetics of induction of IFN acting on infected cells in an autocrine manner. This IFN response likely is too high and too fast for the virus to establish IFN resistance, e.g. by quantitative STAT2 degradation, thus accounting for the serious impairment of replication fitness of this mutant in an IFN-competent system. It is also for this reason that paracrine IFN action plays a minor, if any, role as virus production rate is reduced so profoundly that virus spread remains limited.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The outcome of virus infections, either rapid control or spreading, very much depends on the kinetics of replication of a given virus and activation of the innate antiviral defense. Although this is a well-established paradigm in virology, most studies are based on measurements under steady-state conditions and only rarely take into account the dynamics of virus replication/spread as well as the kinetics of activation and stochasticity of the IFN response. Several earlier reports demonstrated that induction of ISGs rendered cultured cells resistant against DENV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref062">62</xref>], but the kinetics of activation of the antiviral state in relation to virus replication and spread have not been quantified in a single system. To overcome this limitation, in the present study we established BAC-based IFN-competent reporter cell lines that allow monitoring of DENV replication and spread, as well as activation of the IFN response in live cells. We chose two different markers: first, IFIT1 that appears to be activated in an IRF3-dependent manner; second Mx1 that is induced exclusively by IFN, thus serving as selective marker for an intact JAK-STAT signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref055">55</xref>] (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref063">63</xref>]). By using live cell microscopy we observed profound heterogeneity of the IFN response at the single cell level arguing, for a stochastic response. This observation is in good agreement with earlier reports describing heterogeneous induction of the <italic>IFNB1</italic> gene upon viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref064">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref067">67</xref>] or IFN treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref046">46</xref>]. Moreover, a recent study identified an “all-or-nothing” expression of IFN-β and ISGs induced by infection of mouse cells with Newcastle disease virus and differing between individual cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref045">45</xref>]. Consistent with our data this study showed that one IFN-secreting cell protects a large number of naïve cells by induction of ISG expression. However, Rand and co-workers utilized an avian virus that did not spread in the murine cell culture and therefore could not identify the contribution of autocrine and paracrine IFN response to curbing the spread of infection. We found that owing to stochasticity the IFN response is “leaky”. Thus, a fraction of non-protected cells remains that supports virus replication. While in the case of DENV these cells will undergo apoptosis as a result of viral replication, in the case of persistent virus infections such as those caused by HCV, this stochasticity might play an important role for chronicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref046">46</xref>]. The molecular determinants underlying the stochastic nature of the IFN response are poorly explored, but likely due to limiting amounts of factors involved in IFN perception, signal transduction or transcription of ISGs.</p>

By comparison, the initial phase during which an invading virus must overcome the innate immune response to spread has rarely been addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref070">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref073">73</xref>] and experimental data for the parameterization of such models have been scarce. Here we have developed a mathematical model for the dynamic interaction of viral spread and the IFN response and identified all model parameters from a consistent set of experimental data based on DENV infection of IFN-competent human cells. The model specifically studies spreading infections that originate from few initially infected cells, thus using experimental data with low MOI. In high MOI infections, the initial virus load of the infected cells is expected to be more heterogeneous, which might be more accurately described by more complex, agent-based simulation models. The model also abstracts from several details. Notably, the spatial heterogeneity of cell responses observed in our live cell imaging analysis has not been described explicitly, because on the relevant time scale for virus replication and host gene expression, all cells in the culture are likely to be confronted with spatially averaged virus and IFN concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref059">59</xref>]. This might change in densely crowded tissues where the slowing of both viral spread and IFN diffusion could cause, at least initially, more localized infections and IFN responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref071">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref074">74</xref>]. A related aspect is the stochasticity of the IFN response that we have characterized both by flow cytometry and live cell imaging. The model accounts for the observation that ISG induction occurs in individual cells at very different times even after uniform IFN treatment. This is naturally reflected in the slow rate of ISG induction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g007">Fig 7C</xref> for a comparison of model and data), which will appear stochastic at the single cell level.</p>
<p>The model based on kinetics of wildtype DENV replication and IFN induction predicted two synergistic effects that account for attenuation of the 2’-O-methylation deficient mutant: first, reduced production of virus particles likely resulting from the antiviral activity of IFIT1; second, accelerated kinetics of IFN activation. Indeed, by using time-resolved flow cytometry we validated these predictions and observed faster cytokine production in the case of the mutant (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g006">Fig 6B</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g008">Fig 8B</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005345.s011">S10 Fig</xref>). Importantly, this mutant has no general defect in RNA replication, because replication and virus production were much less reduced in IFN-incompetent BHK-21 cells as compared to IFN-competent A549 cells. The reduction of the mutant in BHK-21 cells might be due to low basal expression level of IFIT1 that binds RNA lacking 2’-O-methylation and blocks its translation by competing with translation factor EIF4E for mRNA templates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref041">41</xref>]. However, in IFN-competent cells, the 2’-O-unmethylated RNA induces a much faster IFN response. By using our data-based model, we calculated a ~24 h advance in the onset of IFN secretion in the mutant compared to the wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). It is plausible to assume that the delay observed with the mutant is too short to mount an IFN-resistant state in the infected cells, which requires sufficient expression of, amongst others, NS5 and quantitative degradation of STAT2 (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref007">7</xref>]). As a consequence, cells infected with the mutant are exposed to IFN at a time when they are still IFN responsive, thus causing a profound reduction of virus production rate. In the case of the wildtype, recognition of viral (2’-O-methylated) RNA is inefficient and therefore, the IFN response is induced at a later time point when high amounts of single strand viral genomes or double strand replication intermediates have accumulated. By this time, JAK-STAT signaling would already be shut down and therefore, IFN would not impact viral replication in these already unresponsive infected cells.</p>
<p>Another observation consistent with our model is the higher number of IFIT1deGFP—DENV- or Mx1deGFP—DENV-wildtype double positive cells as compared to the mutant virus (best visible in the flow cytometry results). Given the slower activation kinetics of the IFN response, the time period available to produce progeny wildtype virus without impact of autocrine IFN is much longer and thus, virus spread is much more extended. Therefore, second round infections can occur fast enough before a robust antiviral state has been established in susceptible cells by paracrine IFN action, especially in the subpopulation of naïve cells with slow IFN response. According to our live cell imaging data ~5% of cells respond to IFN even later than 24 h after exposure to the cytokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). This number is consistent with the fraction of double positive cells we observed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005345.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study describes the dynamic nature of the interaction between DENV and the IFN response in mathematical and experimentally validated terms. Obviously, the next step will be to integrate the intracellular steps of DENV replication, e.g. by using mathematical models analogous to the one we recently established for HCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref075">75</xref>]. Computation of processes in the DENV replication cycle, which are most amenable to antiviral treatment and/or most sensitive to the IFN-induced antiviral state should allow predicting best synergies between antiviral drugs and the (innate) immune response. In this respect, the results described here should foster development of novel antiviral concepts to combat DENV infection and help to understand the mechanisms of attenuation underlying engineered DENV vaccine candidates.</p>

<title>Virus production and purification</title>
<p>BHK-21 cells were transfected with <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed capped viral RNA. Four hours after transfection, cell culture medium was replaced by fresh DMEMcplt containing 15 mM HEPES [pH 7.5]. Cells were cultured until a cytopathic effect (CPE) became visible. Virus-containing cell culture supernatants were harvested, cleared from cell debris by filtration using a 0.45μm syringe filter tip and frozen at -70°C. For further amplification, DENV contained in this culture supernatant was used to infect VeroE6 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID<sub>50</sub>) per cell in DMEMcplt containing 15 mM HEPES [pH 7.5]. Virus-containing cell culture supernatants were harvested on day 4 and 6 post infection. Pooled supernatants were filtered through a 0.45 μM pore-size filter and filtrate was layered onto a cushion composed of 20% (w/v) sucrose dissolved in NTE buffer (120 mM NaCl, 12 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 2 mM EDTA). After 2h centrifugation at 28.000 rpm (SW32 Ti rotor; Optima LE-80K Ultracentrifuge, Beckman, Krefeld) at 4°C, an aliquot of the supernatant was frozen at -70°C to determine efficiency of purification whereas residual supernatant and sucrose was aspirated. The virus-containing pellet was resuspended in DMEM containing 5% fetal calf serum and 15 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], aliquoted and stored at -70°C until further use.

<title>Generation of A549-derived cells stably expressing reporter constructs</title>
<p>To obtain A549-derived cells expressing an Mx1- or IFIT1-tagged deGFP in the most authentic genomic context, cells were transfected with a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), which allowed expression of the reporter gene under control of all regulatory elements upstream and downstream of the coding sequence. The following BACs were used: human BAC Mx1 RP11-121A5 and human BAC IFIT1 RP11-46M17 (Source BioScience, Cambridge, UK). These BACs encoded for fusion proteins composed of Mx1 or IFIT1, each fused C-terminally to enhanced GFP and the degradation domain of mouse ornithine decarboxylase (mODC). The latter reduced the half-life of the fusion protein, thus allowing studies of the dynamics of the IFN response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref080">80</xref>]. The original Mx1- or IFIT1-BACs were modified by using the RED/ET recombination method according to an adapted protocol of the Quick and Easy BAC Modification Kit (Gene Bridges, Heidelberg, Germany). In this way we inserted the GFP tagging cassette (kindly provided by Frank Buchholz, Dresden, Germany) and the mODC degradation domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref080">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref081">81</xref>].

<title>FaR is a reliable marker for DENV replication and spread.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the DENV-faR trans-complemented particle (TCP) system. (1) Infectious DENV-faR<sub>TCP</sub> was produced by transfecting cells that stably express capsid protein—prM and E (for reasons of biosafety two independent expression constructs had to be used) with a subgenomic DENV-faR reporter replicon RNA. This replicon contains the faR reporter gene and lacks C, prM and E that are provided in trans in the engineered helper cell line. DENV-faR<sub>TCP</sub>s (dark red circles) released into the cell culture supernatant were harvested 24 h after transfection and used to infect naïve cells. Infected cells can be detected via monitoring faR expression. (2) DENV-faR<sub>TCP</sub> is unable to spread in cells that do not express the structural proteins. These cells support only infection and replication, but not virus particle production and virus spread, hence the name “single round infection”. (<bold>B</bold>) Comparison of DENV spread in naïve A549 cells upon infection with the DENV-faR reporter virus or DENV-faR<sub>TCP</sub>s. Cells were infected at a MOI of 0.1 TCID<sub>50</sub>/cell and the fraction of faR-positive cells was detected by flow cytometry at time points specified in the bottom. (<bold>C</bold>) Kinetics of DENV-faR reporter virus replication and spread in A549 cells. Upon infection with DENV-faR at a MOI of 10 TCID<sub>50</sub>/cell, the number of DENV-faR- and DENV-dsRNA-positive cells detectable at given time points was determined by immunofluorescence assay using faR- and dsRNA-specific antibodies.

Aliquots of unpurified culture supernatants of DENV-infected VeroE6 cells as well as virus pellets and supernatants after ultracentrifugation were added to HCV replicon-containing cells. These replicons are highly sensitive to IFNs and thus, suitable to measure even low amounts of antiviral cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005345.ref078">78</xref>].

Note that at MOI 0.1, IFN-λ levels induced by the mutant were higher than that of the wildtype. At MOI 5, IFN-λ levels induced by the mutant exceeded the wildtype-induced levels for early time points (≤ 60 h), but this was reversed at 72 h and 84 h whereas IFN-α measured in parallel was not detected. At both low and high MOI, the spread of the mutant virus was very much diminished. IL, interleukin; n.d., not detectable.</p>
