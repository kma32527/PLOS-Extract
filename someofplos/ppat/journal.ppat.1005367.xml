<abstract>
<p>B-1 cells play a critical role in early protection during influenza infections by producing natural IgM antibodies. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in regulating this process are largely unknown. Here we found that during influenza infection pleural cavity B-1a cells rapidly infiltrated lungs, where they underwent plasmacytic differentiation with enhanced IgM production. This process was promoted by IL-17A signaling <italic>via</italic> induction of Blimp-1 expression and NF-κB activation in B-1a cells. Deficiency of IL-17A led to severely impaired B-1a-derived antibody production in the respiratory tract, resulting in a deficiency in viral clearance. Transfer of B-1a-derived natural antibodies rescued <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice from otherwise lethal infections. Together, we identify a critical function of IL-17A in promoting the plasmacytic differentiation of B-1a cells. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the regulation of pulmonary B-1a cell response against influenza infection.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Influenza infection is highly localized in respiratory tract where immune response is triggered to provide protection from primary infection. Although natural IgM antibodies produced by B-1a cells have long been recognized as first-line protection against influenza, it remains unclear whether B-1a cell response occurs in the lung and what molecular mechanisms regulate this process. We show that airway exposure to influenza causes migration of B-1a cells to lungs for further differentiation into plasma cells with enhanced production of protective IgM antibodies. IL-17A critically regulates this process by driving differentiation of B-1a cells to high-rate IgM producing plasma cells <italic>in situ</italic>. Thus, IL-17A is a key factor in the local inflammatory milieu that modulates early humoral immunity afforded by B-1a cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Highly localized infection in respiratory tract is a defining feature of influenza infection. An appropriate induction of both innate and adaptive immune responses at this site is necessary for virus elimination and host recovery. B cell response is triggered primarily in respiratory tract, which is essential for antiviral immune response against influenza infections by opsonization of pathogens, activation of complement receptor-mediated phagocytosis and promotion of other immune defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref004">4</xref>]. Influenza virus-binding antibodies are provided by two sources, B-1 cells and conventional B-2 cells. Due to the low frequency of antigen-specific B-2 cells at the onset of infection and a general requirement for simultaneous T cell help, early induction of natural antibody response by B-1 cells is critical. B-1 cell-associated antigen receptors are biased with respect to BCR repertoire and preferentially recognize conserved epitopes present on common pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref005">5</xref>]. In addition, B-1 cells are known to secrete most natural antibodies spontaneously at very low level and do so in the apparent absence of antigen challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref006">6</xref>]. Thus, this class of lymphocytes provides efficient immune surveillance by producing natural neutralizing IgM antibodies before isotype class-switched, high affinity-maturated IgG can be produced by B-2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref011">11</xref>]. B-1 cells are enriched in the pleural and peritoneal cavities where pulmonary or intestinal infections usually occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref005">5</xref>], which consist of two functionally specialized subpopulations, CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1a and CD5<sup>-</sup> B-1b cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref014">14</xref>]. B-1a cells produce most of the natural antibodies and can also participate in innate responses upon antigen stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref018">18</xref>]. Previous studies have shown the localized accumulation of B-1a cells in mediastinal lymph nodes (MedLN) during influenza infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref003">3</xref>]. However, it remains to be investigated whether B-1a cell response occurs in the lung and if so, what molecular mechanisms regulate this process during infection.</p>
<p>IL-17A has been identified as a pro-inflammatory cytokine and participates in chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases <italic>via</italic> its effects on a broad range of target immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref022">22</xref>]. Either deficiency or blockade of IL-17A signaling diminishes antibody responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref026">26</xref>]. Early studies have shown that IL-17A-mediated signaling is critical for early control of pulmonary bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref027">27</xref>]. We previously reported that IL-17A deficient (<italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) mice exhibited impaired viral clearance and more severe immunopathological changes after H5N1 influenza virus infection when compared with wild type (WT) controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref028">28</xref>]. However, it has remained unclear whether IL-17A deficiency affects B-1 cell response during influenza infection.</p>
<p>Here, we show for the first time that airway exposure to influenza causes migration of pleural B-1a cells to lungs for further differentiation into plasma cells with enhanced production of protective IgM antibodies, a process critically regulated by IL-17A-mediated NF-κB activation and Blimp-1 induction. Our findings provide new insights into natural antibody response by B-1a cells and its regulatory mechanisms.</p>

<title>IL-17A deficiency severely impairs natural antibody production following influenza infection</title>
<p>In H1N1 influenza virus-infected mice, significantly up-regulated IL-17A expression was detected in lung tissue as early as 2 days post-infection (dpi) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005367.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Among immune cell subsets present in the lung tissue, IL-17A-producing γδT cells were detected by flow cytometric analysis in naïve mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005367.s001">S1B and S1C Fig</xref>), and the size of this IL-17A<sup>+</sup> γδT population significantly increased at 2 dpi and peaked by 5dpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005367.s001">S1D and S1E Fig</xref>). In contrast, very few IL-17A<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were detected in naïve lungs, and the size of this cell population did not increase until 5dpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005367.s001">S1C and S1E Fig</xref>). Therefore, IL-17A<sup>+</sup> γδT cells represent the major source of IL-17A produced at early stage of pulmonary influenza infection.</p>
<p>To assess a protective function of IL-17A against influenza infection <italic>in vivo</italic>, we found that H1N1 virus-infected <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited significantly reduced survival rate compared with WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005367.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In addition to the reduction in body weight, a much higher viral burden was detected in H1N1-infected <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005367.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>), suggesting a deficiency in viral clearance in <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Further histological analysis revealed substantially increased severity of lung damage in <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, characterized by pronounced inflammatory destruction and leukocyte infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005367.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). In WT mice, intra-nasal administration of H1N1 virus induced a rapid anti-virus IgM response in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BLF) whereas local IgG levels did not increase significantly until 7 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005367.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). In contrast with WT mice, this early IgM response was severely impaired in <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005367.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Notably, we also detected markedly reduced phosphorylcholine (PC)-specific IgM production in BLF of H1N1-infected <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005367.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Since previous studies found that PC-specific natural antibodies were exclusively produced by B-1a cells in naïve mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref031">31</xref>], these data indicate that IL-17A deficiency might lead to impaired B-1a cell response during influenza infection.</p>

<p>To determine the cellular source of infection-induced IgM, we enumerated the frequencies of IgM-producing cells in lung tissue by ELISPOT analysis. Remarkably, we detected a significant amount of infiltrated virus-specific IgM-producing B-1a cells, which was 15-fold more than virus-specific IgM-producing B-2 cells in the lung tissues by ELISPOT analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005367.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). These results suggest that IgM-producing B-1a cells in lung tissue serve as the predominant source of influenza virus-binding IgM at early stages of infection.</p>
<p>After establishing a key role of B-1a cells in early virus-specific antibody production in lung tissue and observing significantly impaired B-1a cell response in <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, we next determined whether timely induced natural antibodies by B-1a cells are critical for the survival of <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Previous studies showed that B-2 and B-1b cells, but not B-1a can be efficiently generated when bone marrow is transplanted to adult mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref032">32</xref>]. In this study, we constructed irradiation chimeras with B-1a cell depletion, which was achieved by reconstituting the full body-irradiated mice with bone marrow cells only, whereas transfer of bone marrow cells together with pleural cavity B-1 cells allowed full regeneration of B-2, B-1a and B-1b cell populations in irradiated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005367.g002">Fig 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005367.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). Upon reconstitution, serum levels of virus-specific and PC-specific IgM were very low in mice receiving bone marrow cells alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005367.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). Transferring serum from the chimera mice with fully reconstituted B-1a cells into H1N1 virus-infected <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice was performed at 1 dpi. These <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited much higher survival rates when compared to <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice that received serum from the chimera mice without B-1a cells or <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice with no serum transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005367.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). These data demonstrate that impaired B-1a cell responses largely account for the reduced survival of H1N1-infected <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p>
<p>To rule out the possibility that <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have intrinsic defect in natural antibody production from B-1a cells, we next examined the mice at naïve state. Detailed analysis of un-challenged WT and <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice found no significant differences in total numbers of B-1 cell subsets in either plural or peritoneal cavities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005367.s004">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>). Moreover, similar levels of total IgM, virus-specific and PC-specific IgM were detected in BLF and serum of naïve mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005367.s004">S4C and S4D Fig</xref>). Therefore, these results collectively suggest that IL-17A is essential for early induction of natural antibody from B-1a cells during H1N1 infection, but not for their normal development or function at the naïve state.</p>

<title>IL-17A promotes plasmacytic differentiation of pulmonary B-1a cells</title>
<p>Next, we performed cytospin preparations on sorting-purified B-1a cells from lung tissue or pleural cavity. B-1a cells in lung tissue were found to be morphologically distinguishable from B-1a cells in the pleural cavity and had a more differentiated plasma cell appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005367.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), indicating that B-1a cells underwent plasmacytic differentiation after migration into lung tissue.

<p>To examine whether IL-17A affects B-1a differentiation and antibody production <italic>in vivo</italic>, we evaluated the antibody producing capacity of B-1a cells from lung tissue and pleural cavities of naïve or virus-infected WT and <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Spontaneous but negligible IgM production was detected in pleural B-1a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005367.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), resulting in large numbers of pinhead-size ELISPOTs, without significant antibody secretion detected in the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005367.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). Also, no differences in frequencies of IgM producing cells or IgM made per cell were observed between WT and <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice either before or after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005367.g003">Fig 3D and 3F</xref>). However, markedly increased IgM was detected in culture supernatant of sorting-purified B-1a cells from lung tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005367.g003">Fig 3D–3F</xref>). In accordance with this result, much larger and heavier antibody-forming spots were observed by ELISPOT analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005367.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The increased amounts of IgM secreted per B-1a cell from lung tissue was detected based upon the concentrations of IgM in culture supernatants and correlated spot frequencies detected by ELISPOT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005367.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Thus, these data suggest that pulmonary B-1a cells become high-rate immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells after migration into lungs of infected mice.</p>
<p>We then compared the antibody production by B-1a cells from WT and <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. B-1a cells from lung tissue of <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice showed significantly decreased frequencies of IgM-producing cells and reduced levels of antibodies in culture supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005367.g003">Fig 3C–3E</xref>). When IgM levels were correlated with spot frequencies detected by ELISPOT, the amount of IgM secreted per B-1a cell from <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice was only 2/3 of that from WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005367.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Together, these data suggest that IL-17A deficiency impairs B-1a plasmacytic differentiation during influenza infections.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The ability of B-1 cells to produce natural IgM antibodies is an important part of the innate immune system. Many studies have characterized B-1 cells as first-line effectors of host defenses prior to the development of adaptive humoral and cellular immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref034">34</xref>]. Current investigations have mainly focused on the development and homeostasis of B-1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref014">14</xref>], but much remains to be determined about the regulatory mechanisms underlying B-1 response against infections. In this study, we have found that the B-1a subset preferentially and rapidly immigrates into the lungs of H1N1-infected mice. Recent studies have shown that IL-17A plays a crucial role in promoting germinal center formation and antibody production by B-2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref035">35</xref>], but a function of IL-17A in regulating B-1 cell responses has not been established. Here, we demonstrate that B-1a cells express functional surface receptors for IL-17A while IL-17A promotes B-1a cell differentiation <italic>via</italic> NF-κB activation and Blimp-1 induction. Moreover, IL-17A drives the differentiation of pulmonary B-1a cells into high-rate IgM producing plasma cells in H1N1-infected mice. Of particular importance, B-1a cell-derived natural antibodies can rescue <italic>Il17a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice from otherwise lethal infections, indicating a critical role of IL-17A in regulating B-1a response against H1N1 infections.</p>
<p>Tissue specific micro-environmental factors may favor the plasmacytic differentiation of B-1a cells and need to be identified. Possibly relevant, B cell-activating factor (BAFF), a TNF family cytokine produced by macrophages and dendritic cells, regulates the survival of peritoneal B-1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref036">36</xref>]. Organs such as lung and gut were previously thought to be non-immune but now appear to actively shape immune functions of a broad range of immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref038">38</xref>]. There is emerging evidence indicating lung as a potential site for lymphocyte education during the onset of diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref038">38</xref>]. In the current study, up-regulated IL-17A expression was detected in lung tissues of influenza-infected mice as early as 2 dpi. Our detailed analysis has demonstrated a critical role of IL-17A in supporting plasmacytic differentiation of B-1a cells both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>Early studies found that B-1 cells constitutively secrete small amounts of IgM and may be maintained in a “semi-activated” or “pre-plasma” cell state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref039">39</xref>]. IgM antibody-production of B-1a cells is closely related with their egression from peritoneal and pleural cavities to other lymphoid organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref040">40</xref>], where they can differentiate into plasma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref043">43</xref>]. A similar transition may occur following influenza infection. Existing evidence indicates that B-1a cells can actively accumulate in the lung-draining lymph nodes following influenza infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref003">3</xref>]. Here we have further demonstrated the functional significance of local differentiation of B-1a cells in the lung tissue and its regulating signal. We show that lung-infiltrated B-1a cells were more plasma cell-like with respect to morphology and transcription profiles as compared to ones present in the pleural cavity. Moreover, the plasmacytic differentiation of B-1a cells contributes to increased natural antibody level that is critical for animal survival.</p>
<p>Our current understanding of transcriptional regulation for plasmacytic differentiation comes mainly from the investigation of B-2 cells. Previous studies have identified a network of transcriptional factors that regulate plasmacytic differentiation. One principle molecule closely associated with this process of B-2 cells is Blimp-1, the master regulator of plasmacytic differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref045">45</xref>]. Blimp-1 orchestrates a gene expression program that drives B cells to become plasma cells through the repression of genes involved in the B-2 cell proliferation, antigen presentation, germinal center reactions, and B-T cell-cell interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref045">45</xref>]. Ectopic expression of Blimp-1 is sufficient to drive B-2 cells to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref047">47</xref>]. Although several studies demonstrated that B-1 cells constitutively express low but detectable levels of Blimp-1 in steady state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref048">48</xref>], and antibody production of B-1a cells requires Blimp-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref049">49</xref>], the regulatory mechanisms underlying plasmacytic differentiation of B-1a cells, particularly the involvement of Blimp-1 during this process, remain to be elucidated. We have observed that up-regulated Blimp-1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels is closely associated with IL-17A-induced differentiation of B-1a cells both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus, it is possible that plasmacytic differentiation of B-1a cells requires similar regulatory mechanisms involving Blimp-1 as compared with B-2 cells. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) was first described as a transcription factor in B cells that binds to the enhancer element controlling immunoglobulin kappa light chain expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref050">50</xref>]. Highly activated and constitutive levels of NF-κB were reported in B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref051">51</xref>] whereas its decreased expression led to cell death or growth arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref053">53</xref>]. Considering that the steady state tonic signaling in B-1 cells in the absence of specific stimulation represents a major difference from B-2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref054">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref057">57</xref>], it is reasonable to speculate that the threshold levels of NF-κB activation in B-1 cells maintain the natural antibody production. In support of this hypothesis, we detected increased nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 in B-1a cells upon IL-17A stimulation by Western blot analysis. Moreover, multiple binding sites of NF-κB on the promoter of <italic>prdm-1</italic> gene were confirmed by CHIP analysis, consistent with recent findings that NF-κB binding to the promoter of <italic>Prdm-1</italic> directly induces Blimp-1 transcription and expression during plasmacytic differentiation of B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref059">59</xref>]. Together, our results reveal a novel function of IL-17A in activating the NF-κB-Blimp1 axis for B-1a cell differentiation.</p>
<p>The adaptive immunity requires the cognate interaction between T and B cells and clonal expansions to generate antigen specific response and memory. Despite their relatively low frequency in the secondary lymphoid tissues, the properties of B-1 cells that secrete antibodies with repertoire that is enriched for highly poly-specific to microbial antigens provide a unique advantage for their pivotal role in first-line protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref049">49</xref>]. One striking benefit of innate B-1a response is its rapid and effective response to control the initial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref060">60</xref>]. The proximity of pleural cavity to the lung provides pleural B-1a cells the advantage to respond quickly to pulmonary infections. Based on the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses, we have shown that influenza infection triggers a series of rapid events in the lung where B-1a cells become IgM secreting plasma cells under the influence of IL-17A. Of particular importance, the IL-17A-mediated B1-a response is closely correlated with animal survival from H1N1 infection, which may suggest a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of influenza infections.</p>

<title>Lung fixation and histological assessment</title>
<p>Mice were sacrificed at the indicated time points post-infection, and tissues were inflated with 10% neutral buffered formalin for at least 24 hours before processing and embedding. Lung tissue was sectioned at 6-μm thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological evaluation. Slides were examined in a blinded manner and scored with a semi-quantitative system as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref028">28</xref>] according to the relative degree of inflammation and tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref064">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref066">66</xref>]. The cumulative scores of inflammatory infiltration, degeneration and necrosis provided the total score per animal. Lung infiltration of inflammatory cells was scored as follows: 0, no inflammation; 1, mild peribronchial and peribronchiolar infiltrates, extending throughout &lt;10% of the lung; 2, moderate inflammation covering 10–50% of the lung; 3, severe inflammation involving over one-half of the lung. Degeneration was scored as follows: 0, no degeneration; 1, little vacuolar degeneration of bronchi and bronchiole epithelium cells, normal pulmonary alveoli; 2, mild necrosis of bronchi and bronchiolar epithelium, mild alveoli damage; 3, severe degeneration. Necrosis was scored as follows: 0, no necrosis; 1, mild necrosis with scant exudate; 2, marked necrosis with abundant exudate; 3, severe interstitial edema around blood vessels, apparent injured parenchyma and degenerated alveolar epithelial cells with greater infiltration of inflammatory cells.</p>
<p>For immuno-fluorescent examination, tissues were embedded in OCT, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryo-sections (6 μm) were stained with monoclonal antibodies specific for phenotypic markers and examined with confocal microscope <bold>C</bold>arl Zeiss LSM 710. Slides were examined in a blinded manner.</p>

<title>RNA extraction and quantitative PCR analysis</title>
<p>Lung tissues or PBS washed cells were homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen, Life technologies), following procedures as previous described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005367.ref028">28</xref>]. Briefly, total RNA samples were prepared with an RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and reverse transcribed with SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Real-time PCR was performed using Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG with ROX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with an Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT real-time PCR system (Foster City, CA, USA). Real-time PCR reactions were set up under the following conditions: 95°C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 30 s. The threshold cycle (CT) of gene products was determined and set to the log-linear range of the amplification curve and kept constant. Relative expression of genes was calculated as 2<sup>ΔΔCT</sup> with normalization to the corresponding internal genes. To determine the copy numbers of the H1N1 NP viral RNA in infected lungs, Total 2ug RNA was reverse transcribed, and 4ul of reverse transcribed products was subjected to real-time PCR analysis. The serial diluted pHW2000 plasmid constrcted with viral <italic>NP</italic> gene (Genebank: KT314335.1) of the H1N1 influenza A virus (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) was used as quantitative standard.</p>

<title>ELISA assay</title>
<p>Samples including BLF, serum or supernatants from cell culture were collected for measuring the production of IgM using a colorimetric sandwich ELISA. Standard capture antibody, phosphorylcholine (PC)-BSA (Biosearch Technologies) or purified influenza virus, biotinylated detection antibody and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin were used. The reactions were developed after the reaction of 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) ELISA substrate solution (Fisher Scientific) and read in a Microplate Absorbance Reader (TECAN, Austria) at OD450nm absorption. Total IgM was quantitatively determined with serial diluted IgM standard (Biolegend). Arbitrary units of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934-specific or PC-specific IgM titers, defined as U/ml, were determined by comparision to hyper-immune sera from WT mice. Binding of that serum at 1x10<sup>4</sup> dilution was set as 1U.</p>
