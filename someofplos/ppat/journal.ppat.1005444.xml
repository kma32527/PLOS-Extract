<abstract>
<p>RIG-I triggers antiviral responses by recognizing viral RNA (vRNA) in the cytoplasm. However, the spatio-temporal dynamics of vRNA sensing and signal transduction remain elusive. We investigated the time course of events in cells infected with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), a non-segmented negative-strand RNA virus. RIG-I was recruited to viral replication complexes (vRC) and triggered minimal primary type I interferon (IFN) production. RIG-I subsequently localized to antiviral stress granules (avSG) induced after vRC formation. The inhibition of avSG attenuated secondary IFN production, suggesting avSG as a platform for efficient vRNA detection. avSG selectively captured positive-strand vRNA, and poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA induced IFN production. Further investigations suggested that uncapped vRNA derived from read-through transcription was sensed by RIG-I in avSG. These results highlight how viral infections stimulate host stress responses, thereby selectively recruiting uncapped vRNA to avSG, in which RIG-I and other components cooperate in an efficient antiviral program.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>RIG-I plays a critical role in sensing cytoplasmic vRNA and triggering a downstream signaling cascade to produce the antiviral cytokine IFN. Over the past decade, a number of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have been undertaken to address the nature of the ligands for RIG-I, and it was demonstrated that RNA species forming a 5’-triphosphate and short double-stranded motif preferentially activates RIG-I. The next challenge to address would be understanding the physiological behavior of RIG-I in the context of authentic virus infection. In this study, by monitoring the time-course events in NDV-infected cells, we demonstrated that RIG-I senses vRNAs that accumulate in vRC and subsequently in host avSG. We discovered that avSG contains vRNA derived from read-through transcription, which acts as a novel RIG-I ligand. Our findings illustrated how RIG-I encounters its natural ligands, and initiates and integrates IFN signaling through the course of virus infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), a DExD/H-box RNA helicase family protein, is a crucial cytosolic viral RNA (vRNA) sensor that initiates signal transduction to produce antiviral cytokines, namely, type I and III interferons (IFN-α/β and IFN-λ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref004">4</xref>]. RIG-I selectively recognizes relatively short double-stranded RNA (&lt;100 nt), and this recognition is markedly enhanced by the presence of 5’-triphosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref008">8</xref>]. Once RIG-I is activated, it physically associates with downstream IFN-β promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1, also termed MAVS, VISA, or Cardif), which is anchored to the mitochondrial outer membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref012">12</xref>]. The RIG-I/IPS-1 interaction leads to the recruitment of a variety of signaling adaptors in order to activate transcription factors including IFN regulatory factors (IRF) 3 and 7 as well as NF-κB. These transcription factors activate the genes coding for cytokines and IFNs in addition to IFN-stimulated genes (ISG).</p>
<p>Viral infection is a pivotal stressor that stimulates cells to execute intrinsic anti-stress strategies. As a part of the stress response, cells provisionally interrupt translational machinery in order to avoid excrescent proteins and shelter accumulated mRNA by sequestering them in cytoplasmic protein complexes, termed stress granules (SG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref013">13</xref>]. SG are typically composed of 40S ribosomal subunits, a subset of translation initiation factors (eIF2, 2B, 3, 4A, 4B, 4E and 4G), and host RNA-binding proteins such as Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein (G3BP), poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), human antigen R (HuR), T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1), and its related protein TIAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref017">17</xref>]. A variety of viruses have been shown to induce the formation of SG in infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref018">18</xref>], which is strictly regulated in a steady state; however, once cells are exposed to viral infections, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-inducible protein kinase R (PKR) is activated by viral dsRNA (vdsRNA), an intermediate product generated within the viral replicative life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref019">19</xref>]. Activated PKR further phosphorylates the eIF2 α-subunit (eIF2α) and then recruits SG components to form the complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>We recently reported that SG played a positive role in antiviral IFN signaling against influenza A virus (IAV) lacking an IFN-inhibitory NS1 protein (IAVΔNS1) by recruiting RIG-I and a set of antiviral host proteins to detect the viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref020">20</xref>]. Moreover, another DExD/H-box RNA helicase protein DHX36 acts with PKR to induce SG, hence facilitates detection of vRNA by RIG-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref021">21</xref>]. These findings shed light on the function of SG as antiviral SG (avSG), a substantial platform for IFN-inducing signaling triggered by RIG-I. However, vRNA species in avSG have not yet been characterized. Few studies have interpreted the spatial and temporal behaviors of RIG-I in virus-infected cells in relation to the induction of IFN.</p>
<p>Newcastle disease virus (NDV) of <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>, a negative-single strand RNA virus, has been shown to efficiently trigger the production of IFN in human and rodent cells. NDV encodes a nucleocapsid protein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN), and large RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein (L). These genes are arranged on non-segmented viral genomic RNA (vgRNA) with extracistronic sequences, known as leader (Le) and trailer (Tr), in an order corresponding to 3’-Le-N-P-M-F-HN-L-Tr-5’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref022">22</xref>]. The viral polymerase first transcribes Le sequence into positive-strand RNA without terminal modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref023">23</xref>]. After Le transcription, the polymerase re-initiates transcription for N gene to yield N mRNA with 5’-m7G cap and 3’-poly(A) tail. Similarly, the polymerase synthesizes other viral mRNAs (vmRNAs) by transcribing downstream genes without dissociation from the template. In later stages of the infection, polymerase switches to the replication mode in order to synthesize the entire length of viral antigenomic RNA as a template for the synthesis of vgRNA. The general strategies of transcription and replication are similar across negative-single strand RNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref024">24</xref>], and the vRNA species produced during the replication cycle are sensed by RIG-I-like receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, we analyzed stress responses in NDV-infected cells in relation to the induction of IFN gene activation. We found that NDV infection induced viral replication complexes (vRC) to which RIG-I was recruited. The appearance of vRC was followed by the formation of avSG, which also recruited RIG-I. The inhibition of avSG diminished signaling for the IFN induction upon NDV infection, suggesting that avSG played an important role in signal amplification. Our results also indicated that poly(A)-containing vmRNAs migrated from vRC to avSG, and that Le-N fusion RNA activated RIG-I in avSG. The results of the present study demonstrated the spatio-temporal dynamics of vRNA detection in triggering the induction of IFN.</p>

<title>NDV infection induced vRC and avSG</title>
<p>We examined viral replication and cellular stress responses by immunostaining NDV-infected HeLa cells. Viral replication was detected by the accumulation of viral N and L proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). These viral proteins localized in granules 6 hr post-infection (hpi) and persisted to 12 hpi. We detected vRNA by RNA-FISH, which allowed us to specifically detect vRNA with undetectable background signal in mock-infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005444.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The results revealed that these granules also contained positive-strand and negative-strand vRNA (vRNA(+) and vRNA(-)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Therefore, we refer these as viral replication complexes (vRC). In order to monitor host stress responses, we detected avSG using antibody to TIAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g001">Fig 1A and 1C</xref>). We also tested other avSG markers, TIA-1, G3BP1, and eIF3η (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005444.s002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005444.s003">S3</xref> Figs) and confirmed that all of these markers detect avSG. avSG were not detected at 6 hpi, by which time vRC had already been identified; however, avSG were clearly observed as distinct granules from vRC at 12 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005444.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). avSG and vRC did not completely merge, except for occasional contact between vRC and avSG (below). avSG coincided with vRNA(+), but not with vRNA(-) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). These results suggested that vRNA(+) was generated in vRC and then translocated into avSG.</p>

<p>Certain types of RNA viruses including NDV have been shown to produce vdsRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref031">31</xref>]. Therefore, we examined subcellular localization of vdsRNA by immunostaining with an anti-dsRNA antibody, which detected &gt;40 bp dsRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref032">32</xref>]. We demonstrated that vdsRNA was not detectable within vRC at 6 hpi, but was clearly present at 12 hpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005444.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). The detection of vdsRNA was restricted to vRC which contains L and vRNA(-). avSG contains vRNA(+) and TIAR but apparently devoid of vdsRNA. We confirmed specificity of anti dsRNA antibody through the loss of reactivity after ribonuclease digestion (RNase A and III) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005444.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Relationship between vRC formation and early <italic>IFNB</italic> gene activation</title>
<p>In order to elucidate the biological significance of vRC and avSG in antiviral innate immunity, we examined the kinetics of the appearance of these granules along with <italic>IFNB</italic> gene expression at every 1.5 hours up to 12 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

On the other hand, avSG (TIAR) were detected as late as 7.5 hpi and persisted thereafter. Quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) revealed the temporal appearance of these granules: vRC-positive cells (light gray) were first detected at 1.5 hpi, and reached &gt;90% at 6 hpi; avSG-positive cells (black) were detected at 7.5 hpi and reached &gt; 90% at 12 hpi. No cells without vRC exhibited avSG, except for those treated with arsenite (dark gray), which was used as a positive control for the formation of SG.

<title>Localization of RIG-I in vRC and avSG</title>
<p>Since NDV infection is detected by RIG-I, we examined its localization in NDV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). RIG-I co-localized with vRC at 6 hpi when avSG was not induced. At 12 hpi, RIG-I co-localized with vRC and avSG. These results were consistent with the formation of vRC and avSG coinciding with the accumulation of <italic>IFNB</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and nuclear translocation of IRF-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). RIG-I transduces a signal to an adaptor, IPS-1, which is expressed on mitochondria. We monitored the localization of IPS-1 using HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged IPS-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref033">33</xref>]. At 6 hpi, IPS-1 localized in the proximity of vRC, showing a yellow color in the periphery of vRC (as probed by anti-L), suggesting their close interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). At 12 hpi, avSG were clearly detected and partially co-localized with IPS-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, bottom right). We confirmed that endogenous IPS-1 re-localized upon NDV infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005444.s007">S7 Fig</xref>) and interacted with vRC and avSG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005444.s008">S8 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>avSG formation was required for full activation of <italic>IFNB</italic> gene expression</title>
<p>We blocked the formation of SG in order to elucidate the significance of avSG in <italic>IFNB</italic> gene expression. We knocked down the expression of PKR, which has been shown to act as a sensor for viral infection in order to trigger the formation of avSG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref020">20</xref>]. We also targeted G3BP proteins (G3BP1 and G3BP2: G3BPs), which are known to be critical for the assembly and maintenance of SG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref035">35</xref>]. We knocked down RIG-I for comparison. A western blotting analysis confirmed the efficient knockdown of the targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The knockdown did not interfere with IFNAR-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005444.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). These cells were infected with NDV and <italic>IFNB</italic> gene expression was examined by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). As expected, the knockdown of RIG-I impaired <italic>IFNB</italic> gene expression and the treatment with siPKR or siG3BPs also inhibited <italic>IFNB</italic> gene induction. The kinetics of vRC, avSG, and <italic>IFNB</italic> mRNA induction were subsequently examined in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). These results were quantified as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g002">Fig 2</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In control cells at 12 hpi, vRC were observed in almost all cells (light gray + black, 97–99%). Knockdown of RIG-I, PKR or G3BPs did not decrease the number of vRC-positive cells (light gray + black, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g005">Fig 5C, 5E and 5G</xref>). The knockdown of RIG-I markedly blocked <italic>IFNB</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, red + green) expression (56.1 to 8.2% at 12 hpi); however, the number of avSG-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, black) remained constant (91.4 to 83.8%). The knockdown of PKR strongly inhibited the formation of avSG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g005">Fig 5E</xref>, black) (91.4 to 17.9%) and decreased the number of <italic>IFNB</italic> mRNA-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g005">Fig 5F</xref>, red + green) (56.1 to 18.4%). The knockdown of G3BPs also inhibited avSG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g005">Fig 5G</xref>, black) (91.4 to 21.7%) and decreased the number of <italic>IFNB</italic> mRNA-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g005">Fig 5H</xref>, red + green) (56.1 to 21.8%). Concomitant with the inhibition of avSG, the number of cells exhibiting vRC and <italic>IFNB</italic> mRNA increased, suggesting that these cells failed to develop into triple positive, high <italic>IFNB</italic> gene-expressing cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g005">5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g006">6H</xref>).

The expression of these genes was dependent on RIG-I, PKR, and G3BPs.

<title>Viral poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA stimulated <italic>IFNB</italic> gene induction</title>
<p>We found that avSG contained vRNA(+), but not vRNA(-) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) or vdsRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005444.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

Since poly(A)<sup>+</sup> vmRNA is major vRNA(+), we isolated poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA from mock and NDV infected cells. These RNA fractions were tested for the induction of <italic>Ifnb</italic> mRNA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). RNA fractions extracted from uninfected cells did not activate the <italic>Ifnb</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), whereas both poly(A)<sup>+</sup> and poly(A)<sup>-</sup> RNA extracted from NDV-infected cells exhibited strong <italic>Ifnb</italic>-inducing activity. In addition to <italic>Ifnb</italic>, <italic>Isg56</italic> and <italic>Cxcl10</italic> genes were also activated by these RNA fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005444.s011">S11A and S11B Fig</xref>).

The results revealed that poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA from RSV and VSV also exhibit strong stimulatory activity, particularly, majority of the stimulatory activity resides in poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA in RSV-infected cells. This activity was sensitive to RNase III or CIAP, but not DNase I, suggesting that this activity resides in poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA species with a secondary structure and end phosphate moieties, such as 5’-triphosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g006">Fig 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005444.s011">S11C and S11D Fig</xref>). To examine the presence of 5'-triphosphate in the stimulatory RNA, the RNA fraction was subjected to reaction with capping enzyme of Vaccinia virus, which adds cap to 5'-triphosphate end. Capping reaction diminished stimulatory activity of the RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g006">Fig 6E</xref>), therefore we speculate that the stimulatory activity is from remaining 5'-triphosphate -containing RNA.</p>

<title>The NDV Le-N read-through transcript retains IFN-β-inducing activity</title>
<p>As described in the Introduction, transcription of NDV occurs in the order of 3’-Le-N-P-M-F-HN-L-Tr-5’. The first transcript Le possesses 5'-triphosphate and is devoid of 3’-poly(A). However, transcripts for N, P, M, F, HN and L possess 5'-cap and 3’-poly(A). We analyzed viral N mRNA by strand-specific northern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). RNA extracted from NDV-infected HeLa cells was fractionated into poly(A)<sup>+</sup> and poly(A)<sup>-</sup> fractions. Ethidium bromide staining revealed the virtual absence of ribosomal RNA in poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA fraction, demonstrating successful fractionation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g006">Fig 6F</xref>, bottom). As expected, N mRNA (expected size 1.7 kilonucleotides, knt) is enriched in poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g006">Fig 6F</xref>, top). This probe detected additional slow migrating RNA of 3.8 knt. We suspected that this larger RNA was read-through N mRNA, an extended transcript covering the N and P genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref036">36</xref>]. Many types of viruses belonging to <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> have been shown to produce read-through transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref039">39</xref>]. The result of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g006">Fig 6F</xref> inspired us to examine the presence of Le-N read-through transcript, because such an RNA possesses both 5'-triphosphate and 3'-poly(A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref038">38</xref>]. To detect Le-N read-through RNA, we performed strand-specific northern analysis using Le-specific RNA probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). Poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA from NDV-infected cells exhibited 1.7 knt signal by this probe. Le RNA (55 nt) was undetectable in this gel due to its small size.</p>
<p>To quantify Le-N read-through RNA, we used a protocol for strand-specific RT-qPCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref040">40</xref>]. This method provides specific detection of the target RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005444.s012">S12 Fig</xref>). First, we quantified positive strand Le-N sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g006">Fig 6H</xref>). As expected, Le-N was enriched in poly(A)<sup>+</sup> fraction. Next, we quantified negative strand Le-N sequence to exclude a possibility that the stimulatory activity is from vmRNA partially hybridized with negative-sense strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g006">Fig 6I</xref>). The result revealed that negative strand Le-N sequence was hardly detectable in poly(A)<sup>+</sup> fraction, excluding the possibility mentioned above. Interestingly, this technique allowed us to detect similar read-through products (Le-NS1, RSV; Le-N, VSV) in cells infected with RSV and VSV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005444.s013">S13 Fig</xref>). Finally, we synthesized RNA corresponding to Le and the Le-N read-through RNA and examined their IFN-inducing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> product of Le-N read-through RNA with 3’-poly(A)<sup>+</sup> as well as Le RNA were capable of inducing <italic>IFNB</italic> gene activation. We monitored Cy3-labeled Le-N read-through RNA after transfection. The transfection induced formation of SG containing G3BP1 and Cy3 signal partially co-localized with the SG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Here, Cy3 signal did not completely coincided with SG, presumably because most Cy3-RNA resided within endosomes and the portion of the RNA escaped into cytoplasm induced SG. The results suggest that Le-N read-through RNA is capable of inducing avSG and the following induction of <italic>IFNB</italic> gene.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study revealed that NDV-derived vRNA species were sensed by two distinct mechanisms. NDV infection resulted in the generation of vRC as early as 1.5 hpi and their number subsequently increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). At 6 hpi, <italic>IFNB</italic> mRNA was detected in cells exhibiting vRC. vRC contained vRNAs (-, +), vdsRNA, and RIG-I (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g001">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g003">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005444.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). These results suggested that vRC are a locale in which vRNA is sensed by RIG-I and triggers IFN-inducing signal in the early stages of the infection (before 7.5 hpi). At 7.5 hpi, avSG were detected with concomitant increases in <italic>IFNB</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Since RIG-I also co-localized with avSG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) and avSG were strongly correlated with the culmination of <italic>IFNB</italic> gene induction at &gt;9 hpi, these results suggested that avSG were a second locale for vRNA detection by RIG-I. This is consistent with the result that most (77 to 92%) cells expressing <italic>IFNB</italic> mRNA were positive for vRC and avSG after 7.5 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) and that the inhibition of avSG markedly attenuated <italic>IFNB</italic> gene expression (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g004">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g005">5</xref>). Immunostaining results clearly indicated that vRC and avSG made contact with IPS-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g003">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005444.s008">S8 Fig</xref>), suggesting signal transduction to IPS-1 from two distinct types of granules.</p>
<p>The transfection of RNA extracted from control and NDV-infected cells showed that NDV-derived vRNA activated the <italic>IFNB</italic> gene by transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). We detected vRNAs including vdsRNA in vRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005444.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), consistent with its function for vgRNA synthesis by viral replicase. However NDV-induced avSG selectively contained vRNA(+), and, hence, vmRNA or viral complementary RNA (vcRNA), a full-length template for the viral genome. This is in contrast to influenza A virus (IAV)-infected cells, in which vgRNA was shown to be localized within avSG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref020">20</xref>]. avSG induced by infection with encephalomyocarditis virus were previously reported to contained vdsRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref035">35</xref>]. These findings indicated that the mechanism underlying the induction of avSG and the vRNA content of avSG depended on virus types. We herein revealed that NDV, as well as other viruses belonging to <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> including RSV and VSV, produced Le-NS1/N fusion RNA with 3’-poly(A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g006">Fig 6G and 6H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005444.s013">S13C and S13F Fig</xref>). The Le transcript has been shown to contain 5’-triphosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref041">41</xref>], and synthetic RNA corresponding to the Le-N strongly activated the <italic>IFNB</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). On the other hand, we were unable to detect vcRNA, presumably because of its low abundance in addition to the low sensitivity of our detection. These results prompted us to speculate that viral Le-N RNA synthesized in vRC was transported to avSG and detected by RIG-I.</p>
<p>Host mRNA generally conforms to a certain format; therefore, it is not sensed as non-self. Since mRNA with m<sup>7</sup>G-cap is not sensed by RIG-I, the acquisition of a cap is a major strategy of viruses to escape immune detection. The importance of additional methylation adjacent to the cap has recently been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref043">43</xref>]. In the present study, we demonstrated that RIG-I specifically recognized the uncapped vRNA of NDV generated by Le-N read-through transcription. The generation of uncapped vRNA through transcriptional read-through is not limited to NDV, it is commonly found in other negative-strand RNA viruses such as Sendai virus, measles virus (MeV), and vesicular stomatitis virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref039">39</xref>], suggesting that sensing such uncapped vRNA is an important strategy of antiviral innate immunity. In the case of MeV, 5’-triphosphate-ended Le RNA is considered to be a signature of activating RIG-I for IFN induction, and the association of RIG-I with the 5’ end of transcript covers the Le to N regions, corresponding to the Le-N read-through transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref044">44</xref>]. In future studies, it will be interesting to explore the general impact of an abortive Le-N read-through transcript, which is exclusively produced by viruses belonging to <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>, on the RIG-I-driven IFN pathway.</p>
<p>Our results suggested that RIG-I detected vRNA within vRC in the early stages of infection and triggered the induction of IFN. However, this early response was more limited than the late response involving avSG, thereby suggesting the more efficient sensing of vRNA in avSG. PKR is known to be essential for the formation of avSG induced by NDV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005444.g004">Fig 4</xref>) and other viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref018">18</xref>]. In MeV infection, PKR was shown to correlate positively with both avSG formation and IFN expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref047">47</xref>]. DHX36, another DExD/H-box helicase, has been shown to cooperate with PKR for the formation of avSG and subsequent viral RNA sensing by RIG-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref021">21</xref>]. Pumilio proteins (PUM1 and 2) are known to cooperate with LGP2 to sense vRNA in order to trigger IFN-inducing signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref048">48</xref>]. PKR, DHX36, and PUM1 and 2 are specifically recruited to avSG. A critical signaling molecule for IFN induction, TRIM25, was shown to be specifically recruited to avSG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005444.ref021">21</xref>]. Taken together, these findings and the results of the present study demonstrated that avSG serves as a platform for the efficient sensing of vRNA through the recruitment of critical signaling molecules.</p>
<p>In summary, the virus sensing in the cytoplasm involves more than a simple interaction between sensor molecules and vRNAs; a more complex mechanism including various RNA binding proteins and stress response machinery is responsible for detecting various vRNA structures generated by the replication of different viruses.</p>
