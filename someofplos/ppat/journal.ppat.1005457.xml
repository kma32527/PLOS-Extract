<abstract>
<p>Plants produce cytokinin (CK) hormones for controlling key developmental processes like source/sink distribution, cell division or programmed cell-death. Some plant pathogens have been shown to produce CKs but the function of this mimicry production by non-tumor inducing pathogens, has yet to be established. Here we identify a gene required for CK biosynthesis, <italic>CKS1</italic>, in the rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>. The fungal-secreted CKs are likely perceived by the plant during infection since the transcriptional regulation of rice CK-responsive genes is altered in plants infected by the mutants in which <italic>CKS1</italic> gene was deleted. Although <italic>cks1</italic> mutants showed normal <italic>in vitro</italic> growth and development, they were severely affected for <italic>in planta</italic> growth and virulence. Moreover, we showed that the <italic>cks1</italic> mutant triggered enhanced induction of plant defenses as manifested by an elevated oxidative burst and expression of defense-related markers. In addition, the contents of sugars and key amino acids for fungal growth were altered in and around the infection site by the <italic>cks1</italic> mutant in a different manner than by the control strain. These results suggest that fungal-derived CKs are key effectors required for dampening host defenses and affecting sugar and amino acid distribution in and around the infection site.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The role of plant-like hormonal compounds produced by fungal pathogens during infection has not been elucidated. Here we identified a conserved gene in most fungi, required for cytokinin production by the rice blast fungus and for its full virulence. Fungal-derived cytokinins are likely potent inhibitors of plant immunity. They are also needed to maintain elevated sugar contents at the site of infection and to drain or consume essential amino acids at, and around, the infection site. Thus, cytokinins represent the second example, after the bacterially-produced coronatine, of plant hormones hijacked by pathogens to successfully invade plant tissues. These findings also suggest that this invasion strategy could be widely conserved among fungi.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plant pathogens have evolved sophisticated strategies to manipulate host biological processes during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref002">2</xref>]. (Hemi)biotrophic pathogens produce and secrete effector proteins and metabolites to hijack cellular metabolism of the infected tissues to their own benefit. For instance, the bacterial pathogen <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae pv</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> produces Transcription Activator Like effectors that specifically induce the expression of genes coding for sugar transporters and thus enhance bacterial nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref003">3</xref>]. The virulence factors can also participate to the inhibition of plant defenses that lead to cell death, thus contributing to maintaining infected cells alive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref004">4</xref>]. Plant-pathogen interactions shaped the pathogen virulence arsenal and the host immune response system. A first layer of plant defenses is induced by the perception of pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns, like flagellin from bacteria or chitin from fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref005">5</xref>]. These basal defense responses consist of an early accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a thickening of the cell wall, and production of metabolites/enzymes with antimicrobial activities. To limit these defenses triggered by chitin perception by the plant’s chitin receptor, fungal pathogens like <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> secrete chitin-binding effectors that enable escape from the host recognition system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref006">6</xref>]. Pathogens also interfere with other steps of plant immunity like signaling cascades following recognition and transcriptional regulators of host defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Plant pathogens manipulate components of hormonal pathways, whether the corresponding hormones are involved in disease resistance (i.e. salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref008">8</xref>]) or in the control of plant developmental processes (i.e. auxin, cytokinins and gibberellic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref011">11</xref>]). Pathogens can affect hormonal homeostasis by targeting/secreting enzymes involved in hormone metabolism or by producing hormonal/mimicking compounds and thereby inhibit defenses, modify nutrient flows and/or induce symptom development. For instance, the fungal pathogens <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic> and <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> secrete respectively a chorismate mutase and a monooxygenase affecting salicylic acid or jasmonic acid homeostasis during infection and then contributing to their virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref013">13</xref>]. Plant pathogens can also directly produce hormones or compounds with similar biological activities. The bacterial pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> produces coronatine to mimic jasmonic acid, which actively opens stomata and counteracts salicylic acid accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref015">15</xref>]. As a consequence, these combined effects on several processes required for infection facilitate host invasion. In the case of pathogenic fungi, there is, however, no direct evidence that hormonal compounds produced are required for virulence.</p>
<p>Fungi and bacteria produce hormonal compounds that are chemically identical or very close to plant hormones involved in plant developmental processes such as cytokinins (CKs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref022">22</xref>]. CKs are adenine derivatives that differ in their side chains (aromatic or isoprenoid). In plants, isoprenoid CKs are mainly synthesized through a <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis pathway from adenosine phosphate. In this pathway, Isopentenyl transferase (IPT) enzymes perform the first step of biosynthesis. However, another minor CK biosynthesis pathway involving tRNA modification is also described in plants and yeast. This minor pathway requires tRNA-Isopentenyl Transferases (tRNA-IPT), enzymes that perform tRNA modification leading to CK production after tRNA degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref025">25</xref>]. In plants, CKs were originally studied for their effects on cell division/differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref026">26</xref>]. CKs also modulate nutritional source/sink distribution and programmed cell-death processes like xylem differentiation, senescence and hypersensitive response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref030">30</xref>]. Tumor-forming pathogens are striking examples of microbes which are able to produce CKs, like the fungi <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref031">31</xref>] and <italic>Claviceps purpurea</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref032">32</xref>] or the protist <italic>Plasmodiophora brassicae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref033">33</xref>]. Morrison et al., (2015a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref031">31</xref>] have recently shown that CK accumulation in <italic>U</italic>. <italic>maydis</italic> infected tissues is correlated to the virulence of this pathogen. However, in this latter case the evidence that these hormones are produced by the pathogen is still unclear. Likewise, the pathogenic bacterium <italic>Rhodococcus fascians</italic> secretes CKs to interfere with host CK signaling pathways by affecting the transcriptional regulation of key cell cycle genes leading to tumor development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref034">34</xref>]. In addition to having potential roles in the virulence of tumor-inducing pathogens, CKs have long been suspected to participate to virulence of pathogens that do not trigger tumors or organ deformations. However, it has not been demonstrated that the CKs produced by this type of pathogens are key virulence factors.</p>
<p>Because CKs delay plant senescence by limiting oxidative burst and maintaining photosynthesis activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref035">35</xref>], they are at the cross-road of several pathways of interest for manipulation by pathogens that need to keep host cells alive in order to drain nutrients for their own growth. Consistent with this role, CKs are accumulated in “green islands”, which are tissues corresponding to photosynthetically active zones maintained around pathogenic lesions caused by (hemi)biotrophic pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref039">39</xref>]. CK compounds have been measured in several different fungal species (even in non-plant interacting ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref040">40</xref>]) and CK secretion was mostly observed in the case of (hemi)biotrophic microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref041">41</xref>]. For instance, Hu &amp; Rijkenberg (1998) immuno-detected CKs in and around fungal hyphae of <italic>Puccinia recondita</italic> f.sp. <italic>tritici</italic> during wheat infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>The hemibiotrophic fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> responsible for the rice blast disease, also produces CKs <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref043">43</xref>] but the CK biosynthesis pathway in this fungus has not been established. Moreover, the role of CKs in the virulence of filamentous fungi that, like <italic>Magnaporthe</italic>, do not form tumors has never been demonstrated. In this study we identified a gene coding for a putative tRNA-Isopentenyl Transferase (tRNA-IPT) in the genome of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and in all Ascomycete genomes tested. Mutants deleted for this gene, named <italic>Cytokinin Synthesis 1</italic> (<italic>CKS1</italic>), were generated and were found to be impaired in CK production confirming that the tRNA degradation pathway is involved in fungal CK production in <italic>Magnaporthe</italic> as was suggested for other fungi by Morrison et al., (2015b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref040">40</xref>]. Deleted <italic>cks1</italic> mutants were not affected in their <italic>in vitro</italic> growth or asexual development in standard minimal conditions however they showed severely reduced virulence on rice. Remarkably, the CK-deficient mutant was not able to maintain the levels of several key nutrients at the infection site and induced early and strong plant defenses, suggesting that fungal CKs may contribute to metabolite mobilization and to rice defense inhibition. Our work confirms the view that, in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>, and possibly in many other fungi, this putative tRNA-IPT, contributes to CK production. Since <italic>CKS1</italic> is required for the full virulence of <italic>Magnaporthe</italic>, we propose that CKs from fungal pathogens could act as effectors combining functions in defense inhibition and nutrient mobilization.</p>

<title><italic>In silico</italic> analysis of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> genome revealed putative orthologous genes of yeast and plant cytokinin pathways</title>
<p>To investigate the role of CKs in the virulence of the blast fungus <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>, homologs of plant and yeast genes involved in CK metabolism or signaling were searched in the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> genome using BLASTp. Potential orthologous genes of some important CK biosynthesis, degradation and signaling component coding genes were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s001">S1 Table</xref>), further extending previous reports that the CK signaling and metabolic pathways are present in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>. As previously mentioned, independently of the <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis pathway, CKs can be also produced through tRNA degradation. In this second pathway the first step of CK production involves tRNA-Isopentenyl transferases (tRNA-IPT), as previously described in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> (AtIPT2 and AtIPT9) and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (MOD5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref045">45</xref>]. A putative tRNA-IPT protein, coded by MGG_04857, was identified in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> which shared 36% identity with AtIPT2 or MOD5 and the sequences of the different known interaction sites were highly conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s003">S1A Fig</xref>). No other gene containing the coding sequence of the IPT domain was identified, suggesting that there is only one orthologous gene in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>. We modeled the three-dimensional structure of MGG_04857 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s003">S1B Fig</xref>) by protein threading, a method based on fold recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref046">46</xref>] and using the experimentally determined MOD5 structure as a template. The model produced suggested a conserved structure, but also confirmed a high conservation of primary sequences of interaction sites i.e. the ATP, DMAPP as well as tRNA binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s003">S1B Fig</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref048">48</xref>]) and indicated that MGG_04857 shows all the features of a <italic>bona fide</italic> tRNA-IPT. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that the blast fungus can produce CKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref043">43</xref>], potentially perceive them, and suggest that MGG_04857 could act as a key enzyme in fungal CK production.</p>

<p>To test the involvement of the putative tRNA-IPT coded by the <italic>MGG_04857</italic> gene in fungal CK production, knock-out mutants of this gene, later called <italic>cks1</italic> (see below), were generated by homologous recombination in the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> GY11 genetic background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s004">S2 Fig</xref>). In addition, a complemented strain (<italic>cks1</italic><sup><italic>CKS1</italic></sup>) was built by transformation of the <italic>cks1</italic> mutant strain with a construct carrying the genomic sequence of <italic>MGG_04857</italic> under control of its own promoter. Gene disruption and complementation were confirmed by PCR on genomic DNA and qRT-PCR and showed that the expression of <italic>MGG_04857</italic> was similar between wild type and <italic>cks1</italic><sup><italic>CKS1</italic></sup> isolates, but not detected in the <italic>cks1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s004">S2E Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Since yeast MOD5 mutants are known to display altered phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref049">49</xref>], we measured the growth of <italic>cks1</italic> mutants under normal and environmental stress. The <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of the <italic>cks1</italic> mutant was not different from the wild type or <italic>cks1</italic><sup><italic>CKS1</italic></sup> strains under standard minimal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s005">S3A Fig</xref>). Moreover, the development of infection structures like the appressorium was not impaired by the <italic>cks1</italic> mutation on glass slides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s005">S3B Fig</xref>) or on rice leaf surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s005">S3C Fig</xref>). This suggests that the early steps of fungal growth are not significantly modified by the <italic>cks1</italic> mutation. By contrast, the <italic>cks1</italic> mutant showed slight but significant and reproducible reduced growth when grown under 1mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s006">S4A Fig</xref>). This phenotype could be complemented by the addition of the CK kinetin to the medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s006">S4B Fig</xref>), suggesting that this defect could be related to a reduced CK production due to the <italic>MGG_04857</italic> deletion.</p>

<p>Four major isoprenoid CKs, cisZR (<italic>cis</italic>-zeatin riboside), iPR (isopentenyl adenosine), cisZNT (<italic>cis</italic>-zeatin nucleotide) and iPNT (isopentenyladenine nucleotide) were detected in mycelia and supernatant of the wild type GY11. The riboside forms, cisZR and iPR, were the most abundant CKs in mycelia while the nucleotide precursor forms, cisZNT and iPNT, were the main secreted ones. The other CK forms, trans-zeatin and dihydrozeatin were not detected. Thus, in the minimal medium, cisZR and cisZNT are the major CKs produced and secreted by the wild-type strain. This is consistent with CK measurements made on several other fungi where cis-zeatin forms were the main CKs detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref040">40</xref>]. The <italic>cks1</italic> mutant was not able to produce and/or secrete any detectable CKs whereas the complemented strain, <italic>cks1</italic><sup><italic>CKS1</italic></sup>, produced CKs at similar levels as the wild type strain GY11 did. Thus, <italic>MGG_04857</italic> appears to be required for CK biosynthesis in the rice blast fungus (therefore called <italic>CKS1</italic> for <italic>Cytokinin Synthesis 1</italic>) and is likely coding for an active tRNA-IPT protein, although this activity needs to be established.</p>

Altogether these results support the hypothesis that the loss of virulence and the over-induction of defense associated with the <italic>cks1</italic> mutation are linked to an absence of CK production by the mutant strain.</p>

<title>Elevated fertilization can restore virulence of the <italic>cks1</italic> mutant</title>
<p>CKs affect different key metabolic processes in plants, like Calvin-Benson or tricarboxylic acid cycles and mediate source/sink modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref029">29</xref>].

The data strongly support the idea that the over-induction of defense-markers by <italic>cks1</italic> is not due to an arrest of growth itself (which would subsequently trigger enhanced plant defense) but rather to another defect that leads to reduced virulence, likely in CK production.

Initially, glucose and fructose contents were significantly higher 48 hpi in plants infected with the <italic>cks1</italic> mutant compared to plants infected with the control strain, an observation that can be related to enhanced induction of defense (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Discussion</xref>). By contrast, at later time points (after 48hpi), soluble sugars contents were significantly lower in plants infected with the <italic>cks1</italic> mutant. Given the known effects of CKs on maintaining photosynthesis active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref064">64</xref>], this observation supports the idea that CKs produced by <italic>Magnaporthe</italic> could contribute to maintain sugar production during infection.</p>

<title>Identification of <italic>CKS1</italic>, a conserved gene required for fungal cytokinin production</title>
<p>The pathogenic fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> produces and secretes CKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref043">43</xref>] but its biosynthesis pathway had remained unknown. Moreover, the involvement of CKs in virulence of pathogenic fungi that do not induce tumors was still undetermined. Recently, a cluster including two genes (including one coding for a IPT-LOG) involved in the <italic>de novo</italic> CK biosynthesis pathway, was characterized in the ergot fungus <italic>Claviceps purpurea</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref032">32</xref>]. In mutants deleted for these two genes, CK production was partially affected but virulence was not. In the present study, we identified a gene in the rice blast fungus, <italic>CKS1</italic>, required for CK biosynthesis. The protein encoded by this gene presents all the features of a tRNA-IPT enzyme, the type of which is known in plants and yeast, and suspected in many fungi, to perform the first step of one of the CK biosynthesis pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref045">45</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis of tRNA<italic>-</italic>IPT protein sequences suggests that this gene is highly conserved among Ascomycete fungi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s010">S8 Fig</xref>) and beyond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref065">65</xref>]. Our work sets the basis for functional analysis of this pathway in several other plant associated fungi known to produce CKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref067">67</xref>].</p>
<p>We generated a <italic>cks1</italic> mutant strain and demonstrated that this strain does not produce any of the CK types secreted by the wild type GY11 and <italic>cks1</italic><sup><italic>CKS1</italic></sup> complemented strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1005457.t001">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, the CKS1 protein is the only one found to contain an IPT domain in the rice blast fungal genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s001">S1 Table</xref>). These results suggest that the CK biosynthesis pathway controlled by CKS1 is probably the only one in the rice blast fungus. Nucleotide forms, which are known to be precursors to riboside, free base and glycosylated CKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref044">44</xref>], seem to be the major type of CKs secreted by control strains (<italic>cks1</italic><sup><italic>CKS1</italic></sup> and GY11). This contrasts with the yeast <italic>Δmod5</italic> mutant which was found to still produce CKs, and suggested that tRNA turnover is not mainly involved in yeast CK production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref068">68</xref>]. However, the <italic>Δmod5</italic> mutant was grown on medium composed of yeast extract that already contains hormonal compounds. Thus, the free CK production by yeast observed in that study could have come from the recycling of CK compounds provided by the medium.</p>
<p>Like the yeast <italic>Δmod5</italic> mutant, the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae cks1</italic> mutant had no obvious pleiotropic effects under standard growth conditions in minimal medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s005">S3 Fig</xref>). By contrast, the growth of <italic>cks1</italic> was affected under oxidative stress and this could be reverted by exogenous CKs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s006">S4 Fig</xref>). This result suggests that CKs play a role in fungal processes, like in yeast, for which MOD5 has primary roles in translation and is required for antifungal drug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref049">49</xref>]. These processes may participate to the loss of virulence of the <italic>cks1</italic> mutants (see below).</p>
<p>In plants, CK signaling is mediated by a multistep phosphorelay system involving Histidine Kinase Receptors, Histidine Phospho-transfer proteins and Response Regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref069">69</xref>]. This kind of transduction system is widespread among organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref070">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref073">73</xref>]. Several studies mentioned its involvement in osmoregulation in yeast and in hyphal growth of <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref074">74</xref>]. Based on protein sequence homology, putative orthologous genes to those of the plant CK signaling pathway were found in the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Two of these genes, <italic>MoSLN1</italic> (coding for an histidine kinase receptor) and <italic>MoSSK1</italic> (coding for type-A response regulator), were previously shown to be required for full virulence of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref075">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref076">76</xref>]. This suggests that CKs could also be perceived by the blast fungus in order to trigger a signal potentially required for its virulence. However, the involvement of these proteins in CKs perception and/or in CKs signaling transduction in response to plant or fungal-derived CKs remains to be established.</p>

<title>Cytokinins are required for fungal virulence</title>
<p>In addition to becoming deficient in CK production, the <italic>Magnaporthe cks1</italic> mutant was less virulent than wild-type GY11 or <italic>cks1</italic><sup><italic>CKS1</italic></sup> control strains since its capacity for penetration and invasion was strongly impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005457.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

Only very recent studies reported the role of protein effectors in virulence of <italic>Magnaporthe</italic> during host invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref078">78</xref>]. The characterization of the CK deficient <italic>cks1</italic> strain demonstrates that CKs play a key role in virulence of the rice blast fungus. Testing whether CKs play similar roles in other pathogenic fungi is now possible since <italic>CKS1</italic> homologs exist in most of them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s010">S8 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>An exogenous supply of kinetin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005457.g003">Fig 3</xref>) or cis-zeatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s008">S6 Fig</xref>) post inoculation restored the virulence of the CK-deficient strain, suggesting that the lack of virulence of these mutants was due to their inability to produce CKs. Moreover, exogenous application of kinetin reverted part of the over-induction of defense by the <italic>cks1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005457.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). This suggests that although other defects due to the deletion of the tRNA-IPT gene may exist, they are not responsible for this over-induction of defense. The demonstration that these fungal-derived CKs are secreted <italic>in planta</italic> is technically challenging because of the presence of plant CKs and the difficulty to localize such small metabolites. However the observation that the expression of plant CK responsive genes is differentially affected by the <italic>cks1</italic> strain before penetration in the plant tissue (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005457.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005457.g005">5A</xref>) suggests that the CKs produced by <italic>Magnaporthe</italic> are also secreted and detected by the plant. The plant receptors and pathways engaged in CK detection remain to be identified and CK mutants in rice will have to be produced to address this question.</p>

<title>Fungal cytokinins affect plant defense and nutrient fluxes and fungal physiology</title>
<p>Several observations support the hypothesis that the impaired virulence of <italic>cks1</italic> is the consequence of an inability of the fungus to manipulate the plant defense pathways and metabolic fluxes rather than a consequence of a self-triggered growth arrest (caused by the <italic>cks1</italic> loss-of-function) that would in turn trigger enhanced defense. First, enhanced defense is already visible <italic>before</italic> fungal penetration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005457.g005">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s007">S5B Fig</xref>) at a time where the <italic>cks1</italic> and control strains were indistinguishable in terms of growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s006">S4C Fig</xref>). Second, reduced fungal growth could be partially restored by manipulating the plant in three ways: (i) by reducing plant defense chemically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005457.g004">Fig 4</xref>) (ii) by impairing immunity genetically in two independent mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005457.g006">Fig 6</xref>), (iii) by modifying plant fertilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005457.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Third, the restoration of virulence under high fertilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005457.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) did not affect the over-induction of defense responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005457.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). This indicates that the arrest of fungal growth can be compensated by high N-fertilization, although the associated over-induction of defense response cannot, presumably because CKs are still not produced. For these reasons, we propose that the impaired virulence of the <italic>cks1</italic> mutant is the consequence of the absence of CK production that would normally dampen defenses and modify nutrient fluxes for the pathogen’s benefit. Since the <italic>cks1</italic> mutant is also more susceptible to oxidative stress <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005457.s006">S4 Fig</xref>), this may further reduce its global capacity to grow into plant tissues, especially if the plant ROS production is enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005457.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). In that sense the <italic>cks1</italic> mutant is similar to the <italic>des1</italic> mutant which is required for dampening ROS-mediated plant defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref054">54</xref>].</p>

<title>Possible effects of fungal CK on the plant metabolism</title>
<p>The transient and elevated sugar content in <italic>cks1</italic> compared to the <italic>cks1</italic><sup><italic>CKS1</italic></sup> strain at 48 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005457.g008">Fig 8A</xref>) is consistent with previous studies in other pathosystems that showed that an early and strong accumulation of soluble sugars, providing energy for the establishment of host defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref079">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref080">80</xref>]. By contrast, the lower contents of glucose, fructose and sucrose found after 72 hpi with the <italic>cks1</italic> strain suggests that photosynthesis is reduced in plants infected by the CK-deficient strain. We propose that <italic>Magnaporthe</italic>-derived CKs contribute to prevention of photosynthesis breakdown during infection process, for instance by limiting oxidative stress generated through photorespiration and, in consequence, allowing the establishment of the biotrophic phase. Among the different amino acids quantified, the contents of two key amino acids (glutamate and aspartate), which are known to be essential for <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref062">62</xref>], were differently affected between mutant and control strains following infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005457.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, CKs were described to alter transcription of genes like glutamate dehydrogenase, asparagine synthetase and aspartate aminotransferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref081">81</xref>]. The fungal-derived CKs could also alter transcription of these genes to re-channel these amino acids towards fungal hyphae. Furthermore, CKs were previously shown to modify amino acid uptake through fungal cell membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref082">82</xref>]; therefore, <italic>cks1</italic> mutants could also be affected in their capacity to import these molecules into fungal hyphae. Altogether, these possible effects of CKs could explain why aspartate and glutamate contents were differently affected during infection by <italic>cks1</italic> strain and the complemented <italic>cks1</italic><sup><italic>CKS1</italic></sup> strain. These results suggest that fungal CKs could be involved in pathogen nutrition during infection as hypothesized for many plant/fungi interactions by Greene (1980) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Our results also suggest that the lack of virulence of <italic>cks1</italic> mutants is partially due to an inability to limit plant defense responses like the oxidative burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005457.g004">Fig 4</xref>) and transcription of defense-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005457.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The enhanced oxidative burst could lead to the stronger induction of defense markers observed during mutant infection and could participate to the strengthening of the cell wall to limit fungal penetration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref083">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref084">84</xref>]. This is consistent with the ROS scavenging activity of CKs demonstrated in transgenic tobacco by Pogány et al., (2004)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref085">85</xref>]. Quite paradoxically, exogenously applied CKs have been shown to enhance, in combination with salicylic acid, rice defense marker genes expression and phytoalexin biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref086">86</xref>]. This synergistic effect depends on key defense transcriptional regulators like OsWRKY45, a pivotal factor in biotic and abiotic stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref087">87</xref>]. Similarly, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, specific recognition of bacterial CKs by plant CK receptors leads to a stronger induction of plant defenses and host resistance, involving plant CK Response Regulators and the transcription factor TGA3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref088">88</xref>]. In this context, how the CKs produced by <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> can act as negative regulators of defenses remains to be elucidated.

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>CKs play a key role in plant-microorganism communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref089">89</xref>] and it seems to be particularly true in plant symbiotic relations with fungi and bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref090">90</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref091">91</xref>]. Our work, showing that <italic>Magnaporthe</italic> requires CK production to be fully virulent, extends the key role that these hormones play in the interactions between plants and microbes to pathogenic fungi that do not trigger organ deformation. Our work suggests that CKs produced by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> act like classical effectors during host invasion as they significantly reduce defenses (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref078">78</xref>]). Moreover, our study shows that fungal CKs can divert and attract plant nutrients essential for fungal growth, much like the TAL effectors from bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005457.ref003">3</xref>]. Therefore, CKs, like other hormones, could represent metabolic effectors with several biological functions. Given their central role in several metabolic processes, plant hormones represent ideal factors to be acquired as effectors by pathogens. Accordingly, evolution probably led the rice blast fungus to include CKs into its weapons for successful colonization of rice plants.</p>
