<abstract>
<p>Bacterial uptake by phagocytic cells is a vital event in the clearance of invading pathogens such as <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>. A major role of the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) on leukocytes against invasive pneumococcal disease is described in this study. Phagocytosis experiments using different serotypes demonstrated that PSGL-1 is involved in the recognition, uptake and killing of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>. Co-localization of several clinical isolates of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> with PSGL-1 was demonstrated, observing a rapid and active phagocytosis in the presence of PSGL-1. Furthermore, the pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide and the main autolysin of the bacterium ―the amidase LytA― were identified as bacterial ligands for PSGL-1. Experimental models of pneumococcal disease including invasive pneumonia and systemic infection showed that bacterial levels were markedly increased in the blood of <italic>PSGL-1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. During pneumonia, PSGL-1 controls the severity of pneumococcal dissemination from the lung to the bloodstream. In systemic infection, a major role of PSGL-1 in host defense is to clear the bacteria in the systemic circulation controlling bacterial replication. These results confirmed the importance of this receptor in the recognition and clearance of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> during invasive pneumococcal disease. Histological and cellular analysis demonstrated that <italic>PSGL-1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice have increased levels of T cells migrating to the lung than the corresponding wild-type mice. In contrast, during systemic infection, <italic>PSGL-1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice had increased numbers of neutrophils and macrophages in blood, but were less effective controlling the infection process due to the lack of this functional receptor. Overall, this study demonstrates that PSGL-1 is a novel receptor for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> that contributes to protection against invasive pneumococcal disease.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> is one of the most important and devastating human pathogens worldwide, mainly affecting young children, elderly people and immunocompromised patients. In terms of host immune defense against invasive pneumococcal isolates, professional phagocytes require receptor-mediated recognition of certain ligands on the bacterial surface for the uptake and clearance of the microorganism. In this study, we demonstrate that the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) on leukocytes is involved in the phagocytosis process of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> by targeting the capsule and the surface protein LytA as pathogen-associated molecular patterns. To explore this process in more detail, we have used wild-type mice and mice deficient in PSGL-1 demonstrating that lack of PSGL-1 is detrimental for the host by increasing the susceptibility to the infection and the severity of the pneumococcal invasive disease. Overall, these data show the importance of PSGL-1 on leukocytes in host defense against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> and confirm that PSGL-1 plays a critical protective role against invasive bacterial disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (pneumococcus) is one of the major causes of invasive disease accounting for more deaths than any other vaccine-preventable bacterial infection. This microorganism colonizes the human nasopharynx, being one of the leading causes of acute otitis media, community-acquired pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) including sepsis and meningitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref001">1</xref>]. The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 14 million episodes of serious pneumococcal disease occur every year with a critical impact in childhood population as pneumonia kills more children than AIDS, malaria and measles combined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Resolution of pneumococcal disease is regulated by the efficient recognition and clearance of the invading pathogen by professional phagocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref003">3</xref>]. Leukocytes play an important role in inflammatory and immune responses against bacterial infection and bacterial clearance depends on the efficacy of different receptors on phagocytic cells to recognize, internalize and kill the pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref007">7</xref>]. Phagocytic receptors on the cell surface trigger phagocytosis following direct recognition of particulate targets. Interaction between selectins and selectin-ligand molecules is essential for the host-pathogen encounter due to its crucial role in leukocyte extravasation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref008">8</xref>]. In this sense, expression of P-selectin and E-selectin by the endothelium provides protection against invading pathogens such as <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref010">10</xref>]. P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) on leukocytes mediates interactions with P-selectin and E-selectin expressed by endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref011">11</xref>]. PSGL-1 is a homodimeric mucin-like glycoprotein expressed on the surface of almost all circulating leukocytes with a great importance in leukocyte adhesion and transmigration as it is responsible for the initial steps of the extravasation cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref012">12</xref>]. However, certain intracellular pathogens have developed sophisticated strategies exploiting specific receptors for their own benefit to enter eukaryotic cells and replicate intracellularly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref013">13</xref>]. This is the case of the obliged intracellular pathogens <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic>, <italic>Ehrlichia</italic> sp., and enterovirus 71 that get access inside the cell by binding PSGL-1, causing granulocytic anaplasmosis/ehrlichiosis and hand-foot-mouth disease respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref016">16</xref>]. However, there is no experimental evidence indicating that PSGL-1 could act as a receptor on leukocytes participating in the recognition and clearance of extracellular invading pathogens such as <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>. In this sense, the main goal of this study was to investigate the protective contribution of PSGL-1 in host defense against IPD.</p>

<title>PSGL-1 is a functional receptor in neutrophils involved in the phagocytic process of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic></title>
<p>The plasma membrane of phagocytes expresses an array of receptors that interact with specific microbial ligands promoting the internalization and clearance of the potential pathogen. To evaluate the impact of PSGL-1 in pneumococcal phagocytosis, HL-60 cells differentiated to granulocytes were used as target cells because they express the same phagocytic receptors as peripheral blood neutrophils including PSGL-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref017">17</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005500.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). To assess the role of PSGL-1 in the phagocytosis of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, the receptor function was blocked using the specific monoclonal antibody KPL-1. This is an accepted method to assess the impact of PSGL-1 in microbial interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref016">16</xref>]. To determine the generic role of PSGL-1 in host defense against this important pathogen, clinical isolates of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> belonging to different serotypes were assessed. Phagocytosis was significantly impaired when PSGL-1 was blocked, indicating that pneumococcal phagocytosis is more efficient when this receptor is fully active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). The contribution of FCγ-receptors was evaluated indicating that the effect of PSGL-1 in phagocytosis is independent of FCγ-receptors activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005500.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). In addition, bacterial killing mediated by PSGL-1 was examined using three different clinical isolates. Our results showed that pneumococcal survival increased when PSGL-1 in phagocytic cells was blocked, demonstrating that this receptor is involved in the clearance of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Finally, phagocytosis experiments using neutrophils obtained from the spleen of wild-type and <italic>PSGL-1</italic><sup>–/–</sup>mice by cell sorting, confirmed that PSGL-1 is involved in the phagocytosis of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>).</p>

<p>To further analyze the kinetics of pneumococcal phagocytosis, cells with PSGL-1 ―either active or antibody-blocked― were infected with the D39 (serotype 2) strain expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP), and the phagocytosis process was monitored using live imaging confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005500.s004">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005500.s005">S2 Movies</xref>). When PSGL-1 was active, a rapid and active phagocytosis was observed, with the majority of the cells containing pneumococcal cells by the end of the process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005500.s004">S1 Movie</xref>).

<title>Autolysin LytA and pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide are bacterial ligands recognized by PSGL-1</title>
<p>Phagocytosis requires receptor-mediated recognition of microbial ligands that are usually expressed in the surface of invading pathogens. These ligands are frequently known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) which are recognized by specific receptors of the innate immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref019">19</xref>]. As LytA ―the main cell wall hydrolase of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>― is located on the bacterial surface and it is essential to interact with critical components of the host immune response including neutrophils and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref021">21</xref>], we explored the possible interaction of PSGL-1 with LytA. Pneumococcal recognition by PSGL-1 was hindered in the absence of LytA, suggesting that LytA might be a bacterial ligand for PSGL-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). Direct interaction between purified LytA and PSGL-1 molecules was observed confirming that this receptor recognizes LytA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). This interaction was dependent on the concentration of PSGL-1, suggesting that recognition of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> is enhanced when PSGL-1 levels are increased. Preincubation of HL-60 cells with purified LytA before infection reduced the phagocytosis in a similar way than KPL-1 antibody, supporting additional evidence that LytA interacts with PSGL-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005500.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). To confirm the interaction of LytA and PSGL-1 we included the non-capsulated strain (M11) and an isogenic <italic>lytA</italic> mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Our results demonstrated that in the absence of LytA, the binding of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> to PSGL-1 is impaired. Although the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is one of the major virulence factors of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, resistance to phagocytosis can vary with the capsular type, which might explain differences of invasiveness among strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref023">23</xref>]. Capsule recognition by PSGL-1 was investigated using a non-capsulated strain (M11) and several isogenic transformants of M11 expressing different CPSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). The absence of CPS caused impaired recognition by PSGL-1, in comparison to the corresponding encapsulated transformants, confirming that PSGL-1 recognizes the pneumococcal CPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). However, different levels of binding were observed depending on the CPS with the weakest recognition for the pneumococcal strain expressing serotype 19A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Experiments including purified CPS of type 3 and different concentrations of PSGL-1 were included to investigate the binding of PSGL-1 to the pneumococcal capsule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). This CPS was assessed because is included in the current PCV-13 vaccine and clinical isolates of serotype 3 are a major cause of IPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref024">24</xref>].

<title>PSGL-1 on leukocytes controls the severity of pneumococcal infection</title>
<p>The development of IPD depends of the complex interplay of many factors including virulence determinants of the pathogen and the efficacy of the host immune response to clear the infection process. A failure to efficiently detect and destroy <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> in the lower respiratory tract or the systemic circulation lead to severe pneumonia or disseminated infection which are associated to increased mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref003">3</xref>]. Next, the protective role of PSGL-1 against IPD was investigated using pneumonia and sepsis models of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In pneumonia, bacterial counts were slightly higher in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung of <italic>PSGL-1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, and much higher in the blood of KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). These bacterial levels were markedly elevated at 24 h in the blood of <italic>PSGL-1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (with the progression of the infection), confirming that PSGL-1 contributes to control bacterial load by reducing the severity of pneumococcal dissemination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In the sepsis model, <italic>PSGL-1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice had greater levels of bacteria in blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). In addition, lethal infection developed faster in <italic>PSGL-1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice than in wild-type mice indicating that PSGL-1 plays a critical role in host defense against IPD by controlling bacterial infection in the systemic circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g005">Fig 5B and5C</xref>). To confirm this hypothesis and exclude the contribution of cellular migration mediated by PSGL-1, mice were directly infected by the intravenous route (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Mice lacking PSGL-1 had increased levels of bacteria in blood than wild-type mice both at 6 and 24 h confirming that a major function of PSGL-1 in host defense is to clear the bacteria in the bloodstream controlling the dissemination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). To extend the importance of PSGL-1 in the clearance of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> from the systemic infection, a sepsis model was repeated using a lethal dose of a different serotype such as TIGR4 strain. Our findings corroborated the results obtained with the D39 strain demonstrating that lack of PSGL-1 was associated with increased bacterial counts in blood and a more severe infection compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005500.g005">Fig 5E and 5F</xref>). Overall, our findings demonstrate that PSGL-1 plays an important role against IPD.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Neutrophils are key players in the innate and adaptive immune responses to microbial cells, since they are critical for rapid clearance of invading bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref026">26</xref>]. For this process, neutrophils must first detect the microorganisms using surface receptors that are essential to engulf and kill the pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref027">27</xref>]. PSGL-1 is a ligand of P-, E- and L-selectins, and is able to mediate the tethering and rolling of circulating leukocytes on the activated endothelium prior to their extravasation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref012">12</xref>]. The role of P, E and L-selectin as well as certain integrins against pneumococcal infection has been previously characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref029">29</xref>]. However, the direct role of PSGL-1 on leukocytes in host defense against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> including its contribution to the recognition and clearance of this microorganism is unknown. As this bacterium is highly variable with up to 96 serotypes described so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref030">30</xref>], we included different serotypes of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> to investigate the role of PSGL-1 in phagocytosis. Hence, our findings showed that PSGL-1 is involved in the recognition and phagocytosis of a major human pathogen such as <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> contributing therefore to the variety of receptors on professional phagocytes that are needed to efficiently identify and destroy invading pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref018">18</xref>]. For the detection of the pathogen it is necessary the interaction of phagocytic receptors with bacterial ligands that are usually exposed on the surface of the microorganism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref019">19</xref>]. Using LytA-deficient mutants, we have recently demonstrated that this surface-exposed protein is a major determinant in the virulence of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> by interacting with essential components of the immune system including phagocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref020">20</xref>]. Our results show now that the LytA autolysin is recognized by PSGL-1 and this effect is dependent on the level of PSGL-1 suggesting that variations in the expression of PSGL-1 on leukocytes might contribute to the efficiency of this interaction. One of the major concerns in the outcome of the infection is that pneumococcal disease can be produced by clinical isolates of a wide variety of polysaccharide capsules, the main virulence determinant of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref023">23</xref>]. In this sense, using pneumococcal transformants expressing the same genetic background but different CPS, we have demonstrated that PSGL-1 recognizes the capsule of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>. This effect was variable depending on the CPS expressed, with the lowest binding related to the strain expressing serotype 19A. In this sense, incidence of IPD cases caused by this serotype has dramatically increased in the last few years and it has been linked to the emergence of vaccine escape variants that arise by switching the capsular locus from serotype 4 to 19A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref032">32</xref>]. These results are important in terms of pathogenesis because differences in the recognition of pneumococcal CPS by receptors such as PSGL-1, might explain why certain serotypes of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> are more associated to IPD and dissemination worldwide than others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>The repertoire of host receptors involved in the binding, uptake, signaling and response to invading pathogens is critical for the outcome of the infection. PSGL-1 is the main selectin receptor involved in neutrophil adhesion and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref008">8</xref>]. Although the importance of leukocyte extravasation is relevant in pneumococcal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref029">29</xref>], the contribution of PSGL-1 to the resolution of IPD was previously unknown. In this study we have used <italic>PSGL-1</italic><sup>−/−</sup>mice to investigate the in vivo role of this receptor in host defense against pneumococcal infection. Our findings confirm that PSGL-1 may act as a pathogen-recognition receptor of the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref034">34</xref>]. In this sense, PSGL-1 acts in host defense controlling bacterial proliferation, dissemination and tissue injury which are critical aspects of IPD. This is of great relevance from the respiratory perspective as invasive pneumonia caused by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> is one of the major causes of mortality in children and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref003">3</xref>]. Lack of PSGL-1 has been linked to a greater susceptibility against the intracellular pathogens <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> or <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>, which is associated with dramatically increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines after intestinal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref036">36</xref>]. In the case of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>, bacterial recognition by immune cells generates an array of cytokines which may play a significant role in host defense. Increase of IL-5, IL-6 and IFN-γ was observed in <italic>PSGL-1</italic><sup>–/–</sup>mice sera. According to our findings, it has been described that increased serum levels of IL-5 and IL-6 were associated with reduced microbial clearance and higher mortality rates in sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref038">38</xref>]. In addition, the increased levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ in the lungs of wild-type mice might be protective as IFN-γ is involved in the IL-12 regulation of neutrophil-mediated host defense against pneumococcal pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>Bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract are characterized by massive accumulation of neutrophils in the alveolar spaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref040">40</xref>]. Our results show that similar numbers of neutrophils and macrophages were observed in the lungs of <italic>PSGL-1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Our results might be unexpected as PSGL-1 is involved in cellular migration of these cells and therefore, increased numbers should be present in the lungs of wild-type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref008">8</xref>]. Hence, our findings can be explained in the context of a bacterial infection as certain pathogens ―including <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic>― have the ability to impair neutrophil migration to the site of infection by cleaving PSGL-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref042">42</xref>]. Interestingly, this is in line with previous findings confirming that the absence of endothelial selectins E, L and P is not associated with impairment of leukocyte emigration to infection sites after pneumococcal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref043">43</xref>]. In addition, PSGL-1 negatively regulates CD4<sup>+</sup>T cell immune responses <italic>in vivo</italic> which can explain the increased levels of T cells observed in the lungs of <italic>PSGL-1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> infected mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref044">44</xref>].</p>
<p>Using an intravenous infection model when no collateral migration effects were expected, higher numbers of neutrophils and macrophages but not T cells, were observed in <italic>PSGL-1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. This is consistent with previous observations showing that blood of <italic>PSGL-1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice contained similar numbers of lymphocytes although they had a significant increase in the proportion of leukocytes, with enhanced levels of granulocytes and monocytes in comparison to wild-type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref045">45</xref>]. This is relevant from the phagocytosis perspective as <italic>PSGL-1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, despite having increased numbers of these phagocytic cells in the bloodstream, were unable to control bacterial replication in the blood, leading to the rapid development of fatal infection. Overall, these results confirm that PSGL-1 on leukocytes plays a critical role in host defense against pneumococcal infection. As a consequence of pathogen-recognition by PSGL-1, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> is efficiently engulfed and destroyed, reducing bacterial replication and dissemination in the host, contributing to control the severity of IPD.</p>

<title>Phagocytosis by HL-60 cells and neutrophils isolated from mice</title>
<p>HL-60 cells (CCL-240; ATCC) differentiated to granulocytes were used and the general conditions of the assay were based on those described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref048">48</xref>]. Briefly, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> strains were fluorescently labeled by incubation with FAM-SE (Molecular Probes) in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer for 1 h at 37°C, washed five times with Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) and stored at −70°C in 10% glycerol as aliquots for further assays. HL-60 cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with HBSS and once with HBSS in the presence of calcium and magnesium ions. Infection assays were performed in the absence of serum to avoid complement-dependent phagocytosis and 10<sup>5</sup> HL-60 cells were infected with 2×10<sup>6</sup> colony forming units (CFU) of viable FAM-SE labeled bacteria. To block PSGL-1, HL-60 cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 25 μg/ml of the KPL-1 antibody (mouse anti-human PSGL-1; MBL) or IgG isotype control (mouse anti-human IgG; Novus Biologicals) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref016">16</xref>]. A similar approach was performed using purified LytA. A minimum of 6,000 cells were analyzed using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciencies). Using cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, we have previously shown that the majority of the effect on the association of fluorescent <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> with HL-60 cells is due to phagocytosis rather than to adhesion of bacteria to the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref049">49</xref>]. Results were expressed as a fluorescence index defined as the proportion of positive cells for fluorescent bacteria multiplied by the geometric mean of fluorescence intensity which correlates with the amount of bacteria phagocytosed per cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref048">48</xref>].</p>
<p>Opsonophagocytosis killing assays were performed in the absence of serum using 10<sup>5</sup> HL-60 cells with the PSGL-1 receptor either active or blocked as mentioned above and 2.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/ml of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref050">50</xref>]. Serial dilutions of culture supernatants were plated on blood agar plates for bacterial counts determination and results were expressed as bacterial survival after 45 min incubation of the pneumococcal strains with HL-60 cells expressing (or not) PSGL-1.</p>
<p>Phagocytosis assays were repeated using neutrophils purified from the spleen of wild-type and <italic>PSGL-1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice by FACS using a FACSAria I (BD Biosciences) dispositive with DIVA version 6.1 software as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref051">51</xref>]. Briefly, single-cell suspensions were prepared in staining buffer (2% fetal calf serum in PBS), and non-specific binding was blocked with Fc block (BD Biosciences).

Animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of ISCIII. All mice used were 8–16 weeks old, and within each experiment, groups of mice were matched for age and sex. Studies investigating pneumococcal sepsis or pneumonia were performed using groups of at least 5 mice and infected as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005500.ref048">48</xref>].

For intravenous inoculation, mice were infected with 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/mouse of D39 strain through the tail vein.
