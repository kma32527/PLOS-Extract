<abstract>
<p>Emergency myelopoiesis is inflammation-induced hematopoiesis to replenish myeloid cells in the periphery, which is critical to control the infection with pathogens. Previously, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-α and IFN-γ were demonstrated to play a critical role in the expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and myeloid progenitors, leading to production of mature myeloid cells, although their inhibitory effects on hematopoiesis were also reported. Therefore, the molecular mechanism of emergency myelopoiesis during infection remains incompletely understood. Here, we clarify that one of the interleukin (IL)-6/IL-12 family cytokines, IL-27, plays an important role in the emergency myelopoiesis. Among various types of hematopoietic cells in bone marrow, IL-27 predominantly and continuously promoted the expansion of only Lineage<sup>−</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup> (LSK) cells, especially long-term repopulating HSCs and myeloid-restricted progenitor cells with long-term repopulating activity, and the differentiation into myeloid progenitors in synergy with stem cell factor. These progenitors expressed myeloid transcription factors such as <italic>Spi1</italic>, <italic>Gfi1</italic>, and <italic>Cebpa/b</italic> through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 3, and had enhanced potential to differentiate into migratory dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils, and mast cells, and less so into macrophages, and basophils, but not into plasmacytoid DCs, conventional DCs, T cells, and B cells. Among various cytokines, IL-27 in synergy with the stem cell factor had the strongest ability to augment the expansion of LSK cells and their differentiation into myeloid progenitors retaining the LSK phenotype over a long period of time. The experiments using mice deficient for one of IL-27 receptor subunits, WSX-1, and IFN-γ revealed that the blood stage of malaria infection enhanced IL-27 expression through IFN-γ production, and the IL-27 then promoted the expansion of LSK cells, differentiating and mobilizing them into spleen, resulting in enhanced production of neutrophils to control the infection. Thus, IL-27 is one of the limited unique cytokines directly acting on HSCs to promote differentiation into myeloid progenitors during emergency myelopoiesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Emergency myelopoiesis is inflammation-induced hematopoiesis, which is critical for controlling systemic infection with pathogens such as a virus, bacteria, or parasite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref002">2</xref>]. In contrast to adaptive immune cells such as T cells and B cells, which can vigorously proliferate in response to their specific antigens, innate immune cells need to be replenished from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitors in bone marrow (BM) because of their low proliferative activity. However, the molecular mechanism of emergency myelopoiesis during infection remains incompletely understood. HSCs and hematopoietic progenitors can directly sense the presence of pathogens via pattern recognition receptors (Rs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and they can also respond to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-γ, interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref001">1</xref>]. IFN-α and IFN-γ have pleiotropic effects on many cell types, including HSCs and hematopoietic progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref001">1</xref>]. Recently, these cytokines were demonstrated to induce an expansion of HSCs and myeloid progenitors, leading to the production of mature myeloid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref006">6</xref>], although their inhibitory effects on hematopoiesis were previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref009">9</xref>]. Currently, thus, there are several conflicting positive and negative effects of IFN-α and IFN-γ in hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref011">11</xref>]. However, these discrepancies may be explained by compensatory mechanisms, including IFN-γ-mediated secretion of other cytokines such as IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref012">12</xref>] and fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>IL-27 is one of the IL-6/IL-12 family cytokines; it plays important roles in immune regulation with both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref016">16</xref>]. IL-27 consists of p28 and Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3), and its receptor is composed of WSX-1 and glycoprotein (gp)130, which is a common receptor subunit in many of the IL-6 family cytokines. We previously demonstrated that IL-27 plays a role in HSC regulation, and that IL-27 expands HSCs and promotes their differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref017">17</xref>]. Moreover, transgenic (Tg) mice expressing IL-27 showed enhanced myelopoiesis in BM and extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, we further examined the effects of IL-27 on hematopoiesis, the molecular mechanisms, and the physiological role of IL-27 in the control of malaria infection. IL-27 acted on and expanded Lineage (Lin)<sup>−</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup> (LSK) cells, which are highly enriched in HSCs together with very primitive hematopoietic progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref019">19</xref>], in BM cells in synergy with stem cell factor (SCF, c-Kit ligand) and differentiated HSCs into myeloid progenitors through activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT3. Moreover, malaria infection induced IFN-γ production, which augmented IL-27 expression, and the IL-27 then promoted the expansion and mobilization of LSK cells into the spleen, resulting in enhanced myelopoiesis to resolve the infection. Our results revealed that IL-27 is one of the limited unique cytokines directly acting on long-term HSCs (LT-HSC), which represent the true stem cells capable of self-renewing, and promotes the expansion and differentiation of them into myeloid progenitors.</p>

<title>IL-27 and SCF expand only LSK cells among various kinds of BM progenitors</title>
<p>Previously, we demonstrated that stimulation of LSK cells with IL-27 and SCF induces an expansion of HSCs and hematopoietic progenitors, including short-term repopulating cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref017">17</xref>]. Moreover, we found that only the combination of IL-27 and SCF, but not either alone, vigorously and continuously expands BM cells to produce LSK cells and CD11b<sup>+</sup>c-Kit<sup>−</sup> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref017">17</xref>]. To examine which cell populations in BM cells respond to IL-27 and SCF in more detail, BM cells were divided into two populations positive or negative for Lin markers except CD11b, and the Lin<sup>−</sup> population was further divided into four populations positive for either c-Kit or CD11b, or both positive, or both negative. Each population purified by sorting was then stimulated with IL-27 and SCF. Among these five populations, only the Lin<sup>−</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup> population greatly expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Next, the BM cells were divided into respective hematopoietic progenitors according to the expression of cell surface markers, as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref022">22</xref>], and stimulated with IL-27 and SCF. Only the LSK cell population vigorously and continuously expanded over more than 6 weeks, although transient and slight expansion was seen in the cell populations of granulocyte/macrophage progenitor (GMP), common myeloid progenitor (CMP), and megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitor (MEP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g001">Fig 1B–1E</xref>). The expanding cells in the LSK cell population were further analyzed for the expression of cell surface markers. In line with the preliminary results, there seemed to be two populations, the phenotypical LSK population and the Lin<sup>+</sup>c-Kit<sup>−</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g001">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Expansion of only the c-Kit<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>−</sup>Lin<sup>−</sup> population by IL-27 and SCF in BM cells. Total BM cells were divided into two populations positive or negative for Lin markers, and the Lin<sup>−</sup> population was further divided into four populations positive for either c-Kit or CD11b, both positive, or both negative. Each population (5 × 10<sup>3</sup>) purified by sorting was stimulated by either IL-27 or SCF alone, or both, in a round 96-well plate and photographed 2 weeks later. (B-E) Expansion of only the LSK cell population by IL-27 and SCF among various BM progenitors. BM progenitors (4–5 × 10<sup>3</sup>) purified by sorting were stimulated with IL-27 and SCF. Cell expansion was photographed at indicated periods (B) and cell number of the expanded LSK cell population retaining the LSK phenotype was counted at 1 week (C). Time kinetic analysis of cell numbers in the LSK population retaining the LSK phenotype (D). Representative flow cytometry dot plot analysis of c-Kit and Lin (upper) and of c-Kit and Sca-1 in the Lin<sup>−</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup> population (lower) of expanded LSK cells and progenitor cells at 1 week (E). (F) Expansion of LSK populations <italic>in vivo</italic> by IL-27 in <italic>IL-27</italic> Tg mice. LSK cells were purified by sorting from BM cells of <italic>GFP</italic> Tg mice and transferred into non-lethally irradiated WT and <italic>IL-27</italic> Tg mice. Twenty days later, BM and spleen in these recipient mice were analyzed for GFP<sup>+</sup> LSK populations.

<p>We previously demonstrated that <italic>IL-27</italic> Tg mice, which express high amounts of IL-27 in blood, show an increased number of LSK cells in the BM and spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref017">17</xref>]. To further examine the <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of IL-27 on the expansion of LSK cells, LSK cells were purified by sorting from BM cells of <italic>GFP</italic> Tg mice and transferred into wild-type (WT) and <italic>IL-27</italic> Tg mice. The transferred GFP<sup>+</sup> LSK cells vigorously expanded in the BM and spleen of <italic>IL-27</italic> Tg mice, but not in those of WT mice, and approximately half of the expanding cells retained the cell surface markers for LSK phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). These results suggest that IL-27 vigorously and continuously augments the expansion of LSK cells both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>IL-27 has the strongest ability to augment the expansion of LSK cells and their differentiation into myeloid progenitors retaining the LSK phenotype</title>

Moreover, although there are several cytokines, such as IL-3, IL-11, G-CSF, and TPO, that are known to transiently expand and differentiate HSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref001">1</xref>], none showed an ability superior to that of IL-27 in expanding LSK cells retaining the LSK phenotype over a long period of time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005507.s002">S1 Fig</xref>).

<p>The LSK cells expanded by IL-27 and SCF were further analyzed for the cell surface expression of various markers, and the expression levels were compared with those of primary LSK cells freshly prepared from BM of WT mice. The expression levels of macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR), CD16/32, and MHC class II in the LSK cells expanded by IL-27 and SCF were much higher than those in primary LSK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

<p>Next, multipotency of the LSK cells expanded by IL-27 and SCF were examined under various differentiation conditions for migratory dendritic cells (mDCs) by granulocyte/macrophage (GM)-CSF, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and conventional DCs (cDCs; lymphoid-resident DCs) were examined using Flt3L and thrombopoietin (TPO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref023">23</xref>], myeloid cells were examined using IL-3 and SCF, and T cells and B cells were examined by using thymic stromal cells (TSt4) with and without expressing Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (DLL1), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref024">24</xref>]. The expanded LSK cells much more rapidly proliferated and differentiated into MHC class II<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> mDCs than primary LSK cells in response to GM-CSF, although the total number of mDCs achieved seemed to be similar for both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). However, LSK cells stimulated with IL-27 and SCF rapidly lost the ability to differentiate into pDC and cDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). These phenomena are highly consistent with the almost complete abolishment of Flt3 expression on the expanded LSK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Under myeloid differentiation conditions, the expanded LSK cells differentiated much more greatly into neutrophils and slightly into mast cells, but less so into macrophages and basophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g002">Fig 2F and 2G</xref>). Similar enhanced differentiation into myeloid cells was observed using the LSK cells obtained from WT and <italic>IL-27</italic> Tg mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005507.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). In contrast, the ability to differentiate into B cells and T cells was almost completely abrogated in the expanded LSK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g002">Fig 2H</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, the ability of the LSK cells expanded by IL-27 and SCF to differentiate into myeloid cells <italic>in vivo</italic> was explored by using mixed BM chimeras. The equal cell numbers of the LSK cell population expanded from CD45.1 congenic mice and BM cells from CD45.2 congenic mice were mixed and transferred into sublethally irradiated CD45.2 congenic mice. After 9 days, cell populations of neutrophils in the BM and spleen were analyzed. In agreement with the <italic>in vitro</italic> results described, the percentages of neutrophils derived from the expanded LSK cells were markedly higher than those from primary LSK cells in both BM and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g002">Fig 2I</xref>).</p>
<p>To explore the molecular mechanisms whereby IL-27 and SCF expand LSK cells, total RNA was prepared from the expanded LSK cells and respective hematopoietic progenitors and analyzed with real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The expanded cells highly expressed the transcription factors critical for differentiation into myeloid cells such as <italic>Spi1</italic>, <italic>Gfi1</italic>, and <italic>Cebpa</italic>, but expression was much less for those important for the other types of cells such as <italic>Irf8</italic>, <italic>Tcf4</italic>, and <italic>Ikzf1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref027">27</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g002">Fig 2J</xref>). No expression of transcription factors important for B cells and erythrocytes, <italic>Pax5</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref028">28</xref>] and <italic>Gata1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref029">29</xref>], respectively, was observed. In addition, the expression of <italic>Cbepb</italic>, which is a transcription factor recently demonstrated to be regulated by cytokines and control emergency granulopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref032">32</xref>], was also increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005507.s004">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>These results suggest that LSK cells expanded by IL-27 and SCF are multipotent myeloid progenitors that have unique potential to differentiate into mDCs, neutrophils, and mast cells, and less so into macrophages, and basophils, but not into pDCs, cDCs, T cells, and B cells.</p>

<title>STAT1 and STAT3 are important for expansion and differentiation of LSK cells by IL-27 and SCF</title>

<p>To further investigate the roles of STAT1 and STAT3 in the expansion of LSK cells and the ability to differentiate into myeloid progenitors by IL-27 and SCF, we used <italic>STAT1</italic>-deficient LSK cells and conditional <italic>STAT3</italic>-knockout (<italic>STAT3</italic> cKO) LSK cells. LSK cells from WT (129) and <italic>STAT1</italic>-deficient mice were stimulated with IL-27 and SCF. Although WT LSK cells comprised more than 90% of cells with the LSK phenotype after 7 days, <italic>STAT1</italic>-deficient LSK cells comprised half LSK phenotype cells and half Sca-1<sup>−</sup>LK (LS<sup>−</sup>K) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Nevertheless, the number of expanded cells was comparable among them, probably due to the anti-proliferative effects by STAT1 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref034">34</xref>]. However, the purified <italic>STAT1</italic>-deficient LS<sup>−</sup>K cells failed to survive thereafter, even in the presence of IL-27 and SCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), although the purified <italic>STAT1</italic>-deficient LSK cells expanded well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), as did WT 129 LSK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Moreover, WT and <italic>STAT1</italic>-deficient LSK cells had similar abilities to differentiate into MHC class II<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup> mDC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g003">Fig 3E</xref>) and macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). <italic>STAT1</italic>-deficient LSK cells showed reduced ability to differentiate into neutrophils and mast cells, but increased ability to differentiate into basophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). In line with the reduced ability to differentiate into neutrophils, mRNA expression of the critical transcription factor <italic>Gfi1</italic> was significantly reduced in <italic>STAT1</italic>-deficient LSK cells compared with that in WT LSK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). In contrast, <italic>STAT3</italic> cKO LSK cells expanded very little in response to IL-27 and SCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). Moreover, the residual surviving LSK cells almost completely lost the ability to differentiate into mDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g003">Fig 3I</xref>) and myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g003">Fig 3J</xref>).

<title>IL-27 and SCF expand CD34<sup>−</sup>CD150<sup>+</sup> LSK cells into myeloid progenitor cells</title>
<p>To more precisely define which cell population responds to stimulation with IL-27 and SCF, LSK cells were further divided into two populations according to CD34 expression. Although the percentage of the more primitive population of CD34<sup>−</sup> LSK cells was much less than that of CD34<sup>+</sup> LSK cells, the CD34<sup>−</sup> LSK cells responded much better to stimulation with IL-27 and SCF and expanded more vigorously than CD34<sup>+</sup> LSK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). Then, the LSK cells were further divided into eight populations, F1 to F8, including LT-HSCs (CD34<sup>−</sup>CD150<sup>+</sup>CD41<sup>−</sup> LSK, F1) and myeloid-restricted progenitor cells with long-term repopulating activity (MyRPs, CD34<sup>−</sup>CD150<sup>+</sup>CD41<sup>+</sup> LSK, F4) according to the recently revised criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref019">19</xref>]. Respective populations purified by sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) were stimulated with IL-27 and SCF. Only two populations, F1 and F4, vigorously expanded. F5, which corresponds to populations more differentiated toward myeloid cells such as macrophages, slightly expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>). The F1 and F4 populations expanded by IL-27 and SCF had great abilities to differentiate into myeloid cells, particularly neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Thus, IL-27 and SCF expand CD34<sup>−</sup>CD150<sup>+</sup> LSK cells, including LT-HSCs and MyRPs, and differentiate them into myeloid progenitor cells, which have great potential to differentiate mainly into neutrophils.</p>

The infection markedly induced the enhanced percentage and number of LSK cells in the BM and spleen of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>). The LSK cells in the BM showed greatly augmented abilities to differentiate <italic>in vitro</italic> into neutrophils and mast cells, but had slightly reduced abilities to differentiate into macrophages and basophils after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Moreover, the LSK cells in the spleen exhibited a much more enhanced ability to differentiate into neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g005">Fig 5E</xref>).

<p>To further elucidate the protective role of LSK cells in malaria infection, LSK cells purified from BM cells of infected WT CD45.1 mice were injected into the infected <italic>WSX-1</italic>-deficient CD45.2 mice.

Thus, the blood stage of malaria infection augments the expression of IL-27 through IFN-γ, and IL-27 then promotes the expansion, differentiation, and mobilization of LSK cells into the spleen to control parasitemia.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previously, we found that IL-27, which is in the IL-6/IL-12 family of cytokines, plays a role in the regulation of HSCs <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref017">17</xref>]. Here, we have further elucidated that IL-27 is a unique cytokine that directly acts on LSK cells to promote their differentiation into myeloid progenitor cells called M-CSFR<sup>+</sup>Flt3<sup>−</sup>CD16/32<sup>+</sup> LSK cells, which still retain the LSK phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g002">Fig 2A–2I</xref>). These progenitors have great potential to give rise to neutrophils, mDCs, and mast cells, but not to pDCs, cDCs, T cells, and B cells. Interestingly, among various BM progenitor cells, IL-27 and SCF vigorously and continuously expand only HSCs and primitive myeloid progenitor cells with long-term repopulating activity, such as LT-HSCs and MyRPs, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref019">19</xref>], for more than 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Consistent with the ability to differentiate into myeloid progenitor cells, the LSK cells expanded by IL-27 and SCF expressed transcription factors such as <italic>Spi1</italic>, <italic>Gfi1</italic>, <italic>Cebpa</italic>, and <italic>Cebpb</italic>, which are critical for myeloid differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref032">32</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g002">Fig 2J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005507.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). Although <italic>Cebpb</italic> was reported to be an important transcription factor for emergency granulopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref032">32</xref>], STAT3 signaling was revealed to be important for its upregulation, whereas STAT1 signaling unexpectedly suppressed its expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005507.s011">S10 Fig</xref>). This phenomenon seems to correlate to the expression level of the anti-apoptotic gene <italic>Bcl-2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref040">40</xref>], but not the transcription factor <italic>E2-2</italic>, which is critical for pDC differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref041">41</xref>]. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the precise roles of each STAT in the regulation of <italic>Cebpb</italic> expression. Thus, IL-27 is one of the limited unique cytokines that directly acts on the most primitive LT-HSCs; it promotes their expansion and differentiation into myeloid progenitor cells, presumably through MyRPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref019">19</xref>], to replenish myeloid cells such as neutrophils in the periphery during emergency myelopoiesis.</p>
<p>Sca-1 is an IFN-responsive molecule that is highly upregulated in many hematopoietic cells following exposure to IFNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref037">37</xref>]. Consequently, myeloid-restricted progenitor cells normally identified as Lin<sup>−</sup>Sca-1<sup>−</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup> (LS<sup>−</sup>K) become positive for Sca-1 and can no longer be distinguished from the real multipotent LSK cells, resulting in overestimation of the latter population, and this is a problem. IL-27 was previously reported to enhance the expression of Sca-1 on T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref042">42</xref>]. However, to alleviate the problem, we initially identified the cell population responsive to IL-27 and SCF among BM cells by using LSK cells and various hematopoietic progenitor cells purified by sorting. Intriguingly, it turned out that the SCF and LSK cell populations expanded vigorously and continuously in response to IL-27, and that the LS<sup>−</sup>K cell populations including GMP, CMP, and MEP only transiently and slightly responded during the first week and then disappeared thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g001">Fig 1A–1E</xref>). Moreover, in almost all <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, we used primary LSK cells that were purified by sorting. The high responsiveness of the LSK cells to IL-27 seems to be partially due to the higher mRNA expression of <italic>WSX-1</italic> in the LSK cells compared to that of other hematopoietic progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005507.s004">S3 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>We previously demonstrated that during the blood stage of malaria infection with attenuated <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> XAT, IL-12-mediated IFN-γ production and phagocytic cells (including neutrophils) in the spleen are critical for controlling parasitemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref043">43</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrated that neutrophils play an important role in killing malaria parasites in mice, rats, and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref045">45</xref>]. In marked contrast, regarding infection with lethal <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> NK65, IL-12-mediated IFN-γ production was shown to contribute to T-cell-dependent immunopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref046">46</xref>]. However, a major role of IL-27 in infection is its suppression of excess immune responses against infection by controlling the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref016">16</xref>]. Consistent with this, WSX-1/IL-27 was recently demonstrated to have a critical role in limiting the effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated immunopathology caused by IL-12-dependent IFN-γ production during infection with lethal <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> NK65 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref049">49</xref>]. The present study clearly revealed that WSX-1/IL-27 contributes to clearance of parasites due to enhanced myelopoiesis during the early phase of infection with attenuated <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> XAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005507.s006">S5A Fig</xref>). However, during the late phase of infection, WSX-1/IL-27 seems to play a role in limiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005507.s006">S5B Fig</xref>), leading to augmented reduction of parasitemia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005507.s006">S5A Fig</xref>), as in the case of infection with lethal <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> NK65 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref049">49</xref>]. Moreover, our preliminary data revealed that there were no apparent differences observed in parasitemia or expansion of LSK cells and neutrophils in the BM and spleen of WT and <italic>WSX-1</italic>-deficient mice 7 days after infection with lethal <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> NK65 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005507.s012">S11 Fig</xref>). It is conceivable that pro-inflammatory cytokines other than IL-27 were abundantly produced in the absence of IL-27 during infection with lethal <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> NK65 and that late-phase infection with attenuated <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> XAT may have redundantly compensated for the loss of IL-27 to promote myelopoiesis. However, other studies have shown that IL-27 limits migration of neutrophils from the BM to the site of inflammation by reducing production of cytokines and chemokines during influenza infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref050">50</xref>] and septic peritonitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref051">51</xref>]. IL-27 was also reported to be a negative regulator of neutrophil function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref052">52</xref>]. Although IL-27 directly promotes myelopoiesis to produce myeloid progenitors in BM, as shown in the present study, IL-27 may indirectly regulate migration of these progenitors and neutrophils to the site of inflammation and limit neutrophil function. Thus, IL-27 has both positive and negative effects on neutrophils; therefore, the overall outcome of the effects of IL-27 is likely to be governed by the balance between these effects, depending on the disease model.</p>
<p>It was recently demonstrated that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>chabaudi</italic> infection induces mobilization of early myeloid progenitor cells out of BM, thereby transiently establishing myelopoiesis in the spleen through IFN-γ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref037">37</xref>]. However, the expression of IFN-γR in the hematopoietic compartment was dispensable, whereas its expression in the irradiation-insensitive cellular compartment, including endothelial cells and stromal cells, was important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref037">37</xref>]. Secretion of IFN-γ-induced chemokines such as CCL2 and CCL7 by non-hematopoietic cells plays a critical role in the mobilization of CCR2-expressing HSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref037">37</xref>]. In this study, however, there is no experimental evidence regarding how IFN-γ regulates the activation of HSCs. In the present study, <italic>WSX-1</italic>-deficient mice showed significantly reduced numbers of LSK cells and neutrophils compared with WT mice after <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> XAT infection, resulting in increased parasitemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g005">Fig 5A–5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005507.s006">S5A Fig</xref>). These results suggest that endogenous IL-27 greatly contributes to the clearance of parasitemia through augmentation of myelopoiesis. Moreover, similar to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>chabaudi</italic> infection, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> XAT infection could not increase the number of LSK cells in <italic>IFN-γ</italic>-deficient mice with increased parasitemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Of note, after <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> XAT infection, <italic>p28</italic> mRNA expression and its serum protein level were markedly upregulated in an IFN-γ-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005507.s010">S9 Fig</xref>). This is consistent with previous reports indicating that <italic>p28</italic> gene transcription in macrophages is induced by IFN-γ and TLR ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref053">53</xref>], and that IFN-γ limits Th17-mediated and Th9-mediated autoimmune inflammation through IL-27 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref055">55</xref>]. In addition, the hydrodynamic injection of the IL-27 expression vector into infected <italic>IFN-γ</italic>-deficient mice greatly recovered the number of LSK cells and neutrophils in the BM and spleen and eventually reduced parasitemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g006">Fig 6E–6G</xref>). Thus, during malaria infection, it is highly conceivable that the proliferative effects on LSK cells by IFN-γ are indirectly mediated by IL-27. In our study, we could not observe any direct proliferative effect of IFN-α and IFN-γ on LSK cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, as recently pointed out by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref011">11</xref>], and only IL-27 augmented the proliferative effect for more than 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g001">Fig 1G and 1H</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, IL-27 was reported to have a polyglutamic acid domain in the p28 subunit, which is unique among cytokines, and to confer hydroxyapatite-binding and bone-binding properties and bone tropism to bone sialoprotein and the endosteal bone surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref056">56</xref>]. This location in the BM has been identified as a niche for HSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref057">57</xref>], and these properties support the idea that IL-27 plays a critical role in the regulation of HSCs in that niche. We detected much higher expressions of IL-27 subunits (both <italic>p28</italic> and <italic>EBI3</italic>) at mRNA levels in BM than in the spleen during the steady state, and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> XAT infection greatly augmented the expression of <italic>p28</italic> mRNA in both BM and spleen, and also its serum protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005507.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>). Further studies are necessary to clarify which BM cells produce IL-27 during malaria infection; mesenchymal stromal cells might be a candidate because of their reported IL-6 production during viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref012">12</xref>], as described in the next section.</p>
<p>It was recently demonstrated that specific cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during an acute viral infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus secrete IFN-γ, thus enhancing the production of IL-6 in BM mesenchymal stromal cells and resulting in an increased number of early multipotent progenitors and committed myeloid precursors in the BM and accumulation of myeloid cells in the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref012">12</xref>]. The IL-6Rα chain is only expressed at the stage of early multipotent progenitors and downstream myeloid precursors, and it is lacking HSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref012">12</xref>]. In contrast, IL-27 most predominantly acts on only HSCs, as shown in the present study. Both IL-6 and IL-27 share gp130, which is ubiquitously expressed as a common receptor subunit. Therefore, downstream of IFN-γ, both IL-27 and IL-6 may be necessary to induce the maximum myelopoiesis to control infection. However, the mode of IL-6 action is complex and there are two major mechanisms: IL-6 classic signaling through membrane IL-6Rα and IL-6 <italic>trans</italic>-signaling through soluble IL-6Rα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref059">59</xref>]. It was recently reported that <italic>IL-6Rα</italic>-deficient mice show increased resistance to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>chabaudi</italic> infection and that IL-6 <italic>trans</italic>-signaling, but not IL-6 classic signaling, contributes to a lethal outcome of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005507.ref060">60</xref>]. In contrast to the viral infection, we could not detect any increased mRNA expression of <italic>IL-6</italic> in the BM or spleen of WT and <italic>IFN-γ</italic>-deficient mice with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> XAT infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005507.s009">S8 Fig</xref>). A similar inability of IFN-γ to enhance <italic>IL-6</italic> mRNA expression in WT BM cells <italic>in vitro</italic> was also observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005507.s010">S9A Fig</xref>). In addition, <italic>IL-6</italic>-deficient mice showed little increased susceptibility to the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> XAT infection, reduced cell numbers in the LSK cell population, and reduced neutrophils in the BM and spleen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005507.s013">S12 Fig</xref>). Thus, individual pathogens may utilize different mechanisms to induce emergency myelopoiesis through IL-27, IL-6, and others.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present results provide a novel role and mechanism for the action of IL-27 downstream of IFN-γ in the efficient expansion of myeloid progenitor cells from LT-HSCs and MyRP cells and their mobilization into the spleen during acute malaria infection.</p>

Data are shown as mean ± SEM (n = 5) and are representative of at least two independent experiments. *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.005. (B-C) Similar cell numbers of the LSK cell population and neutrophils in the BM and spleen of WT and <italic>IL-6</italic>-deficient mice compared with mice infected with malaria. BM and spleen cells were analyzed by flow cytometry 7 days after malaria infection; representative dot plots of c-Kit and Sca-1 in the Lin<sup>−</sup> population (B) and Gr-1 and CD11b (C) are shown. The cell numbers of the LSK cell population and neutrophils were counted (B-C). Data are shown as mean ± SEM (n = 3) and are representative of two independent experiments. *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.005.</p>
