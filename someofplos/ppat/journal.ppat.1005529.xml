<abstract>
<p>Although nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins are the major immune receptors in plants, the mechanism that controls their activation and immune signaling remains elusive. Here, we report that the avirulence effector AvrPiz-t from <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> targets the rice E3 ligase APIP10 for degradation, but that APIP10, in return, ubiquitinates AvrPiz-t and thereby causes its degradation. Silencing of <italic>APIP10</italic> in the non-<italic>Piz-t</italic> background compromises the basal defense against <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>. Conversely, silencing of <italic>APIP10</italic> in the <italic>Piz-t</italic> background causes cell death, significant accumulation of Piz-t, and enhanced resistance to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>, suggesting that APIP10 is a negative regulator of Piz-t. We show that APIP10 promotes degradation of Piz-t via the 26S proteasome system. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AvrPiz-t stabilizes Piz-t during <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> infection. Together, our results show that APIP10 is a novel E3 ligase that functionally connects the fungal effector AvrPiz-t to its NLR receptor Piz-t in rice.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Rice is the staple food for half of the world’s population. Rice diseases are, however, the major threat for stable rice production worldwide. Elucidating the molecular basis is pivotal for the development of durable resistance to control rice diseases. We previously found that the RING finger E3 ligase APIP6 interacts with AvrPiz-t and plays a role in rice PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). In this study, we characterized another RING finger E3 ligase in rice, named APIP10. Like APIP6, APIP10 and AvrPiz-t degrade each other, and APIP10 is a positive regulator of PTI. Interestingly, reduction of <italic>APIP10</italic> expression level in the <italic>Piz-t</italic> resistant plants causes severe cell death and accumulation of the NLR receptor Piz-t, indicating APIP10 is a negative regulator of Piz-t. We also show that APIP10 can promote Piz-t degradation while AvrPiz-t can stabilize Piz-t. Our results demonstrate that APIP10 is a target of a fungal effector and a negative regulator of an NLR receptor in plants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Unlike animal responses to pathogen infection, plant responses to pathogen infection do not include a circulatory system or specialized cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref001">1</xref>]. Instead, individual plant cells launch defense responses against invading pathogens. Extensive molecular studies over the last two decades have revealed two layers of host immunity in plants. Plant immunity can be activated when highly conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are recognized by plasma membrane-bound pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in a process called PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). PTI is considered the first layer of plant immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref003">3</xref>]. For the second layer, immunity can be activated when pathogen-delivered avirulence (Avr) effectors are recognized by the product of plant resistance (R) genes in a process called effector-triggered immunity (ETI). ETI can be achieved by the direct or indirect interaction between the Avr effectors and R proteins in the plant cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref004">4</xref>]. Upon recognition, both immunity layers are capable of initiating a signaling cascade that can result in multiple defense responses.</p>
<p>The nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins play a major role as intracellular immune receptor R proteins in plant immunity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref005">5</xref>]. Most R genes cloned to date encode NLR proteins that mediate recognition of diverse effectors from all classes of plant pathogens. Both direct and indirect interactions between NLRs and effectors occur in different pathosystems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref006">6</xref>]. In the indirect interactions, additional plant proteins are the targets of effectors and may be either genuine virulence targets of the effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref007">7</xref>] or decoy proteins that plants have evolved to mimic <italic>bona fide</italic> effector targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref008">8</xref>]. A hybrid model of the direct and indirect interactions was proposed in which the target protein serves as ‘bait’ that the effector associates with before direct interaction with the NLR receptor and before immune signaling is activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Because NLR activation and signaling usually results in strong defense responses and a hypersensitive reaction (HR), such activation and signaling must be tightly regulated to avoid adverse effects on plant growth and development when plants are not under pathogen attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref013">13</xref>]. Some factors controlling NLR activation and signaling have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref010">10</xref>]. For example, analysis of crystal structure and <italic>in vitro</italic> interactions revealed that the two CHORD domains of a single RAR1 molecule bridge the N-termini of the HSP90 monomers, thus regulating the ‘open’ and ‘closed’ state of the HSP90 dimer that coordinates NLR stabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref014">14</xref>]. Two independent studies showed that the tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein SRFR1 is a negative regulator of the accumulation and activation of the NLR receptor SNC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Ubiquitin-mediated degradation of proteins via the 26S proteasome is important for the regulation of protein levels in living cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref017">17</xref>]. The E3 ligases in the ubiquitination process interact and bring substrates to be ubiquitinated in proximity to the conjugating enzyme E2. Involvement of ubiquitination in NLR-mediated immunity has been recently reported in plants (see review by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref018">18</xref>]). For example, the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex involving the F-box protein CPR30/CPR1 (SCF<sup>CPR1</sup>) targets the NLR protein SNC1 and RPS2 for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref012">12</xref>]. Furthermore, when plants overexpressing CPR1 were treated with the 26S proteasomal inhibitor MG132, levels of SNC1 increased. This observation suggested that SNC1 levels are modulated by SCF<sup>CPR1</sup> via the 26S proteasome-mediated degradation pathway. However, it is unknown whether these E3 ligase complexes are the host targets of pathogen effectors.</p>
<p><italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> is the causal agent of rice blast, a severe disease that limits rice production worldwide. We cloned the R gene <italic>Piz-t</italic> from rice and its cognate avirulence gene <italic>AvrPiz-t</italic> from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref019">19</xref>]. <italic>Piz-t</italic> encodes an NLR protein, but <italic>AvrPiz-t</italic> does not show homology to any genes in the databases. Our previous study showed that AvrPiz-t is secreted into the rice cell and interacts with the rice E3 ligase APIP6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref020">20</xref>]. Analysis of <italic>APIP6</italic> RNAi transgenic plants showed that APIP6 is a positive regulator of PTI. AvrPiz-t and APIP6 can degrade each other <italic>in planta</italic>. APIP10 is another E3 ligase that was identified in the yeast-two hybrid screen when AvrPiz-t was used as the bait in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref020">20</xref>]. To determine the role of APIP10 in rice immunity in the current study, we analyzed the relationships among APIP10, AvrPiz-t, and Piz-t. We report that APIP10 contributes to rice immunity by functioning in both PTI and ETI. While APIP10 is the target of AvrPiz-t’s virulence activity for suppression of PTI, APIP10 is also a negative regulator of the accumulation and activation of the NLR receptor Piz-t. Degradation of APIP10 by AvrPiz-t results in the release of APIP10 suppression of Piz-t accumulation and the initiation of a strong defense response. Our study identifies a novel E3 ligase, APIP10, that functionally connects a fungal effector with its NLR receptor in plants.</p>

<title>AvrPiz-t interacts with the putative E3 ligase APIP10 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>We previously reported that AvrPiz-t interacts with three putative C3HC4-type E3 ligases in yeast-two hybrid (Y2H) screens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref020">20</xref>]. Among the <underline>A</underline>vr<underline>P</underline>iz-t <underline>i</underline>nteracting <underline>p</underline>roteins (APIPs), APIP10 showed a strong interaction and was selected for further studies. We confirmed the interaction between AvrPiz-t and APIP10 in yeast using four selection markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005529.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). To further validate the interaction in yeast, we performed <italic>in vivo</italic> Co-IP (co-immunoprecipitation) experiments by co-expressing <italic>GFP</italic>:<italic>AvrPiz-t</italic>:<italic>HA</italic> and <italic>Myc</italic>:<italic>APIP10</italic> in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> using the agroinfiltration method. Because the AvrPiz-t signal peptide is cleaved in the mature protein, we used the <italic>AvrPiz-t</italic> gene without its N-terminal signal peptide sequence to make constructs in the following experiments unless indicated otherwise. When the GFP:AvrPiz-t:HA fusion protein was immunoprecipitated (IP) from the plant extract using anti-HA IgG beads, the Myc:APIP10 proteins were detected in the immunocomplex of GFP:AvrPiz-t:HA with the anti-Myc antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005529.s001">S1B Fig</xref>, middle lane of the upper-right panel). As a control, no visible background signal was detected in the samples expressing only GFP:AvrPiz-t:HA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005529.s001">S1B Fig</xref>, the third lane of the upper-right panel) or Myc:APIP10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005529.s001">S1B Fig</xref>, the first lane of the upper-right panel). These results indicate that AvrPiz-t interacts with APIP10 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Since AvrPiz-t interacts with three putative C3HC4-type E3 ligases in the Y2H screens as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref020">20</xref>], we decided to confirm whether that the interaction between AvrPiz-t and APIP10 is specific by including an unrelated E3 ligase, SPL11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref021">21</xref>], as an additional negative control in the Co-IP experiment. To facilitate the detection of SPL11 <italic>in planta</italic> as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref022">22</xref>], mSPL11, which has three mutations in the U-box domain, was used in the experiment.

When the GFP:AvrPiz-t:HA fusion protein was immunoprecipitated from the plant extract using the anti-HA IgG beads, the Myc:APIP10 proteins were also detected in the immunocomplex of GFP:AvrPiz-t:HA with the anti-Myc antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005529.s001">S1C Fig</xref>, first lane of the top-right panel).

<title>APIP10 is a functional RING finger E3 ligase</title>
<p><italic>APIP10</italic> identified from the Y2H library consists of a 1,416-bp open reading frame and encodes a protein with 472 amino acids. BLAST searches showed that <italic>APIP10</italic> is a single-copy gene in the rice genome and that the predicted protein belongs to a large family of conserved and ubiquitous RING finger proteins in eukaryotes. APIP10 has multiple, predicted conserved domains such as a BRAP2 (<underline>BR</underline>CA1-<underline>A</underline>ssociated <underline>P</underline>rotein <underline>2</underline>), a C3HC4-type RING finger, a ZnF UBP (<underline>Z</underline>i<underline>n</underline>c-<underline>F</underline>inger <underline>U</underline>biquitin <underline>B</underline>inding <underline>P</underline>rotein), and a coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005529.s002">S2A Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether APIP10 has E3 ligase activity like other BRAP2-RING Finger-ZnF UBP proteins, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay with a series of negative controls. In the E3 ligase activity assay, the MBP:APIP10 fusion protein purified from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> was incubated with wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) E1, Arabidopsis E2 (AtUBC10), 5X Myc:ubiquitin (Myc:Ub), and ATP. To verify whether the E3 ligase activity of APIP10 depends on its RING finger domain, we included the mutant dRING (APIP10 dRING) in which the RING finger at the amino acid position from 158 to 204 was completely deleted. In the preliminary experiment, no polyubiquitin product was visible when Ub was used. Therefore, Ub fused with 5X Myc was used in the reaction, and the immunoblot with anti-Myc antibody was performed to enhance the detection of the polyubiquitin. A band of polyubiquitin product with high molecular weight was detected in the reaction with the complete APIP10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005529.s002">S2B Fig</xref>, lane 6, arrow indicated) but not in the reaction with APIP10 dRING (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005529.s002">S2B Fig</xref>, lane 5 in the top panel), suggesting that the RING finger domain is required for the E3 ligase activity of APIP10. To further confirm this result, we performed an E3 ligase assay with time and E2 enzyme quantity as variables and with APIP10 dRING as negative a control. The immunoblot analysis with anti-Myc antibody showed that a signal of the high molecular weight protein band (about 170 kD) became stronger as the time was increased (the protein band is indicated by an arrow in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005529.s003">S3A Fig</xref> in the top panel).

<p>To confirm the ubiquitination result, we repeated the E3 ligase assay for the reactions in lane 6–8 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g001">Fig 1A</xref>. Then we conducted a GST pulldown analysis by washing the GST:AvrPiz-t:HA and GST:AvrPi-ta:HA beads with the PBST solution (Phosphate Buffered Saline with 0.5% Triton X-100) after the E3 ligase reaction. Immunoblot analysis with the anti-HA antibody showed the ubiquitinated bands above the GST:AvrPiz-t:HA fusion protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005529.s004">S4 Fig</xref>, first lane in the upper panel).

<p>Because AvrPiz-t is ubiquitinated by APIP10 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), we hypothesized that AvrPiz-t may be a substrate of APIP10 <italic>in planta</italic>.

To determine the role of APIP10 in PTI against <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>, we designed an RNAi construct targeting 215 bp of <italic>APIP10</italic> 3’UTR using the pCXUN vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref025">25</xref>] and generated over 20 stable transgenic lines in NPB (without <italic>Piz-t</italic>).

<p>To determine whether the severe cell death triggered in the calli is related to the Piz-t:HA protein, we performed immunoblot analysis for Piz-t:HA with the anti-HA antibody and qRT-PCR of the <italic>APIP10</italic> transcripts; we did this with four independently transformed callus lines that showed different levels of cell death. qRT-PCR indicated that the transcript level of <italic>APIP10</italic> was lower in lines with severe cell death than in the line without cell death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005529.s010">S10 Fig</xref>, the upper panel), indicating that the cell death observed in the transgenic plants was caused by the silencing of <italic>APIP10</italic>. Strikingly, the lines with lower <italic>APIP10</italic> transcripts in the NPB <italic>Piz-t</italic>:<italic>HA</italic> background showed a higher expression level of the Piz-t-HA protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, the upper panel), suggesting that the <italic>APIP10</italic> transcript level is negatively correlated with Piz-t accumulation and cell death. To determine whether the accumulation of the Piz-t protein is due to its increased transcription, we used qRT-PCR to quantify <italic>Piz-t</italic> transcripts. The analysis revealed that the number of <italic>Piz-t</italic> transcripts in the <italic>APIP10</italic> RNAi callus lines was inversely related to Piz-t protein accumulation (.<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005529.s010">S10 Fig</xref>, the lower panel), indicating that the accumulation of the Piz-t protein is not the result of its increased transcription.</p>
<p>After two rounds of rice transformation, we were able to obtain only six T1 lines that had reduced cell death because most <italic>APIP10</italic> RNAi lines died within 2–3 weeks after transfer to soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, right panel). To confirm the results obtained from callus lines, we compared the T<sub>2</sub> plants of the <italic>APIP10</italic> RNAi lines in the NPB <italic>Piz-t</italic>:<italic>HA</italic> background with the wild-type NPB <italic>Piz-t</italic>:<italic>HA</italic> plants.

Immunoblot analysis of total protein obtained from the leaf tissue of two lines (#14–4 and 38–6) revealed that they contained 1.5- to 2.2-times more Piz-t:HA than the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). qRT-PCR analysis using the same leaf tissue showed that <italic>Piz-t</italic> transcripts were less abundant in the <italic>APIP10</italic> RNAi lines 14–4 and 38–6 than in the control plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005529.s011">S11B Fig</xref>), indicating that the Piz-t accumulation is not due to an increase in its transcription level.</p>

<title>Knockdown of <italic>APIP10</italic> in the <italic>Piz-t</italic> background compromises PTI but still enhances resistance to a virulent isolate</title>
<p>To determine whether PTI responses of <italic>APIP10</italic> RNAi lines in NPB <italic>Piz-t</italic>:<italic>HA</italic> were compromised as we had observed in the <italic>APIP10</italic> RNAi lines in NPB, we monitored the ROS generation triggered by chitin and flg22 in the leaf disks of 4-week-old plants. The analysis showed that silencing of <italic>APIP10</italic> in the presence of <italic>Piz-t</italic> almost completely suppressed ROS induced by flg22 in the leaf tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g003">Fig 3F</xref>) but did not suppress ROS induced by chitin significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). This observation was similar to that observed in the <italic>APIP10</italic> silencing lines in NPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). qRT-PCR also revealed that the RNAi lines showed significant but distinct transcriptional induction or suppression profiles of the PTI-related defense genes 3 h after treatment with chitin or flg22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). For example, the <italic>APIP10</italic> RNAi lines showed suppression of <italic>KS4</italic> transcripts at 3 h after treatment with flg22 or chitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g003">Fig 3H</xref>, left) but showed significant suppression of <italic>PAL</italic> transcripts at 3 h after treatment with flg22 but not after treatment with chitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g003">Fig 3H</xref>, right).</p>
<p>We next used the punch inoculation method to measure the resistance of the <italic>APIP10</italic> RNAi lines in the NPB <italic>Piz-t</italic>:<italic>HA</italic> background to the virulent <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> isolate RB22. Surprisingly, lesions were smaller on the <italic>APIP10</italic> RNAi plants in the <italic>Piz-t</italic> background than on the wild-type NPB-<italic>Piz-t</italic>:<italic>HA</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g003">Fig 3I</xref>); this was opposite to the disease phenotype observed in the <italic>APIP10</italic> RNAi plants in the NPB background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Consistent with lesion size, the relative fungal biomass measured by the DNA-based qPCR was significantly lower in the <italic>APIP10</italic> RNAi-NPB-<italic>Piz-t</italic>:<italic>HA</italic> plants than in the <italic>Piz-t</italic>:<italic>HA</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g003">Fig 3J</xref>, left panel). Furthermore, the sporulation in the infected area was significantly lower on the <italic>APIP10</italic> RNAi-NPB-<italic>Piz-t</italic>:<italic>HA</italic> plants than on the <italic>Piz-t</italic>:<italic>HA</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g003">Fig 3J</xref>, right panel). Taken together, these results suggest that silencing of <italic>APIP10</italic> in the <italic>Piz-t</italic> plants enhances resistance to the virulent isolate RB22 possibly through the accumulation of Piz-t, even though the PTI response was compromised because of the silencing of <italic>APIP10</italic>.</p>

<title>APIP10 promotes degradation of the Piz-t protein through the 26S proteasome system</title>
<p>Because we found that silencing of <italic>APIP10</italic> in transgenic rice leads to accumulation of the Piz-t protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g004">Fig 4B and 4D</xref>), we speculated that <italic>APIP10</italic> may promote the degradation of Piz-t in rice. To test this hypothesis, we co-expressed either <italic>Myc</italic>:<italic>APIP10</italic> or <italic>Myc</italic>:<italic>APIP10 dRING</italic> (as a negative control) with <italic>Piz-t</italic>:<italic>HA</italic> using agroinfiltration in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> leaves. Less Piz-t:HA protein accumulated when it was co-expressed with APIP10 than when it was co-expressed with APIP10 dRING, and the accumulation was recovered almost to the control level by treatment with MG132 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005529.s012">S12 Fig</xref>, lane 1 vs. 2 and lane 3 vs. 4 in the first panel).</p>
<p>To confirm these results, a semi-<italic>in vivo</italic> degradation assay was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref035">35</xref>]. For this assay, total protein extracted from the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>-inoculated <italic>Piz-t</italic>:HA rice plants was mixed with total protein extracted from <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> leaves co-expressed with either <italic>APIP10</italic> or <italic>APIP10</italic> dRING with GFP as an internal control. The samples were collected at different times before 1X SDS loading buffer was added to stop the reaction. The level of Piz-t was decreased by APIP10 over time, and after 2 h, less Piz-t protein was detected in the presence of APIP10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, lane 5) than in the presence of APIP10 dRING (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, lane 10). The decrease in the level of the Piz-t protein at 4 h was partially inhibited by treatment with MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, lane 2 in the first panel). To rule out the possibility that the deletion of the RING finger domain in APIP10 stabilizes both APIP10 dRING and Piz-t, myc:GFP was used as a negative control instead of APIP10 dRING in the semi <italic>in vivo</italic> degradation assay. The decrease in the level of the Piz-t protein was observed in the presence of Myc:APIP10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005529.s013">S13 Fig</xref>, lane 1 vs. lane 3 in the top panel) and the degradation of Piz-t:HA was partially inhibited by the MG132 treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005529.s013">S13 Fig</xref>, lane 1 vs. lane 2).

<p>Because we found that AvrPiz-t promotes degradation of APIP10 and that silencing of APIP10 leads to accumulation of Piz-t, we reasoned that expression of AvrPiz-t <italic>in planta</italic> may lead to the accumulation of Piz-t.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In host–microbe interactions, ubiquitination plays an important role in both host defense and pathogen infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref036">36</xref>]. Researchers have identified both pathogen effectors that target the ubiquitination machinery for defense suppression and plant ubiquitination-related proteins that target pathogen effectors for degradation and thus for defense enhancement. Most of these findings, however, have been derived from several model plant diseases caused by bacterial pathogens. Although recent research has revealed the importance of ubiquitination in plant diseases caused by fungi or oomycetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref037">37</xref>], the role of ubiquitination in these diseases is poorly understood. In particular, how microbial perturbation of host ubiquitination activates the defense response mediated by NLR receptor proteins is largely unknown. In this study, we describe the relationship among the fungal effector AvrPiz-t, the rice RING finger E3 ligase APIP10, and the NLR receptor Piz-t. We found that AvrPiz-t can interact with and promote the degradation of APIP10 when it is secreted into rice cells by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>. Silencing of <italic>APIP10</italic> in the <italic>Piz-t</italic> background causes severe cell death and accumulation of Piz-t. Co-infiltration assays showed that APIP10 expression leads to Piz-t degradation and that such degradation depends on the RING finger domain of APIP10. In contrast, AvrPiz-t can stabilize Piz-t during blast infection. These results demonstrate an elegant defense mechanism in which rice cells use the E3 ligase APIP10 to regulate Piz-t for immune responses when attacked by the blast fungus carrying the <italic>AvrPiz-t</italic> gene. Degradation of the APIP10 by AvrPiz-t and the resulting elimination of the negative regulation of Piz-t protein by APIP10 leads to a rapid increase in Piz-t and a strong defense response including programmed cell death in the infected cells. Although APIP10 seems similar to RIN4 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> in that they both negatively regulate an NLR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref007">7</xref>], the ability of APIP10 to degrade a pathogen effector (AvrPiz-t) and to regulate a host NLR (Piz-t) is unique. Therefore, identification of the novel E3 ligase APIP10 that functionally connects a fungal effector to its cognate NLR receptor in rice provides new insights into plant innate immunity.</p>
<p>We found that AvrPiz-t interacts with APIP10 and that this interaction reduces APIP10 E3 ligase activity. APIP10 specifically ubiquitinates AvrPiz-t but not the unrelated effector AvrPi-ta. The ubiquitination of AvrPiz-t depends on the RING domain of APIP10, and the degradation of AvrPiz-t depends on the 26S proteasome system. These results suggest that AvrPiz-t could be the pseudo-substrate of APIP10. By acting as the pseudo-substrate, AvrPiz-t might prevent APIP10 from ubiquitinating either the host proteins or even other cytoplasmic effector proteins secreted from the fungus. Interaction with AvrPiz-t reduces APIP10’s E3 ligase activity and the stability of APIP10. Turnover of E3 ligase enzymes that contain RING domains is regulated in many ways in cells. For example, CBL RING E3 ligases have substrate-dependent regulation in animal systems because substrate specificity plays a role in CBL turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref040">40</xref>]. Turnover of the rice E3 ligase APIP10 by a fungal effector is an interesting phenomenon. Further investigation of the mechanism underlying APIP10 degradation by AvrPiz-t in rice may provide new insights into fungal–plant interactions.</p>
<p>Ubiquitination is important in the regulation of defense-related NLR proteins in plants. Recent research shows that SCF<sup>CPR1</sup> regulates the levels of SNC1 and RPS2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref041">41</xref>]. Also, COP1-dependent regulation of an NLR HRT was observed in response to <italic>turnip crinkle virus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref013">13</xref>]. In this study, we found that APIP10 is a negative regulator of the NLR receptor Piz-t. Specifically, Piz-t levels are higher in the <italic>APIP10</italic> RNAi plants than in control plants, which is consistent with the accumulation of Piz-t after infection with isolates carrying AvrPiz-t. The accumulation of the Piz-t protein after the recognition of AvrPiz-t is unique because the R proteins RPM1 and RPG1 disappear after the recognition of cognate effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref043">43</xref>]. RPM1 is rapidly degraded with effector-mediated activation, perhaps due to a negative feedback that limits HR and attenuates the disease resistance response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref042">42</xref>]. The same laboratory reported that the disappearance of activated RPM1 is not dependent on the proteasome system because the two common proteasome inhibitors, MG132 and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, were not able to stabilize steady-state levels of RPM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref044">44</xref>]. Our results show that the Piz-t protein level is regulated by the proteasome system. However, we don’t know whether the accumulation of the Piz-t protein due to reduced transcription levels of <italic>APIP10</italic> leads to the activation of Piz-t and whether the activated form is translocated into the nucleus. In addition, the accumulation of Piz-t in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthimiana</italic> when AvrPiz-t is expressed is intriguing because it implies that <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> may have functional otholog(s) of APIP10. Indeed, two APIP10 homologs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://solgenomics.net/tools/blast/show_match_seq.pl?blast_db_id=267;id=Niben101Scf01072g01009.1;hilite_coords=60-483" xlink:type="simple">Niben101Scf01072g01009.1</ext-link>, 47% identity, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://solgenomics.net/tools/blast/show_match_seq.pl?blast_db_id=267;id=Niben101Scf05720g06002.1;hilite_coords=16-463" xlink:type="simple">Niben101Scf05720g06002.1</ext-link>, 43% identity) were found in the Sol Genomics Network Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://solgenomics.net/" xlink:type="simple">https://solgenomics.net/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>In addition, the APIP10 RING domain is vital for Piz-t degradation, suggesting the importance of E3 ligase activity in regulating NLRs. Even though the negative regulation of Piz-t by APIP10 during <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> infection is clear, how APIP10 regulates the Piz-t protein level before and after <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> infection remains unknown. Because no direct interaction between APIP10 and Piz-t was found in yeast, we speculate that a partner or chaperone protein links APIP10 and Piz-t in rice cells. Identifying this unknown protein is one of our objectives in dissecting the Piz-t-mediated signaling pathway.</p>
<p>Many Avr/R protein-protein interactions fit into the guard model, but the molecular mechanism that regulates the recognition and signaling between the pathogen and host proteins is incompletely understood, especially for fungal and oomycete pathogens of plants. In addition and as noted earlier, the regulation of NLR receptors before and after pathogen infection is still unclear. In our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref020">20</xref>], we found that AvrPiz-t targets the E3 ligase APIP6 for degradation and that APIP6 in turn degrades AvrPiz-t and positively regulates PTI to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> in rice. In this study, we found that APIP10 not only has a similar relationship as APIP6 with AvrPiz-t but also negatively regulates the NLR protein Piz-t via ubiquitination. Based on our previous results and those from this study, we provide the following model to explain the relationships among AvrPiz-t, APIP6, APIP10, and Piz-t (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005529.g007">Fig 7</xref>). After being secreted and translocated into rice cells, AvrPiz-t interacts with both APIP6/10 and interferes with their E3 ligase activity. In response, APIP6/10 ubiquitinate AvrPiz-t, which causes the degradation of AvrPiz-t in rice cells. When AvrPiz-t is delivered into rice cells without Piz-t, it promotes the degradation of APIP6/10 to suppress PTI. When the <italic>Piz-t</italic> plants are not attacked by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>, APIP10 directly or indirectly maintains the Piz-t protein at a low level through ubiquitination. However, when AvrPiz-t is delivered into rice cells expressing Piz-t, AvrPiz-t interacts with and degrades APIP10, which removes the negative regulation on Piz-t and causes the rapid accumulation of Piz-t protein. The rapid accumulation of Piz-t triggers a strong HR and the activation of defense responses.</p>

<title>Working model of the relationships among AvrPiz-t, APIP6, APIP10, and Piz-t.</title>
<p>When <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> spores land on a rice leaf and germinate, cell-surface localized PRRs can recognize PAMPs, which leads to PTI as a defense mechanism against the fungal infection. To counteract PTI, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> secretes effector proteins including AvrPiz-t. Once AvrPiz-t enters rice cells, it is translocated into rice cells and promotes the degradation of APIP6/10, which are positive regulators of PTI, to suppress defense responses such as accumulation of ROS and induction of defense-related genes. However, APIP10 is also a negative regulator of Piz-t in rice cells, and the degradation or modification of APIP10 by AvrPiz-t removes the negative regulation on Piz-t and thus leads to the accumulation of Piz-t, which triggers ETI-mediated responses. To counter its degradation by AvrPiz-t, APIP10 ubiquitinates AvrPiz-t, which leads to the degradation of the effector in the rice cell.</p>

<title>Rice plant induction treatment, inoculation, and gene expression analysis</title>
<p>The punch inoculation method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref046">46</xref>] with a slight modification was used to evaluate infection of rice plants by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>. Isolate RB22 was cultured on oat meal agar medium for 2 weeks. A 10-μl volume of a spore suspension (5 × 10<sup>5</sup> spores ml<sup>-1</sup>) was applied to slightly punctured sites of leaves on plants that were 4 to 6 weeks old. Lesion diameter was recorded 10 days after inoculation. To measure the sporulation rate, we removed a 3×1 cm<sup>2</sup> leaf piece that included a lesion and immersed it in a microcentrifuge tube containing 100 μl of distilled water with 1% Tween 20. The samples were vigorously mixed in a vortex apparatus for 2 min to dislodge the spores, and the number of spores ml<sup>-1</sup> was determined with a microscope and hemacytometer. The infection ratio was calculated as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref047">47</xref>]. Student’s <italic>t</italic>- test was used to test the significance of the differences between the segregating wild-type and lines expressing the transgenes.</p>
<p>qRT-PCR was used to determine gene expression in rice plants or detached leaves. After treatments had been applied to plants or detached leaves, total RNAs were extracted from leaf tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) to remove DNA contamination following the manufacturer’s protocol. About 1 μg of DNase I-treated RNA was subjected to first-strand cDNA synthesis using the Promega Reverse Transcription System (Promega). qRT-PCR was carried out using the iQ5 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad).

<title>Measurement of ROS level</title>
<p>The second leaf from the top of 4- to 6-week-old rice plants was used for the measurement of ROS. Small leaf discs (approximately 4 mm in diameter) were cut from the leaves with a cork borer and pre-incubated overnight in sterile-distilled water. After the leaf disks were treated with elicitors, ROS generation was monitored by the luminol chemi-luminescence assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005529.ref026">26</xref>]. Three pre-incubated leaf disks per sample were immersed in a microcentrifuge tube containing 100 μl of luminol (Bio-Rad), 1 μl of horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and the elicitor (100 nM flg22, 8 nM hexa-N-acetylchitohexaose, or water control). Luminescence was measured at 10-s intervals for 21 min using a Glomax 20/20 luminometer (Promega). Each treatment was represented by three replicate microcentrifuge tubes.</p>
