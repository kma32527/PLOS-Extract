<abstract>
<p>The intracellular endosymbiotic bacterium <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can protect insects against viral infection, and is being introduced into mosquito populations in the wild to block the transmission of arboviruses that infect humans and are a major public health concern. To investigate the mechanisms underlying this antiviral protection, we have developed a new model system combining <italic>Wolbachia-</italic>infected <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> cell culture with the model mosquito-borne Semliki Forest virus (SFV; <italic>Togaviridae</italic>, <italic>Alphavirus</italic>). <italic>Wolbachia</italic> provides strong antiviral protection rapidly after infection, suggesting that an early stage post-infection is being blocked. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> does appear to have major effects on events distinct from entry, assembly or exit as it inhibits the replication of an SFV replicon transfected into the cells. Furthermore, it causes a far greater reduction in the expression of proteins from the 3´ open reading frame than the 5´ non-structural protein open reading frame, indicating that it is blocking the replication of viral RNA. Further to this separation of the replicase proteins and viral RNA in transreplication assays shows that uncoupling of viral RNA and replicase proteins does not overcome <italic>Wolbachia’s</italic> antiviral activity. This further suggests that replicative processes are disrupted, such as translation or replication, by <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection. This may occur by <italic>Wolbachia</italic> mounting an active antiviral response, but the virus did not cause any transcriptional response by the bacterium, suggesting that this is not the case. Host microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in protection, but again we found that host cell miRNA expression was unaffected by the bacterium and neither do our findings suggest any involvement of the antiviral siRNA pathway. We conclude that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> may directly interfere with early events in virus replication such as translation of incoming viral RNA or RNA transcription, and this likely involves an intrinsic (as opposed to an induced) mechanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) pose a considerable threat to human and animal health, yet effective control measures have proven difficult to implement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref002">2</xref>]. In recent years novel means of reducing their replication in arthropod vectors have been suggested as an alternative way to reduce the prevalence of these viruses. One of the most exciting approaches is the use of the endosymbiotic intracellular bacterium <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to control arbovirus transmission from mosquito to vertebrate from within the arthropod vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref004">4</xref>]. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was first found to confer resistance to viruses in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref006">6</xref>]. When it was transferred to the mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> it made the mosquitoes resistant to two important human pathogenic arboviruses, dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref008">8</xref>]. Importantly, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can also invade and be stably maintained in natural populations thanks to a trait called cytoplasmic incompatibility, which causes embryos to die when uninfected females mate with infected males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref009">9</xref>]. This allows <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to spread through mosquito populations by providing a reproductive advantage to the <italic>Wolbachia-</italic>infected females that transmit the bacterium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref010">10</xref>]. Field trials have shown that releasing <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes allows the bacterium to invade <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref012">12</xref>] and reduces the susceptibility of the mosquitoes to DENV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>The mechanism(s) by which <italic>Wolbachia</italic> confers broad resistance remains unclear. Antiviral protection is seen in insects that harbour high densities of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref015">15</xref>]. For example Martinez et al (2014) showed a clear correspondence between <italic>Wolbachia</italic> density and the level of protection against the insect viruses, <italic>Drosophila</italic> C virus (DCV) and Flock House virus (FHV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref016">16</xref>]. This phenomenon is also seen in the mosquito <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic>, where the endogenous <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains <italic>w</italic>AlbA and <italic>w</italic>AlbB have a relatively low density especially in key tissues such as the midgut and offer little protection against DENV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref018">18</xref>]. It has also been hypothesised that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> protection is dependent on target cells and tissues harbouring <italic>Wolbachia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref017">17</xref>]. Indeed, there is little evidence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and virus being present together in the same cell when either is present in a high density, suggesting that antiviral protection is cell autonomous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref019">19</xref>]. It may be a case of competition for space or cellular resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref008">8</xref>]. Viruses and <italic>Wolbachia</italic> depend on host lipids, and in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> it has been shown that enriching dietary cholesterol reduced the extent to which <italic>Wolbachia</italic> protects against DCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref020">20</xref>]. It has also been suggested that there is competition for iron resources within cells, as <italic>Wolbachia</italic> upregulates transferrin in mosquitoes while DENV and CHIKV are thought to cause its downregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Viral replication is controlled by innate immune responses in both <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> and mosquitoes and several experiments suggested that the upregulation of immune pathways—immune-priming—may be important for <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated antiviral activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref024">24</xref>]. However, this appears to only be the case in mosquito populations that have been transinfected with <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref024">24</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila</italic> species that are naturally infected with <italic>Wolbachia</italic> do not show an immune-priming phenotype, yet still confer antiviral activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref025">25</xref>]. RNAi is considered the most important antiviral response in insects, with double stranded viral RNA (dsRNA) being processed into short RNAs by the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway and directing the destruction of viral RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref027">27</xref>]. However, several studies have shown that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> provides protection in mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic> and cells that lack components of this pathway, ruling out a role for the siRNA pathway in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref029">29</xref>]. There is however data that suggest the miRNA pathway may play a role in <italic>Wolbachia</italic> mediated protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref032">32</xref>]. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> has been shown to alter the expression of multiple miRNAs in mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref031">31</xref>]. The miRNA pathway is involved in many cellular processes, and miRNAs are produced from genome-encoded nuclear precursor RNAs that are processed into 22 nucleotide (nt) molecules that can induce target RNA degradation or inhibition of translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, the mechanism(s) by which <italic>Wolbachia</italic> confers antiviral activity are still unclear, and very little is known about exactly how the viral replication cycle is affected. Furthermore, it is not clear if <italic>Wolbachia</italic> itself responds to viral infection. In order to address these questions and to understand how <italic>Wolbachia</italic> interacts with viruses we have combined two powerful and well-studied model systems–the mosquito-borne alphavirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV; <italic>Togaviridae</italic>, genus <italic>Alphavirus</italic>) and a <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-containing <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref034">34</xref>]–and show that the endosymbiont provides strong protection against infection in this system. To identify the stage of the viral replication cycle that is likely being affected we compared SFV, SFV replicon and a SFV-based transreplicase system. We then used high-throughput sequencing to unravel the role of host small RNA pathways and the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transcriptional response in antiviral protection. We find that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> targets the virus rapidly after infection, and is likely blocking early events in the replication of viral RNA (for example translation of incoming RNA, the switch from translation to replication or RNA transcription) within cells, though we cannot rule out an effect on entry or exit. These effects are neither associated with a host small RNA response nor a transcriptional response by the endosymbiont, but mediated by intrinsic activities.</p>

<p>We developed a model arbovirus infection system based on SFV, for which excellent molecular tools including replicons and recombinant viruses are available and which we have used extensively to study arbovirus-arthropod interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref037">37</xref>], and the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>-derived Jw18 cell line infected with the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain wMel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref034">34</xref>].</p>

<p>To determine if <italic>Wolbachia</italic> could protect against SFV infection in Jw18 cells, we infected Jw18Wol and Jw18Free cells with SFV4(3H)-<italic>RLuc</italic> (infectivity &gt;90%) and measured <italic>RLuc</italic> activity at 7 and 24 hpi as a proxy for viral replication and spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref038">38</xref>]. Results indicated that even as early as 7 hpi inhibition of virus by <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is observed, with a 2–3 fold increase in <italic>RLuc</italic> activity in Jw18Free cells compared to Jw18Wol cells. By 24 hpi this difference is more marked with an 8–12 fold increase in <italic>RLuc</italic> activity in the Jw18Free cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> confers antiviral protection against an arbovirus in this system. Furthermore the mechanism by which <italic>Wolbachia</italic> inhibits viral infection must be rapid suggesting either entry of the virus is inhibited or replication/translation are inhibited.</p>

<title>Suppression of reporter gene expression mediated by activity of the viral subgenomic promoter suggests <italic>Wolbachia</italic> inhibits early replication events</title>
<p>As <italic>Wolbachia</italic> inhibits viral infection or subsequent processes as early as 7 hpi it could be hypothesised that entry of the virus into cells is inhibited, leading to a significant reduction in the number of subsequent replication complexes. In order to test this hypothesis we bypassed viral entry and analysed early translation and replication by transfection of <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed capped SFV1(3F)<italic>RLuc</italic>-SG-<italic>FFLuc</italic> replicon RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In this SFV-derived replicon RNA, an open reading frame (ORF1) encoding <italic>RLuc</italic> is fused to the non-structural nsP3 and the second, structural ORF(2) has been deleted and replaced with the <italic>FFLuc</italic> ORF (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and Methods</xref>). Alphavirus gene expression occurs in separate phases which are linked to replicative processes. Initially ORF1 is translated from the RNA genome giving rise to the nsP proteins, which carry out replicative functions. Then a switch from translation to replication occurs leading to production of a full length antisense copy of the genome, the antigenome. Antisense RNA (which most likely exists in a duplex with the original positive-strand genome) is used as a template for synthesis of new genomes; in addition it carries an internal promoter sequence that directs transcription of a subgenomic mRNA encoding the structural proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g001">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref039">39</xref>]. Thus, expression of structural proteins (or <italic>FFLuc</italic> marker, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) takes place only from these subgenomic RNAs i.e. is fully dependent on the replication process. In contrast, <italic>RLuc</italic> can be produced both by directly translating the replicon that was transfected into the cells as well as by translating new full-length positive strands, generated during RNA replication. Furthermore, in the absence of structural proteins no new virus particles can be formed preventing the spread of infection. It was found that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> results in a significant inhibition of early translation and/or replication independent of normal viral entry, with both <italic>RLuc</italic> and <italic>FFLuc</italic> readouts being significantly lower in Jw18Wol cells compared to Jw18Free cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). We cannot rule out that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> may also have an effect on entry which we do not observe in these assays.</p>

<p>As this SFV-derived replicon allows for the separate analysis of transcription and translation from both the genomic and subgenomic promoters and corresponding mRNAs, it allows us to further pinpoint the stage in the replication cycle that is affected by <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. In the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infected cells we observed a 200–600 fold decrease in <italic>FFLuc</italic> readout, a marker expressed from the RNA produced from subgenomic promoter, which is significantly greater (T-Test <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.0001) than the ~ 8 fold decrease in <italic>RLuc</italic> readout, a marker produced both from transfected RNAs and full-length positive-strand transcripts from the genomic promoter. This would suggest a clear and early inhibition of establishment of RNA replication. Alternatively, it could indicate a specific defect in the production of the subgenomic mRNA. This could occur either by <italic>Wolbachia</italic> directly interfering with replication, or by preventing the translation of proteins required for replication to occur and/or inhibiting the switch from replicase protein translation to RNA replication. Overall the results indicate that early viral RNA translation and/or replication were likely to be inhibited by <italic>Wolbachia</italic>.</p>
<p>To further investigate the effect of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> on viral translation and/or replication we uncoupled viral replicase proteins from viral RNA by the introduction of two plasmids into cells in a SFV transreplicase assay. In this system, one plasmid encodes the viral replicase proteins and the second encodes an RNA template containing the untranslated regions of SFV with either <italic>FFLuc</italic> downstream of the genomic/actin promoter or <italic>Gluc</italic> downstream of the subgenomic promoter. In both cases the expressed sequences are under the control of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> Actin promoter. Upon expression the replicase proteins will bind the RNA template and replication of the reporter construct will take place. Expression of <italic>FFLuc</italic> is under both the control of the Actin promoter and the genomic promoter, therefore due to the high expression from the Actin promoter it is difficult to determine active replication from the genomic reporter. However active replication can be measured from the production of the <italic>Gluc</italic> reporter which is solely under the control of the subgenomic promoter. This system therefore allowed us to determine if production of replicase proteins from mRNA transcribed in the nucleus could overcome <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated protection and determine if the origin of viral RNA is also important. In order to rule out arbitrary effects we also generated a non-replicating replicase with the introduction of a GDD-GAA mutation in the nsP4 protein, thus producing an inactive replicase. Results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>. Activity from the Actin and SFV genomic promoters appeared to be unaffected by the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, however it should be noted that there is no significant difference between the wildtype and mutant (GAA) replicase or cells where no replicase-expressing plasmid had been transfected. This confirms that the activity we saw here was most likely due to transcription from the Actin promoter and we are unlikely to detect expression from the genomic promoter as the system is at an optimum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). This has also been observed in mammalian systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref040">40</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, we observed that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> significantly lowered activity from the subgenomic promoter as <italic>Gluc</italic> activity is lower in Jw18Wol cells compared to Jw18Free. This is in keeping with our previous observation that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is able to inhibit viral translation and/or replication. Once viral RNA template is produced from the nucleus and transported to the cytoplasm, replication complexes are thought to form as normal. Thus <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was still able to confer protection even when viral replicase/RNA delivery routes were changed. Taken together this data strongly indicated that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> inhibits viral translation and/or replication.</p>

<title>Virus-derived siRNA profiles support an inhibitory effect of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> on viral replicative processes</title>
<p>A major immune pathway in insects to fight viral infections is the exogenous siRNA pathway which involves the production of virus-derived small interfering RNAs (viRNAs) by the enzyme Dicer-2 acting on virus-derived dsRNA (such as viral replication intermediates) as a substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref041">41</xref>]. The hallmark of this pathway in insects is the production of 21 nucleotide (nt) viRNAs, a process that has been described in detail for alphavirus infection of mosquitoes and mosquito cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref042">42</xref>]. To test whether the levels of viRNAs were affected by <italic>Wolbachia</italic> we used high-throughput sequencing of 18-33nt small RNAs from Jw18 cells 24hpi with SFV4(3H)-<italic>RLuc</italic>. In Jw18Free cells, small RNAs that were 21 nt long and map to the SFV genome were strongly induced upon viral infection (Wilcoxon unpaired test: <italic>P</italic> = 0.008, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005536.s001">S1A Fig</xref> for uninfected controls). 21 nt RNAs mapped equally in both sense and antisense orientations to the viral genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g004">Fig 4A</xref>; <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.1 Chi-squared test against a uniform distribution). The length and lack of strand bias or first nucleotide bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) suggest that these small RNAs are generated by the activity of Dicer-2 on virus-derived dsRNA, probably replication intermediates; moreover 21 nt viRNAs were distributed across the viral genome as previously reported for SFV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref043">43</xref>] and also other arboviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref027">27</xref>].

<p>If <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection were to reduce viral infection by upregulating antiviral RNAi we would expect increased viRNA production in the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. However, whilst 21 nt viRNAs were still present above the background seen in virus-free controls (<italic>P</italic> = 0.008, Wilcoxon unpaired test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005536.s001">S1B Fig</xref>), the amount of viRNAs was strongly reduced on both sense and antisense orientations relative to <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free cells (<italic>P</italic> = 0.008, Wilcoxon unpaired test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g004">Fig 4A versus 4B</xref>). Due to a significant reduction in viral replication, the distribution of 21 nt viRNAs from Jw18Wol cells revealed very few areas of viRNA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). RNAs smaller than 21 nt were similar between Jw18Wol and Jw18Free cells in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>), however it is likely that these smaller species of RNAs are background against the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> genome or degradation products.</p>
<p>This confirmed that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> does not protect against infection by enhancing the production of small RNAs against viruses. Instead, these results are consistent with a model whereby <italic>Wolbachia</italic> interferes with viral replication, leading to a decrease in the levels of viral replication intermediates and therefore a reduction in dsRNA, the substrate available for Dicer-2 and exogenous siRNA pathway induction. This is not surprising as previous studies have shown that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can still confer antiviral activity in flies mutant for key components of the siRNA pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref029">29</xref>].</p>

Of these 85.6% mapped to <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> and 12.4% mapped to <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. In the virus-infected cells, 3.8% of reads mapped to the SFV genome, and this dropped to 0.03% for cells that were not challenged with the virus. No <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genes were differentially expressed in response to viral infection at either time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g007">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>). There are three reasons to believe that this is a true lack of a transcriptional response and not simply a lack of statistical power. First, across many transcripts we were able to detect a transcriptional response of the cells to SFV in the same experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g007">Fig 7D and 7E</xref>), and the coverage of many of these differentially expressed transcripts was lower than for many <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g007">Fig 7B–7E</xref>). Second, we had a very large dataset. In each of the 4 treatments about two thirds of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> transcripts had over 100 reads mapped to them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), which is expected to give good power to detect differential expression. Compared to most published RNAseq experiments ours was a highly replicated experiment involving 40 libraries (biological replicates) across 4 lanes of Illumina HiSeq. Third, if genes with very low-expression are ignored, our estimates of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> gene expression levels in cells with and without SFV were nearly identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005536.g007">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>, log<sub>2</sub>FC≈0). Therefore, the lack of differential expression cannot be attributed to a lack of statistical power.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The bacterial symbiont <italic>Wolbachia</italic> offers an exciting opportunity in the fight against arbovirus transmission by mosquitoes. Several studies have found that it has antiviral activity in key arbovirus mosquito vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref045">45</xref>]. However, the exact mechanisms behind this activity are poorly understood. In order for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to be used as a long term and sustainable system to control arbovirus spread, it is critical that we understand these mechanisms. By combining two powerful model systems–the model arbovirus SFV, and a <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> cell line–we were able to show that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> may protect against virus at a very early stage of infection and appeared to block replication and/or translation of viral RNA. This did not involve an active transcriptional response from either the host, the small RNA pathways or <italic>Wolbachia</italic> itself.</p>
<p>Little is known about how <italic>Wolbachia</italic> affects viral replication and dynamics, with studies measuring changes in either the survival of infected insects or viral copy number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref019">19</xref>]. To investigate the phenomenon in more depth we used the alphavirus SFV, for which virus-encoded reporter genes are known to correspond well to viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref038">38</xref>]. We found that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is able to inhibit viral replication as early as 7 hpi. To our knowledge this is the first indication that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> inhibits viral replication at such an early stage (for example by inhibition of initial translation of incoming RNA or other early replicative processes), as previous studies have focused mainly on days post-infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref046">46</xref>]. This suggests that the mechanism by which <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is conferring antiviral activity is either fast acting or is already present upon viral infection i.e. intrinsic. This is important as for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to be used successfully as a control mechanism for arbovirus transmission, control of viral replicative processes at an early stage could be vital, as it would not allow the virus to replicate to high levels allowing for dissemination.</p>
<p>The SFV life cycle can be divided into entry, initial translation of incoming viral genomes, switch from translation to replication, RNA replication, translation of structural proteins from subgenomic RNA, assembly and exit from cells. Understanding where in this lifecycle <italic>Wolbachia</italic> acts is vital to understanding the mechanisms behind its antiviral activity. This can often prove difficult to investigate as little is understood about SFV (and arbovirus) replication in insect cells compared to vertebrate cells. By utilising SFV reporter viruses and replicon constructs we can begin to deconstruct the replication cycle. The very early stage at which SFV was inhibited and the fact that bypassing viral entry still resulted in viral inhibition by <italic>Wolbachia</italic> suggests that <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is likely blocking an early post-entry stage in the replication cycle. We can further dissect how <italic>Wolbachia</italic> affects the replication cycle due to the presence of a sub-genomic promoter in alphaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref047">47</xref>]. Expression from the first ORF of SFV does not require viral replication (though due to an increase of genomic RNA copy number, it is dramatically increased when replication occurs), as positive-sense RNA virus genomes can act as mRNA immediately after infection. In contrast translation and protein expression from the second ORF of SFV requires a full round of replication in order for the sub-genomic promoter to become available. Therefore by utilising the replicon SFV expressing <italic>RLuc</italic> reporter directly from genomic RNA and <italic>FFLuc</italic> via activity of the subgenomic promoter we could test whether <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is affecting the replication of viral RNA. Our results showed that viral replication and/or translation of replicon were inhibited by <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. This could occur either by <italic>Wolbachia</italic> directly interfering with replication, or by inhibiting the translation of viral proteins required for this to occur and/or inhibiting the switch from translation to replication. Further to this we showed by using a SFV transreplicase system and uncoupling the replicase proteins from template RNA that there was significant inhibition of the subgenomic promoter and thus viral translation and/or replication. Thus providing replicase proteins either directly or separately did not overcome the inhibition phenotype. These results indicate that the origin of viral RNA (transcription in the nucleus in the transreplicase system) was also not important to <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated antiviral activity.</p>
<p>This block in translation/replication in the presence of the endosymbiont was backed by analysis of the induction of small RNA responses, which reveal that <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected cells did not show higher production of viRNAs which are derived from the dsRNA generated during viral replication (see below).</p>
<p>One possible way in which <italic>Wolbachia</italic> could protect against viruses would be by the bacterium mounting an active antiviral response following infection. If this were the case, it would likely be reflected in a transcriptional response of the endosymbiont to the virus. However, in a very large dataset we did not find a single <italic>Wolbachia</italic> gene that was differentially regulated in response to viral infection. This is consistent with the very early inhibition of viral replication, which suggests that the antiviral mechanism is constitutively present before the virus infects the cell and is thus intrinsic.</p>
<p>Previous studies have indicated that a host miRNA response may be responsible for <italic>Wolbachia’</italic>s antiviral activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref048">48</xref>], but we found no support for this hypothesis in our system. In virus-free mosquitoes <italic>Wolbachia</italic> changes the expression of a number of miRNAs, but we found no such differences in our cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005536.s003">S3E Fig</xref>). Previous studies did not analyze concurrent infections of both <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref048">48</xref>]. When we did this we found a marked miRNA response to the virus, but this was unaltered by the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. It is surprising that we still see host miRNA response to viral infection in the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, as the level of SFV infection is extremely low. This suggests that miRNA response may be due to early events in viral replication such as virion binding and/or entry or that this response requires very little viral protein synthesis/RNA replication to be initiated. Previous studies have indicated that the viRNA pathway is not required for <italic>Wolbachia</italic>’s antiviral activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref029">29</xref>]. Our data supports this, with a strong reduction in 21 nt viRNAs mapping to the SFV genome and antigenome when <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is present. This suggests that viral replication is inhibited so significantly that very few viRNAs are produced, rather than <italic>Wolbachia</italic> inducing an antiviral RNAi response. Further studies utilising this system would be beneficial to the field. For example little is known about the possibility of viruses mutating to overcome <italic>Wolbachia</italic> mediated protection as long term studies are lacking. A cell-based assay offers an ideal opportunity to look at virus evolution over the long term in such associations. In addition to this it would be interesting to look at the effect on other viruses in our system as other studies have indicated that even within the same family <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can have different effects on viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref049">49</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> studies <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is also known to protect against FHV without lowering viral titres. It would be interesting to look at this in the context of our findings, as it may suggest another mechanism by which <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can confer antiviral activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion we have developed a powerful new system to study the replication dynamics of SFV in <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> cells. While the exact mechanism of the antiviral response remains unknown, current data is consistent with a ‘passive’ mechanism such as competition for resources or space, or by <italic>Wolbachia</italic> remodelling the intracellular environment. While effects of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> on entry or exit cannot be excluded, our data point to an effect on translation and/or replication at least for this model alphavirus. Considering the broad antiviral effects of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> across <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mosquito species, it is tempting to propose a model of inhibition that relies on similar intrinsic mechanisms rather than diverse processes such as miRNA regulation or immune responses. The data presented in this study point towards such an antiviral mode of action by <italic>Wolbachia</italic> endosymbionts.</p>

<title>SFV transreplicase system: construction of replicase and template expression constructs</title>
<p>pAc51-V5-His backbone was used to construct the plasmid expressing the replicase of SFV. First, the multiple coning site of the plasmid was replaced by a polylinker sequence <underline>TTCGAA</underline>TATGGATCCTAT<underline>TTAATTAA</underline>TATCCTAGG (recognition sites of Bsp119I and PacI are underlined). Second, Bsp119I and PacI adapters were added to the 5’ and 3’ ends of the sequence encoding SFV replicase, respectively, by using PCR and subcloning procedures. Finally, the sequence encoding SFV replicase was inserted into modified pAc51 vector using Bsp119I and PacI restriction sites. The resulting plasmid was designated as pAct51-SFVRepl. In order to obtain plasmid encoding for a polymerase defective form of SFV replicase, the conserved GDD motif in nsP4 was altered to GAA using PCR-based mutagenesis and subcloning procedures; the resulting plasmid was designated pAc51-SFVRepl-GAA.</p>
<p>In order to obtain a plasmid for expression of template RNA for the SFV replicase the polylinker and terminator regions of pAc51-V5-His were replaced with a synthetic DNA fragment consisting from the first 280 nucleotides of SFV genome (including EcoRV restriction site, nucleotides 275–280) followed by the sequence TAT<underline>GGATCC</underline>TATG<underline>GCGCGC</underline>C<underline>GTCGAC</underline> (recognition sites BamHI, BssH2 and SalI underlined). The replacement was performed in such a way that the 5’ end of the SFV genome was positioned exactly downstream of last start site of actin promoter. The following sequences were added using synthetic DNA fragments (GenScript, USA) and subcloning procedures: a) sequence encoding for firefly luciferase (<italic>FFLuc</italic>), placed in frame with N-terminal fragment of SFV nsP1 (amino acid residues 1–65, encoded by the 5’ region of SFV genome); b) SFV subgenomic promoter spanning from position -145 to +51 with respect of the start site of SFV subgenomic RNA; c) sequence encoding for <italic>Gaussia</italic> luciferase (<italic>Gluc</italic>); d) 3’ UTR of SFV followed by 69 adenine residues; e) negative strand ribozyme of hepatitis delta virus; e) late termination region of simian virus 40.

<title>Detection of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection by DAPI staining.</title>
<p>Cells were tetracycline treated or not and stained with DAPI in order to visualize <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection; tetracycline-treated cells are referred to as Jw18Free. (A) Cells were checked for the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> by PCR using two separate primer pairs as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref006">6</xref>]. (B) Cells were then stained with DAPI in order to visualise <italic>Wolbachia</italic> content, density was consistent with previous observations with ~90% of cells infected. (C) Jw18Free cells were infected with an MOI of 20 calculated in BHK cells and stained with SFV NSP2 antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005536.ref050">50</xref>] in order to determine infection rate. Cells positive for SFV were shown to have an infection rate &gt;90%.</p>
