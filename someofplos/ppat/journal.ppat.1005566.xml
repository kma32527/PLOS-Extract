<abstract>
<p>Efficient carbon assimilation is critical for microbial growth and pathogenesis. The environmental yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is “Crabtree positive”, displaying a rapid metabolic switch from the assimilation of alternative carbon sources to sugars. Following exposure to sugars, this switch is mediated by the transcriptional repression of genes (carbon catabolite repression) and the turnover (catabolite inactivation) of enzymes involved in the assimilation of alternative carbon sources. The pathogenic yeast <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is Crabtree negative. It has retained carbon catabolite repression mechanisms, but has undergone posttranscriptional rewiring such that gluconeogenic and glyoxylate cycle enzymes are not subject to ubiquitin-mediated catabolite inactivation. Consequently, when glucose becomes available, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> can continue to assimilate alternative carbon sources alongside the glucose. We show that this metabolic flexibility promotes host colonization and virulence. The glyoxylate cycle enzyme isocitrate lyase (CaIcl1) was rendered sensitive to ubiquitin-mediated catabolite inactivation in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> by addition of a ubiquitination site. This mutation, which inhibits lactate assimilation in the presence of glucose, reduces the ability of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> cells to withstand macrophage killing, colonize the gastrointestinal tract and cause systemic infections in mice. Interestingly, most <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> clinical isolates we examined (67%) have acquired the ability to assimilate lactate in the presence of glucose (i.e. they have become Crabtree negative). These <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> strains are more resistant to macrophage killing than Crabtree positive clinical isolates. Moreover, Crabtree negative <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> mutants that lack Gid8, a key component of the Glucose-Induced Degradation complex, are more resistant to macrophage killing and display increased virulence in immunocompromised mice. Thus, while Crabtree positivity might impart a fitness advantage for yeasts in environmental niches, the more flexible carbon assimilation strategies offered by Crabtree negativity enhance the ability of yeasts to colonize and infect the mammalian host.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Most yeast species occupy environmental niches, but some infect humans. All species must assimilate carbon to grow and colonize their niche, but carbon source availability differs significantly between niches. The environmental yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is thought to have evolved under conditions of sugar feast and famine because it has evolved mechanisms to exploit energetically favourable sugars first, and then switch to using alternative carbon sources. These mechanisms depend on catabolite inactivation—the degradation of enzymes involved in the assimilation of alternative carbon sources when glucose is present. In the pathogenic yeast <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, which has evolved in sugar-poor host niches, these enzymes are not subject to catabolite inactivation. Consequently, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> can simultaneously exploit sugars and alternative carbon sources. We demonstrate that this metabolic flexibility promotes resistance to macrophage killing, gut colonization, and the ability to cause systemic infection. We also show that many <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> clinical isolates have lost catabolite inactivation, and hence can simultaneously assimilate sugars and alternative carbon sources. The disruption of catabolite inactivation in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> renders it more resistant to phagocytic killing, and more virulent. We conclude that virulence is enhanced by metabolic flexibility.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Microbes must acquire nutrients efficiently if they are to compete effectively in complex microenvironments. A common microbial strategy is to focus resources on the utilization of energetically favourable carbon sources when they are available, and then, once they become exhausted, switch to alternative, less favourable carbon sources. For example, organisms such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> assimilate sugars such as glucose before switching to less favourable carbon sources such as alcohols and organic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref002">2</xref>]. This behaviour reflects the niches these microbes occupy. In these environments, microbes often compete for survival during cycles of “feast and famine”, where periods of growth on less favourable carbon sources or starvation are punctuated by episodes of sugar availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref002">2</xref>]. These organisms have evolved elegant regulatory mechanisms, such as the <italic>lac</italic> operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref003">3</xref>] and <italic>GAL</italic> regulon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref004">4</xref>], that mediate the efficient, sequential assimilation of sugars and alternative carbon sources. In contrast, microbes that have evolved in niches that contain limiting sugar concentrations display alternative modes of carbon assimilation. For example, the fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is able to assimilate sugars and alternative carbon sources simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref005">5</xref>]. We show here that this type of metabolic flexibility enhances the ability of yeasts to colonise and infect the mammalian host.</p>
<p><italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> is an environmental yeast that is thought to have evolved under conditions of sugar “feast and famine” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref002">2</xref>]. It is defined as a “Crabtree positive” yeast on the basis that glucose represses respiratory metabolism even under aerobic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref007">7</xref>]. Consequently, when <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> encounters mixtures of carbon sources, this yeast first assimilates glucose, converting it to ethanol via fermentative metabolism. Then, once glucose is exhausted, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> derepresses metabolic pathways required for the assimilation of alternative carbon sources through a combination of transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms. Glucose triggers the transcriptional repression of gluconeogenic and glyoxylate cycle genes (carbon catabolite repression), and accelerates the degradation of gluconeogenic mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref009">9</xref>]. Glucose also triggers the inactivation and degradation of gluconeogenic and glyoxylate cycle enzymes (catabolite inactivation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g001">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref011">11</xref>]. This glucose-accelerated protein degradation is driven in part by the ubiquitination of target metabolic enzymes by the Glucose-Induced Degradation (GID) complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g001">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref012">12</xref>]. The GID complex is an E3 ubiquitin ligase composed of seven proteins (Gid1/Vid30, Gid2/Rmd5, Gid4/Vid24, Gid5/Vid28, Gid7, Gid8, and Gid9/Fyv10), with Gid8 being essential for the activity of this complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref014">14</xref>]. Following exposure to glucose, the GID complex recruits the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc8 to target enzymes, leading to their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref015">15</xref>]. Targets for glucose-accelerated ubiquitinmediated protein degradation in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> include the gluconeogenic enzymes Fbp1 and Pck1, and the glyoxylate cycle enzyme Icl1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref017">17</xref>]. Together, these mechanisms rapidly shut down the assimilation of alternative carbon sources following glucose addition.</p>

<title>The lack of catabolite inactivation in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> permits simultaneous assimilation of alternative carbon sources and glucose.</title>
<p>In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, glucose triggers the rapid ubiquitination and degradation via the GID complex of enzymes involved in the assimilation of alternative carbon sources (catabolite inactivation).

<p>The <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> paradigm has been extended to other yeasts. However, this <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>-centric perspective is challenged by the metabolic plasticity of other yeast species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref020">20</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> is defined as a “Crabtree negative” yeast because it retains respiratory metabolism following glucose addition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref013">13</xref>]. However, at the transcriptional level, this pathogenic yeast is as sensitive to glucose as its distant relative, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref022">22</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> responds to very low sugar concentrations, displaying significant downregulation of gluconeogenic and glyoxylate cycle genes following exposure to 0.01% glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref022">22</xref>]. Yet <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> cells continue to assimilate alternative carbon sources following glucose addition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref018">18</xref>]. This is because gluconeogenic and glyoxylate cycle enzymes are retained following glucose addition, and are not subject to catabolite inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g001">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref018">18</xref>]. Key enzymes, such as isocitrate lyase (CaIcl1), lack the ubiquitination sites that target their <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> orthologues for glucose-accelerated ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. As a result, when sugars become available, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> can continue to assimilate alternative carbon sources simultaneously with these sugars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref018">18</xref>]. Therefore, catabolite inactivation plays a key role in the management of carbon utilization.</p>
<p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> is capable of colonizing a diverse range of complex niches in its mammalian host. This yeast colonizes the oral cavity, the gastrointestinal tract and genitalia in many individuals, is a frequent cause of mucosal infection (oral thrush and vaginitis), and in severely immunocompromised patients can cause life-threatening systemic infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref024">24</xref>]. In these niches <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> is exposed to complex mixtures of carbon sources that include amino acids, fatty acids, and carboxylic acids, such as lactate. Some niches contain relatively low levels of glucose, at least compared to the 2% glucose often used to cultivate <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans in vitro</italic>. The bloodstream contains 4 to 7 mM (0.07–0.13%) glucose, whereas vaginal secretions are reported to contain around 28 mM (0.5%) glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref026">26</xref>]. In contrast, glucose concentrations in the colon are thought to be vanishingly low. Indeed, the ability to assimilate lactate is essential for gastrointestinal colonisation by <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref027">27</xref>]. Additional studies indicate that the ability to assimilate alternative carbon sources is important for systemic infection by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref029">29</xref>]. For example, <italic>PCK1</italic> (gluconeogenesis) and <italic>ICL1</italic> (glyoxylate cycle) gene expression is up-regulated in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> following internalization by macrophages or neutrophils, during gastrointestinal colonization and during renal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref031">31</xref>]. Also, inactivation of <italic>PCK1</italic> and <italic>ICL1</italic> attenuates <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> virulence in mouse models of systemic candidiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref025">25</xref>]. These studies attest to the importance of alternative carbon assimilation for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> colonisation and virulence. Collectively, they raise the question as to whether the metabolic flexibility of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> (i.e. in the context of this study, its ability to assimilate glucose and alternative carbon sources simultaneously) contributes to the virulence of this pathogenic yeast.</p>
<p>We address this question here. Our approach has been to impose catabolite inactivation in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> by genetically re-programming the key glyoxylate cycle enzyme, CaIcl1, for glucose-accelerated ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. The resultant <italic>CaICL1-Ubi</italic> mutant is less able to colonize the gastrointestinal tract and to cause systemic infections in mice than wild type controls. We then extended our studies to clinical isolates of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. Most of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> clinical isolates we examined have acquired the ability to utilise lactate and glucose simultaneously. Furthermore, when we inactivated glucose-accelerated ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation in a Crabtree positive <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> clinical isolate, by deleting <italic>GID8</italic>, the <italic>gid8</italic> cells were better able to colonise mice than their isogenic <italic>GID8</italic> controls. Taken together, our data indicate that the flexibility to simultaneously assimilate sugars and alternative carbon sources contributes to the pathogenicity of yeasts.</p>

<title>Metabolic ubiquitination targets have been rewired across yeast species</title>
<p>Recently we reported that some <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> enzymes involved in the assimilation of alternative carbon sources are retained at relatively high levels after cells are exposed to glucose and that, unlike <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> can continue to utilize lactate or oleate in the presence of glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref018">18</xref>]. We also demonstrated that CaIcl1 is retained following glucose addition because it lacks the ubiquitination sites present in its <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> orthologue, ScIcl1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref018">18</xref>]. This suggested that ubiquitination sites in key metabolic enzymes may have been rewired in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> relative to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. Therefore, our first step was to examine this in more detail. Our <italic>in silico</italic> analyses of ubiquitination sites in key metabolic enzymes were performed using Ubpred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref032">32</xref>]. This software correctly predicted the existence or lack of ubiquitination sites in ScIcl1 and CaIcl1, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref018">18</xref>]. We examined gluconeogenic, glycolytic, glyoxylate cycle and fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes across a selection of species from the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> and <italic>Candida</italic> complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g002">Fig 2</xref>).

<p>Key central metabolic enzymes displayed clear patterns consistent with the evolutionary rewiring of ubiquitination sites across yeast species (Icl1, Eno1, and Fox2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In particular, high confidence ubiquitination sites were observed in Icl1 for all species examined in the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> complex, but not for those in the <italic>Candida</italic> complex. Ubiquitination sites were also observed in Pck1 for three Crabtree positive species, but only in one Crabtree negative species examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Therefore, the existence of ubiquitination sites in Icl1 and Pck1 correlated closely with Crabtree classification. This correlation was not observed for Mls1, the second enzyme specific to the glyoxylate cycle. Mls1 ubiquitination sites were not detected in any of the species examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005566.s006">S1 Table</xref> in the supplementary information), suggesting that the catabolite inactivation of one essential enzyme in a metabolic pathway might be sufficient to decrease flux through that pathway following glucose exposure. It should be noted, however, that Ubpred is unable to predict functional ubiquitination sites with complete accuracy as no sites were predicted for ScFbp1, an enzyme that is known to undergo ubiquitin-mediated catabolite inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref033">33</xref>]. Ubpred utilizes an experimentally validated training set, but some ubiquitination sites may only be revealed following posttranslational modification of target proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref032">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, additional trends linking evolutionary clade and ubiquitination sites were observed for glycolytic and fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Like the glyoxylate cycle, glycolysis is essential for virulence, and fatty acid β-oxidation may contribute to systemic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref034">34</xref>]. Ubiquitination sites were detected in Eno1 for all of the Crabtree negative species, but not for any of the Crabtree positive species, and the relationship for Fox2 was almost as strong. Therefore, despite the limitations of <italic>in silico</italic> prediction, these observations strongly support the view that rewiring of ubiquitination targets in central metabolism has occurred during the evolution of yeast species, and that this rewiring contributes to the management of carbon assimilation strategies in these species.</p>
<p>We have shown previously that, in response to glucose, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> rapidly degrades a modified version of CaIcl1 bearing a C-terminal ubiquitination motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref018">18</xref>]. Therefore, while <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> and other <italic>Candida</italic> species have rewired metabolic ubiquitination targets, such as Icl1, these yeasts still retain the apparatus that mediates glucose-accelerated degradation.</p>

<title>Metabolic flexibility increases <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> resistance to phagocytic killing</title>
<p>Previously we suggested that this evolutionary rewiring of central metabolic ubiquitination targets might contribute to the ability of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> to colonize and cause infection in the mammalian host. Therefore, we tested this using a <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> mutant in which an artificial ubiquitination site was added to the carboxy terminus of CaIcl1 (CaIcl1-Ubi) to render it sensitive to glucose-induced degradation. However, the CaIcl1-Ubi strains we constructed previously had the <italic>URA3</italic> marker integrated at the <italic>ICL1</italic> locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref018">18</xref>], and the chromosomal locus at which <italic>URA3</italic> is integrated is known to influence <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> virulence-related phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref035">35</xref>]. Therefore, to carefully examine the virulence-related phenotypes of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> cells expressing CaIcl1-Ubi, we first reconstructed the mutation in the wild type clinical isolate <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> SC5314 using a <italic>NAT1</italic> marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref036">36</xref>]. We generated isogenic strains in which the wild type CaIcl1 or CaIcl1-Ubi proteins are epitope-tagged with Myc<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005566.s007">S2 Table</xref> in the supplementary information). As controls, we also constructed isogenic wild type (<italic>ICL1</italic>) and homozygous null strains (<italic>icl1Δ/Δ</italic>) in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> SC5314 genetic background. We then reconfirmed that the addition of the ubiquitination site caused the CaIcl1-Ubi protein to be destabilized in response to glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), thereby recapitulating our earlier observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref018">18</xref>]. Next, we showed that glucose-accelerated ubiquitin-mediated degradation of CaIcl1 reduces the ability of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> cells to assimilate an alternative carbon source in the presence of glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans ICL1-Ubi</italic> cells grew less well than the isogenic wild type control on lactate media containing the non-metabolizable glucose analogue, 2-deoxyglucose.

<p>It was conceivable that the manipulation of <italic>ICL1</italic> affected the ultrastructure of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> cell wall in some indirect way, and hence phagocytic recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref038">38</xref>].

<p>We also tested whether the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> mutants are capable of dissemination to the kidney. For all of the strains, some degree of dissemination from the gastrointestinal tract to the kidney was observed in a subset of colonized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). However, this dissemination was significantly decreased for the <italic>ICL1-Ubi</italic> strain and for the <italic>icl1Δ/Δ</italic> null mutant. The number of animals in which dissemination was observed was lower for these strains than their isogenic controls. Furthermore, the fungal burden in the kidneys of these animals was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).

<p>We then examined the virulence of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans ICL1-Ubi</italic> and <italic>icl1Δ/Δ</italic> cells in a mouse model of disseminated candidiasis.

These strains also showed corresponding decreases in virulence according to their Outcome Score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), which considers mouse weight change as well as renal fungal burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref039">39</xref>].

<title><italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> clinical isolates can acquire metabolic flexibility</title>
<p>We asked whether this general principle might be applicable to other yeasts. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> is not classically considered a pathogen, but infections can occur in severely immunocompromised patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref040">40</xref>]. While laboratory strains of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> display catabolite inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref017">17</xref>] and are unable to assimilate alternative carbon sources simultaneously with glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref018">18</xref>], we wondered whether <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> strains associated with infection have acquired a greater degree of metabolic flexibility. Therefore, we examined <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> clinical isolates from a range of infection sites including blood, oral cavity, vagina and faeces.</p>
<p>First, we confirmed the identity of putative <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> clinical isolates via their proteomic fingerprints by MALDI-biotyping. Twenty-one of the isolates examined were confirmed to be <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. Seven proved to be <italic>C</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic>, <italic>Candida krusei</italic> or <italic>Candida lusitaniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005566.s008">S3 Table</xref> in the supplementary information). The 2-deoxyglucose resistance of the <italic>bona fide S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> clinical isolates was then tested. The glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose is non-metabolizable, but it activates carbon catabolite repression, thereby preventing the growth of Crabtree positive yeasts on alternative carbon sources. Strikingly, more than half of the isolates tested were 2-deoxyglucose resistant (62%: 13 of 21 strains), and hence had acquired the ability to assimilate lactate in the presence of glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g007">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005566.s008">S3 Table</xref> in the supplementary information). As a control we also assayed their allyl alcohol sensitivity. All isolates were sensitive, confirming that they all expressed alcohol dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005566.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). The 2-deoxyglucose resistant phenotype did not correlate with the site of isolation (bloodstream, oral, vaginal). Nevertheless, the observation that many clinical isolates have acquired 2-deoxyglucose resistance is consistent with the idea that metabolic flexibility promotes host colonisation and hence virulence.</p>

<title>Remodelling <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> into a Crabtree negative-like yeast</title>
<p>To further test whether metabolic flexibility promotes <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> virulence we generated mutants in which ubiquitin-mediated catabolite mechanisms were inactivated. Glucose-accelerated protein degradation in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> is mediated by the vacuolar degradation pathway, which operates in conjunction with the GID complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref014">14</xref>]. Thus, we identified the GID complex components that are essential for catabolite inactivation by plating <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> mutants on lactate medium containing 2-deoxyglucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Wild-type S288c cells were unable to grow on lactate in the presence of 2-deoxyglucose. Similarly, <italic>ubc8</italic> cells, which lack Ubc8 (an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that down-regulates gluconeogenic enzymes), did not grow on lactate plates containing 2-deoxyglucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). This might be due to functional redundancies with other ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes such as Ubc1, Ubc4 and Ubc5. However, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> mutants with defects in key components of the GID complex (Gid8, Rmd5, Vid30) were able to assimilate lactate in the presence of 2deoxyglucose. This is consistent with the idea that these GID complex mutants are defective in catabolite inactivation.</p>

<p>To test this further, we examined the stability of ScIcl1 in wild-type and <italic>gid8Δ</italic> cells. To monitor ScIcl1 levels, we epitope tagged this enzyme with Myc<sub>9</sub> at its carboxy terminus. As expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref018">18</xref>], the ScIcl1-Myc<sub>9</sub> protein was detected in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> cells grown on lactate, and was degraded in wild-type <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> cells after exposure to glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). However, the ScIcl1-Myc<sub>9</sub> protein was stable in <italic>gid8Δ</italic> cells following glucose addition. The <italic>gid8Δ</italic> cells remained sensitive to allyl alcohol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005566.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), suggesting that other enzymes involved in alternative carbon metabolism, and alcohol dehydrogenase in particular, retained their activity following <italic>GID8</italic> inactivation. These data reinforce the conclusion that an active GID complex is required for catabolite inactivation. Essentially, Gid8 inactivation converts <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> into a Crabtree negative-like organism that is able to assimilate lactate and glucose simultaneously, much like <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>.</p>

<title>Flexible carbon utilization protects against macrophage killing and promotes virulence</title>
<p>Rendering CaIcl1 susceptible to catabolite inactivation makes <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> cells more sensitive to phagocytic killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Therefore, we predicted that inhibiting catabolite inactivation in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> would render this yeast more resistant to macrophage killing. We further predicted that this effect might be observed for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> cells pre-grown on lactate, but not in cells grown on glucose, effectively priming the cells for metabolic flexibility. This is because gluconeogenic and glyoxylate cycle enzymes are induced in lactate-grown cells, irrespective of their Crabtree status. However, following exposure to the 0.45% glucose in macrophage medium (DMEM), Crabtree positive cells were expected to rapidly degrade gluconeogenic and glyoxylate cycle enzymes via catabolite inactivation, whereas Crabtree negative cells were expected to retain these enzymes. Therefore, to test the impact of catabolite inactivation on macrophage killing, we grew Crabtree positive wild-type cells and Crabtree negative-like <italic>gid8Δ</italic> cells on lactate, and then exposed them to the J774.1 macrophages in DMEM. The same <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> isolates were grown on glucose as a control, because gluconeogenic and glyoxylate cycle gene expression is strongly repressed in glucose-grown cells irrespective of their Crabtree status. Therefore no difference between Crabtree positive and negative cells with respect to gluconeogenic and glyoxylate cycle gene expression was expected under glucose conditions, and none was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). In contrast, lactate-grown Crabtree negative-like <italic>gid8Δ</italic> cells were over three-fold more resistant to macrophage killing than lactate-grown wild-type control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). We conclude that the increased metabolic flexibility, afforded by the loss of Gid8 and catabolite inactivation, promotes resistance to macrophage killing in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>.</p>

<p>If increased metabolic flexibility enhances resistance to macrophage killing, one might predict that Crabtree negative-like <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> isolates should display relatively high levels of resistance to macrophage killing. To test this, we compared the resistance of three 2deoxyglucose resistant (Crabtree negative-like) and three 2-deoxyglucose sensitive (Crabtree positive) <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> clinical isolates to macrophage killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g009">Fig 9B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005566.s008">S3 Table</xref> in the supplementary information). Control cells that were pre-grown on glucose displayed no major differences in macrophage resistance. Also, the 2-deoxyglucose resistant and sensitive strains were not significantly different when pre-grown on glucose. When pre-grown on lactate, the macrophage resistance of the 2-deoxyglucose sensitive isolates did not increase compared to pre-growth on glucose. This was consistent with the idea that in these Crabtree positive strains, gluconeogenic and glyoxylate cycle enzymes are rapidly degraded following glucose exposure (i.e. transfer to DMEM). Indeed, the isocitrate lyase activity decreased rapidly in most of the Crabtree positive strains examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). In contrast, growth on lactate increased the macrophage resistance of all three of the 2-deoxyglucose resistant strains. For strain J960965 the <italic>circa</italic> four-fold increase was not statistically significant, but for strains J941047 and J940610, the lactate-induced increases were highly significant relative to control cells pre-grown on glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g009">Fig 9B</xref>).</p>
<p>It was conceivable that the resistance of the Crabtree negative <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> isolates to macrophage killing was due to reduced phagocytic uptake rather than increased survival following phagocytosis. Therefore, we compared the uptake of the Crabtree positive and negative <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> clinical isolates by the J774.1 macrophages. No significant differences were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g009">Fig 9D</xref>). Therefore, increased metabolic flexibility appears to enhance resistance to macrophage killing.</p>
<p>We reasoned that elevated macrophage resistance might be reflected in increased virulence, and therefore we tested the impact of <italic>GID8</italic> inactivation upon virulence. First, the <italic>GID8</italic> gene was deleted in the Crabtree positive <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> clinical isolate NCPF8313 to generate a <italic>gid8</italic> null mutant, and then the <italic>GID8</italic> gene was reintroduced to generate the <italic>gid8+GID8</italic> control strain. The loss of <italic>GID8</italic> in this clinical isolate permitted lactate assimilation in the presence of glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g010">Fig 10A</xref>), essentially converting this strain into a Crabtree negative-like yeast. The same phenotype was observed when <italic>GID8</italic> was deleted in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> S288c (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005566.s005">S5 Fig</xref> in the supplementary information). <italic>GID8</italic> reintegration then restored Crabtree positivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g010">Fig 10A</xref>), confirming that Gid8 is essential for catabolite inactivation in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> clinical isolates.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Yeast pathogenicity is a polygenic trait. A range of virulence factors contribute to pathogenicity, including yeast-hypha morphogenesis, adhesins and invasins, and secreted hydrolases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref042">42</xref>]. Pathogenicity is also enhanced by fitness attributes such as robust stress responses and efficient metabolic adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref045">45</xref>]. Clearly the ability to assimilate the variety of carbon sources available in host niches is advantageous to pathogenic yeasts. For example, the loss of glycolysis or glucose sensing attenuates the dissemination and pathogenicity of the basidiomycete yeast <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref046">46</xref>]. Also, mutations that block glycolysis, gluconeogenesis or the glyoxylate cycle attenuate the virulence of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, an ascomycete yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref029">29</xref>]. We now show that the coordinated regulation of these pathways is important for virulence in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>. Our data suggest that evolutionary pressures in host niches have selected for yeasts with enhanced metabolic flexibility that permits the simultaneous exploitation of sugars and alternative carbon sources. This view is supported by several key observations.</p>
<p>Firstly, there appears to have been evolutionary rewiring of central metabolic ubiquitination targets in the ascomycete yeasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Yeasts in the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> clade tend to contain ubiquitination sites in glyoxylate cycle (Icl1) and gluconeogenic enzymes (Pck1), whereas species in the <italic>Candida</italic> clade generally carry ubiquitination sites in glycolytic (Eno1) and fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes (Fox2). The introduction of such a site in CaIcl1 is sufficient to promote glucose-accelerated ubiquitin-mediated degradation of this enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Not all enzymes on these pathways are predicted to carry an ubiquitination site. However, the loss of one essential enzyme on a metabolic pathway is sufficient to inhibit flux through that pathway.</p>
<p>Secondly, although <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> is classified as a Crabtree positive yeast, many clinical isolates have acquired the flexibility to simultaneously assimilate alternative carbon sources alongside glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g007">Fig 7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005566.s004">S4 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005566.s008">S3 Table</xref> in the supplementary data). However, not all clinical isolates have become Crabtree negative. Also, the pathogen <italic>C</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic>, which is a member of the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> clade, is Crabtree positive. However, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> are less potent pathogens than <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref047">47</xref>]. Taken together, these observations are consistent with the view that metabolic flexibility is one of a number of factors that contribute to the pathogenicity of yeast species.</p>
<p>Thirdly, this view is reinforced by the observation that reducing the metabolic flexibility of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> attenuates its ability to colonize and cause infection. The addition of a ubiquitination site to CaIcl1 triggered its degradation in response to glucose, thereby reducing the ability of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> cells to assimilate lactate and glucose simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g003">Fig 3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref018">18</xref>]. This mutation essentially shifted <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> towards a Crabtree positive-like state. It rendered <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> more sensitive to macrophage killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g004">Fig 4</xref>), reduced its ability to colonise the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g005">Fig 5</xref>), and attenuated its ability to cause systemic infection in immunocompetent mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Fourthly, we show that the virulence of a <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> clinical isolate correlates with its metabolic flexibility. The deletion of a key GID complex component (Gid8) inhibited catabolite inactivation in a Crabtree positive <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> clinical isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g008">Fig 8</xref>), thereby converting it into a Crabtree negative-like strain that is now able to assimilate lactate and glucose simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Even though <italic>gid8</italic> mutations reduce biofilm formation, ethanol resistance and thermotolerance in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, the inactivation of <italic>GID8</italic> increased the resistance of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> to macrophage killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g009">Fig 9A</xref>) and increased the virulence of this yeast in the immunocompromised host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g010">Fig 10</xref>). This was consistent with the observation that Crabtree negative <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> clinical isolates are more resistant to macrophage killing than Crabtree positive isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005566.g009">Fig 9B</xref>).</p>
<p>Our observations reinforce previous reports describing the importance of the glyoxylate cycle and alternative carbon metabolism for microbial infection. <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> mutants that lack the glyoxylate cycle display attenuated virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref048">48</xref>]. This is also the case for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans icl1</italic> mutants, which are less pathogenic in the murine model of systemic candidiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref028">28</xref>]. Our data extend this by showing that the glyoxylate cycle promotes gastrointestinal colonization and the dissemination of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> to the kidney. This supports the idea that isocitrate lyase represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref050">50</xref>] as the glyoxylate cycle is not conserved in mammalian cells.</p>
<p>Our findings also highlight the importance of posttranscriptional regulation in metabolic control. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> has retained the same tight transcriptional repression of glyoxylate cycle genes and other genes required for the assimilation of alternative carbon sources that is observed in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> in response to glucose. For example, in both <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>ICL1</italic> and <italic>PCK1</italic> transcript levels decrease dramatically following glucose exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref022">22</xref>]. Yet <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> continues to assimilate alternative carbon sources in the presence of glucose, whereas <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> does not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref018">18</xref>]. This is because key central metabolic enzymes are subject to ubiquitination and degradation (catabolite inactivation) in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, but not in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref018">18</xref>]. This implies that catabolite inactivation, rather than carbon catabolite repression, plays the major role in controlling the short term management of carbon assimilation.</p>
<p>The impact of Crabtree effects on growth in complex microenvironments is likely to be subtle. For example, we would expect isogenic Crabtree positive and negative strains to grow at similar rates during protracted exposure to sugars or alternative carbon sources, as they would be expected to express similar levels of glycolytic enzymes during growth on sugars, and similar levels of gluconeogenic enzymes during growth on alternative carbon sources. Crabtree positive and negative strains are only likely to behave differently during transitions between alternative carbon sources to sugars. Following transient exposure to glucose, Crabtree positive strains degrade their gluconeogenic enzymes and must resynthesize these enzymes to resume growth on the alternative carbon sources. In contrast, Crabtree negative strains retain these enzymes and therefore are able to resume growth on the alternative carbon sources once the glucose is exhausted. Therefore, when the two are compared directly, a subtle phenotype is expected, where Crabtree negative cells display more continuous growth than Crabtree positive cells during transitions between alternative carbon sources to sugars. When we tested this, we did not detect significant differences between <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans ICL1</italic> and <italic>ICL1-Ubi</italic> cells in competition experiments with <italic>NAT1-</italic>marked strains <italic>in vitro</italic> on defined lactate-containing media with various frequencies of glucose addition. We reason that the degree of competition must depend on the frequency of glucose exposure relative to cell doubling times and enzyme clearance rates. Whatever the basis for this, our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments failed to capture the complexity of <italic>in vivo</italic> niches where competition was reproducibly observed. Nevertheless, experimental observations suggest that the relaxation of the transcriptional control mediated by carbon catabolite repression can enhance the ability of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> cells to compete <italic>in vitro</italic> depending on the frequency and duration of changes in carbon source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref051">51</xref>]. This represents a trade-off between the costly expression of enzymes required for growth on alternative carbon sources and the speed with which metabolism can be reprogrammed to assimilate these alternative carbon sources when sugars become limiting. Our work suggests that the advantages of “flexible” over “specialist” carbon utilization strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref051">51</xref>] extend to fungal pathogens as they colonise complex host niches.</p>
<p>The simultaneous assimilation of glucose and alternative carbon sources raises interesting questions about metabolic fluxes. Formally, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are not expected to occur in the same cell because this might be predicted to set up futile cycles at the Pfk-Fba and Pyk-Pck steps. However, futile cycling appears to be minimal in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> cells expressing gluconeogenic enzymes during growth on glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref052">52</xref>]. Therefore, it is conceivable that when <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> cells are assimilating both glucose and lactate for example, much of the carbon from the glucose is used for cell wall construction and flows down the glycolytic pathway, whilst much of the carbon from the lactate flows into the glyoxylate and TCA cycles. This remains to be tested.</p>
<p>In conclusion, on the basis of our observations in evolutionarily divergent yeasts, we suggest that catabolite inactivation of central anabolic pathways is disadvantageous to yeasts during interactions with the mammalian host. This reflects the complexity of host niches, which are often poor in glucose, but rich in alternative carbon sources. The re-synthesis of enzymes required for alternative carbon utilization following transient exposure to glucose is likely to be energetically demanding, possibly providing a competitive disadvantage against other organisms in the gut microbiota, for example. In contrast, catabolite inactivation might be advantageous to saprobic yeasts that occupy environmental niches. Consequently, some pathogenic yeasts of environmental origin, such as <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> and <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic>, may have retained catabolite inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005566.ref053">53</xref>]. If so, given the contrasting nutrient availabilities in divergent host niches, we speculate that catabolite inactivation might influence the tissue tropism of such infections.</p>
