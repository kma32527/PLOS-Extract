<abstract>
<p>Intracellular pathogens include all viruses, many bacteria and parasites capable of invading and surviving within host cells. Key to survival is the subversion of host cell pathways by the pathogen for the purpose of propagation and evading the immune system. The intracellular bacterium <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, invades host cells in a vacuole that is subsequently ruptured to allow growth of the pathogen within the host cytoplasm. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion has been classically described as a macropinocytosis-like process, however the underlying details and the role of macropinosomes in the intracellular bacterial lifestyle have remained elusive. We applied dynamic imaging and advanced large volume correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) to study the highly transient events of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneriâs</italic> early invasion into host epithelial cells and elucidate some of its fundamental features. First, we demonstrate a clear distinction between two compartments formed during the first step of invasion: the bacterial containing vacuole and surrounding macropinosomes, often considered identical. Next, we report a functional link between macropinosomes and the process of vacuolar rupture, demonstrating that rupture timing is dependent on the availability of macropinosomes as well as the activity of the small GTPase Rab11 recruited directly to macropinosomes. We go on to reveal that the bacterial containing vacuole and macropinosomes come into direct contact at the onset of vacuolar rupture. Finally, we demonstrate that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> does not subvert pre-existing host endocytic vesicles during the invasion steps leading to vacuolar rupture, and propose that macropinosomes are the major compartment involved in these events. These results provide the basis for a new model of the early steps of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> epithelial cell invasion, establishing a different view of the enigmatic process of cytoplasmic access by invasive bacterial pathogens.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> is an intracellular bacterial pathogen and the causative agent of bacillary dysentery. It possesses the ability to invade and propagate within human cells by injecting bacterial effector proteins directly into host cells. Shortly after entry within a vacuole, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> induces vacuolar rupture and escapes into the host cytosol via an unknown mechanism. Using large volume correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) and dynamic microscopy we studied discrete and highly transient steps of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> early invasion in detail. We provide the first 3D high resolution view of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion site and of vacuolar rupture itself. We find that vesicles formed at the invasion site due to injected bacterial effectors, termed macropinosomes, are functionally involved in vacuolar rupture and come into direct contact with the bacterial containing vacuole during this process. This unique and surprising pathogenic strategy stands in stark contrast to other invasive pathogens that induce direct lysis of their surrounding vacuole via the action of destabilizing bacterial proteins.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The lifestyle of intracellular bacterial pathogens is generally divided into the following steps: contact and entry into the host cell, residence within a vacuole, escape into the cytosol or establishment of a membrane encased niche, and cell-to-cell spreading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref001">1</xref>]. Some intracellular bacterial pathogens, called invasive bacteria, such as <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic>, <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> and <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, are able to induce their own entry into nonphagocytic host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref002">2</xref>]. Invasive bacteria are thought to subvert various host endocytic pathways during their life cycle, allowing the establishment of their specific intracellular niche and evasion of host immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref003">3</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> is a medically important pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref005">5</xref>] that uses a type III secretion system (T3SS) to translocate bacterial proteins called effectors into the host cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref006">6</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref007">7</xref>]. Induction of macropinocytosis has been proposed as the invasion strategy for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> entry into non-phagocytic epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref002">2</xref>]. In short, effectors released upon cell contact induce major rearrangements of the host cell cytoskeleton, mainly polymerization of actin filaments to form bundles supporting membrane projections termed ârufflesâ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref008">8</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref009">9</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref010">10</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref011">11</xref>]. This leads to the formation of large membrane protrusions, which form a pocket enclosing the bacteria and facilitating entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref012">12</xref>]. Such ruffles appear similar to those described for macropinocytosis, a classical non-selective cellular uptake mechanism of molecules into large, irregular shaped vesicles, termed macropinosomes, formed by the collapse and fusion of ruffles with the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref013">13</xref>]. In this classic model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref002">2</xref>], entry and macropinosome formation represent a single process. However, evidence exists that bacterial entry and membrane ruffling are associated with different bacterial effectors and host responses during <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion: for example, host vinculin is recruited specifically to entering bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref014">14</xref>], Rho-GTPase isoforms are recruited differentially to either entering bacteria or membrane ruffles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref008">8</xref>], and the bacterial effector IpgD was shown to regulate ruffling morphology and is not required for bacterial entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref015">15</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref016">16</xref>]. Entry has been proposed to occur initially via effector mediated contact of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref017">17</xref>] to cholesterol rich lipid raft membrane domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref018">18</xref>] and to be mediated by specific receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref019">19</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref020">20</xref>] suggesting entry is akin to receptor mediated phagocytosis. In the case of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, an invasive,T3SS-employing pathogen which shares many common aspects with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> entry into host cells, it was hypothesized that <italic>Salmonella</italic> containing vacuole and macropinosomes may be distinct, as they are sorted into different intracellular routes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref021">21</xref>]. Thus, it appears that the classic model for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion may be too simplistic, and a revised model could include two parallel processes: (i) bacterial entry and (ii) membrane ruffling, whose precise biological role in invasion has not been studied in detail.</p>
<p>Upon entry, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> reside within bacteria containing vacuoles (BCVs), followed by BCV rupture and escape into the cytosol within 10 minutes, a step crucial for the intracellular growth of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref022">22</xref>]. Initially, it was thought that bacterial effectors, such as the translocator proteins IpaB and IpaC, induce <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> vacuolar rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref023">23</xref>]. For instance, IpaB was shown <italic>in vitro</italic> to oligomerize and insert into the plasma membrane of target cells, forming cation selective ion channels involved in vacuolar rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref024">24</xref>]. In contrast, we recently showed that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> subverts host cell pathways for BCV rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref025">25</xref>]. A siRNA screen aimed at identifying host proteins involved in vacuolar rupture yielded multiple hits related to membrane trafficking, including EEA1, SNX1, VAMP2, and the small Rab GTPases Rab4, Rab5 and Rab11. Rab5 and Rab11 were recruited to the invasion site, with Rab11 localized to a large area surrounding invading bacteria, but not to the forming BCV. Rab11 knockdown caused a strong delay in vacuolar rupture timing, providing a functional link between membrane trafficking at the invasion site and vacuolar rupture. Additionally, the bacterial effector IpgD, a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> phosphatase, was shown to regulate Rab11 recruitment and to be required for efficient vacuolar rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref025">25</xref>]. How this subversion of host cell pathways by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> relates to bacterial entry and vacuolar rupture has remained unclear.</p>
<p>In this work, we applied dynamic imaging and advanced large volume correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) in the form of focused ion beam/ scanning electron tomography (C-FIB/SET) to reveal key features of the pathogenic strategy employed by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic>. We analyze the architecture of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion site in detail and reveal that it contains two distinct compartments, the BCV and macropinosomes. We demonstrate that Rab11 is recruited directly to macropinosomes and its activity is required for efficient vacuolar rupture. Finally, we reveal that the BCV and macropinosomes come into direct contact at the onset of vacuolar rupture. Our results represent a major step forward in understanding the mechanism of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> escape to the cytosol, and provide the basis for an updated model of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion into epithelial cells.</p>

<title><italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> is surrounded by macropinosome-like vesicles at the invasion site but does not reside within them</title>
<p>Macropinosomes were previously observed at the invasion site of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> in epithelial cells using phase contrast microscopy and fluorescent dextran added to the infection media, acting as a fluid phase marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref021">21</xref>]. We set out to examine macropinosome formation at the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion site by measuring internalization of fixable dextran conjugated to Alexa Fluor-647 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). HeLa, Caco-2 and NRK cells were infected for 30 minutes with wild-type dsRed expressing bacteria, added together with the fluorescent conjugate. This was followed by washes to remove non-internalized dextran, fixation and staining for actin to visualize the site of invasion, and DNA to visualize cell nuclei. Multiple dextran containing vesicles were observed surrounding <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> at the invasion site to a similar extent in all host cell types used. The size distribution of the vesicles was quantified in HeLa cells using automated software. Vesicles are heterogeneous in size, with the majority of vesicles having a diameter less than 1Î¼m and a fraction of larger vesicles observed. As <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> is generally thought to enter cells within a pocket formed by large membrane protrusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref012">12</xref>], we expected the BCV to also contain detectable fluid phase marker. Surprisingly, bacteria were never observed within dextran positive vesicles, implying <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> containing vacuoles exclude most extracellular fluid. The observed vesicle size heterogeneity and uptake of extracellular fluid are reminiscent of features classically associated with macropinosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref026">26</xref>], suggesting <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> is surrounded by macropinosome-like vesicles (here on referred to simply as âmacropinosomesâ, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">discussion</xref>) at the invasion site but does not reside within them.</p>

<title>Newly formed macropinosomes are the major compartment at the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion site</title>
<p>Intracellular bacterial pathogens are normally thought to subvert pre-existing host endocytic vesicles during invasion (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec001">introduction</xref>), however our study indicated that nascent macropinosomes appear to be a major endomembrane component at the invasion site of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic>. We examined the relative contribution of pre-existing endocytic vesicles to the endomembrane content at the invasion site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). To this end, we performed sequential labeling experiments, pre-loading cells with dextran Alexa Fluor-488 for two to three hours prior to infection to allow uptake by the host endocytic compartment. This was followed by extensive washes and infection in the presence of dextran Alexa Fluor-647. Extensive labeling of punctate dextran Alexa Fluor-488 endomembrane structures was observed throughout the cells. Strikingly, we could not detect accumulation of dextran Alexa Fluor-488 containing vesicles around invading bacteria, while dextran Alexa Fluor-647 vesicles were highly enriched around bacteria. Furthermore, we did not detect any co-localization of the two differently colored dextrans around the entering bacteria at the measured time-point. Quantitative image analysis revealed 92% of total vesicle volume (i.e. combined volume of vesicles labeled by either dextran Alexa Fluor-488 or dextran Alexa Fluor-647) at the invasion site is occupied by dextran Alexa Fluor-647 containing vesicles. This indicated that the local environment around invading <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> is occupied by newly formed macropinosomes, without significant recruitment of pre-existing host endocytic vesicles, arguing against active subversion of pre-existing host endocytic pathways by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> during invasion.</p>

<title>C-FIB/SET provides detailed 3D structural information of discreet and transient stages of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion</title>
<p>Since fine structural details of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion site are obscured by the resolution limit of standard light microscopy, we applied CLEM in the form of correlative large volume focused ion beam/scanning electron tomography (C-FIB/SET) to examine the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion site in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref028">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This emerging technique combines 3D fluorescent and large volume electron tomography into a single correlated data set, providing three features ideal for investigation of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion: First, discreet and highly transient (in the order of minutes) stages of invasion can be targeted using fluorescent microscopy with stage-specific fluorescent markers prior to tomography acquisition. Thus, precise access to early invasion (before BCV rupture) and to the vacuolar rupture event itself can be gained. Secondly, the large cellular volumes (in the order of 1000 Î¼m<sup>3</sup>) acquired using this technique allow visualization of entire invasion sites, accounting for multiple bacteria, vesicles and other cellular structures present at the site. The BCVâs and other vesiclesâ membranal integrity and their connectivity to other compartments can be examined in 3D from all axes, providing structural information not easily accessible by classic serial sectioning and tomography approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref029">29</xref>]. Finally, the fluorescent labeling correlated in 3D to the tomography data (with bacteria observed by light and electron microscopy acting as alignment fiducials) provides molecular specificity to features observed within the tomography volume, albeit within the light microscopy diffraction limit (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec016">materials and methods</xref>). Overall, 15 C-FIB/SET data sets of invasion sites were acquired for this study. As fluorescence microscopy of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion site revealed that BCVs exclude detectable fluorescent dextran and are surrounded by dextran containing vesicles in all our experiments, we first set out to examine the architecture of the early invasion site in detail using C-FIB/SET.

<title>The BCV is a tight compartment distinct from surrounding macropinosomes</title>
<p>We examined the structure of the BCV in early invasion in detail and delineated the typical BCV structural motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005602.s007">S2 Movie</xref>). The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g002">Fig 2B</xref> is representative of all datasets acquired during early invasion in our study. We found that the bacterial cytosol and membrane are surrounded by a layer of low electron density. Based on annotation from previous ultrastructural studies we associate this layer with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref031">31</xref>]). Furthermore, this layer is also present in rupturing BCVs missing parts of their BCV membrane (see below), indicating it does not represent the vacuole lumen. These bacterial structures are tightly enclosed by the vacuole membrane. An additional electron dense layer observed only around bacteria surrounded by phalloidin stain (as identified by fluorescence microscopy) is consequently identified as actin. Finally, we observe multiple small vesicles surrounding the BCV, but not contacting it nor each other. In all data sets observed, BCVs contained a single bacterium (often in division), were structurally uniform and tightly surrounding the bacterium inside. We were not able to detect a luminal BCV space around the bacteria in any of our data sets. Overall, our high resolution correlated view of the early <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion site reveals the BCV is a tight, uniform compartment, structurally distinct from the surrounding heterogeneous macropinosomes. We conclude that the BCV and macropinosomes present at the early invasion site represent two distinct compartments.</p>

FIB/SET analysis reveals the entire vesicle population around invading <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> irrespective of the fluorescent probe, while the dextran Alexa Fluor-647 label provides an indication of the volume occupied by vesicles formed during invasion. In the two datasets presented (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005602.s003">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>), 95% and 99% of vesicles found at the invasion site reside within the fluorescent dextran label (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005602.s003">S2C Fig</xref>).

<title>Vacuolar rupture efficiency is correlated to macropinosome availability</title>
<p>We have recently shown that the bacterial effector IpgD is required for efficient vacuolar rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref025">25</xref>]. As IpgD is also a regulator of macropinosome formation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>), we hypothesized these two processes may be functionally related. In order to test this hypothesis, we performed two bacterial effector mutant library screens aimed at identifying the relationship between the number of macropinosomes at the invasion site and vacuolar rupture timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>, selected hits are presented. For screen details see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec016">materials and methods</xref>. Full screen results are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005602.s004">S3A Fig</xref>). First, the library was screened for the number of macropinosomes formed at the invasion site using quantitative image analysis of fluorescent dextran containing vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Various effectors alongside IpgD were found to affect macropinosome formation, including IpgB1, IpgE (a chaperone for IpgD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref015">15</xref>]) and IpgB2. Secondly, the library was screened for vacuolar rupture timing using dynamic microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). We found an inverse correlation between the number of macropinosomes formed at the invasion site and the delay in vacuolar rupture timing, i.e. the fewer macropinosomes found at the invasion site, the longer rupture is delayed. Of particular interest is the effector IpgB1, the strongest hit in both screens. IpgB1 was shown to be involved in the early stages of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion, is associated with membrane ruffles, and can induce membrane ruffling via stimulation of Rac1 and Cdc42 activities. Like IpgD, it has no known function in disrupting membrane integrity or pore formation to our knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref032">32</xref>]. Thus, our mutant screens results revealed that vacuolar rupture efficiency is correlated to macropinosome availability. We also studied the effect of drugs known to inhibit macropinocytosis and actin dynamics on macropinosome formation and vacuolar rupture timing. Amiloride, a Na(+)/H(+) exchange inhibitor known to cause indirect inhibition of macropinocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref033">33</xref>] did not inhibit macropinosome formation and entry at low doses and was cytotoxic at higher doses. As we have previously identified via high-content siRNA screening that Arp2/3 subunits are among host proteins involved in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> uptake and vacuolar rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref025">25</xref>] we tested CK-666, an Arp2/3 complex inhibitor that does not stimulate dissociation of preformed actin branches in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref034">34</xref>]. CK-666 inhibited macropinosome formation without inhibiting bacterial entry, and significantly delayed vacuolar rupture timing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005602.s004">S3B Fig</xref>). The selective inhibition of macropinosome formation by CK-666 may be due to the drug having a stronger effect on ruffle formation, a process requiring massive actin re-arrangement, as opposed to the more small scale actin re-arrangement required for bacterial uptake. Overall, our results demonstrate that vacuolar rupture timing is dependent on the availability of macropinosomes, indicating that membrane ruffling and macropinosome formation may be functionally linked to vacuolar rupture.</p>

<title>Time lapse microscopy reveals macropinosomes border the BCVs at the onset of vacuolar rupture</title>
<p>We therefore set out to examine the cell biology underlying the relation between macropinosomes and vacuolar rupture in detail using dynamic microscopy, functional assays and structural analysis. First, we examined the spatial and temporal proximity of macropinosomes to the rupturing BCV. We performed live microscopy of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion in cells transfected with a marker of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), 2XFYVE-GFP, used for labeling macropinosomes, and galectin-3-mOrange used for labeling vacuolar rupture. PI3P has been previously reported to be associated with early macropinosome maturation, in particular with the cup closure step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref035">35</xref>]. We found that 2XFYVE-GFP was partially co-localized with dextran positive vesicles at the invasion site, this partial co-localization likely due to the transient nature of its recruitment to forming macropinosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref035">35</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005602.s004">S3C Fig</xref>). Galectin-3-mOrange is commonly used as a vacuolar rupture marker as it specifically labels the BCV only after loss of vacuole integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref036">36</xref>]. 3D multi-channel images were acquired every 30 seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005602.s008">S3 Movie</xref>) and the resulting movies were quantified by counting the number of events where macropinosomes were found bordering (within 1Î¼m) the rupturing BCV, as indicated by the first appearance of a galectin-3-mOrange signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g003">Fig 3E</xref> left). In 73% of all vacuolar rupture events analyzed (n = 30 events in three independent experiments), macropinosomes were found bordering the BCV, with 50% of events containing more than one bordering vesicle. This number most likely underrepresents such events as not all macropinosomes are labeled with 2XFYVE-GFP. In order to assess whether macropinosome proximity to the BCV occurs upstream of rupture or is a product of rupture, we performed high temporal resolution imaging with multi-channel confocal stacks acquired every 5 seconds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005602.s004">S3D Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005602.s009">S4 Movie</xref>). This allowed clear detection of bordering macropinosomes at the onset of the galection-3-mOrange signal appearance and therefore at the onset of vacuolar rupture. Data quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, right) showed that in 92% of the subset of vacuolar rupture events containing bordering macropinosomes (n = 36 events in three independent experiments), bordering occurred at least one frame before the onset of rupture, indicating this proximity is present upstream of vacuolar rupture. In all movies acquired, rupturing BCVâs (i.e. labeled with galectin-3-mOrange) were never co-labeled with 2XFYVE-GFP, and 2XFYVE-GFP positive vesicles were never co-labeled with galection-3-mOrange, implying macropinosome proximity to the rupturing BCV does not result in membrane fusion or ruptured macropinosomes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">discussion</xref>).</p>

Taken together, these results suggest that during invasion Rab11 can associate directly with newly formed macropinosomes via a non-classical pathway that does not involve recycling endosomes. In order to test this hypothesis we performed dextran pulse chase experiments combined with live imaging of cells transfected with Rab11-GFP and galectin-3-mOrange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g004">Fig 4Aâ4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005602.s010">S5 Movie</xref>).

At that point the cells were quickly washed to remove non-internalized dextran from the media and live imaging was initiated. Cells were imaged in 3D at 60s intervals. The time point for dextran washes (t = 0) was chosen so that invasion sites already containing internalized dextran but prior to vacuolar rupture (as indicated by galectin-3-mOrange) could be captured. Thus the relation between dextran containing macropinosomes and Rab11-GFP recruited to the invasion site could be examined during live imaging of early invasion. A representative experiment is presented. We found that Rab11 is directly and dynamically recruited to macropinosomes prior and during vacuolar rupture, conforming the non-classical association between macropinosomes and Rab11 at the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion site.

We transfected cells with Rab11-GFP or Rab11 DN and galectin-3-mOrange and performed live imaging of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion to determine vacuolar rupture timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g004">Fig 4D</xref> right, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005602.s011">S6 Movie</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005602.s012">S7 Movie</xref> showing representative experiments). We found that vacuolar rupture is significantly delayed when using the Rab11 DN. Our results indicate that while Rab11 is not required for macropinosome formation or bacterial entry, its activity is required for recruitment to macropinosomes and efficient vacuolar rupture. We hypothesize that Rab11âs role in vacuolar rupture is manifested through its well described function in vesicle trafficking regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref039">39</xref>] acting uniquely on macropinosomes in the case of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">discussion</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall our effector mutant screens, live imaging and functional studies reveal that macropinosomes at the invasion site are the target for direct recruitment of Rabs, they border the BCVs at the onset of vacuolar rupture, and their formation and trafficking are required for efficient vacuolar rupture. Together, these results provide for the first time evidence that vacuolar rupture involves two cellular compartments, the BCV and macropinosomes.</p>

<title>Macropinosomes come into direct contact with the bacteria containing vacuole during vacuolar rupture</title>
<p>We hypothesized that macropinosomes are directly implicated in vacuolar rupture via physical contacts with the BCV. Such contacts are obscured when using fluorescence microscopy due to the limited resolution of light microscopy. We therefore applied C-FIB/SET to image the very short-lived and highly dynamic rupturing event in detail, acquiring correlative data sets of invasion sites containing BCVs labeled with galectin-3-mOrange to indicate rupture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g005">Fig 5</xref>). C-FIB/SET is particularly suited for the unambiguous identification of compartmental contact points at the invasion site, as it provides information in all three axes and within a large cellular volume likely to contain multiple contacts occurring at various orientations. Strikingly, in cells infected with the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005602.s013">S8 Movie</xref>) rupturing BCVs were found in direct contact with multiple surrounding vesicles. A partly dissociated BCV membrane emanating into the cytosol from the contact point between a macropinosome and a BCV was observed, with most of it still attached to the bacterium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, white arrows, yellow). Smaller intraluminal vesicles within the large macropinosome were commonly observed at the interface between the macropinosome and the BCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, black arrowhead). As IpgD is required for efficient rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref025">25</xref>], we examined its involvement in the formation of macropinosome-BCV contact points. Infection with a <italic>Îipg</italic>D strain revealed a reduction in the number of vesicles in contact with the BCV, yet macropinosome-BCV contact points morphologically identical to the wild-type were still always observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005602.s014">S9 Movie</xref>), indicating that IpgD regulates macropinosome availability but does not impact the formation of macropinosome-BCV contacts during rupture. In the rupture events presented here, most of the BCV membrane is still present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, yellow), and rupture is observed at the opposite side of the bacterium in relation to the contact points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, black arrows). We conclude that the BCV and surrounding macropinosomes come into direct contact during vacuolar rupture. Thus, our functional, dynamic and structural analysis (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g005">5</xref>) suggest that macropinosomes are required for efficient vacuolar rupture and that macropinosome-BCV contacts are involved in this process.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report here that macropinosomes are a central compartment in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion and that they are implicated in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> vacuolar rupture. Our results lay the ground for a new model of the early steps of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion into epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g006">Fig 6A</xref>): Invasion begins with two distinct processes occurring in conjunction: bacterial entry into a tight BCV and the regulated formation of macropinosomes via membrane ruffling. Then, host Rab GTPases are recruited directly to nascent macropinosomes, followed by direct contact between macropinosomes and the BCV at the onset vacuolar rupture. Host endomembranes are not recruited to the invasion site, indicating invasion occurs without subversion of pre-existing host endocytic pathways or pre-existing endomembrane compartments. Macropinosomes are revealed to be key players in the process of vacuolar rupture, as indicated by functional experiments demonstrating that the efficiency of vacuolar rupture is dependent on macropinosome availability and Rab11 activity (acting in direct association with macropinosomes). This new model provides a conceptual framework that accommodates previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref008">8</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref014">14</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref015">15</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref016">16</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref025">25</xref>], and has predictive power in regard to the possible biological role of membrane ruffling and macropinosomes in other pathogenic systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref011">11</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref021">21</xref>]. For example, various observations made regarding the bacterial effector IpgD are put into biological context with our work: While IpgD is not required for bacterial entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref015">15</xref>], it is known to promote ruffling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref015">15</xref>], is required for macropinosome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>), Rab11 recruitment to the invasion site and efficient vacuolar rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref025">25</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref027">27</xref>]. These activities are now placed in sequence, as ruffling, macropinosome formation, Rab GTPase recruitment to macropinosomes and vacuolar rupture represent a cascade of causally connected events occurring during <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>Vesicles induced by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> share some similarities with classically described macropinosomes formed in non-pathogenic systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref013">13</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref041">41</xref>]. Their formation in the context of membrane ruffling, size heterogeneity and uptake of fluid phase marker resemble that of macropinosomes (and micropinosomes, accounting for smaller vesicles formed at the invasion site). However, their formation is induced via the action of bacterial effectors that modulate other cellular pathways as well, and thus may affect vesicle biochemistry. Indeed, our results demonstrate that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> induced macropinosomes are associated with Rab11, a typical marker for the recycling endosomal pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref038">38</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref039">39</xref>], not known to label macropinosomes in other systems. Macropinosome trafficking in the absence of pathogens is cell type dependent, and while professional phagocytizing cells direct macropinosomes into the lysosomal pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref042">42</xref>], in some non-professional phagocytizing cells, macropinosomes were reported to recycle to the plasma membrane, with little or no interaction with endosomal vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref041">41</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref043">43</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref044">44</xref>]. It may be that the macropinosome-BCV contacts are a product of âmisdirectedâ trafficking towards the BCV that we like to term âinternal recyclingâ, instead of recycling to the plasma membrane, as both compartments present similar membranal features.</p>
<p>Intracellular pathogens are generally thought to engage and subvert existing housekeeping endomembrane system pathways, such as the lysosomal or recycling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref038">38</xref>]. This pathogenic strategy is a hallmark of <italic>Salmonella</italic> invasion into epithelial cells, with many studies demonstrating complicated subversion patterns induced by <italic>Salmonella</italic> during invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref004">4</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref045">45</xref>]. In stark contrast, we report here a pathogenic strategy that does not exploit a pre-existing host pathway. Instead, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> induces the formation and trafficking of macropinosomes formed <italic>in situ</italic> in a âlocal pathogenic pathwayâ that involves the recruitment of Rab GTPases to macropinosomes, and does not involve recruitment of host endomembranes. Thus at each <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion site a local trafficking pathway is initiated without it being normally present in the cell. This pathway is subsequently exploited by the pathogen for vacuolar escape. The strategy employed by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> represents a divergence from existing paradigms of pathogen- host interactions centered on the successive pathogen subversion of established trafficking pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref003">3</xref>]. In resemblance to other pathogenic systems, such as viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref046">46</xref>], macropinosomes are revealed to be a key constituent of the invasion process.</p>
<p>The establishment of a new model for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion presented here hinged on the utilization of the emerging technique of C-FIB/SET. First, C-FIB/SET was used to demonstrate that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> enters cells within a tight BCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g002">Fig 2</xref>), likely explaining the lack of detectable fluorescent dextran labeling around bacteria when studied by light microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This result strongly supports a model where bacterial entry occurs via a phagocytosis- like mechanism leading to tightly enveloped bacteria, and not, as is classically suggested (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec001">introduction</xref>), via a macropinocytosis- like entry processâwhich would result in spacious, heterogeneous BCVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref002">2</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g006">Fig 6</xref>). In this âtwo parallel pathwaysâ invasion model, the biological function of membrane ruffling and the resulting macropinosomes is related to the downstream step of vacuolar rupture, and not, as previously thought, to bacterial entry. Second, by specifically targeting rupturing vacuoles (as indicated by galectin-3-mOrange fluorescent labeling) for FIB/SET acquisition, this enigmatic and transient event became reliably and reproducibly accessible to 3D ultrastructural investigation for the first time, revealing macropinosome-BCV contacts and emanating dissociated membranes. The biological observations obtained through the application of C-FIB/SET in our study not only led to the emergence of new biological concepts regarding <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion, but act to demonstrate the power of this technique to investigate complex biological arenas containing multiple transient or rare events, complex 3D cellular organization and intricate structural interfaces.</p>
<p>We reveal a functional relationship between macropinosomes and the process of vacuolar rupture, mediated by the activity of Rab11. Macropinosome formation and trafficking ultimately result in macropinosomeâBCV contact points formed at the onset of vacuolar rupture. How these contact points may drive membrane destabilization and eventual vacuolar rupture remains an open question. Our results lay the ground for future in depth investigations of the molecular mechanism and underlying biophysics driving this process, however initial insights into the mechanism of rupture can be gained from several observations: Firstly, in both fixed and dynamic light microscopy experiments, macropinosomes were never labeled with galectin-3-mOrange during vacuolar rupture. As BCV membranes become coated with galectin-3 at the loss of vacuolar integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref036">36</xref>], fused or ruptured macropinosomes (i.e. with inner membranes exposed to the BCV or cytoplasm) would be expected to be labeled with galectin-3 as well. Furthermore, rupturing BCVs were never labeled with fluorescent dextran (fixed and pulse-chase experiments) or 2XFYVE-GFP (live microscopy; even during time-lapse studies with very high temporal resolution), as would be expected had dextran flowed from fusing macropinosomes into the collapsing BCV during rupture or if lipids were exchanged. These two observations argue against macropinosome -BCV fusion or macropinosome rupture as the underlying process facilitating BCV rupture, suggesting an altogether different mechanism is in place. Secondly, IpgD regulates macropinosome formation as well as rupture timing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref025">25</xref>]. Infections with the Î<italic>ipgD</italic> strain exhibit overall fewer macropinosomes in contact with rupturing BCVs, while the typical macropinosome-BCV contact point is still present in every rupturing BCV examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). A decrease in the amount of contacts may limit damage to the BCV, explaining the observed delay in vacuolar rupture when using this strain and hinting at a cumulative damaging effect of macropinosome-BCV contacts. A decrease in macropinosome trafficking towards the BCV when using Rab11 KD or Rab11 DN would result in a similar effect. One possible mechanism could involve the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) pinched off from the BCV membrane and into maturing macropinosomes, causing increased membrane tension and eventually vacuolar rupture. Such vesicles are often observed at the interface between the BCV and connected macropinosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, black arrowhead). The molecular machinery driving the formation of ILVs has been described in endosomes and phagosomes, but not in macropinosomes thus far to our knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref041">41</xref>]. Finally, the involvement of multiple bacterial effectors in vacuolar rupture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>), without any single effector mutant inducing a complete arrest of rupture, implies that vacuolar rupture is not dependent on a single bacterial effector as described in other systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref047">47</xref>]. While other invasive bacterial pathogens employ direct lysis of their surrounding vacuole via bacterial proteins inserted directly into the membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref048">48</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref049">49</xref>], <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> vacuolar rupture is most likely a complex process that involves multiple bacterial and host molecules acting to facilitate macropinosome formation, trafficking, contacts with the BCV and membrane destabilization. Future studies using imaging, biochemical and biophysical approaches will allow further elucidation of this critical step in the growth of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic>.</p>
<p>Macropinosomes have been identified at the invasion site of intra-cellular bacterial pathogens years ago in seminal works by S. Falkow and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref011">11</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref021">21</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref050">50</xref>]. However, since then, their precise role in intra-cellular bacterial invasion has remained poorly understood and their importance overlooked. We report here a central role for macropinosomes in the pathogenic strategy of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic>, and predict that this compartment is exploited by other invasive bacteria as well, possessing various biological functions in the context of pathogenicity yet to be discovered.</p>

<p>Fixed samples were imaged using a Perkin Elmer UltraView spinning disc confocal microscope, with a 60X/ 1.2NA water objective and a Z step size of 0.3 Î¼m. For time lapse microscopy, cells were imaged with a confocal microscope (for experiments in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g003">3Câ3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g004">4Aâ4C</xref>) at 37Â°C with a 40X / 1.3 NA oil objective. Every 60, 30 or 5 seconds depending on experiment, a stack of 6 z-planes (step size of 0.5Î¼m) was acquired sequentially in two or three channels using a 488nm, 561nm and 640nm laser depending on experiment. For mutant library rupture timing screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) and Rab11 DN experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g004">Fig 4D</xref>) cells were imaged at 37Â°C using a Nikon Ti-E wide-field microscope with a 20X air objective. Imaging was performed with excitation at 465 to 500 nm and 540 to 565 nm. Images were acquired every 90 or 120 seconds (depending on the exposure time) for 1 to 2 hours. In each screen experiment two mutants and one control (wild-type strain) were screened and images of 10 positions per strain acquired. For the Rab11 DN experiments 8 positions per condition were acquired with WT and IpgD as controls.</p>

<p>Sample preparation and acquisition were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005602.ref025">25</xref>]. In short, HeLa cells were cultured on MatTek dishes with finder grid (MatTek Corporations). Infections were performed as described above. Samples were fixed with 0.1% Glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes at room temperature. After high resolution confocal microscopy imaging (using 60X objective) positions of interest were marked using phase contrast and fluorescence with 10X and 20X objectives. Samples were then fixed overnight with 2.5% Glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer followed by fixation in 2.5% glutaraldehyde + 0.4% Tannic Acid pH 7.2 in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 30 min at RT. Samples were stained with 1% OsO4 in DDW for 30 min at 4Â°C. Samples were dehydrated in graded ethanol series and embedded in Epon followed by FIB/SET performed in a Helios Nanolab Dual beam (FEI) at the electron microscopy unit at the Weizmann Institute of Science (Israel). XY pixel size range was 6.5â8.3 nm and slice thickness 10 nm. Data was aligned using ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/" xlink:type="simple">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). Amira and Avizo (FEI) were used for 3D visualization, data correlation, manual segmentation and supporting movies. Internalized bacteria were used as correlating fiducials. Inverted contrast is presented. Overall 15 C-FIB/SEM datasets of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion sites were acquired, 11 of WT strain and 4 of Î<italic>ipgD</italic> strain.</p>

<title>Quantitative image analysis</title>
<p>Macropinosome size distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) was quantified using ICY (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/</ext-link>). âSpot detectorâ plugin was applied to segment dextran containing vesicles in 3D confocal stacks. A spherical assumption was used to extract vesicle diameter. 2300 vesicles from three separate experiments were analyzed. WT vs. Î<italic>ipgD</italic> strain vesicles/bacterium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) was quantified using CellProfiler (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cellprofiler.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cellprofiler.org/</ext-link>). Macropinosomes were counted only when found in actin labeled ruffles that contained at least one bacterium. Quantification is based on six separate experiments including in total 1186 cells, 1877 bacteria and 4330 vesicles. Unpaired t test was used for significance. Vesicle volume distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) was performed using a custom ICY protocol. 34 invasion sites in two experiments were chosen for analysis. <italic>Shigella</italic>-dsRed, dextran Alexa Fluor-488 and Alexa Fluor-647 signals were segmented in 3D. The sum of volumes of all vesicles of each type within 30 voxels of bacteria in each invasion site was calculated and normalized to the total vesicle volume at the site. Overall 476 vesicles were used in analysis. The mutant library macropinosome formation screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) was quantified using CellProfiler in an identical manner to the WT vs. Î<italic>ipgD</italic> strain vesicles formation assay described above. Results were obtained from two independent experiments, each containing at least 30 invasion sites, with 907 invasion sites analyzed in total. For mutant library rupture timing screen and Rab11 DN experiments (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g003">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g004">4D</xref>), time lapse series were visually analyzed with Fiji (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fiji.sc/" xlink:type="simple">http://fiji.sc</ext-link>). For rupture timing screen three independent experiments per strain were performed, at least 50 invasion events per strain were measured, with 791 events in total. For Rab11 DN experiments three independent experiments per condition were performed, with 946 rupture events analyzed in total (WT 351, IpgD 193, DN 402). Vacuolar rupture timing was measured as the time interval between the beginning of ruffle formation and the appearance of a Galectin-3 localized signal. Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism software v6. The difference between WT and mutants, or DN rupture timing was evaluated using one-way ANOVA. p &lt; 0.05 was considered as significant: *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.0001, and ****p&lt;0.0001. Time lapse microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g003">Fig 3Câ3E</xref>) was manually quantified using Fiji, with bordering event counted when 2XFYVE-GFP and galectin-3-mOrange signal where found within 6 pixels distance of each other. Analysis of macropinosomes bordering at the onset of BCV rupture was performed by manually counting all instances of 2XFYVE-GFP positive vesicles present at the rupture site at least one frame before galectin-3 cage appearance (positive hit) in contrast to vesicles appearing only during or after galectin-3 cage appearance (negative hit). 36 events were imaged in eight independent experiments All quantitative data in the manuscript is presented as mean, with error bars presented as s.d.</p>

<title>C-FIB/SET confirms the presence of newly formed vesicles at the invasion site.</title>
<p>C-FIB/SET was applied to correlate dextran Alexa Fluor-647 labeling (purple) added during 30 min infection to all vesicles detected by FIB/SET at the invasion site (EM Segmentation, orange). Bacteria are labeled by DAPI (cyan) and segmented from FIB/SET data (blue). Two separate datasets are presented, (A) and (B). Quantitative analysis reveals that 95% and 99% (respectively) of vesicles found at the invasion site reside within the fluorescent dextran label. Vesicles outside of dextran label are highlighted in the overlay view (yellow). In data set B, five of the largest vesicles that reside outside of the dextran labeling are found near the surface of the cell, most likely representing late forming macropinosomes formed after removal of dextran in the washing phase. Scale bars are 10Î¼m.</p>

<title>Full mutant screens results, application of the Arp2/3 inhibitor CK-666 and high temporal resolution imaging of vacuolar rupture.</title>
<p>(A) Full results of the two bacterial effector mutant library screens described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005602.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>. All bacterial effectors examined by both screens are presented. Results are normalized to WT. (B) CK-666 inhibits macropinosome formation (left) and causes a significant delay in vacuolar rupture (middle), but does not inhibit bacterial entry (right). Unpaired student t-test is used for significance. See supplementary materials and methods for experimental details. (C) 2XFYVE-GFP is partially co-localized with dextran positive vesicles at the invasion site. Cells transfected with 2XFYVE-GFP were infected for 30 min with WT strain in the presence of dextran Alexa Fluor-647. 2XFYVE-GFP was partially co-localized with dextran positive vesicles at the invasion site. (D) High temporal time lapse microscopy reveals macropinosomes border the BCV at the onset of vacuolar rupture. Cells transfected with the PI3P marker 2XFYVE-GFP, and the vacuolar rupture marker galectin-3-mOrange, were imaged in three dimensions (z-interval: 0.5 Î¼m,) during <italic>S</italic>. <italic>flexneri</italic> invasion at five second intervals. Z-projections are shown in the figure. After the onset of membrane ruffling (0s), a transient PI3P enrichment was observed (130s) around the BCV with a lifetime of 20-250s (n = 27), followed by macropinosome formation (310s). Vacuolar rupture begins with macropinosomes bordering the BCV (340s) in 33 out of 36 events observed (92%). Macropinosomes persist around the BCV during rupture (440s). Scale bar is 5Î¼m.
