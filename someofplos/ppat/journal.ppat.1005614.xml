<abstract>
<p>Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) is currently the only approved vaccine against tuberculosis (TB) and is administered in over 150 countries worldwide. Despite its widespread use, the vaccine has a variable protective efficacy of 0–80%, with the lowest efficacy rates in tropical regions where TB is most prevalent. This variability is partially due to ubiquitous environmental mycobacteria (EM) found in soil and water sources, with high EM prevalence coinciding with areas of poor vaccine efficacy. In an effort to elucidate the mechanisms underlying EM interference with BCG vaccine efficacy, we exposed mice chronically to <italic>Mycobacterium avium (M</italic>. <italic>avium)</italic>, a specific EM, by two different routes, the oral and intradermal route, to mimic human exposure. After intradermal BCG immunization in mice exposed to oral <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic>, we saw a significant decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ, and an increase in T regulatory cells and the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 compared to naïve BCG-vaccinated animals. To circumvent the immunosuppressive effect of oral <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> exposure, we vaccinated mice by the pulmonary route with BCG. Inhaled BCG immunization rescued IFN-γ levels and increased CD4 and CD8 T cell recruitment into airways in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic>-presensitized mice. In contrast, intradermal BCG vaccination was ineffective at T cell recruitment into the airway. Pulmonary BCG vaccination proved protective against Mtb infection regardless of previous oral <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> exposure, compared to intradermal BCG immunization. In conclusion, our data indicate that vaccination against TB by the pulmonary route increases BCG vaccine efficacy by avoiding the immunosuppressive interference generated by chronic oral exposure to EM. This has implications in TB-burdened countries where drug resistance is on the rise and health care options are limited due to economic considerations. A successful vaccine against TB is necessary in these areas as it is both effective and economical.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The current vaccine against tuberculosis (TB), BCG, has variable efficacy (0–80%) at protecting against infection. A large body of clinical and experimental evidence implicates host exposure to environmental mycobacteria (EM) as the cause of interference with BCG vaccine-induced immunity. We explore the mechanism by which EM interferes with parenteral immunization and propose oral tolerance as a mechanism for this interference. In addition, we use the pulmonary route to vaccinate EM-exposed hosts, thus ensuring effective BCG immunization and subsequent protection against TB. This work has broad implications in the TB vaccine field as it shows that the vulnerability of the current vaccine, and that of many novel vaccine candidates, may be the route of administration and not necessarily the vaccine itself.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading causes of death due to an infectious agent worldwide, with a yearly mortality of 1.5 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref002">2</xref>]. The World Health Organization estimates that over one-third of the global population is latently infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), the bacterium that causes TB, and every year 9 million people develop active TB. These mortality and morbidity statistics, coupled with increasingly limited antibiotic options due to drug resistance, demonstrate why an effective vaccine against TB has become a global health priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is the only approved vaccine against TB. Despite widespread use, BCG offers variable protection against pulmonary disease (0–80%), with the lowest efficacy in geographical regions where TB is most prevalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref003">3</xref>]. This variability is due, at least in part, to environmental mycobacteria (EM) exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref009">9</xref>]. EM are present ubiquitously in soil and water sources around the world, with high concentrations coinciding with areas of poor vaccine efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref012">12</xref>]. Individuals living in these areas have high EM exposure via the gastrointestinal (GI) tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref012">12</xref>]. While EM interference with BCG protection has been widely studied, the mechanism of action has not been elucidated and continues to be a topic of debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>To elucidate the mechanism of interference by EM, it is necessary to understand how the immune system responds to EM and BCG, separately and together, in the appropriate tissue of exposure. Homeostasis, inflammation, and tolerance are all critical for protection against, and recovery from, pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref019">19</xref>]. This regulation of immunity is different depending on the location of infection within the body. Localized infections are usually compartmentalized to a specific tissue or niche within the body that favors pathogenesis. Similarly, various tissues within the body can be immunologically primed to home immune cells in a tissue-specific manner, such that these cells manifest their effects primarily in a particular tissue compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref021">21</xref>]. Thus, the route of exposure to an antigen predisposes an individual for all subsequent immune responses to the same antigen.</p>
<p>Compartmentalized immunity is an evolutionary advantage. For example, the GI tract needs to respond to pathogens differently than the respiratory tract. The GI tract comes into contact with many pathogens daily and requires mechanisms for generating a tolerogenic response to commonly ingested antigens and pathogens, in order to prevent unnecessary inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref025">25</xref>]. This phenomena, called oral tolerance, is defined as the lack of a systemic immune response to parenteral immunization with an antigen to which an animal has previously been exposed to through the GI tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref024">24</xref>]. Conversely, the lung and airway are vulnerable to serious infection. The airway is a highly compartmentalized and reactive tissue. This was illustrated by Xing and colleagues, who demonstrated the failures of systemic vaccination against pulmonary pathogens like Mtb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref028">28</xref>]. They showed that parenteral vaccination with BCG was not sufficient for the recruitment of antigen-specific immune cells to the airway of the lung in a mouse model of TB. Only mucosal (intranasal) immunization generated immune cells in the airway and was protective against subsequent aerosol Mtb infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, we explored the oral and parenteral routes of EM exposure and their ability to interfere with intradermal BCG immunization. We hypothesized that chronic EM exposure by the oral route results in systemic tolerance toward these EM. We found that this tolerance is cross-reactive to the intradermally delivered BCG vaccine which has cell wall components markedly similar to EM. Consequently, the host does not generate immunity against BCG, and individuals remain vulnerable to TB infection. Furthermore, we found that targeting the immunologically naïve airway by pulmonary immunization circumvented systemic EM immunosuppression and provided BCG-specific immunity which was protective against TB. Our research helps define the mechanism of EM interference with BCG vaccination and indicates that pulmonary administration enhances the protective effects of the BCG vaccine, regardless of prior EM exposure. It is likely that these findings will also be pertinent to future TB vaccines containing mycobacterial antigens that are administered by the parenteral route.</p>

<p>T cells were first assessed for antigen cross-reactivity to determine whether lymphocytes from EM-presensitized mice can distinguish between EM and BCG and thus respond differentially. Splenic and lung T cells from O-MA and ID-BCG mice were restimulated with either heat-killed <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> or BCG. There was no difference in IFN-γ response with respect to the antigen (<italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> or BCG) used for restimulation in either tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), suggesting marked antigenic similarity between <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> and BCG. However, T cells from ID-BCG animals responded with higher IFN-γ secretion than T cells from O-MA animals. Specifically, when restimulated with BCG, splenic T cells from ID-BCG mice secreted high levels of IFN-γ (1x10<sup>3</sup> pg/mL), whereas T cells from O-MA mice secreted two-fold less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Importantly, mice presensitized with oral <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> before intradermal immunization with BCG (O-MA + ID-BCG) had markedly reduced IFN-γ secretion compared to the ID-BCG group. Indeed, pretreatment with oral <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> reduced IFN-γ secretion by T cells from BCG-immunized mice restimulated with BCG to the level seen in mice never immunized with BCG (O-MA only). Likewise, BCG stimulated lung T cells from mice orally exposed to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> prior to intradermal BCG immunization (O-MA + ID-BCG) secreted IFN-γ at levels similar to that of mice treated with oral <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). These data confirm previous findings and show that while intradermal BCG induces a strong proinflammatory response in mice, the proinflammatory response to oral <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> exposure is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref009">9</xref>]. Moreover, mice presensitized to oral <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> and immunized with BCG responded like unimmunized mice receiving only oral <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic>. Thus, oral exposure to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> markedly suppressed the IFN-γ response to BCG restimulation.</p>

<title>Increased tolergenic immune profiles associated with oral EM exposure</title>
<p>Decreased IFN-γ in mice exposed to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> suggested that O-MA suppresses the Th1 response to the BCG vaccine. To further assess the Th1-suppressive effect of EM oral exposure on intradermal BCG immunization in mice, we also assessed differences in T cell production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 following restimulation with BCG. Interestingly, the only significant difference between ID-BCG and O-MA+ID-BCG mice was seen for IL-10. TNF-α was not detectable in any of the groups. Oral <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> exposure increased IL-10 levels in the spleen by nearly 2-fold with and without BCG vaccination, compared to BCG alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that is mainly secreted by regulatory T cells (Treg), which are critical for lymphocyte suppression and known mediators of oral tolerance. Furthermore, IL-10 is often increased in tolerogenic systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref022">22</xref>]. Therefore, this data suggested that a tolerance mechanism is involved in the immunosuppressive effects of oral <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> in response to subsequent intradermal BCG vaccination.</p>
<p>To further examine the mechanism of EM immunosuppression of BCG immunization, mice were chronically exposed to EM by two different exposure routes: oral (O-MA) and intradermal (ID-MA). The same exposure and dosing regimen used earlier was employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), with an additional group which received intradermal <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> exposure, followed by ID-BCG. Immune cells were assessed 6 weeks after initial <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> exposure. Mice exposed to O-MA versus ID-MA prior to ID-BCG had similar splenic T cell (CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>) and macrophage (CD11b) numbers. However, O-MA mice had 4-fold more splenic Treg (CD4<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup>) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Lung tissue showed similar trends, with Treg levels 2-fold higher in the O-MA group. In addition, pulmonary CD8<sup>+</sup> cells were lower in the O-MA group; however, this difference was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Cytokine analysis of the tissues showed significantly decreased IFN-γ levels in spleens of O-MA versus ID-MA mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005614.s001">S1B Fig</xref>) and no detectable IFN-γ in the lung. While differences in IL-10 secretion were not significant in either tissue, ID-MA treatment resulted in less IL-10 in the lung than O-MA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005614.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). These data suggest that oral <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> exposure generates a tolerogenic phenotype in mice and causes the immunosuppressive effects observed in BCG immunized mice.</p>

<p>In addition to generating tissue resident immunity, various research suggests that pulmonary immunization may be the only way to generate immunity in the airways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref037">37</xref>]. Concurrently, we inferred that systemic tolerance generated by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> would not be present in the airway. To test initial responses to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> exposure we compared IFN-γ production by T cells in response to restimulation with heat-killed BCG in the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic>-exposed, BCG-immunized groups (O-MA+ID-BCG, O-MA+Pul-BCG) compared to the intradermal-only BCG group (ID-BCG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Compared to those from the ID-BCG group, splenic T cells from the O-MA+ID-BCG and O-MA+Pul-BCG groups produced significantly less IFN-γ. However, in both the lung and airway, only T cells from the O-MA+ID-BCG group showed significantly reduced IFN-γ production compared to the ID-BCG control, whereas O-MA+Pul-BCG had similar IFN- γ levels to that of the ID-BCG group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). These data suggested that O-MA-mediated tolerance is not present in the airways.</p>
<p>We again assessed both IFN-γ and IL-10 levels in these groups at 4 weeks after BCG vaccination to determine whether BCG vaccination had changed initial immune responses to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> by this later time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). While there was no significant difference in IFN-γ secretion between the two groups, spleens of O-MA+ID-BCG treated mice secreted less IFN-γ than spleens of mice given ID-BCG alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, spleen). Furthermore in both the spleen and lung, restimulated cells from O-MA+Pul-BCG mice secreted the most IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g003">Fig 3</xref>). With respect to IL-10 secretion in the spleen, O-MA exposure in both BCG vaccination groups increased secretion levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g003">Fig 3F</xref>, spleen), however this did not reach statistical significance. Conversely, in the lung, IL-10 levels were increased in the O-MA+ID-BCG group but not in lungs from the O-MA+Pul-BCG or ID-BCG treatment mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g003">Fig 3F</xref>, lung).</p>

<p>To assess differences in tissue inflammation between <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic>-exposed and BCG-immunized mice following Mtb challenge, lungs and spleens were excised and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g006">Fig 6</xref>).

Pul-BCG and ID-BCG groups showed minimal inflammation, with inflammatory infiltrates making up 4% and 0.03% of the lung area, respectively. O-MA+ID-BCG and O-MA+Pul-BCG groups also had minimal inflammation; with lesions occupying less than 2% of the area of lung sections for each group.

<p>The BCG vaccine is given by the intradermal route in over 150 countries worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref038">38</xref>]. However the vaccine’s efficacy is impaired in areas where EM are endemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref005">5</xref>].

<p>Prior EM exposure has been shown to be detrimental to BCG protective efficacy in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref039">39</xref>]. Previously, two mechanisms have been proposed for the failure of BCG due to EM exposure, the blocking and the masking hypotheses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref040">40</xref>], which propose that BCG replication is blocked or BCG immunity is masked by EM, respectively. Here we show evidence for an alternate mechanistic hypothesis, BCG vaccine interference via oral tolerance, which may encompass both the blocking and masking hypotheses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref040">40</xref>]. Importantly, we presensitized mice via the oral route to mimic human ingestion of EM (without antibiotic clearance) similar to Flaherty and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref007">7</xref>], whereas other early studies used parenteral exposure with antibiotic clearance of the EM before vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref041">41</xref>]. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate oral tolerance as a mechanism of BCG vaccine failure.</p>
<p>We used a mouse model to investigate the mechanism of EM interference by exposing mice to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> (a common EM) via the oral route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref009">9</xref>]. Mice were then vaccinated intradermally with BCG. The immune response of mice, based on IFN-γ production by T cells following <italic>ex vivo</italic> BCG restimulation, was significantly decreased in mice exposed to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> prior to intradermal vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). This corroborates previous findings that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> exposure impairs the immune response to BCG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref039">39</xref>]. Interestingly, the masking hypothesis states that a naïve host produces a lower initial pro-inflammatory response to EM presensitization. It should be noted that this immune response can be cross-reactive against Mtb, but is not as strong as the immunity generated by BCG vaccination in a naïve host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref041">41</xref>]. After EM presensitization, individuals vaccinated with BCG cannot produce a pro-inflammatory response to BCG that ever surpasses the initial pro-inflammatory response to EM; thus, the immune response to EM masks the subsequent immune response generated against BCG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref041">41</xref>]. Although our data, as well as those of others, initially appeared to support the masking hypothesis, we further explored the mechanism of BCG vaccine interference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>We examined the cross-reactivity of T lymphocytes to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> and BCG by taking T cells from ID-BCG or O-MA exposed mice and restimulating with either antigen <italic>ex vivo</italic>. We observed identical IFN-γ responses in tissue-specific T lymphocyte populations from both exposure groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). This suggests that the immune cells cannot distinguish between the live BCG vaccine and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic>. Therefore, the EM immune response does not “mask” the BCG-specific response, but rather this immunosuppression is a consequence of cross-reactivity between the two mycobacterial species, wherein the host immune system cannot distinguish between <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> BCG.</p>
<p>Previously, both Flaherty et al. and Poyntz et al., showed reduced BCG efficacy associated with oral <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref007">7</xref>]. To determine if the immunosuppressive effect of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> depended on the route of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> exposure, mice were administered <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> chronically by either the oral or by the intradermal route. Mice exposed to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> by the oral route, but not by the intradermal route, had elevated Treg cells in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) and increased IL-10 secretion by both splenic and lung T cells in response to BCG restimulation at multiple timepoints after vaccination (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g001">1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g003">3F</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005614.s001">S1</xref>). Importantly, Treg cells and IL-10 are both mediators of oral tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref024">24</xref>]. This observation is also supported by both data generated in mouse models of EM exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref044">44</xref>], and some epidemiological data examining patients with EM infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref045">45</xref>]. These individuals present with increased T regulatory numbers, along with the associated cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref045">45</xref>]. This, coupled with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> colonization of the GI tract in mice exposed orally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), suggests that the immunosuppressive effects of EM are closely linked to the oral route of exposure.</p>
<p>Another mechanism suggested to explain BCG vaccine interference by EM is described by the blocking hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref006">6</xref>]. This hypothesis suggests that BCG is eliminated in hosts after vaccination due to prior EM immunity. This is detrimental because BCG is required to migrate to the lung and persist long enough to generate BCG-specific immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref036">36</xref>]. However, early animal experiments supporting this hypothesis did not utilize oral EM administration, the most common route of human exposure, thus oral tolerance was not observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref006">6</xref>]. Our study shows that the immunosuppression against BCG vaccination associated with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> is linked to the oral route of exposure. Only oral <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> exposure increased splenic and lung Treg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Furthermore, with respect to the blocking hypothesis, we show that BCG migrates minimally to the lung after intradermal immunization, regardless of prior EM exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Previous literature suggests that this may be due to a delay in migration associated with intradermal immunization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref046">46</xref>], however the result is that a robust local immune response to BCG is not generated in the lung. Contrarily, mice vaccinated by the pulmonary route had more BCG in the lung one week after immunization (6 weeks after initial <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> exposure) and thus produced a Th1 immune response. These data support our hypothesis that EM immunosuppression is an oral tolerance mechanism, and that the route of EM exposure and BCG immunization are both important (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Pulmonary BCG immunization is effective at protecting against Mtb in EM exposed hosts.</title>
<p>Chronic oral exposure to EM results in systemic tolerance against mycobacteria. This tolerance generates poor immunity in a subsequent intradermal BCG vaccination scenario, and could lead to variable vaccine efficacy. However, because systemic tolerance is not present in the airways of hosts, pulmonary immunization generates robust immunity and is protective against Mtb challenge.</p>

</fig>
<p>Our next step was to investigate whether EM-driven immunosuppression could be overcome by delivering the BCG vaccine by the pulmonary route. Horvath and colleagues demonstrated that the pulmonary airway is an isolated immune compartment which can only be effectively immunized against TB via the pulmonary route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref028">28</xref>]. According to these authors, parenteral vaccination is sufficient to generate immune cells in the systemic circulation and in the lung parenchyma; however, only intranasal immunization generates an adaptive immune response in the lung airway compartment. We hypothesized that the airway would be immunologically naïve to EM-generated systemic tolerance induced via a gut-mucosa-specific mechanism. As expected, mice vaccinated with BCG by the pulmonary route after oral <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> exposure had significantly higher Th1 responses in the airway, as demonstrated by the large number of T-lymphocytes (both helper and cytotoxic), effector memory cells, and macrophages present in BALF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g004">Fig 4</xref>; BALF panel), compared to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic>-exposed mice subsequently vaccinated intradermally with BCG. Most importantly, we showed that oral EM exposure impairs the efficacy of intradermal, but not pulmonary, BCG vaccination against subsequent aerosol Mtb challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005614.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). These results show that pulmonary BCG immunization is effective at protecting against Mtb, even in EM-exposed individuals.</p>
<p>To determine the broader implications of these studies, future experiments should test the ability of multiple strains of orally administered EM to generate tolerance. It has been shown that EM exposure in humans is variable on both the species and dosing level, with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic>, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>fortuitum</italic>, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>parafortuitum</italic>, <italic>M diernhoferi</italic>, and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>phlei</italic> all being present in variable amounts in the human sputum samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref004">4</xref>]. Likewise, similar studies in small animal models have previously shown that different species and strains of EM cause variations in the immunosuppressive effects seen against intradermal BCG vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref009">9</xref>]. Also, studies done previously show little to no protection provided by parenteral <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> alone against Mtb challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref041">41</xref>]. Similarly, Flaherty and colleagues showed that oral <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> alone resulted in Mtb burden similar to that seen in naïve control mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref007">7</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to investigate how tolerance against these different EM might affect Mtb infection as well as BCG immunization.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many of the details of this tolerance mechanism still remain unknown. Does contiguous oral EM exposure before and after BCG vaccination still result in tolerance? We and others have shown how oral and parenteral EM presensitization prior to vaccination affects BCG protective efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref039">39</xref>]. Likewise, others have examined the effects of oral and parenteral EM sensitization after BCG vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref007">7</xref>]. It is more likely that EM exposure is consistently present throughout the life of these individuals. Most countries vaccinate with BCG in the first few years of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref038">38</xref>]. However many would argue that this is the most critical time period for GI flora generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref048">48</xref>]. Infants would be extremely vulnerable to EM colonization, and may even become sensitized to the EM on their mother’s skin and in her breast milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref049">49</xref>]. In this case, one might expect that after vaccination any BCG-specific immunity generated would predictably wane as a result of continuous tolerance against EM. Thus, the question of how and when exposure happens remains critical to understanding how BCG vaccine immunosuppression takes place in humans.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is important to examine how pulmonary EM exposure affects immunity in the airway. The airways tend to be a reactive tissue and rarely tolerogenic. It may be that EM exposure is beneficial in the airway providing a boost to BCG established immunity. Research published in 1984 by Orme and Collins showed that a single pulmonary exposure of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> and other EM conferred significant TB resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref050">50</xref>]. While this seems to suggest that pulmonary EM exposure was not immunosuppressive in nature, this study should be repeated with a chronic exposure experimental design to ensure that no tolerance is generated. Chronic EM exposure by the pulmonary route could prove technically challenging to study due to mucociliary clearance from the airways and subsequent ingestion of the EM. Regardless of the difficulties, these questions must be answered to completely understand the mechanisms behind the failures and successes of prospective TB vaccines currently in clinical trials.</p>
<p>This work helps us to understand the limitations of the current BCG vaccine and the potential for failure of any new vaccine administered by the parenteral route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref051">51</xref>]. If oral tolerance interferes with the intradermal BCG vaccine in humans, then it has major implications for vaccines against TB and other infectious diseases. Since EM are ubiquitous soil and water residents, little can be done to avoid human exposure. Moreover, the effects of oral tolerance are not tissue-specific. Tolerance is generated in the GI tract, and tolerogenic T cells migrate throughout the body via the circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005614.ref024">24</xref>]. This may result in the failure of any new intradermal TB vaccine that uses mycobacterial antigens. We have demonstrated that pulmonary immunization will circumvent EM-generated tolerance and provide protective immunity against Mtb. Importantly, this immunity is evident in the airways, the tissue compartment where the host first encounters this important human pathogen.</p>
