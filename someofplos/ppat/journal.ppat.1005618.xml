<abstract>
<p>Protein export is central for the survival and virulence of intracellular <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> blood stage parasites. To reach the host cell, exported proteins cross the parasite plasma membrane (PPM) and the parasite-enclosing parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM), a process that requires unfolding, suggestive of protein translocation. Components of a proposed translocon at the PVM termed PTEX are essential in this phase of export but translocation activity has not been shown for the complex and questions have been raised about its proposed membrane pore component EXP2 for which no functional data is available in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>. It is also unclear how PTEX mediates trafficking of both, soluble as well as transmembrane proteins. Taking advantage of conditionally foldable domains, we here dissected the translocation events in the parasite periphery, showing that two successive translocation steps are needed for the export of transmembrane proteins, one at the PPM and one at the PVM. Our data provide evidence that, depending on the length of the C-terminus of the exported substrate, these steps occur by transient interaction of the PPM and PVM translocon, similar to the situation for protein transport across the mitochondrial membranes. Remarkably, we obtained constructs of exported proteins that remained arrested in the process of being translocated across the PVM. This clogged the translocation pore, prevented the export of all types of exported proteins and, as a result, inhibited parasite growth. The substrates stuck in translocation were found in a complex with the proposed PTEX membrane pore component EXP2, suggesting a role of this protein in translocation. These data for the first time provide evidence for EXP2 to be part of a translocating entity, suggesting that PTEX has translocation activity and provide a mechanistic framework for the transport of soluble as well as transmembrane proteins from the parasite boundary into the host cell.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> parasites, the deadliest agent of human malaria, develop within erythrocytes where they are surrounded by a parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM). To ensure intracellular survival, the parasite exports a large repertoire of proteins into the host cell. Exported proteins require unfolding for trafficking across the membrane boundaries separating the parasite from the erythrocyte, typical for transport by protein translocating membrane channels. Here, we dissected the sequence of translocation events at the parasite boundary using substrates that can be conditionally arrested at translocation steps. We for the first time obtained exported proteins arrested in the process of being translocated across the PVM. This jammed the translocons for all other types of exported proteins and inhibited parasite growth. The constructs stuck in translocation were in a complex with EXP2, a component of a complex known to be essential for protein export that is termed PTEX. Our work links the need for unfolding and the function of this complex in export, giving experimental evidence that PTEX indeed is a translocon. Conditionally unfoldable domains have been instrumental in unravelling transport processes across membranes and here resolve the transport steps the different kinds of exported proteins require to reach the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>-infected host cell.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Five species of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites cause human malaria. Of these <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> is responsible for the majority of the over 500’000 annually recorded malaria deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref001">1</xref>]. The pathology of malaria is caused by the continuous propagation of the parasite within red blood cells (RBCs). In this phase <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> parasites modify extensively the host RBC by exporting hundreds of different proteins into the infected cell. These modifications include host cell surface changes that cause the sequestration of infected RBCs (iRBCs) in the vasculature, a phenomenon considered to be a major contributor to parasite virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref002">2</xref>]. Other changes are required for nutrient acquisition, to adjust RBC rigidity and to facilitate protein trafficking in the host cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref003">3</xref>]. Protein export is therefore central for blood stage development and malaria pathology.</p>
<p>Two general types of exported proteins have been described in malaria parasites. The first group contains a five amino acid motif termed Plasmodium export element (PEXEL) or host targeting signal (HT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref006">6</xref>]. The second group, termed PEXEL negative exported proteins (PNEPs), is defined by the absence of a PEXEL/HT signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref008">8</xref>]. Both groups comprise soluble and transmembrane (TM) proteins. Despite the distinction into PNEPs and PEXEL proteins, both types of proteins appear to share a similar export domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref009">9</xref>] and at least at one point during their export, the same trafficking factors are involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Many aspects of the pathways exported proteins use to reach the host RBC are still unclear. The parasite replicates in a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) formed by a PV membrane (PVM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref012">12</xref>]. Exported proteins therefore have to cross two membranes, the parasite plasma membrane (PPM) and the PVM. A previously postulated protein translocation machine termed ‘Plasmodium translocon of exported proteins’ (PTEX) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref013">13</xref>], is involved in this export step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref011">11</xref>]. Of the 5 known PTEX components, heat shock protein 101 (HSP101), and a parasite-specific protein termed PTEX150 are essential for protein export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref011">11</xref>]. Much less clear is the role of the suspected PTEX membrane pore component EXP2 for which no functional data are available in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>. Recent work in the apicomplexan <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> showed that PfEXP2 was able to functionally replace a protein implicated in the solute pore activity at the PVM of this parasite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref014">14</xref>]. This raised the possibility that PfEXP2 may have an additional or differing role than in protein export, which would also explain the finding that EXP2, but not HSP101, is expressed in liver stage parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Although some of its components are clearly essential for protein export, PTEX is still a translocon in concept, as translocation activity has so far not been shown and a function upstream of membrane translocation would also satisfy the findings so far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref017">17</xref>]. It is also puzzling that it promotes trafficking of both TM and soluble proteins. PTEX is situated on the luminal face of the PVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref013">13</xref>]. While soluble proteins directly reach PTEX after release by transport vesicles into the PV, TM proteins embedded in the transport vesicle membrane will end up integral to the parasite plasma membrane (PPM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref018">18</xref>]. There is evidence that these proteins are then extracted out of the PPM in an unfolding dependent step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref009">9</xref>], but the trafficking events at the PPM, PV and PVM remain obscure (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref017">17</xref>]).</p>
<p>Substrates fused to conditionally foldable domains have been used to study translocation processes in various organelles and systems, for instance in mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref020">20</xref>]. A widely used tool for such studies is mouse dihydrofolate reductase (mDHFR), a protein that can be stabilized in its folding upon addition of a small ligand such as WR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref019">19</xref>]. If mDHFR is fused to a translocation substrate, addition of the ligand will render the substrate translocation incompetent. The resulting defect in transport is indicative of membrane translocation and excludes vesicular trafficking for the transport step analyzed. This system has previously been used in malaria parasites to show that soluble truncated PEXEL reporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref021">21</xref>], TM PNEPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref009">9</xref>] and soluble PNEPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref007">7</xref>], require unfolding to reach the host cell. However, while clearly indicative of translocation, these experiments did not link this activity with the proposed translocon PTEX.</p>
<p>Here we resolve the translocation steps in the parasite periphery, demonstrating that two unfolding events are required for TM proteins to reach the host cell. Further we show that all known types of exported proteins converge at the second translocation step at the PVM and that inducibly jamming this pore arrests general protein export and parasite development. Crucially, we for the first time obtained stable translocation intermediates and use this to provide evidence that links EXP2 with the translocating complex, suggesting that PTEX has translocation activity.</p>

<title>Dissection of unfolding events of exported TM proteins at the parasite periphery indicates a two-step process</title>
<p>The previously used exported TM protein REX2 fused with mDHFR accumulated at the PPM after addition of WR, leading to an arrest at the first step when exported TM proteins leave the parasite cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref009">9</xref>]. In agreement with previous data for a soluble mDHFR fused PEXEL reporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref021">21</xref>], this arrest was not reversible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). This precluded the use of this system to study the subsequent transport steps by simply removing WR. We therefore replaced mDHFR with the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), a protein that forms a translocation incompetent folded structure in oxidising but not reducing environments based on 3 disulfide bonds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref020">20</xref>]. The rational was that BPTI would only form a folded structure once the construct reached the PV, which is thought to be an oxidising environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref023">23</xref>]. In contrast, extraction out of the PPM, when BPTI still faces the reducing cytoplasmic side of the PPM, would not be affected (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s001">S1B Fig</xref> for schematic).</p>
<p>To first test whether the PV indeed is an oxidative environment where BPTI can fold into a translocation incompetent state and to assess whether PVM translocation was sensitive to this domain, we fused BPTI to REX3, a soluble exported protein that is directly delivered from the secretory pathway into the PV. Export of REX3 was indeed sensitive to BPTI, as evident by a clear, although only partial, accumulation of the construct in the parasite periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In contrast, a REX3 control construct fused with a mutated BPTI [unable to form the stabilising disulfide bridges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref024">24</xref>]], did not show an accumulation in the parasite periphery but was fully exported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), excluding oxidation unrelated trafficking defects. This suggested that the system is suitable to obtain translocation incompetent reporters in the PV and we next fused BPTI to the TM PNEP REX2. The resulting construct (REX2-BPTI-GFP) showed a strong accumulation in the parasite periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), suggestive of a translocation-dependent step of TM proteins after passing the PPM. This block was not absolute, as additional fluorescence was detected in the Maurer's clefts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). A control construct with a mutated BPTI was fully exported to the Maurer's clefts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), again excluding oxidation unrelated trafficking defects. Protease protection assays (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g001">Fig 1E</xref> for schematic) with REX2-BPTI-GFP indicated that the REX2-BPTI-GFP molecules were in the PV in their entireness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g001">Fig 1F</xref>) and hence had completed the extraction out of the PPM. These results are consistent with an oxidation state-dependent arrest in export in the PV due to fusion with BPTI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g001">Fig 1G</xref>) and indicated that after PPM extraction exported TM proteins undergo a second unfolding-dependent translocation at the PVM.</p>

<title>The redox sensitive folding domain is only effective if close to the TM</title>
<p>Unexpectedly, when we analysed two further TM PNEPs fused to BPTI (SBP1-BPTI-GFP and MAHRP1-BPTI-GFP), these constructs showed no accumulation in the parasite periphery but were efficiently exported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g001">Fig 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). The most noticeable difference between these PNEPs and REX2 is their larger size. We reasoned that protein length might influence whether BPTI can fold in an intermediate step in the PV. To test this idea, we shortened the N- or C-terminus of SBP1 in SBP1-BPTI-GFP by inserting deletions previously reported not to affect export of this protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref025">25</xref>]. The protein with the shortened N-terminus (SBP1ΔN-BPTI-GFP) was not blocked in export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g001">Fig 1I</xref>). In contrast, deletion of most of the C-terminus (SBP1ΔCBPTI-GFP) resulted in a strong block in the parasite periphery with some left over export to the Maurer's clefts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g001">Fig 1J</xref>), comparable to the result with REX2-BPTI-GFP. This was not due to a general export defect introduced by the C-terminal deletion but due to folding of BPTI, as a version of SBP1ΔC-BPTI-GFP with the mutated BPTI was exported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g001">Fig 1K</xref>).</p>
<p>These results suggested that the length of the C-terminus, specifically the region between the TM and the blocking domain, decides whether BPTI has the chance to fold in the PV and the protein gets blocked in further export. To confirm this and exclude an SBP1-specific effect, we extended the C-terminus in REX2-BPTI-GFP by inserting 3 consecutive REX2 C-termini (REX2+3C-BPTI-GFP). This turned REX2 into a protein unaffected by BPTI as this construct was fully exported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g001">Fig 1L</xref>). This lends support for a scenario where translocation substrates with a large distance between the TM and the blocking domain already engage the PVM translocon while still being extracted out of the PPM which would prevent release into the PV and oxidation-state dependent folding of BPTI. In contrast, such a direct ‘hand over’ may not be possible for proteins with a short C-terminus where BPTI would already become exposed to the oxidising milieu of the PV to form the folding stabilising disulfide bonds before the protein can get access to the PVM translocon (see model <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s001">S1D and S1E Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Certain mDHFR fusions jam the translocon for other exported proteins, leading to a WR-dependent co-block</title>
<p>Prompted by the differences seen with different PNEP-BPTI constructs, we fused SBP1 and MAHRP1 with mDHFR to confirm that they at all require unfolding to pass from the parasite into the host cell. Analogous to REX2-mDHFR-GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref009">9</xref>], these constructs were efficiently exported to the Maurer's clefts and conditionally blocked in the parasite periphery in the presence of the ligand WR that prevents unfolding of the appended mDHFR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). This indicated translocation as the mode of export for these TM PNEPs, similar to REX2. However, compared to REX2-mDHFR-GFP ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref009">9</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), there were three notable differences in these constructs after arresting export with WR: firstly, the arrest phenotype was leaky in many cells, i.e. besides the prominent peripheral stain, there was also a detectable signal at the Maurer's clefts (arrowheads <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Secondly, the fluorescence pattern in the parasite periphery was unusual as it included small, mobile, worm-like protrusions reaching into the host cell (arrows <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Thirdly and most remarkably, the internal control (co-expressed REX2mCherry) also showed a WR-dependent block in export even though it lacked an mDHFR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). REX2 fusion with an inverted order of GFP and mDHFR (REX2-GFP-mDHFR, generated in a failed attempt to obtain a reversible mDHFR-based block), showed a similar phenotype to SBP1 and MAHRP1 and differed from REX2-mDHFR-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Hence, the difference observed was not specific for the exported protein used.</p>

<p>These data indicated that in contrast to REX2-mDHFR-GFP, the export-blocked version of these constructs remained arrested in a translocon that also trafficks REX2mCherry and that arresting these constructs in the process of translocation thereby prevented the passage of REX2mCherry. This effect was clearly caused by the mDHFR fusion protein, as in a subpopulation of cells not expressing the mDHFR construct, REX2mCherry was correctly trafficked to the Maurer's clefts in the presence of WR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). In contrast, REX2mCherry was always arrested in parasites harbouring the GFP-tagged mDHFR fusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). We termed this effect a 'co-block' as it was caused by a protein fused with mDHFR that was arrested as a stable intermediate in the translocon and prevented passage of the fully translocation competent mCherry control.</p>
<p>The export-arrested form of REX2-mDHFR-GFP, which does not cause a co-block, was previously found to be located at the PPM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref009">9</xref>]. We investigated the site of arrest for the co-blocking SBP1-mDHFR-GFP. Initial protease protection experiments indicated that the protein is neither in the PPM nor PVM but in the PV. This was based on the finding that after permeabilisation of the PVM with saponin, addition of protease K digested SBP1-mDHFR-GFP down to its protease resistant core (mDHFR-GFP) which is only possible if this protein is freely accessible in the PV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). However, due to the proportionally small size difference of this core compared to the protected fragment (if the protein were inserted up to the blocking domain into the PPM), we increased the size of the potential protected fragment by appending a protease sensitive domain [a mutated PH domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref026">26</xref>]] to the C-terminus of the construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Similar to SBP1-mDHFR-GFP this construct (SBP1-mDHFR-GFP-PH<sup>mut</sup>) was fully exported and conditionally arrested in the parasite periphery after addition of WR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Protease protection assays showed that in the blocked state the C-terminal PH part was also fully protease accessible in the PV, indicating that the SBP1-mDHFR-GFP-PH<sup>mut</sup> molecules had entirely passed the PPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Hence, the site of block differed from that of REX2-mDHFR-GFP.</p>
<p>The co-blocked REX2-mCherry control was also found in the PV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). The presence of the co-blocked molecules in the PV indicated that the site of arrest of the co-blocking construct is the PVM and that PPM extraction is not prevented by clogging the PVM translocons. This further supports a two-step model of translocation for TM proteins.</p>

<title>All types of exported proteins are affected by the co-block, indicating that they pass through a single type of pore</title>
<p>Next we tested whether other kinds of exported proteins besides REX2mCherry were co-blocked by PNEP mDHFR-fusions arrested in translocation. To this end we generated doubly transfected parasites as well as parasites expressing two individual proteins from the same open reading frame using a skip peptide [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref028">28</xref>], see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s003">S3 Fig</xref> for demonstration of suitability of this approach] to co-express SBP1-mDHFR-GFP with mCherry tagged members of each of the different known groups of exported proteins. The co-expressed proteins included the soluble PEXEL proteins REX3 and KAHRP, the soluble PNEP MSRP6, and the TM PEXEL protein STEVOR. In each case the co-expressed mCherry fusion protein was hindered in export if SBP1-mDHFR-GFP trafficking was arrested with WR in the translocon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g003">Fig 3A–3D</xref>). Similarly, REX2-GFP-mDHFR (the domain order that in contrast to REX2-mDHFR-GFP led to a co-block of REX2mCherry) caused a co-block of the PEXEL protein KAHRP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). These data were also confirmed with endogenous exported proteins detected by IFA using specific antisera: a WR-dependent co-block of the late expressed MSRP6 and KAHRP was seen in SBP1-mDHFR-GFP expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). In contrast, proteins expressed earlier in the cycle (before SBP1-mDHFR-GFP under the <italic>crt</italic> promoter was expressed), were unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). Taken together, these data show that TM PNEPs arrested during translocation hinder the passage of all known types of exported proteins, indicating that a single kind of protein conducting pore is used by all exported proteins to cross the PVM.</p>

<title>PEXEL TM proteins require unfolding for export and PEXEL proteins can also cause a co-block</title>
<p>So far it was not tested whether PEXEL TM proteins also require unfolding for export. Our data indirectly indicated that they require translocation, as they were co-blocked by arrested mDHFR fusions, suggesting passage through the same pore. A shared pathway was also indicated by their sensitivity to inactivation of PTEX components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref011">11</xref>].

<p>Next we tested whether it is possible to obtain arrested translocation intermediates of PEXEL proteins that induce a co-block. To this end we generated double transfectants expressing either REX3-mDHFR-GFP or PTP1-mDHFR-GFP together with the TM PNEP REX2mCherry. In the case of REX3-mDHFR-GFP, addition of WR caused a co-block of REX2mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). These results show that other types of proteins than TM PNEPs can induce a co-block. As REX3 is directly released into the PV, the PVM translocon has to be the site where the translocation intermediates are arrested and cause the co-block, consistent with the data obtained with SBP1-mDHFR-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to the result with REX3-mDHFR-GFP, no co-block was observed with PTP1-mDHFR-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). It is noteworthy that PTP1-mDHFR-GFP in WR treated parasites did not show worm-like protrusions extending from the PVM, similar to REX2-mDHFR-GFP which is also not co-blocking.</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>The capacity to induce a co-block and the sensitivity of export to fusion with BPTI depends on similar properties</title>
<p>Of the constructs tested so far, those with the capacity to cause a co-block were also insensitive to fusion with BPTI (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g002">2</xref>). Prompted by this correlation, we tested whether the capacity to induce a co-block (as judged by co-expression with REX2mCherry) also depended on the length of region between the TM and the blocking domain. Indeed, extension of this region in REX2 (REX2+3C-mDHFR-GFP) turned this protein into a co-blocker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) whereas shortening this region in SBP1 (SBP1ΔCmDHFR-GFP) changed it into a non-co-blocking protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Next we tested whether this was the reason for the failure of PTP1-mDHFR-GFP to induce a co-block. PTP1 has a short C-terminus of 27 amino acids. Extension of the PTP1 C-terminus in this construct (PTP1-mDHFR+3C-GFP) turned this protein into a co-blocker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Similar to REX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g001">Fig 1</xref>), export of PTP1 was sensitive to BPTI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), whereas the version with the extended C-terminus (PTP1-BPTI+3C-GFP) again was insensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g005">Fig 5E</xref>).</p>

<title>A pan-export block hampers <italic>in vitro</italic> parasite growth</title>
<p>The jammed translocon prevented export of all so far tested exported proteins and provided the opportunity to apply an inducible pan-export block. To assess the effect of generally blocking protein export on parasite growth, we generated an integration parasite line that expresses SBP1 fused to mDHFR-GFP from the endogenous locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s006">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>).

<title>Substrates stuck in translocation are in a complex with the PTEX component EXP2</title>
<p>Translocation activity has so far not been demonstrated for PTEX and the functional role of the proposed pore component EXP2 is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref014">14</xref>]. We took advantage of our constructs stuck in translocation to determine whether this arrest involves the proposed translocation pore EXP2 using immunoprecipitations (IP). To this end we generated a cell line expressing 3xHA tagged EXP-2 from the endogenous locus (EXP2-3xHA<sup>endo</sup>) and further transfected it with SBP1-mDHFR-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>). As expected, treatment with WR led to an arrest of export of SBP1-mDHFR-GFP in the parasite periphery where it co-localised with EXP2-3xHA by IFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), as previously shown for the PEXEL leader of GBP fused to mDHFR-GFP, a construct that also co-localised with EXP2 when arrested in export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref034">34</xref>].</p>

<p>As to our knowledge PTEX was never defined using IP with EXP2-HA, we first wished to confirm that EXP2-3xHA indeed pulls down other PTEX components. IP using anti HA-beads with EXP2-3xHA<sup>endo</sup> parasites treated with the protein crosslinker DSP followed by mass spectrometry analysis of the eluates revealed the PTEX components PTEX150, HSP101, and PTEX88 as well as several other proteins that may include further PTEX interaction partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g007">Fig 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s011">S3 Table</xref>). Hence, EXP2-HA was part of the expected PTEX complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref013">13</xref>]. Next we IPed EXP2-3xHA from parasites that expressed SBP1-mDHFR-GFP in presence of WR (to arrest SBP1-mDHFR-GFP in the translocon) and absence of WR (control). While EXP2-3xHA co-IPed SBP1-mDHFR-GFP when this protein was stuck in translocation, this was not the case in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g007">Fig 7D</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g007">Fig 7F</xref> for quantification of enrichment). SERA5, a soluble molecule of the PV, to control for non-specific interactions, was not co-IPed. No DSP was used for these experiments but similar results were obtained when DSP treated parasites were used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). This indicated that substrates arrested during translocation are in a complex with EXP2.</p>
<p>To confirm these findings we carried out the reciprocal experiment and tested whether the substrate (SBP1-mDHFR-GFP) arrested in the translocon co-IPed the proposed pore component EXP2-3xHA. EXP2-3xHA was indeed enriched after IP of translocon-arrested SBP1-mDHFR-GFP if compared to control parasites without WR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). As SBP1-mDHFR-GFP also showed some enrichment in WR+ over control after the IP (potentially due to greater stability of the folding stabilised molecule), we quantified the band intensities which showed that this was not significant. In contrast the enrichment of the co-IPed EXP2-3xHA was significant (n = 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). Taken together these results indicate that SBP1-mDHFR-GFP stuck in translocation is found in a complex with EXP2. In order to confirm this with a second co-block inducing protein, we repeated the anti-HA IP with EXP2-3xHA<sup>endo</sup> parasites expressing REX2-GFP-mDHFR. Again this substrate was detected in the WR+ eluate but not in the control, demonstrating co-purification with EXP2-HA when this substrate was arrested during translocation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s007">S7D Fig</xref>). In contrast, EXP2-3xHA<sup>endo</sup> parasites expressing REX2-mDHFR-GFP (which is not co-blocking and arrests at the PPM extraction step preceding PTEX), did not co-IP this protein in WR-treated parasites compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g007">Fig 7G</xref>). Hence, only the second of the two consecutive unfolding dependent events involves EXP2.</p>
<p>A further candidate of the PTEX components that might interact with the arrested substrate is HSP101, the ATPase that may unfold the substrate. To test whether this is the case or not, we generated a cell line expressing 3HA-tagged HSP101 from the endogenous locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s007">S7E and S7F Fig</xref>) and co-transfected a construct expressing SBP1-mDHFR-GFP. Unlike EXP2-3xHA, HSP101-3xHA did not pull down the substrate after anti-HA IP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s007">S7G Fig</xref>). Whilst this could indicate a disassociation of HSP101 from PTEX when substrates are arrested in the translocon, some HSP101 was still interacting with EXP2 in the substrate-arrested state as judged by its presence in the EXP2-3xHA IPed fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Hence, whilst some HSP101 still appears to be part of the complex containing the arrested substrate, it does not seem to be in direct contact with the substrate.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we for the first time obtained intermediates of exported proteins inducibly and stably arrested during translocation into the host cell. Intriguingly, these translocation intermediates prevented the transport of all known types of exported proteins, demonstrating that the actual translocation is a point of convergence for all exported proteins and a single kind of protein-conducting channel mediates export. Our data further support a two-step translocation process for exported TM proteins which are first extracted out of the PPM and then translocated into the host cell in a second unfolding-dependent process at the PVM.</p>
<p>Blocking translocation of all exported proteins across the PVM made possible to inhibit general protein export and strongly reduced parasite growth. Similarly to the phenotype observed when HSP101 and PTEX150 were knocked down [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref011">11</xref>], we observed slowed parasite development and an accumulation of young trophozoite stage parasites, although the growth arrest was not absolute. Crucially, our IP data now link the proposed PTEX pore component EXP2 with the entity carrying out the translocation step, fitting with the site of block and the proposed function of PTEX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref013">13</xref>]. Our substrate was arrested in the process of being translocated by preventing unfolding of its C-terminal fusion part. The fact that other proteins could then not pass the PVM clearly shows that the arrested substrate remained in the translocon, likely partly inserted into the membrane channel. Hence, our data support the idea that EXP2 is part of the translocation pore and that PTEX has translocation activity, although it cannot fully exclude a different role of EXP2 in the complex, especially as the link between substrate and EXP2 may also be indirect. However, if there is an indirect link, it does not seem to be via HSP101, as we failed to detect an interaction of arrested substrate with this protein. It should also be noted that we cannot formally rule out that EXP2 at the same time also interacts with a complex other than PTEX that in actual fact carries out the translocation in which case PTEX would have a different, translocon-proximal essential function in export. Finally it is noteworthy that in contrast to the co-blocking SBP1-mDHFR-GFP and REX2-GFP-mDHFR no interaction was detected with export blocked REX2-mDHFR-GFP, a construct that is not co-blocking and arrests at the PPM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref009">9</xref>], demonstrating the specificity of the IP results.</p>
<p>Recent data highlighted the possibility of an alternative or dual role of EXP2 as part of a solute transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref016">16</xref>] both of which would be congruent with recent findings indicating that EXP2 is important for the growth of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref015">15</xref>]. Our data points to a role in protein export for EXP2 but cannot exclude a dual role. In this respect it is noteworthy that our IP data identified further potential interaction partners of EXP2 and it will be interesting to determine whether these constitute further components of PTEX, interaction partners that (together with EXP2) form a second type of pore conducting solutes or are simply proteins abundant in the PV crosslinked to PTEX by chance.</p>
<p>Two findings indicate that fitting with the location for PTEX, the PVM is the site where the co-block inducing translocation intermediates are arrested. Firstly, a soluble PEXEL protein (a type of protein directly released into the PV that requires translocation at the PVM but not the PPM), also induced a co-block. Secondly, exported TM proteins accumulated in the PV when they were co-blocked, indicating that their extraction out of the PPM was not affected. It should be noted that also the co-blocking construct itself will be co-blocked when all translocation sites are clogged and it can be assumed that this population of the construct by far exceeds the population stuck in translocons.</p>
<p>Our data provide mechanistic insights into the translocations of TM proteins at the PPM and the PVM. The importance of the distance between the blocking domain and the TM (henceforth named spacer) for (i) sensitivity to fusion with BPTI and (ii) the co-blocking capacity of a construct is particularly intriguing. mDHFR fusions with a short spacer were arrested in the PPM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref009">9</xref>] and were not co-blocking whereas mDHFR fusions with a long spacer were arrested in PTEX at the PVM, causing a co-block. While other scenario can also be envisaged, we favor two, non-mutually exclusive, possibilities why only proteins with a long but not a short spacer reach the PVM translocon and prevent the export of other proteins. As not the total length from the N-terminus to the blocking domain but specifically the distance between blocking domain and TM domain was important, the TM domain must play a role in this effect. The first possibility is that the TM domain is part of the recognition signal that has to emerge far enough out of the PPM extractor to become available for engagement with PTEX, leading to a transient interaction and hand-over of the substrate. This idea is supported by the fact that the type of TM region is one critical determinant for a protein to be exported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref035">35</xref>]. The second possibility is that a short spacer keeps the TM domain in the PPM extractor close to the membrane milieu which could favor lateral release into the membrane if extraction is blocked.</p>
<p>The BPTI results also support the hand-over model, as in proteins with long spacers, BPTI is not exposed to the oxidizing environment of the PV and cannot fold, suggesting that the polypeptide chain is passed from the PPM extractor directly through PTEX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005618.s001">S1D and S1E Fig</xref>). Taken together the different properties of mDHFR and BPTI constructs indicate that TM proteins with a short C-terminus have a brief intermediate in the PV, similar to soluble proteins, and that TM proteins with a long C-terminus cause a transient interaction of the PPM and PVM protein conducting machines while being translocated into the host cell. This is similar to the situation in mitochondria where the translocators of the outer and inner membrane transiently interact during substrate transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref036">36</xref>]. However, this does not appear to be mandatory in the parasite, as proteins with a short spacer were not directly handed over. From our experiments it can be assumed that a spacer as short as 99 amino acids (C-terminus of SBP1) but longer than 34 amino acids (C-terminus of REX2) enables the TM of the substrate to emerge sufficiently from the PPM to engage PTEX at the PVM and to induce a direct hand over without intermittent release into the PV. Finally, other models for the observed phenotypes and for the translocations at the PPM and PVM may also be possible and it will be interesting to see how future work conforms with the here favored scenario.</p>
<p>It is interesting that mDHFR fused export substrates only block the passage of other proteins when arrested in PTEX but not in the PPM extractor. The lack of a co-block at the PPM may be due to the mechanism of how the PPM extractor receives proteins and its resulting architecture. As opposed to PTEX which obtains proteins from the PV, the TM substrates (arriving from a brefeldin A sensitive secretory pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref018">18</xref>]) are already integral to the PPM and the extractor needs the ability to receive substrates laterally. This might be a reversible process, leading to disassociation of the substrate back into the membrane if its export is blocked and hence frees the extractor for other substrates. It should also be noted that blocking translocation generally requires a high saturation with arrested substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref037">37</xref>]. A small proportion of free extractors may therefore already be sufficient to maintain export of other proteins.</p>
<p>The situation for the transport of exported TM proteins at the parasite periphery resembles that in certain plastids where the outer most membrane receives substrates in integral form from the Golgi after which they are translocated across the inner membranes, hence requiring extraction out of the first membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref039">39</xref>]. How this extraction is achieved in these plastids is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref040">40</xref>] but the ERAD pathway in the ER membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref041">41</xref>] and the Asi complex in the nuclear inner membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref043">43</xref>] clearly demonstrate that a dislocation of membrane embedded proteins is possible. In absence of data on the nature of the PPM extractor, multiple configurations for the translocation set-up at the PPM and PVM can be envisaged (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref017">17</xref>]). In one possible scenario, the dislocation of TM proteins from the PPM is aided by PTEX, which is especially plausible for the substrates that are handed over to PTEX at the PVM while portions of the molecule are still being extracted out of the PPM. This is also supported by the capacity of HSP101 to disassociate from PTEX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005618.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Many exported proteins, including the major virulence factor PfEMP1, contain TMs, and the identification of the PPM extractor will be crucial to understand how the export of these proteins is achieved. The translocation machineries in the malaria parasite PPM and PVM may have similar capacities to those in other systems such as the mitochondrial membranes that are remarkably versatile in regards to the types of substrates accepted and the destiny of delivery. Stable translocation intermediates will be essential to further unravel these mechanisms in malaria parasites.</p>

<p>TCA Protein pellets were solubilized in lysis buffer (6 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 10 mM HEPES pH 8.0) by sonication for 10 min at 4°C. Proteins were reduced with 10 mM DTT for 10 min at room temperature and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide for 20 min in the dark. Proteins were digested with 0.5 μg LysC (Wako) for 3h at room temperature.

Precursor and fragment ion mass tolerances were set to 15 ppm for precursors and 0.03 Da for fragment ions.

<title>Irreversibility of export arrest of mDHFR fusion proteins and differing outcome of fusion with BPTI.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative IFA images of parasites expressing REX2-mDHFRmyc (constructs shown schematically above image panels) grown with (+WR) or without (control) WR and 5 h after removal of WR. A construct without GFP was chosen as this protein can after folding itself block translocation, which excludes this possibility as a reason for the irreversibility of the block. The PVM was co-stained using an antibody against ETRAMP5 (α-Etr5). The low amounts of signal detected at the Maurer’s clefts 5 h after removal of WR likely represents newly synthesized protein. (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic of the rational for using BPTI fusions of exported TM proteins to overcome the first translocation at the PPM and achieve arrest of export at the second translocation based on redox dependent folding of BPTI in the oxidizing environment of the PV. Features in the schematic are as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005618.g001">Fig 1E</xref>. (<bold>C</bold>) Representative live fluorescence images of the cell line expressing MAHRP1-BPTI-GFP (schematic of the construct shown above the panel). DIC, differential interference contrast. Size bars: 5 μm. (<bold>D-E</bold>) Model for the translocation of TM proteins between the PPM and PVM. Extraction out of the PPM is not hindered, as BPTI is unfolded in the reducing cytoplasm of the parasite (<bold>D-E</bold>, left). In proteins with a short C-terminus (<bold>D</bold>) fusion with BPTI results in a short distance between the TM and this domain. The TM then only reaches the PVM translocon once BPTI already emerged into the PV and its disulfide bridges can form in this oxidizing environment (middle panel). Further translocation across the PVM is then blocked (right). In contrast, in proteins with a long C-terminus (<bold>E</bold>), the distance between the TM and BPTI is long enough for the TM to reach the PVM translocon while BPTI is still unfolded in the parasite’s cytoplasm (<bold>E</bold>, middle). Concomitant extraction at the PPM and translocation at the PVM then leads to direct passage of the BPTI fusion protein into the host cell without exposing BPTI to the oxidizing environment of the PV and hence export is not inhibited (<bold>E</bold>, right). PPM extractor and PVM translocon may interact during this phase. The co-blocking activity of exported TM proteins fused to mDHFR likely depends on similar mechanistics related to the fact that these proteins can reach the PVM translocon during extraction while proteins with a short C-terminus remain in the PPM extractor only.</p>

The size of the digested product is consistent with the protease resistant core (mDHFR-GFP), indicating no larger protected fragment and hence presence of the constructs in the PV. The same is the case for the co-blocked REX2mCherry (mCherry does not appear to form a stable core and was completely digested).
