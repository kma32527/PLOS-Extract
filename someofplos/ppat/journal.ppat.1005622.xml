<abstract>
<p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of viral lower respiratory tract illness in children. In contrast to the RSV prototypic strain A2, clinical isolate RSV 2–20 induces airway mucin expression in mice, a clinically relevant phenotype dependent on the fusion (F) protein of the RSV strain. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a role in airway mucin expression in other systems; therefore, we hypothesized that the RSV 2–20 F protein stimulates EGFR signaling. Infection of cells with chimeric strains RSV A2-2-20F and A2-2-20GF or over-expression of 2–20 F protein resulted in greater phosphorylation of EGFR than infection with RSV A2 or over-expression of A2 F, respectively. Chemical inhibition of EGFR signaling or knockdown of EGFR resulted in diminished infectivity of RSV A2-2-20F but not RSV A2. Over-expression of EGFR enhanced the fusion activity of 2–20 F protein in <italic>trans</italic>. EGFR co-immunoprecipitated most efficiently with RSV F proteins derived from “mucogenic” strains. RSV 2–20 F and EGFR co-localized in H292 cells, and A2-2-20GF-induced MUC5AC expression was ablated by EGFR inhibitors in these cells. Treatment of BALB/c mice with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib significantly reduced the amount of RSV A2-2-20F-induced airway mucin expression. Our results demonstrate that RSV F interacts with EGFR in a strain-specific manner, EGFR is a co-factor for infection, and EGFR plays a role in RSV-induced mucin expression, suggesting EGFR is a potential target for RSV disease.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is responsible for severe lower respiratory disease in infants and young children. Overabundant airway mucus contributes to airway obstruction in RSV bronchiolitis, and a better understanding of RSV pathogenesis may contribute to needed therapies and vaccines. We reported previously that RSV clinical isolate strain 2–20 induces more airway mucin expression in mice than prototypic RSV strains and that the 2–20 fusion (F) protein mediates mucin induction. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been shown to play a role in lung mucin expression. We identified a functional interaction between 2–20 F and EGFR, in that 2–20 F expression activated EGFR and, reciprocally, EGFR expression increased 2–20 F fusion activity. RSV F and EGFR co-localized in infected cells. EGFR co-immunoprecipitated with RSV F protein from various RSV strains, and the strength of this <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction correlated with strain-specific airway pathogenicity in mice. EGFR inhibition abrogated 2–20 F-mediated infection <italic>in vitro</italic> and mucin expression induction <italic>in vivo</italic>. These data identify EGFR as a novel strain-specific co-factor of RSV infection and suggest EGFR may be a target for ameliorating RSV disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a human pathogen of the <italic>Pneumovirus</italic> genus within the <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family. Worldwide, the virus causes over 30 million lower respiratory tract illnesses per year in children and is a leading cause of infant pneumonia mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref002">2</xref>]. Despite a substantial clinical burden of disease, there are no available vaccines or RSV-specific therapeutics. A challenge to RSV vaccine and therapy strategies remains elucidation of the unclear relationship between RSV infection and pathogenesis.</p>
<p>RSV is an enveloped, non-segmented, negative-strand RNA virus whose genome is approximately 15.2 kb in length and encodes 10 genes which are translated into 11 proteins. RSV attachment is mediated through host glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), cellular protein nucleolin, association with cholesterol-rich microdomains, and CX3CR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref009">9</xref>]. Mechanisms surrounding RSV entry remain unclear and other host receptors, co-receptors, and co-factors contributing to infection are likely to be identified. Two envelope proteins mediate RSV infection, the attachment glycoprotein (G) and the fusion (F) protein. Prior to infection, RSV F exists in a metastable pre-fusion conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref011">11</xref>]. RSV F undergoes a series of conformational changes yielding a thermodynamically stable six-helix post-fusion bundle, which drives viral and host membrane fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref013">13</xref>]. RSV G is mucin-like, having extensive N- and O-linked glycosylation, and G is responsible for facilitating RSV attachment through interactions with GAGs and CX3CR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref015">15</xref>]. However, G is not absolutely required for viral entry into immortalized monolayer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref018">18</xref>]. Mechanisms by which F and G mediate host cell entry and their interactions with other host cell targets remain uncertain.</p>
<p>Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a host glycoprotein comprised of an extracellular ligand receptor and intracellular kinase domain. The latter is activated through both Src-dependent phosphorylation and autophosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref020">20</xref>]. In addition to a wide variety of host ligands including epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα), several viruses have been identified that employ EGFR binding and activation for viral entry and replication. These pathogens include hepatitis B virus, human cytomegalovirus (hCMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref023">23</xref>]. Previous studies by others evaluating the role of EGFR in RSV infection have shown that RSV activates EGFR in lung epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref025">25</xref>]. EGFR activation in these cells promotes a pro-inflammatory response including increased survival of RSV-infected cells and suppression of interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 1-dependent CXCL10 production, an important event for recruitment of lymphocytes to infected airway epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref025">25</xref>]. Another study using a recombinant virus based on the RSV subgroup A prototypic strain A2 demonstrated that RSV cell entry is largely mediated through endocytotic macropinocytosis promoted by EGFR phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Respiratory failure is the critical consequence of RSV disease in children, and overabundant mucus obstruction of the airways contributes to this outcome. Our laboratory previously reported that clinical isolate RSV A2001/2-20 (2–20) causes more airway necrosis, inflammation, and mucin expression during infection in BALB/cJ mice than the A2 reference strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref028">28</xref>]. Transfer of the RSV 2–20 F protein into strain A2 recapitulated higher levels of airway mucin expression in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref028">28</xref>]. These studies demonstrated that the RSV F protein plays a key role in airway epithelium infection and pathogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> and suggests that RSV F plays a role in RSV strain-specific phenotypes.

We hypothesized that mucin induction by RSV 2–20 F is mediated by a specific interaction with EGFR.

<title>RSV 2–20 F activates EGFR, and EGFR promotes 2–20 F protein activity</title>
<p>As EGFR phosphorylation/activation mediates mucin expression in response to other respiratory viruses, RSV A2 is known to activate EGFR, and RSV 2–20 F is more “mucogenic” than A2 F in the context of infection, we hypothesized that the 2–20 strain F protein potently activates EGFR. Western blotting was performed to determine levels of total EGFR and phospho-EGFR (p-EGFR) after infection of HEp-2 cells with RSV strains A2 and A2-2-20F. We used serum-starved cells because serum is an activator of EGFR signaling in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref032">32</xref>]. A2-2-20F-infected cells had a higher ratio of p-EGFR to EGFR than A2-infected cells at 24 h post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). We performed similar experiments in serum-starved NCI-H292 (H292) cells, and in an earlier time course we found that A2-2-20F infection resulted in a higher p-EGFR/EGFR ratio than A2 infection at 1, 12, and 24 hr post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). To define the role of RSV 2–20 F expression alone in EGFR activation, A2 F and 2–20 F expression constructs were transfected into serum-starved HEp-2 cells and blotted for EGFR and p-EGFR levels. There was a significantly higher 4.45-fold ratio of p-EGFR to EGFR after 2-20F expression than after A2 F expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). These data demonstrate that the 2–20 RSV F protein activated EGFR in cells to a greater extent than the A2 strain F protein.</p>

<p>We tested whether EGFR can enhance RSV F protein fusion activity. We used a previously established cell-cell fusion assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref034">34</xref>]. The dual-split protein (DSP) assay is based on co-transfecting an “effector”/<italic>cis</italic> population of 293T cells with a construct expressing N-terminal domains of a <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase and GFP fusion protein (DSP<sub>1-7</sub>) and an F expression construct in the presence of specific fusion inhibitor. Another population of 293T cells (“target”/<italic>trans</italic>) is transfected with a construct expressing the C-terminal domains of the luciferase-GFP fusion protein (DSP<sub>8-11</sub>) and, in this case, either equal molar amounts of empty vector (pcDNA) or an EGFR expression vector. The fusion inhibitor is washed out, the effector and target cells are mixed, and fusion is quantified by luciferase activity reconstituted by cell content mixing. A2 F had significantly more cell-cell fusion activity than 2-20F in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Expression of EGFR in <italic>trans</italic> enhanced 2–20 F activity but not A2 F activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Similar to published A2 F and 2–20 F fusion assay experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref028">28</xref>], we found no difference, as measured by flow cytometry, between A2 F and 2–20 F surface expression in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005622.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). To determine whether the boost in RSV 2-20F fusion is specific to a <italic>trans</italic> F-EGFR interaction, 2-20F was either co-expressed (in <italic>cis</italic>) with EGFR or in <italic>trans</italic> in the target cells. There was a significant boost to 2-20F fusion when EGFR was expressed in <italic>trans</italic> but not in <italic>cis</italic>, suggesting EGFR enhancement of 2–20 F activity does not occur when the proteins are overexpressed in the same cells or membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Co-expression of EGFR with RSV F did not alter F surface expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005622.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). There was no effect on 2–20 F activity by overexpression of signaling lymphocyte activation molecules (SLAM), a receptor for measles virus (MeV) serving as an irrelevant transmembrane protein control. Collectively, the data show EGFR specifically enhanced the fusion activity of RSV strain 2–20 F protein but not A2 F protein.</p>

<title>EGFR inhibition and knockdown reduced infectivity of RSV expressing 2–20 F</title>
<p>EGFR can function as receptor, co-receptor, or entry co-factor for other viruses, and EGFR depletion in HeLa cells was reported to reduce RSV A2 strain infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref026">26</xref>]. We explored the role of EGFR in RSV-2-20F infection. Cells were pre-treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (AG1478 and PD153035) then infected with recombinant RSV A2, RSV A2-2-20F, or RSV A2-2-20GF. Virus infectivity was measured by flow cytometry of virally expressed mKate2. NCI-H292 (H292) cells are a human tracheal epithelial cell line known to express mucin genes through activation of the EGFR pathway and known to support RSV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref037">37</xref>]. Treatment of H292 cells with increasing concentrations of EGFR inhibitor AG1478 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in infectivity of all three virus strains at an MOI of 1, and the reduction in infection was greater against A2-2-20F and A2-2-20GF than against A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Treatment of H292 cells prior to RSV A2 infection at a higher MOI = 3 with either AG1478 or PD153035 resulted in no change in infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In contrast, EGFR inhibition prior to A2-2-20F or A2-2-20GF infection at MOI = 3 reduced infection efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Treatment in BEAS-2B cells, a human bronchial epithelial cell line, with AG1478 or PD153035 resulted in similar decreases in infectivity of RSV A2-2-20F and A2-2-20GF while having no effect on A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In order to test the effect of EGFR inhibition on RSV infectivity in a model more relevant to RSV biology, we utilized normal human bronchial epithelial cells differentiated at air-liquid interface (NHBE-ALI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref038">38</xref>]. We found that pre-treatment of NHBE-ALI cultures with 5 μM AG1478 was not toxic, as previously described, whereas PD153035 was toxic to NHBE-ALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref039">39</xref>]. Pre-treatment of NHBE-ALI cultures with AG1478 resulted in significant reduction in infectivity of RSV A2-2-20F and A2-2-20GF, and no significant effect on A2 compared to vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).

<p>To determine the role of EGFR expression in RSV infectivity, BEAS-2B cells were first transduced with lentivirus expressing either EGFR-specific shRNA or scrambled (control) shRNA. EGFR shRNA reduced expression of EGFR in BEAS-2B cells by 56% compared to the scrambled shRNA control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). shRNA knockdown of EGFR in BEAS-2B cells resulted in lower infectivity of A2-2-20F and A2-2-20GF but not A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). MeV infection is known to be EGFR-independent; therefore MeV was used as a control for RSV specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref040">40</xref>]. The knockdown data show EGFR acted as a co-factor contributing to infectivity of RSV expressing the F protein of the clinical isolate 2–20 and suggest RSV F may be interacting with EGFR in a strain-dependent manner.</p>

RSV F was immunoprecipitated (IP) well with motavizumab mAb and probed for the presence of co-precipitated EGFR.

To identify putative EGFR interaction sites for RSV 2–20 F, three sets of mutations were introduced into 2–20 F that changed amino acids to the corresponding A2 residues. Mutation sets were introduced into the F head region (T63N, E66K, and G76I triple mutant), stalk region (G519V and K524N double mutant), and in the cleaved 27 residue peptide (pep27) between the furin cleavage sites (N124K) of 2–20 F. Introduction of either the head or the stalk mutation sets resulted in reductions in the efficiency of EGFR-bound to 2–20 F, as detected by IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The N124K pep27 mutation did not affect the co-IP efficiency significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).

<p>Muc5ac is a major inducible and secreted mucin protein in the lung that is up-regulated by EGFR activation and during RSV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref049">49</xref>]. We first tested whether RSV infection of these cells results in MUC5AC gene expression. In DMSO-treated serum-starved H292 cells, A2-2-20GF infection resulted in higher MUC5AC mRNA levels than mock, A2, and A2-2-20F infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Therefore H292 cells provide an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of RSV strain-specific induction of mucin expression. Serum-starved H292 cells were treated with EGFR pathway inhibitors PD153035 and AG1478, mock-infected or infected with RSV strains A2, A2-2-20F, and A2-2-20GF, and MUC5AC expression was quantified. In the presence of either inhibitor, MUC5AC mRNA fold-change in A2-2-20GF infected cells was ablated. The combination of RSV 2–20 F and 2–20 G was important for MUC5AC induction in this <italic>in vitro</italic> model, consistent with the efficient attachment function of 2–20 G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g005">Fig 5A</xref> and ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref018">18</xref>]), and the EGFR pathway was critical for MUC5AC induction.</p>

<p>We tested the role of EGFR signaling in A2-2-20F-induced airway mucin expression. BALB/cJ mice were pre-treated with erlotinib, a specific quinazoline derivative that binds to and inhibits EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, or vehicle suspension, and tested for suppression of EGFR activation in mouse lung homogenates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref050">50</xref>]. Erlotinib caused a reduction in the signal of p-EGFR in lungs from both mock-infected and A2-2-20F-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Mice pre-treated then treated daily with vehicle or erlotinib were infected with mock or A2-2-20F. Lungs were harvested day 8 post-infection and processed for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stains of goblet cell hyperplasia/metaplasia (Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g002">Fig 2</xref>), a surrogate of airway for mucin expression. Our lab uses a digital pathology system to morophometrically quantify PAS positivity in all airways involved in lung sections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref028">28</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>RSV disease in infants is associated with airway obstruction, lung inflammation, epithelial cell sloughing, and mucus production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref052">52</xref>]. The relative contributions of sloughed epithelium and mucus production to airway obstruction remain unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref054">54</xref>]. Distal airways are thought to have fewer mucin-secreting cells than larger airways, but overabundant mucus production is associated with infant bronchiolitis clinically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref053">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref055">55</xref>]. The clinical isolate strain 2–20 to a degree recapitulates human RSV disease in the BALB/c mouse model of RSV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref056">56</xref>]. The prototypical A2 strain does not cause airway mucin expression in mice, and chimeric RSV strains A2-2-20F is mucogenic like parental 2–20, implicating the F protein in mucin induction <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref044">44</xref>]. RSV 2–20 has somewhat altered tropism in the mouse because it infects the airway epithelium and alveolar epithelial cells, whereas A2 infects predominantly alveolar epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref027">27</xref>]. 2–20 and A2-2-20F cause more airway necrosis in mice than A2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref028">28</xref>]. Therefore, infection of the mouse airways correlates with mucin induction in this model. Here, we investigated mechanisms of 2–20 F-induced airway mucin induction. In cultured cells, 2–20 F exhibited greater functional and physical interaction with EGFR than A2 F, and EGFR was able to enhance the fusion activity of the 2–20 F protein. Chemical inhibition of EGFR signaling reduced infectivity of 2–20 F-expressing RSV and ablated mucin induction <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We report that RSV F interacts with and activates EGFR and that EGFR contributes to infection <italic>in vitro</italic> and plays a critical role in RSV-induced mucin expression.</p>
<p>Our study shows F and EGFR interact functionally and physically. Expression of the 2–20 F protein potently activated EGFR, as measured by p-EGFR levels in cells. The efficiency of co-IP of EGFR with F depended on strain specificity of the expressed F protein. EGFR had the highest co-IP efficiency with 2–20 and line 19 F proteins, strains previously shown to be mucogenic in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref044">44</xref>]. We mapped the enhanced co-IP efficiency with 2–20 F to two domain differing between 2–20 F and A2 F, residues 63/66/76 and residues 519/524. Amino acids 63, 66, and 76 cluster at the top of the prefusion F trimer. This region overlaps prefusion-specific antigenic site ∅, and the adjacent residue 67 is important for RSV F prefusion stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref057">57</xref>]. As we discussed in Stokes et al, residues 519 and 524 in RSV F are membrane-proximal in the stalk, a region implicated in regulating Hendra virus F protein triggering via stabilization of the pre-fusion form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref058">58</xref>]. In our co-IP experiments, we expressed functional F, which for RSV does not require triggering by the attachment protein, so prefusion and postfusion forms were present. We speculate that 63/66/76 and 519/524 regions regulate prefusion stability, which may relate to EGFR co-IP efficiency between F species and mutants. In the DSP fusion assay, EGFR boosted 2–20 activity, so we predict the functional interaction occurs prior to postfusion F formation. Additional studies and reagents will be required to further elucidate F-EGFR molecular interactions.</p>
<p>RSV infection was previously shown to activate EGFR. The A2 strain activates EGFR in cells, resulting in delayed apoptosis by ERK activation and production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref024">24</xref>]. RSV A2 strain was shown to activate EGFR following virus attachment, leading to macropinocytotic endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref026">26</xref>]. In that study, EGFR depletion in HeLa cells by siRNA delivery resulted in reduced infectivity of the A2 strain, whereas we found that EGFR depletion in BEAS-2B cells reduced infectivity of RSV expressing 2–20 F but not of the A2 strain. The discordant findings may be related to the cell line and/or the efficiency of EGFR knockdown. Recently, RSV activation of EGFR, in addition to influenza A (H1N1) and rhinovirus infections, led to suppression of IRF1-dependent CXCL10 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref025">25</xref>]. CXCL10 is expressed in airway epithelial cells, is a ligand of CXCR3 (a key regulator of leukocyte trafficking), and when elevated is associated with obstructive airway diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref060">60</xref>]. Using RSV 2–20 F-expressing viruses in future studies may shed additional light on entry mechanisms, such as macropinocytosis, and downstream immunopathogenesis such as IL-8 expression, neutrophil recruitment, and CXCL10 expression.</p>
<p>The capacity of RSV F to engage EGFR during infection may depend in part on a function of the RSV G protein. We observed an appreciable increase in MUC5AC expression in H292 cells when using strain A2-2-20GF, not A2 or A2-2-20F. In these cells, 2–20 G conferred greater attachment, as measured by superresolution microscopy, consistent with the sequence-based prediction that 2–20 G has more glycosylation sites and our recent published data that 2–20 G has a higher apparent molecular weight than A2 G and confers enhanced cell attachment in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref018">18</xref>]. The co-localization quantification in H292 cells revealed that, irrespective of the abundance of RSV F puncta, 2–20 G greatly enhanced signal overlap between F and EGFR, suggesting 2–20 G alters location of RSV on the plasma membrane. Our current working model is that initial 2–20 G interactions with CX3CR1, GAGs, and/or other factors mediates attachment that likely precedes F-EGFR interaction, EGFR activation, and infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005622.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Further studies will need to evaluate the role of G in F-EGFR interactions during infection in cells and animal models.</p>

<p>In summary, we for the first time identified a host protein that both interacts with the RSV F protein and promotes fusion. EGFR was expressed at the apical surface of differentiated pediatric bronchial epithelial cells, and RSV F and EGFR co-localized in infected cells. Using clinically relevant RSV strains and infection models, we found that EGFR is critical for RSV-induced airway mucin expression and laid the groundwork for defining the molecular interaction between F and EGFR.</p>

PBEC were expanded in collagen-coated flasks using airway epithelial cell media and supplements (Lonza), then seeded onto transwell inserts (Corning), and then air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures were initiated and maintained 21 days in order to establish well-differentiated (WD)-PBECs, as described in further detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref045">45</xref>]. Paraformaldehyde-fixed and permeabilized WD-PBEC were stained for anti-β-tubulin, MUC5AC, or RSV F protein expression as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref045">45</xref>] and were stained with anti-phospho-(p)-EGFR (Abcam, ab40815). WD-PBEC cultures were infected with RSV subgroup A clinical isolate BT2a as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref045">45</xref>]. Fluorescent images were obtained with a SP5 confocal DMI 6000 inverted microscope (Leica).</p>

<title>Erlotinib treatment of mice and quantification of airway mucin expression</title>
<p>7-week old female BALB/cJ mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were orally gavaged with 100 mg/kg of erlotinib (Selleck Chemicals LLS, Catalog S1023) or vehicle (0.5% carboxymethylcellulose /0.1% Tween 80) in a total volume of 100 μL daily, beginning two days prior to infection, and continuing for the duration of the experiment. Mice were infected intranasally with 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> PFU of A2-2-20F or mock virus preparation. On day 8 post-infection, the lungs were harvested and placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histopathology sectioning and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining for goblet cell hyperplasia as a measure of airway mucin expression. PAS positivity was quantified for greater than 285 individual airways total from 5 separate mice per group by digital morphometric analysis as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref027">27</xref>]. In a separate group of mice, the left lung was harvested, snap frozen, and later homogenized in RIPA buffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail. The amount of total protein the lung homogenates was determined by Bradford assay and equivalent proteins from each group were loaded on a 4–17% SDS-PAGE gel and separated by electrophoresis before Western blotting for total EGFR (Abcam, AB15669) or p-EGFR Monoclonal (Abcam, AB24928).</p>

<title>Fluorescent imaging of serial lung sections</title>
<p>7-week old female BALB/cJ mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were infected intranasally with 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> PFU of A2-2-20F (-mKate2), 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> FFU of A2-2-2-20F, or mock virus preparation. On day 8 post infection, lungs were harvested and prepared as above for PAS staining or, after sectioning, were deparaffinized with Clear-rite (Thermo Scientific), rehydrated through graded alcohols to water, and then stained with Prolong DAPI Gold (Life Technologies). PAS slides were imaged using a Mirax Imaging System as descried previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005622.ref027">27</xref>]. DAPI-stained slides analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using the Mirax Image System. Equal exposure time was used for each channel (DAPI 120μs, mKate2 900μs) across all groups. Excitation was provided by HXP-120 light source (LEj) through Zeiss filter set 2 (DAPI) or 45 (mKate2). Images were analyzed in Panoramic Viewer v1.15.2 (3DHISTECH), where pseudocoloring levels were kept constant for each channel across all groups. Images of representative airways from the central portion of each lung were exported as TIF files.</p>
