<abstract>
<p>Gamma-herpesviruses colonise lymphocytes. Murid Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4) infects B cells via epithelial to myeloid to lymphoid transfer. This indirect route entails exposure to host defences, and type I interferons (IFN-I) limit infection while viral evasion promotes it. To understand how IFN-I and its evasion both control infection outcomes, we used Mx1-cre mice to tag floxed viral genomes in IFN-I responding cells. Epithelial-derived MuHV-4 showed low IFN-I exposure, and neither disrupting viral evasion nor blocking IFN-I signalling markedly affected acute viral replication in the lungs. Maximising IFN-I induction with poly(I:C) increased virus tagging in lung macrophages, but the tagged virus spread poorly. Lymphoid-derived MuHV-4 showed contrastingly high IFN-I exposure. This occurred mainly in B cells. IFN-I induction increased tagging without reducing viral loads; disrupting viral evasion caused marked attenuation; and blocking IFN-I signalling opened up new lytic spread between macrophages. Thus, the impact of IFN-I on viral replication was strongly cell type-dependent: epithelial infection induced little response; IFN-I largely suppressed macrophage infection; and viral evasion allowed passage through B cells despite IFN-I responses. As a result, IFN-I and its evasion promoted a switch in infection from acutely lytic in myeloid cells to chronically latent in B cells. Murine cytomegalovirus also showed a capacity to pass through IFN-I-responding cells, arguing that this is a core feature of herpesvirus host colonization.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Gamma-herpesviruses establish chronic infections and cause cancers. They achieve this by immune evasion. Immune responses nonetheless suppress infection to a degree. By understanding how immune responses and viral evasion come together we can potentially control infection and prevent disease. MuHV-4 provides an accessible model with which to define outcomes. It enters new hosts via epithelial cells, passes to macrophages, then persists in B cells. Type I interferonsâ€”a key anti-viral defenceâ€”controlled epithelial and B cell infections but poorly restricted the intervening macrophage infection. Therefore for maximal effect interferons must act before B cells are infected.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Î³-herpesviruses persist in lymphocytes and cause lymphoid and epithelial cancers. MuHV-4, like Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and the Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus (KSHV), persists in B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref001">1</xref>]. After epithelial entry, it reaches B cells in organized lymphoid tissue via dendritic cells (DC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref002">2</xref>]. It then spreads with remarkable precision from splenic marginal zone (MZ) macrophages to MZ B cells, follicular DC, then follicular B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref003">3</xref>]. Glycoprotein conformation changes guide host colonization, with epithelial-derived virions infecting myeloid cells but not B cells, myeloid-derived virions infecting B cells, and B cell-derived virions infecting epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref004">4</xref>]. However epithelial-derived virions still infect epithelial cells better than myeloid cells, and myeloid-derived virions still infect epithelial and myeloid cells better than B cells. Therefore efficient B cell colonization must involve also a suppression of non-B cell infections.</p>
<p>Immune cell colonization makes host defences an important feature of the Î³-herpesvirus infection landscape. Type 1 interferons (IFN-I) are a core vertebrate anti-viral defence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref005">5</xref>]. Myriad stimuli induce IFN-I: classically double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), but also other nucleic acids in unusual forms or places, such as unmethylated and cytoplasmic DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref006">6</xref>]. IFN-I secretion is triggered by phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) 3 and 7. Signalling through the STAT-1/2-linked IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) then induces an anti-viral state in infected and surrounding cells via restricted protein synthesis, a reduced apoptosis threshold and immune effector recruitment. IFNÎ± is produced mainly by myeloid cells, IFNÎ² by many cell types, and both in large amounts by plasmacytoid DC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref007">7</xref>]. The multiplicity of induction pathways sensitive to different infection hallmarks ensures that essentially all viruses elicit an IFN-I response.</p>
<p>Most viruses also evade IFN-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref008">8</xref>]. MuHV-4 reduces IFN-I induction in infected cells, inhibiting IRF3 via ORF36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref009">9</xref>] and TANK binding kinase 1 via ORF11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref010">10</xref>]. It also reduces IFN-I signalling, down-regulating STAT-1 and STAT-2 via M2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref011">11</xref>], degrading IFNAR via ORF54 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref012">12</xref>] and inhibiting responses downstream of IFNAR via ORF37 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref013">13</xref>]. A third interaction is that IFN-I transcriptionally suppresses M2 to inhibit viral reactivation from latency, both directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref014">14</xref>] and by restoring STAT-1/2 expression to allow STAT-1-dependent transcriptional suppression of ORF50, the main viral lytic transactivator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref015">15</xref>]. Such effects could explain why IFN-I retains an important role in preventing disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref017">17</xref>]. However MuHV-4 still reactivates sufficiently to cause disease in IFN-I-competent mice lacking CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref018">18</xref>]; and M2 is still made sufficiently to promote acute lymphoid infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref019">19</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref021">21</xref>] and provide an important T cell target in long-term infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref022">22</xref>]. Thus, the quantitative relationships between IFN-I signalling and viral evasion remain unclear.</p>
<p>Qualitative questions also remain. ORF11, ORF36, ORF37, ORF54 and M2 all limit IFN-I signalling to infected cells, so ongoing viral gene expression should preclude a cellular IFN-I response; but in cells already exposed to IFN-I, viral signalling blocks should be ineffective and infection should be suppressed. In a uniform cell population such mutual inhibition would manifest as transient viral replication; but <italic>in vivo</italic> infection is more complicated, with MuHV-4 spreading between cell types and between anatomic sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref023">23</xref>]. Splenic B cell colonization involves at least 5 lytic cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref003">3</xref>], so virus entry into IFN-I-exposed B cells must be common. For Herpes simplex virus, IFN-I does not prevent epithelial virus production but impaired responses promote pathological neuronal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref024">24</xref>], suggesting that cell type is an important outcome determinant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref025">25</xref>]. Most studies of MuHV-4 and IFN-I have averaged effects across whole organs, so how host response and viral evasion vary with cell type is unclear. To understand this better we tracked MuHV-4 replication in IFN-I responding cells. The results provide new insight into how a complex pathogen interacts with an ancient host defence, and how cell type-specific infection outcomes guide host colonization.</p>

<title>IFN-I induction reduces MuHV-4 replication <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>MuHV-4 replicates in a wide range of primary and transformed cells, suggesting that it either induces little IFN-I or evades its effects. Weak inhibition of fibroblast infection by MuHV-4-expressed IFNÎ± [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref026">26</xref>] suggests effector evasion. However the expression kinetics of IFNÎ± were unclear, and the cells infected (hamster fibroblasts or IFNAR<sup>-/-</sup> fibroblasts transfected with IFNAR encoding DNA) may have responded poorly to murine IFNÎ±. Myeloid cells play a central role in MuHV-4 host colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref027">27</xref>], and RAW-264 monocyte-macrophages are well-described IFN-I producers and responders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref028">28</xref>]. Therefore we tested in RAW-264 cells whether MuHV-4 induced IFN-I, and whether IFN-I affected viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g001">Fig 1</xref>). ELISA of cell supernatants for IFNÎ² showed only limited induction in infected cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), so we tested viral susceptibility to IFN-I signalling more stringently by treating the RAW-264 cells with poly(I:C), a well-characterised TLR3 ligand. IFNÎ² was then readily detectable regardless of whether virus was present, and viral replication was reduced 10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). However the infectivity of induced RAW-264 cell cultures still increased 100-fold between day(d)1 and d2 after MuHV-4 inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), despite IFNÎ² being detected at both time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), and continued to increase at d3. Therefore MuHV-4 both induced little IFNÎ² and partly resisted its effects.</p>

<title>IFN-I induction transiently reduces MuHV-4 replication in lungs</title>
<p>We tested next how IFN-I affected MuHV-4 replication in the lungs, where it infects alveolar macrophages (AMs) and type 1 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC1s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref029">29</xref>]. Again we wanted to know whether IFN-I was induced, and if induced whether MuHV-4 resisted its effects. IFN-I induction is generally rapid, for example peaking 12-24h after experimental respiratory virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref030">30</xref>], but IFNAR<sup>-/-</sup> mice given MuHV-4 i.n. have normal virus titers in the lungs for at least 4d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref016">16</xref>], implying poor IFN-I induction or poor efficacy. Bioassays have suggested poor induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref031">31</xref>], and consistent with this result, IFNÎ² was not detected by ELISA of lung washes at 1d post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). To test MuHV-4 resistance to IFN-I therefore, we induced it with poly(I:C) 6h before virus inoculation. This gave detectable IFNÎ² in lung washes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), and increased Mx1 transcription in lungs by d1, whereas infection took until d3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Live imaging of luciferase<sup>+</sup> MuHV-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) and plaque assays of infectious virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g001">Fig 1F</xref>) showed IFN-I induction reducing lung infection at d3 but not at other time points. Although poly(I:C) also induces inflammatory cytokines, these seem not to affect acute MuHV-4 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref033">33</xref>] and IFNAR blockade abrogated the effect of poly(I:C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). This implied also that IFN-III induction by poly(I:C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref034">34</xref>] did not have a marked effect. Thus, as with RAW-264 cell infection <italic>in vitro</italic>, MuHV-4 in the lungs induced little IFN-I, and inducing IFN-I only modestly reduced viral replication.</p>

<title>MuHV-4 passes through IFN-I responding cells</title>
<p>To track how IFN-I responses and viral replication overlap in single cells, we infected Mx1-cre mice, in which cre is transcribed from an IFN-I-inducible Mx1 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref035">35</xref>], with MuHV-4 in which cre switches a fitness-neutral (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005654.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) reporter construct from mCherry (red) to eGFP expression (green) (MHV-RG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref027">27</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g002">Fig 2</xref>).

Upper respiratory tract inoculation similarly gave little virus switching in noses at d5; significantly more in superficial cervical LN (SCLN) at d5; and significantly more again in SCLN at d14.

<p>As lymphoid infection follows epithelial infection, greater fluorochrome switching in spleens than in lungs could also have reflected time-dependent IFN-I induction. To analyse spleen infection without a preceding lung infection, we gave MHV-RG to Mx1-cre mice i.p., when it reaches splenic MZ macrophages directlyâ€”presumably via the thoracic duct and blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref003">3</xref>]. At d3 after i.p. inoculation, splenic virus was significantly more switched than that recovered from lungs at d3 after i.n. inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). This result suggested that viral IFN-I exposure is intrinsically greater in the spleen. Poly(I:C), which is used widely to activate the Mx1-cre transgene, increased virus switching in each site, with again significantly more switching in spleens. It inhibited viral replication only in lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). IFN-I responses should drive viral fluorochrome switching but inhibit replication; viral inhibition of IFN-I production or signalling should preserve replication but limit switching; high level switched virus recovery from spleens implied both IFN-I induction and resistance to its effects.</p>
<p>pDCs are important IFN-I producers in some settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref007">7</xref>]. Depleting them with mAb 120G8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g002">Fig 2E</xref>) had no significant effect on the switching or titer of i.p.-inoculated MHV-RG. The same treatment increased significantly the titer of footpad-inoculated MuHV-4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005654.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), so it was functionally effective. Thus, the IFN-I response to spleen infection did not depend strongly on plasmacytoid DCs.</p>

In infected lungs, &gt;99% of fluorescent cells were unswitched (mCherry<sup>+</sup>eGFP<sup>-</sup>).

<p>Virus tagging is most informative acutely, as the site of tagging is then clearer.

<p>To test more stringently the capacity of MuHV-4 to resist IFN-I in spleens, we induced it with poly(I:C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g003">Fig 3E and 3F</xref>).

<title>MuHV-4 induces IFN-I responses in B cells but not AEC1s</title>
<p>The Mx1-cre transgene has been used extensively to delete floxed cellular genes via poly(I:C) injection. We reasoned that it could also reveal cellular exposure to IFN-I, via activation of a floxed cellular fluorochrome. To this end we crossed Mx1-cre with ROSA26-YFP mice, in which cre-dependent removal of a floxed translational stop activates YFP expression, and infected them with wild-type MuHV-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g004">Fig 4</xref>).

Therefore we compared ORF36<sup>-</sup> MuHV-4 with wild-type also by i.p. inoculation, which reaches the spleen directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Our ORF36<sup>-</sup> MuHV-4 showed a relatively minor defect in direct lung infection when given i.n. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), and a marked defect in direct spleen infection when given i.p. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). IFN-I induction with poly(I:C) increased the lung infection defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Thus in lungs, limited IFN-I induction normally allows ORF36<sup>-</sup> MuHV-4 to achieve near wild-type titers; but in spleens, where IFN-I induction was greater, ORF36 was an important outcome determinant. Poor splenic infection by ORF36<sup>-</sup> MuHV-4 was associated with a shift in viral antigen from MZ (CD169<sup>+</sup>) to red pulp (RP, F4/80<sup>+</sup>) macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>). Impaired virus transfer to the WP provided an explanation for the reduction in titer, as lymphoproliferation in the WP normally amplifies the viral load. Virus deposition in the RP was consistent with virions being carried by blood flow from the MZ when transfer to the WP was impaired.</p>

<title>IFN-I blockade increases MuHV-4 replication in macrophages</title>
<p>Although MuHV-4 colonizes IFN-I-responding mice, i.n. and i.p. inoculations are more pathogenic in IFNAR<sup>-/-</sup> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref045">45</xref>], so IFN-I must normally exert some restriction on virus replication. Which cell types support the additional infection when IFN-I is lacking has been unclear. Blocking IFN-I signalling with an IFNAR-specific antibody increased acute lung infection &lt;5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), consistent with little IFN-I induction in this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g001">Fig 1</xref>); by contrast spleen increased infection &gt;50-fold. Immunostaining revealed extensive viral lytic spread through the splenic MZ and RP, with increased viral antigen expression in cells morphologically typical of macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Splenic macrophages are diverse and lack a single unifying marker. Viral antigens were evident in CD169<sup>+</sup> (MZ macrophage) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>), CD206<sup>+</sup> (tissue resident, non-MZ macrophage) and F4/80<sup>+</sup> (RP macrophage) populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g006">Fig 6E</xref>), so IFNAR blockade made many macrophage subtypes more permissive for lytic infection. Viral staining in the WP remained low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Thus in the absence of IFN-I, MZ to WP transfer became rate-limiting for virus spread, and most infection was diverted to the RP, again consistent with untransferred MZ virus following splenic blood flow.</p>

<p>We tracked latent infection in spleens by viral eGFP expression from a constitutive promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). Again blocking IFNAR increased infectious virus titers at d4. Total recoverable virus (infectious centre assay) increased similarly to infectious virus, consistent with most early spleen infection being lytic in MZ macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref046">46</xref>]. By d7 after i.p. challenge, when spleen infection is largely latent in B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref046">46</xref>], virus titers remained elevated above controls in IFNAR-blocked mice; however the elevation was no greater than at d4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g006">Fig 6F</xref>), implying that IFN-I limited mainly MZ macrophage infection. Staining spleen sections at d7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g006">Fig 6G and 6H</xref>) showed more WP infection (eGFP<sup>+</sup>) in IFNAR-blocked mice than in controls, so more lytic infection in MZ macrophages eventually fed through to more latent infection in WP B cells. However IFN-I blockade did not increase viral antigen<sup>+</sup>/ viral eGFP<sup>+</sup> cell ratios in the WP at d7â€”in fact they were reducedâ€”so the proportion of lytic infection in WP B cells did not increase. We conclude that splenic macrophage infection was strongly restricted by IFN-I, but that acute viral reactivation in WP B cells was largely IFN-I-independent.</p>
<p>IFN-I principally targets viral lytic infection. Therefore it possibly had least effect on B cell infection because this is mostly latent. MuHV-4 that cannot shut down lytic infection due to an additional promoter element inserted upstream of its ORF50 lytic switch gene (M50) replicates normally in mice for 3d, but is then progressively attenuated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref047">47</xref>]. This virus cannot drive B cell proliferation because it is constitutively lytic, but it is attenuated also in the lungs, where AEC1s and alveolar macrophages are infected. That IFNAR deficiency does not significantly increase MuHV-4 lung infection for at least 4d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref016">16</xref>] suggested that M50 virus attenuation might be due to impaired IFN-I evasion. To test this hypothesis we gave mice IFNAR blocking antibody i.p. then wildtype or M50 MuHV-4 i.n. (10<sup>5</sup> p.f.u.). Lung virus titers after 7d showed restoration of the M50 replication defect by IFN-I blockade (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005654.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Thus, a capacity to establish latency was important for IFN-I evasion.</p>

<title>Murine cytomegalovirus also passes through IFN-I-responding cells</title>
<p>MuHV-4 passage through IFN-I responding cells was surprising: we expected that either viral evasion would prevent an IFN-I response in infected cells, or IFN-I would prevent viral replication. To test whether it was a unique to MuHV-4, we infected Mx1-cre mice with murine cytomegalovirus that cre switches from eGFP to tdTomato expression (MCMV-GR). We induced IFN-I or not with poly(I:C), gave MCMV-GR i.p., and recovered infectious virus from livers and spleens by plaque assay at d3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). As with MHV-RG, IFN-I induction with poly(I:C) increased MCMV-GR switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) without reducing titers. Thus MCMV, which like MuHV-4 inhibits IFN-I induction and signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref048">48</xref>], could also pass through IFN-I-responding cells. Spleen sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005654.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>) revealed eGFP<sup>-</sup>tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells around lymphoid follicles, consistent with MCMV infecting IFN-I-responding MZ macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref049">49</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>MuHV-4 provides an experimental window onto the Î³-herpesviruses, whose colonization of lymphoid tissue directly confronts host immune defences. IFN-I attenuated macrophage infection, whereas B cell infection was protected by viral evasion. This cell type-dependent outcome explained how IFN-I and its evasion both control infection, with each dominating in a different setting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005654.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Together they played a significant role in shifting the focus of viral tropism from macrophages acutely to B cells chronically.</p>
<p>In the lungs, AMs provide MuHV-4 with a gateway to AEC1s, which then support lytic replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref029">29</xref>]. AEC1s made no detectable Mx1 response to infection or to poly(I:C). Thus, although IFN-I responding AMs poorly supported virus spread, inducing or blocking IFN-I or disrupting its evasion all had modest effects because AEC1s still allowed virus replication. Splenic MZ macrophages provide a gateway to MZ B cells. Again IFN-I restricted virus spread from macrophages. Unlike AEC1s, B cells made Mx1 responses, but their IFN-I responses were bypassed by viral evasion.</p>
<p>An important role for the ORF36 IFN-I evasion gene in splenic infection was surprising, as its inhibition of IRF3 should limit IFN-I induction, and the abundant exposure of wild-type splenic virus to IFN-I implied that MuHV-4 evades its effector functions rather than relying solely on limiting induction. A possible explanation is that ORF36, as a lytic gene, operates more in macrophages than in B cells, as macrophages support lytic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref043">43</xref>] and are important IFN-I producers, whereas B cells support a more tightly latent infection and function more prominently as IFN-I responders. IFN-I production by macrophages depends on positive feedback through IFNAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref051">51</xref>]. Thus ORF36, by limiting IFN-I production, should limit IFN-I signalling by infected macrophages both to themselves and to B cells. This would promote macrophage to B cell virus transfer: first, by promoting new virion production in macrophages; and second, by reducing the effector evasion required for those virions to productively enter B cells. The importance for splenic infection of IFNAR degradation by ORF54 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref012">12</xref>] suggests that it may play a similar role. Plasmacytoid DC produce IFN-I independently of feedback through IFNAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref007">7</xref>], so their production would not be affected by ORF36 or ORF54. They (B220<sup>+</sup> DC) are not an acute infection target in spleens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref003">3</xref>]. However they contributed relatively little to virus switching or control, so other evasion mechanisms may limit their scope.</p>
<p>The recovery of fluorochrome-switched virions implied that viral IFN-I evasion also operates down-stream of IFN-I induction or signalling, that is downstream of ORF36. Switching was evident early after i.p. virus inoculation, when splenic infection is mostly lytic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref046">46</xref>]. Established lytic infection would inhibit IFN-I signalling, so we envisage that most switching occurred when virions entered cells already making IFN-I responses. In this context the disassembly of IFN-I induced ND10 domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref052">52</xref>] may be an important evasion mechanism. This is a function of the MuHV-4 ORF75c tegument component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref054">54</xref>] and is conserved in the homologous Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus ORF75 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref055">55</xref>] and Epstein-Barr virus BNRF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref056">56</xref>]. Tagged viral genomes could then remain latent until IFN-I responses have subsided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref014">14</xref>]. Therefore, <italic>pace</italic> cell differences in IFN-I response, macrophage infection may be more susceptible than B cell infection to inhibition by IFN-I because it is more lytic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref046">46</xref>].</p>
<p>Together the IFN-I response and its evasion promoted B cell over macrophage infection, making IFN-I an important determinant of <italic>in vivo</italic> viral tropism. A corollary is that IFN-I-based therapies are likely to have only a small window of efficacyâ€”mainly reducing acute gamma-herpesvirus replication in myeloid cells. Downstream of this, virions entering IFN-I-exposed B cells would still establish a viable infection. IFN-I deficiency increases <italic>ex vivo</italic> MuHV-4 reactivation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref014">14</xref>]. However the explant reactivation assay is complicated, relying on plaque formation in complex <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures that contain both virus-infected and immune cells. Reactivation rates are low, particularly from B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005654.ref043">43</xref>], and may be affected by cell viability, <italic>in vitro</italic> antibody production and cytokines. The failure of IFNAR blockade to increase the viral antigen / eGFP staining ratio of d7 splenic WP B cells argued that here IFN-I is not a major regulator of <italic>in vivo</italic> lytic reactivation. The capacity of MCMV also to re-emerge acutely after Mx1-dependent tagging suggested that many herpesviruses can enter IFN-I responding cells and rapidly re-emerge. How far IFN-I can restrict MCMV was not explored, but clearly there are limits on what it alone is likely to achieve.</p>

<title>IFNAR-dependent attenuation of MuHV-4 with increased lytic reactivation.</title>
<p>Mice were given anti-IFNAR blocking mAb (100Î¼g i.p. every other day, Î±IFN) or not (nil) then wild-type (WT) or M50 MuHV-4 i.n. (10<sup>5</sup> p.f.u.). M50 MuHV-4 has the proximal 416bp of the Murine cytomegalovirus IE1 promoter inserted in its ORF50 exon1 5â€™ untranslated region. ORF50 encodes the MuHV-4 lytic switch protein. M50 MuHV-4 shows increased ORF50 transcription and an incapacity to remain latent (May JS, Coleman HM, Smillie B, Efstathiou S, Stevenson PG (2004) Forced lytic replication impairs host colonization by a latency-deficient mutant of murine gammaherpesvirus-68. J Gen Virol 85: 137â€“146). At 7 days after infection, lungs were titered for infectious virus by plaque assay. Crosses show means, other symbols show individual mice. Without aIFN mAb M50 titers were significantly less than wild-type (p&lt;0.001 by Studentâ€™s unpaired 2-tailed test); with IFNAR blockade M50 and WT titers were not significantly different.</p>

<title>Summary of how IFN-I and MuHV-4 replication interact in different infected cell types.</title>
<p>Type 1 alveolar epithelial cells made no detectable Mx1 response to MuHV-4 infection or to p(I:C), and IFN-I induction had little effect on viral replication in the lungs, where these cells are abundantly infected. Thus, their interaction was dominated by poor responsiveness to IFN-I. Macrophages contrastingly showed viral fluorochrome switching but propagated switched virions poorly, and IFN-I blockade increased massively the extent of their infection. Thus, in macrophages IFN-I was protective. B cells were different again. They showed abundant viral fluorochrome switching and switched virion production. IFN-I blockade had little effect on infection, but viral evasion gene disruption caused marked attenuation, indicating that B cell infection is normally dominated by IFN-I evasion. This implies that virions can enter IFN-I-responding B cells and establish a latent infection that is stably maintained and can reactivate, presumably when IFN-I signalling has diminished.</p>
