<abstract>
<p>Viruses interfere with and usurp host machinery and circumvent defense responses to create a suitable cellular environment for successful infection. This is usually achieved through interactions between viral proteins and host factors. Geminiviruses are a group of plant-infecting DNA viruses, of which some contain a betasatellite, known as DNAβ. Here, we report that <italic>Cotton leaf curl Multan virus</italic> (CLCuMuV) uses its sole satellite-encoded protein βC1 to regulate the plant ubiquitination pathway for effective infection. We found that <italic>CLCuMu betasatellite</italic> (CLCuMuB) βC1 interacts with NbSKP1, and interrupts the interaction of NbSKP1s with NbCUL1. Silencing of either <italic>NbSKP1s</italic> or <italic>NbCUL1</italic> enhances the accumulation of CLCuMuV genomic DNA and results in severe disease symptoms in plants. βC1 impairs the integrity of SCF<sup>COI1</sup> and the stabilization of GAI, a substrate of the SCF<sup>SYL1</sup> to hinder responses to jasmonates (JA) and gibberellins (GA). Moreover, JA treatment reduces viral accumulation and symptoms. These results suggest that CLCuMuB βC1 inhibits the ubiquitination function of SCF E3 ligases through interacting with NbSKP1s to enhance CLCuMuV infection and symptom induction in plants.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Viruses pose a serious threat to field crops worldwide; therefore, understanding the mechanisms of viral disease can help crop improvements. Here, we investigate how <italic>Cotton leaf curl Multan virus</italic> (CLCuMuV) interacts with plant to cause viral disease. We found that CLCuMuV uses its sole satellite-encoded protein βC1 to regulate the plant ubiquitination pathway for effective infection. By interrupting the interaction of NbSKP1 with NbCUL1 through its interaction of SKP1, βC1 interferes with the plant ubiquitination pathway and impairs plant hormone signallings to enhance viral accumulation and symptoms. These new insight into the mechanisms of viral disease may help crop improvements in the future.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Monopartite begomoviruses often possess an essential disease-specific betasatellite and are responsible for devastating diseases in many crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref001">1</xref>]. For example, at least six distinct begomoviruses that are associated with a single betasatellite, <italic>Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite</italic> (CLCuMuB), cause Cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD), which is a major constraint to cotton production in Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref002">2</xref>]. <italic>Cotton leaf curl Multan virus</italic> (CLCuMuV) is one of these begomoviruses and can infect cotton and many other plants including <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>. CLCuMuV consists of a circular single-stranded DNA genome that encodes only 6 proteins (V1 and V2 in virion-sense strand whilst C1, C2, C3 and C4 in virion complementary-sense strand). CLCuMuB is a small circular single-stranded DNA molecule that is essential for CLCuMuV to induce disease symptoms in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Betasatellites, such as CLCuMuB, are approximately half the size of the begomovirus DNA genomes. They require the helper begomoviruses for replication and movement in plants and only encode a single multifunctional pathogenicity protein βC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref001">1</xref>]. βC1 can up-regulate the proliferation of its cognate helper virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref004">4</xref>], and complement the movement function encoded by the DNA B component of some bipartite begomoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref005">5</xref>]. βC1 is essential for producing viral disease symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref012">12</xref>] and plays important roles in suppression of transcriptional (TGS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref013">13</xref>] and posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref018">18</xref>]. Furthermore, βC1 can also promote the performance of the whitefly and impair plant development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref022">22</xref>]. More details about the multiple functions of βC1 can be found in recently published reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref023">23</xref>]. However, how geminiviruses exploit βC1 to perform these diverse functions needs further investigations.</p>
<p>Ubiquitination is a highly dynamic posttranslational modification process that is a major protein degradation and rapid regulatory mechanism in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref024">24</xref>]. Through the action of a sequential cascade of three enzymes consisting of E1, E2, and E3, ubiquitin is covalently attached to substrate proteins, and then, in most cases, the polyubiquitinated proteins will be degraded by the 26S proteosome. As the most abundant member of the E3 family, the SKP1/CUL1/F-box (SCF) complex is the best characterized multi-subunit ubiquitin ligase. In the SCF complex, SKP1/ASK1 (S-phase kinase-associated protein) acts as a bridge between CUL1 (Cullin1) and F-box proteins. CUL1 is the major structural scaffold and F-box proteins are responsible for recognizing target substrates. RBX1 is the fourth subunit that is heterodimerized with CUL1, and binds E2 through its RING Finger domain. More than 700 predicted F-box proteins are encoded by the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> genome, suggesting these F-box proteins have highly targeting potentials for extensive regulatory functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>The SCF complex-based E3 ubiquitin ligases have been known to regulate plant hormone signaling. Several phytohormone receptors are F-box proteins in SCF complexes, such as SCF<sup>TIR1</sup> for auxin, SCF<sup>COI1</sup> for jasmonates, SCF<sup>SLY1/GID2</sup> for gibberellins and SCF<sup>MAX2</sup> for strigolactones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref030">30</xref>]. In addition, SCF complexes regulate ethylene (ET) signal transduction at multiple points (SCF<sup>ETP1</sup> and SCF<sup>ETP2</sup> for EIN2, SCF<sup>EBF1</sup> and SCF<sup>EBF2</sup> for EIN3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref032">32</xref>]. Since phytohormones have pivot functions in vegetative growth, compromising of these pathways is usually accompanied by abnormal developmental phenotype. Among them, JA plays a crucial role in defense against pathogens and insects. Recently, JA pathway was reported to be involved in plant defense against geminivirus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we report that a geminivirus uses its satellite-encoded βC1 to interfere with the ubiquitination function of SCF E3 ligases to enhance viral infection and symptom development in plants.</p>

<title>CLCuMuB βC1 Is Required for Development of Typical Disease Symptoms and Enhancement of CLCuMuV DNA Accumulation</title>
<p>CLCuMuB was reported to enhance DNA accumulation of the helper virus and be necessary for producing viral disease symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref004">4</xref>]. To see whether βC1 is responsible for these functions, we constructed a null mutant betasatellite for the βC1 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref034">34</xref>] with a ATG-TGA transition in the start codon, hereafter called βM1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005668.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Different from <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> plants infected with CLCuMuV and β (CA+β) causing severe downward leaf curling and darkening as well as swollen veins, plants infected with CLCuMuV and βM1 (CA+βM1) grew taller, developed much milder symptoms and accumulated much less CLCuMuV genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005668.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Further, we generated transgenic <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> plants expressing non-tagged or tagged βC1. However, most transgenic plants have very severe symptoms and are infertile or dead finally. Nevertheless, we were able to obtain five lines expressing non-tagged βC1 under control of its native promoter (<italic>βC1pro</italic>:<italic>βC1</italic>), 2 lines expressing GFP-tagged βC1 driven by CaMV 35S promoter (<italic>35Spro</italic>:<italic>GFP-βC1</italic>) and 4 lines expressing HA-tagged βC1 driven by CaMV 35S promoter (<italic>35Spro</italic>:<italic>HA-βC1</italic>). All these transgenic plants showed aberrant development phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005668.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that CLCuMuB βC1 is required for development of typical disease symptoms and enhancement of CLCuMuV DNA accumulation.</p>

<title>NbSKP1s Interacts with CLCuMuB βC1 <italic>In Vitro</italic> and <italic>In Vivo</italic></title>
<p>To understand how CLCuMuB βC1 facilitates virus infection, we used CLCuMuB βC1 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref035">35</xref>] to identify host CLCuMuB βC1-interacting proteins. From screening the <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> cDNA library, we characterized a full-length SKP1-like protein (designated as <italic>SlSKP1</italic>) that interacted with βC1. Furthermore, 12 putative <italic>NbSKP1</italic> homologues identified in the <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> genome through bioinformatics analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://solgenomics.net" xlink:type="simple">http://solgenomics.net</ext-link>), encode proteins with more than 44% amino-acid identity to SlSKP1. However, we obtained only 4 predicted cDNAs by RT-PCR. Indeed, RNA-seq results (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.solgenomics.net/transcript_sequences/by_species/Nicotiana_benthamiana/" xlink:type="simple">ftp://ftp.solgenomics.net/transcript_sequences/by_species/Nicotiana_benthamiana/</ext-link>) indicates that other 8 putative homologues are not or rarely expressed in leaf tissues. Three of the 4 NbSKP1 homologues NbSKP1.1, NbSKP1.2 and NbSKP1.3, collectively called NbSKP1s, interact with CLCuMuB βC1, whilst the other do not or interact very weakly with βC1 in yeasts and it is named as NbSKP1L1 (NbSKP1-like 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

<p>To examine whether CLCuMuB βC1 directly interacts with NbSKP1.1, <italic>in vitro</italic> GST pull-down assay was performed. His-HA double-tagged NbSKP1.1 (His-HA-NbSKP1.1) was expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) and then purified by Ni-NTA Agarose (Qiagen, Netherlands) column. After elution, His-HA-NbSKP1.1 was incubated with Glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE, American) bonded with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli-</italic>expressed GST, GST-tagged CLCuMuB βC1 (GST-βC1) or its mutant with the deletion of C-terminal 43 amino acids (GST-βC1ΔC43). His-HA-NbSKP1.1 was pulled down by GST-βC1 but not GST and GST-βC1ΔC43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), indicating that NbSKP1.1 can directly interact with βC1. To our surprise, His-HA double-tagged NbSKP1L1 (His-HA-NbSKP1L1) was also pulled down by GST-βC1 but not GST and GST-βC1ΔC43. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>We also demonstrated <italic>in planta</italic> interaction of CLCuMuB βC1 with NbSKP1.1 using co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay. In this assay, HA-tagged NbSKP1.1 (HA-NbSKP1.1) was co-expressed transiently with GFP or GFP-tagged CLCuMuB βC1 (GFP-βC1) in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> by agroinfiltration. GFP-βC1 transgenic <italic>N</italic>.<italic>benthamiana</italic> exhibits leaf curl symptoms, which indicates GFP-βC1 is a functional protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005668.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). Total protein extracts were immunoprecipitated by GFP-Trap beads (ChromoTek, German). The resulting precipitates were analyzed by western blot assays using an anti-HA antibody (CST, USA). We found that HA-NbSKP1.1 was co-immunoprecipitated by GFP-βC1 but not GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Similarly, we also found that HA-tagged NbSKP1L1 (HA-NbSKP1L1) was co-immunoprecipitated by GFP-βC1 but not GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). To confirm these Co-IP results, we performed the reverse IP. GFP-βC1 was co-expressed transiently with HA-tagged GUS (HA-GUS), HA-NbSKP1.1 or HA-NbSKP1L1 in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> by agroinfiltration. Total protein extracts were immunoprecipitated by HA-beads (Abmart, China). The resulting precipitates were analyzed by western blot assays using an anti-GFP antibody (ChromoTek, German).

<p>To find where CLCuMuB βC1 interacts with NbSKP1.1 and NbSKP1L1 in plant cells, citrine yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-based bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref036">36</xref>] were performed. HA-tagged βC1 or βC1ΔC43 was fused to the N-terminal domain of YFP (nYFP) to generate HA-βC1-nYFP or HA-βC1ΔC43-nYFP. NbSKP1.1, NbSKP1L1 and the N-terminal fragment of firefly luciferase (nLUC) as a negative control were fused to HA-tagged C-terminal domain of YFP (HA-cYFP) to generate HA-cYFP-NbSKP1.1, HA-cYFP-NbSKP1L1 and HA-cYFP-nLUC. Western blot assays using an anti-HA antibody showed that all chimeric proteins can be expressed correctly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005668.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). HA-βC1-nYFP or HA-βC1ΔC43-nYFP was transiently co-expressed with HA-cYFP-NbSKP1.1, HA-cYFP-NbSKP1L1 or HA-cYFP-nLUC respectively in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic>. No such interaction between HA-βC1-nYFP and HA-cYFP-nLUC was found. However, positive interactions between HA-βC1-nYFP and HA-cYFP-NbSKP1.1 or HA-cYFP-NbSKP1L1 were observed in both nucleus and cell periphery, as indicated by occurrence of yellow fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). As a control, HA-βC1ΔC43-nYFP didn’t interact with HA-cYFP-NbSKP1.1 or HA-cYFP-NbSKP1L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that NbSKP1s and NbSKP1L1 interact with CLCuMuB βC1 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the interaction of the two proteins occurs in nucleus and cell periphery of plant cells.</p>

Meanwhile CLCuMuB βC1 seems to have no inhibition on jasmonates biosynthesis according to JA level data measured by mass spectrum and HPLC.

<title>Exogenous MeJA Treatment Reduces Plant Susceptibility to CLCuMuV</title>
<p>βC1 interferes with SCF function to enhance geminivirus DNA accumulation and damages the integrity of SCF<sup>COI1</sup> complex to hinder JA responses.

<title>Molecular Basis of Virus Symptoms Elicited by Geminivirus βC1</title>
<p>Betasatellites are indispensable for some monopartite geminiviruses to induce viral symptoms in host plants. The sole protein βC1 encoded by several betasatellites, has been reported to be responsible for this phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref001">1</xref>]. However, how βC1 induces viral symptoms remain obscure. CLCuMuB βC1 was previously reported to interact with a tomato ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (UBC), SlUBC3, by its C-terminal myristoylation-like motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref022">22</xref>]. The myristoylation-like motif only exists in CLCuMuB βC1 and its close relative <italic>okra leaf curl betasatellite</italic> (OLCB βC1). However, OLCB βC1 does not interact with SlUBC3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref022">22</xref>]. Further, silencing of <italic>UBC3</italic> in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> did not cause any obvious phenotype and enhanced viral DNA accumulation in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005668.s018">S18 Fig</xref>). Thus, it is possible that symptoms induced by CLCuMuB might not be mediated by interaction between βC1 proteins and host UBC3 enzyme. Here, we demonstrate that CLCuMuB βC1 is also indispensable for symptom production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005668.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Through a series of interaction assays, we found that CLCuMuB βC1 interacts with NbSKP1s, important components of SCF complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Further, CLCuMuB βC1 interferes with the interaction between SKP1 and CUL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g003">Fig 3</xref>) to impair the function of SCF complexes, such as SCF<sup>COI1</sup> and SCF<sup>SYL1</sup> (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g007">7</xref>), which is consistent with the previous observation that overexpression of CLCuMuB βC1 in tobacco causes a global reduction of polyubiquitinated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref022">22</xref>]. We found that disrupting the function of SCF complexes by silencing of either <italic>SKP1</italic> or <italic>CUL1</italic> leads to some typical virus symptoms, such as severe leaf curling, crimping, leaf darkening and growth retardation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g005">5</xref>). Indeed, perturbation of the ubiquitin system can cause leaf curling and vascular tissue abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref047">47</xref>]. Further, overexpression of CLCuMuB βC1 blocked the degradation of GAI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g008">Fig 8</xref>), the target of the SCF<sup>SLY1</sup>, repressed plant responses to GA, which may explained why the presence of CLCuMuB make plant dwarf phenotype. These results suggest that some geminiviral βC1 proteins can elicit viral symptoms by disrupting the plant ubiquitination pathway by interfering with SKP1-CUL1 interaction through its interaction with SKP1.</p>
<p>Although <italic>NbSKP1s</italic> silencing is in fact causing higher accumulation of viral DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g004">Fig 4B1–4B3</xref>), the symptoms seem simply due to <italic>NbSKP1s</italic> silencing but not higher accumulation of virus, because we found higher accumulation of CLCuMuV DNA, but no symptom in plants infected with CLCuMuV and βM2-<italic>SKP1</italic>-176 which is generated though inserting the 176-bp <italic>NbSKP1</italic>.<italic>1</italic> fragment directly into βM2, without fused with the 169-bp <italic>βC1</italic> fragment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005668.s019">S19 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We noticed that silencing of either <italic>SKP1</italic> or <italic>CUL1</italic> did not produce all symptoms caused by CLCuMuB βC1. Besides leaf curling, crimping, darkening and growth retardation caused by silencing of either <italic>SKP1</italic> or <italic>CUL1</italic>, the viral symptoms elicited by CLCuMuB βC1 also include bending shoot and enations from abaxial side of leaves. <italic>Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus</italic> (TYLCCNV) βC1 was reported previously to elicit leaf morphological changes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> by mimicking the functions of ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 2 through its interaction with ASYMMETRIC LEAVES 1 and by repressing the accumulation of miR165/166 to subvert leaf polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref020">20</xref>]. Meanwhile, suppression of miR165/166 can cause enations from abaxial side of leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref048">48</xref>]. It is possible that CLCuMuB βC1 induces enations by suppression of miR165/166. Further, TYLCCNV βC1 may also induce viral symptoms by up-regulating the expression of a calmodulin-like protein (rgsCaM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref016">16</xref>]. Considering that geminivirus βC1 is a multiple functional protein, CLCuMuB βC1 may contribute to the viral symptoms by multiple mechanisms including disrupting the plant ubiquitination pathway.</p>

<title>Molecular Basis of Geminivirus βC1 Enhancing Virus Accumulation</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that CLCuMuB βC1 impairs the interaction between NbSKP1s and NbCUL1 by interacting with NbSKP1s and silencing of either <italic>NbSKP1s</italic> or <italic>NbCUL1</italic> enhances CLCuMuV DNA accumulation. Deletion of CLCuMuB βC1 reduced CLCuMuV titer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005668.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Silencing of either <italic>NbSKP1s</italic> or <italic>NbCUL1</italic> caused enhanced virus accumulation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g005">5</xref>). Geminiviruses may interfere with plant ubiquitination to suppress plant defense against geminivirus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref049">49</xref>]. It has been reported that V2 protein of <italic>Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus</italic> (TYLCSV) interacts with UBA1, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme, which is a positive regulator of plant defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref051">51</xref>], and silencing of either <italic>UBA1</italic> or <italic>RHF2a</italic> (RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase) in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> enhances TYLCSV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref052">52</xref>]. Geminiviral C4 activates expression of host RING E3 ligase RKP to ubiquitinate cell cycle inhibitors ICK/KRPs to help the replication of <italic>Beet severe curly top virus</italic> (BSCTV) via promoting cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref054">54</xref>]. However, how geminivirus βC1 proteins interfere with plant ubiquitination pathway to enhance viral accumulation is still obscure.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that CLCuMuB βC1 disrupted the integrity of SCF<sup>COI1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>). Meanwhile CLCuMuB βC1 does not inhibit JA biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005668.s014">S14 Fig</xref>). More importantly, JA treatment reduces the plant susceptibility to CLCuMuV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g008">Fig 8</xref>), which is consistent with the previous observation that JA treatment attenuates the infection of plant with <italic>Beet curly top virus</italic> (BCTV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref033">33</xref>]. TYLCCNB βC1 was reported to suppress JA-related host defenses for increasing population densities of their whitefly vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref021">21</xref>]. Further, <italic>Cabbage leaf curl virus</italic> (CaLCuV) infection can also repress JA response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref044">44</xref>]. The C2 proteins of TYLCSV, <italic>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus</italic> (TYLCV) and BCTV were reported to impair derubylation of SCF E3 ligase complexes and inhibit jasmonate signaling by interacting with CSN5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref033">33</xref>]. Thus, CLCuMuB βC1 could enhance CLCuMuV accumulation, at least partially by repressing JA responses through interfering with plant ubiquitination.</p>
<p>We observed that the levels of CLCuMuV DNA in <italic>SKP1-</italic> or <italic>CUL1-</italic>silenced plants were lower than that in the presence of CLCuMuB with functional βC1 although silencing of either <italic>SKP1</italic> or <italic>CUL1</italic> resulted in a higher accumulation of CLCuMuV DNA (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005668.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005668.s002">S2</xref>). It has been reported that knock-down of either CSN5A or CSN3, two components of protein degradation-related CSN complexes, hinders BCTV infection although knockout of <italic>Arabidopsis csn5a</italic> mutant can partially complement BCTV C2 mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref052">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref055">55</xref>]. Further, overexpression of a given F-box protein can circumvent the general SCF malfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref057">57</xref>]. These observations suggest that begomoviruses might not only hamper, but also redirect the activity of SCF complexes for begomoviruses propagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref033">33</xref>]. Very recently, ubiquitination is reported to regulate the stability of TYLCCNV βC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005668.ref058">58</xref>]. Thus, host plants, geminiviruses and their satellites may have evolved to exploit the dual roles of the ubiquitination pathway in plant defense and viral pathogenesis to co-survive in their long-term arm races.</p>

At 14 dpi, total DNA was extracted from each plant respectively and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR (means±SEM, n ≥7) to quantify viral DNA accumulation. <italic>EIF4a</italic> was used as the internal reference to calculate the relative amount of viral DNA. (<bold>C1, C2 and C3</bold>) Real-time RT-PCR confirmed silencing of <italic>NbSKP1s</italic>. Total RNA was extracted from upper leaves of each plant respectively and subjected to quantitative RT-PCR (means±SEM, n = 4) to quantify <italic>NbSKP1s</italic> mRNA level. <italic>EIF4a</italic> was used as the internal reference. The raw data of (B1–B3) and (C1–C3) were analysed by two-sample <bold><italic>t</italic></bold>-test to show the significance level at 0.05 (*), 0.01 (**) and 0.001(***). These experiments were repeated at least twice. (<bold>D1, D2 and D3</bold>) Symptoms of plants infected with CLCuMuV (CA) and βM2-<italic>SKP1</italic>-176 (A1), βM2-<italic>SKP1</italic>-184 (A2) or βM2-<italic>SKP1</italic>-351 (A3) at 21 dpi. No plants infected with CA+βM2-<italic>SKP1</italic>-176, about 50% plants infected with CA+βM2-<italic>SKP1</italic>-184 and all plants infected with CA+βM2-<italic>SKP1</italic>-351 showed typical symptoms.</p>
