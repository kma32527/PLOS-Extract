<abstract>
<p>TNFα is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine with a key role in the activation of the immune system to fight viral infections. Despite its antiviral role, a few viruses might utilize the host produced TNFα to their benefit. Some recent reports have shown that anti-TNFα therapies could be utilized to treat certain viral infections. However, the underlying mechanisms by which TNFα can favor virus replication have not been identified. Here, a rhabdoviral infection model in zebrafish allowed us to identify the mechanism of action by which Tnfa has a deleterious role for the host to combat certain viral infections. Our results demonstrate that Tnfa signals through its receptor Tnfr2 to enhance viral replication. Mechanistically, Tnfa does not affect viral adhesion and delivery from endosomes to the cytosol. In addition, the host interferon response was also unaffected by Tnfa levels. However, Tnfa blocks the host autophagic response, which is required for viral clearance. This mechanism of action provides new therapeutic targets for the treatment of SVCV-infected fish, and advances our understanding of the previously enigmatic deleterious role of TNFα in certain viral infections.</p>

<p>Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is one of the main pro-inflammatory cytokines produced in response to a broad type of infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref001">1</xref>].

In addition, some viruses might utilize the host produced TNFα to their benefit. Thus, anti-TNFα therapies could be utilized to treat certain viral infections. However, the underlying mechanisms by which TNFα can favor certain virus replication have not been identified. Here, we have used a viral infection model in zebrafish to identify the mechanism of action by which TNFα has a deleterious role for the host to combat certain viral infections. Our results demonstrate that Tnfa does not affect viral ability to infect host cells or to antagonize the main host antiviral pathway, namely the interferon pathway. However, Tnfa impairs viral clearance by blocking the host autophagy response, which is usually used by host cells to degrade unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular components, and that we found to be critical to eliminate intracellular viral particles. This mechanism of action provides new therapeutic targets for the treatment of SVCV-infected fish in aquaculture and probably to other viral infection affecting cattle industry and human.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is one of the main pro-inflammatory cytokines produced in response to a broad type of bacterial, viral and fungal infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref001">1</xref>]. TNFα has a crucial role in activating and orchestrating the immune response in order to protect the host organism from pathogens. TNFα deregulation can promote susceptibility to pathogens by impairing pathogen clearance and, ultimately, promoting maintenance of infection and death. When specifically talking about viral pathogenesis, TNFα has been shown to inhibit the replication of certain viruses such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the varicella zoster virus (VZV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref002">2</xref>]. In addition, anti-TNF therapies to treat autoimmune diseases exacerbate the infection produced by virus such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref003">3</xref>]. It is not surprising that due to the key role of TNFα in the host protection to viral infections, some viruses have developed different ways to interfere with the TNFα pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref004">4</xref>]. In contrast, it seems that a few viruses might utilize the host produced TNFα to their benefit. Interestingly, human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection induces TNFα expression. These increased TNFα levels in serum correlates to increased viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref005">5</xref>]. In accordance to that, TNFα inhibitors are able to impair HIV-1 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref006">6</xref>], and anti-TNFα treatments have been proposed to combat HIV-1 infection in combination with other therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref007">7</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref005">5</xref>]. Similarly, neutralization of TNFα decreases virus production in CMV-infected macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref008">8</xref>]. The ability of TNFα to favor virus replication has also been demonstrated for non-mammalian viruses, such as the spring viremia of carp virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref009">9</xref>], a fish rhabdovirus infecting cyprinids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref011">11</xref>]. Moreover, intraperitoneally SVCV-infected adult fish, in which recombinant TNFα was administrated simultaneously, has shown a higher mortality rate than fish injected with the virus alone. The mechanism explaining how TNFα facilitates viral infection and its deleterious effects in the host has not yet been proposed.</p>
<p>Since zebrafish is a cyprinid susceptible to SVCV infection, and TNFα can exacerbate SVCV infection, we chose this amenable infection model to investigate how a virus might utilize host produced TNFα to their benefit. To that end, we analyzed the role of zebrafish TNFα (Tnfa) in i) the key steps of SVCV pathogenesis: virus adhesion, fusion, and replication; and ii) in the antiviral host response, such as interferon production and autophagy. The results showed that Tnfa signaling through its receptor Tnfr2 inhibits autophagy, leading to impaired viral clearance in SVCV-infected cells. This mechanism of action provides new therapeutic targets for the treatment of SVCV-infected fish, and advances our understanding of the previously enigmatic deleterious role of TNFα in certain viral infections.</p>

<title>Tnfa increases susceptibility of zebrafish to SVCV infection</title>
<p>As in most infections, Tnfa is up-regulated in response to SVCV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref012">12</xref>]. Unexpectedly, this up-regulation rather than help to control the infection, has a deleterious role in adult zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref009">9</xref>]. To further study this phenomena, we first investigated whether or not Tnfa was also able to enhance SVCV replication both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. For that, we pre-incubated the zebrafish embryonic fibroblast cell line, ZF4, which expresses both Tnfrs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref009">9</xref>], with zebrafish recombinant Tnfa or interferon 1 (Ifn1, also known as Ifnphi1) for 4 hours and, subsequently, the treated cells were infected with SVCV. At 24 hours post-infection (hpi), viral replication, measured as the presence of transcript of the nucleoprotein that forms the SVCV capside (N protein), was evaluated by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). N protein transcripts significantly increased in Tnfa-treated cells and significantly decreased in Ifn1-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), suggesting that Tnfa enhances and Ifn1 decreases viral replication <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<p>Both insufficient and excess Tnfa have been shown to promote susceptibility to mycobacterial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref013">13</xref>]. We then asked whether endogenous rather than exogenous Tnfa was beneficial or detrimental to the host during SVCV infection. The percentage of animals that survived at 7 days post-infection (dpi) was significantly higher in Tnfa-depleted larvae when compared to controls (Tnfa expressing larvae) (55% versus 30%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005699.s002">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). The survival percentage of control and Tnfa-depleted uninfected larvae was 100% in both cases. In accordance to these results, qPCR analysis of embryos harvested at 48hpi showed that the highest levels of viral replication (measured as the amount of SVCV N protein mRNA in infected animal tissues) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), and virus particles (measured as the amount of negative sense RNA encoding SVCV G glycoprotein in infected animal tissues) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), were found in control larvae. These results were further confirmed in larva forced to express Tnfa RNA, which showed drastic increased susceptibility to SVCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g001">Fig 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005699.s002">S1C and S1E Fig</xref>). Together, these results indicate that Tnfa enhances SVCV replication and pathogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>The Tnfa/Tnfr2 axis mediates increased SVCV replication in zebrafish</title>
<p>TNFα exerts its activity through the binding and activation of two receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2 (Tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 and 2, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref014">14</xref>]. Tnf receptors are expressed early during zebrafish development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref015">15</xref>], and they both have important roles for the clearance of viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref016">16</xref>]. To further dissect the contribution of Tnfa signaling in SVCV pathogenesis, we performed loss-of-function experiments for both Tnfa receptors using specific antisense morpholinos (MOs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref015">15</xref>] in SVCV-infected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005699.s002">S1F–S1I Fig</xref>). Tnfr2-depleted larvae were distinctly more resistant to SVCV infection compared to their control siblings (60% versus 30%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), while Tnfr1-depleted larvae showed a slightly, but statistically significant, reduced survival compare to their control siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This result was supported by increased, or decreased, SVCV replication in Tnfr1- and Tnfr2-depleted larvae, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Accordingly, the presence of viral genomes was also higher in Tnfr1-depleted larvae and lower in Tnfr2-depleted larvae at 48 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). In addition, larva forced to express a RNA encoding a dominant negative (DN) form of Tnfr2, which is lacking the entire intracellular signaling domain and extinguishes Tnfr2 signaling by trimerization with endogenous Tnfr2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref015">15</xref>], showed increased resistance to SVCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g002">Fig 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005699.s002">S1D and S1E Fig</xref>).

<title>Tnfa does not affect viral adhesion or viral delivery from endosomes to the cytosol</title>
<p>To better understand the mechanism by which Tnfa enhances viral replication, we investigated the role of Tnfa in two key steps of SVCV pathogenesis, virus cell binding and the subsequent membrane fusion that allows virus release from the endosome to the cytosol. To interrogate if Tnfa could be facilitating the virus binding to the cell, we infected ZF4 cells for 30 minutes at 4°C to allow the virus adhesion but not its endocytosis and replication. Tnfa was added to ZF4 cells before or simultaneously to SVCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The number of viral particles adhered to Tnfa-treated cells (in both conditions, pre- or simultaneously added) was slightly lower than in the non-treated cells, assessed by qPCR of negative sense RNA encoding SVCV G glycoprotein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).

<p>After binding to the cell membrane, SVCV enters the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Subsequently, these early endosomes are acidified after fusing to lysosomes. Endosomal acidification triggers conformational changes in the G protein of rhabdovirus, releasing the virus genome into the cytoplasm and allowing their replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref018">18</xref>].

<title>Tnfa does not antagonize the antiviral role of interferon during SVCV infection</title>
<p>Interferon is one of the most powerful antiviral cytokine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref020">20</xref>]. It has been shown that interferons can act synergistically with TNFα to suppress virus replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref022">22</xref>]. However, TNFα and interferon can have antagonistic roles in certain cells such as human fibroblast-like synoviocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref023">23</xref>]. Therefore, we decided to investigate if the enhancing role of TNFα in SVCV replication was the result of impairing the interferon response during SVCV infection. ZF4 cells were pre-treated with Tnfa and/or Ifn1 for 4 hours. Subsequently, these cells were infected with SVCV alone or in combination with Tnfa. After 24 hours, qPCR analysis was performed to detect the expression of antiviral host genes and viral N protein transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The addition of Tnfa before or in combination with SVCV did not alter the transcript levels of the genes encoding major antiviral effectors, such as myxovirus (influenza) resistance b (Mxb), radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2 (Rsad2), Mxc and protein kinase containing Z-DNA binding domains (Pkz) compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005699.s003">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). In contrast, Ifn1-treated cells showed drastically increased levels of the transcripts for the same host genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005699.s003">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). Cells were then pre-incubated with 2 different dilutions of Ifn1 (1/100 and 1/500), alone or in combination with Tnfa, and subsequent SVCV infection was performed. Both Ifn1 dilutions were able to increase the RNA levels of <italic>mxb</italic>, though these levels were unaffected by the simultaneous addition of Tnfa, in both uninfected and infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that Tnfa does not antagonize the antiviral role of Ifn1 during SVCV infection. To verify that Ifn1 was indeed interfering with SVCV replication in ZF4 cells, SVCV replication was quantitated by RT-qPCR analysis of the N protein transcripts in SVCV-infected ZF4 cells pre-treated with Tnfa and Ifn1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g004">Fig 4A and 4E</xref>). While the N protein mRNA levels were up-regulated in Tnfa-treated cells, they were down-regulated in the Ifn1, as well as in the Tnfa/Ifn1 combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). This finding suggests that Ifn1 has a protective role against SVCV replication and that TNFα does not antagonize the antiviral role of Ifn1 during SVCV infection.</p>

<title>Tnfa inhibits autophagy</title>
<p>Since autophagy is an efficient antiviral mechanism in response to many viral infections including SVCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref025">25</xref>], we asked if Tnfa could interfere with the autophagy-mediated clearance of SVCV by host infected cells. ZF4 cells were incubated with Tnfa for 4 hours and autophagy levels were assessed by cellular LC3 distribution. Cells were treated with autophagy modulators, such as 3-Methyladenine (3MA) and rapamycin (Rapa) to respectively inhibit or enhance autophagy. As expected, autophagy (red puncta indicating L3C recruitment) was clearly diminished in 3MA-treated cells and, in contrast, strongly increased in Rapa-treated cells (both in number and size of the autophagosomes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Interestingly, Tnfa treatment diminished autophagosome formation suggesting that Tnfa inhibits autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In contrast, cells treated with heat-inactivated Tnfa (control Tnfa, CTnfa) did not affect autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).</p>

<p>After autophagy induction, the cytosolic soluble form of LC3 (LC3-I) is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (LC3-II), which is recruited to autophagosomal membranes. This process is conserved among vertebrates and present in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref026">26</xref>] and in fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref025">25</xref>]. Therefore, LC3-II/LC3-I ratio is commonly used to quantify autophagosome formation by western-blot (WB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref027">27</xref>]. In order to quantify autophagy formation in Tnfa-treated cells, western-blot for LC3 was performed from lysates of Tnfa-treated ZF4 cells at 4 hours post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The LC3-II/LC3-I ratio decreased by 2-fold in Tnfa-treated cells, but was unaltered in heat-inactivated Tnfa (CTnfa), indicating the negative impact of Tnfa in autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). As expected, the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio decreased after 3MA treatment and increased after Rapa addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). To further verify the Tnfa-mediated down-regulation of autophagy, ZF4 cells were pre-treated with Rapa for 4 hours and, subsequently, Tnfa was added for 4 hours and western-blot for LC3 was performed using the cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). The addition of Tnfa to Rapa-treated cells led to a 2-fold reduction in the autophagy activity compared to cells treated with Rapa alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). As expected, incubation of Tnfa alone reduced the autophagy activity by 2-fold compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). All together, these results indicate that Tnfa reduces autophagy in ZF4 cells. Moreover, these data suggest a role for Tnfa as a potent effector in reverting autophagy after this process has been initiated.</p>

<title>Tnfa impairs autophagy-mediated clearance of SVCV in ZF4 cells</title>
<p>We have previously demonstrated that autophagy has a protective role during SVCV and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref025">25</xref>]. To investigate whether Tnfa-mediated reduction of autophagy impairs SVCV clearance, ZF4 cells were pre-incubated with Tnfa prior to SVCV infection. As shown in the diagram of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, the virus foci forming units (ffu) were first detected by immunofluorescence against N protein alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), or in combination with LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g006">Fig 6D</xref>) or P62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). To evaluate whether these ffu correlated with the infective viral particles, the SVCV present in the supernatant (viral yield) was also isolated and titrated by plaque forming units (PFU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g006">Fig 6A and 6C</xref>). The ffu number increased in Tnfa-treated cells compared to untreated and CTnfa-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). However, no differences on the foci size were found between these two treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). As expected, 3MA increased the ffu number, while Rapa decreased it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Supernatant from cells treated with Tnfa contained 2.5-times more infective viral particles (4.5x10<sup>5</sup> pfu/ml) than un-treated (1,8x10<sup>5</sup> pfu/ml), or CTnfa-treated cells (1,4x10<sup>5</sup> pfu/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). As expected, 3MA-treatment also increased the SVCV pfu/ml (5,5x10<sup>5</sup>), while Rapa significantly decreased it (2,7x10<sup>4</sup> pfu/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Notably, although viral particles colocalization with LC3 and P62 puncta was hardly observed in control cells, probably reflecting the rapid degradation/loss of immunogenicity of the virus, it was nicely observed in cells treated with Tnfa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005699.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Tnfa impairs viral clearance through the inhibition of the autophagy response in infected cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although the administration of anti-TNFα therapies normally aggravates viral infections, there are a few reports suggesting that TNFα inhibition could be beneficial for the treatment of certain viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref005">5</xref>]. However, the mechanism by which viruses manipulate the host-produced TNFα for their own benefit had never been determined. Here, we have used the zebrafish as an infection model to examine <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> the mechanisms by which TNFα enhances viral pathogenesis. We utilized the previously established viral infection model of SVCV in zebrafish, in which excess Tnfa had already been reported to increase viral susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref009">9</xref>], to dissect the possible negative role of TNFα for the host during SVCV infection. Our studies demonstrate that Tnfa enhances SVCV replication through its receptor Tnfr2. Mechanistically, Tnfa does not alter SVCV binding to the cells, its escape from the endosome to the cytosol, or the Ifn-mediated antiviral response. In contrast, Tnfa inhibits autophagy both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, leading to decreased viral clearance and, consequently, to a higher susceptibility to the infection.</p>
<p>The increased survival of Tnfa- and Tnfr2-depleted larvae infected with SVCV demonstrates that Tnfa signaling through Tnfr2 has a deleterious effect in the host during SVCV infection. These results are further confirmed by the increased susceptibility of larvae forced to express Tnfa, confirming previous studies using recombinant Tnfa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref009">9</xref>], and by the increased resistance of larvae forced to express a DN form of Tnfr2. The fact that the percentage of survival of Tnfr1-depleted larvae is slightly reduced compared to control larvae suggests that Tnfa signaling through Tnfr1 might have some protective role against SVCV infection. Furthermore, the observation that Tnfr2 depletion leads to a much higher larval survival than Tnfa depletion (70% versus 55%, respectively), further supports dual roles for Tnfa during viral infection, being protective signaling through Tnfr1 and detrimental signaling through Tnfr2. However, the overall effect of Tnfa during viral infection is predominately harmful for the host. Therefore, we need to be aware that the manipulation of each Tnf receptor leads to different outputs than Tnfa depletion alone. Thus, the use of specific TNF receptor inhibitors, rather than TNFα neutralizing drugs, could prove to be beneficial for the treatment of TNFα-related pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref029">29</xref>]. The potential protective role of signaling through Tnfr1 during SVCV infection still remains unexplored, and further experiments should be performed to investigate this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Since this is the first study conducted to address the enhancing role of TNFα in viral pathogenesis, we decided to dissect the essential steps occurring during viral infection in order to identify which of them, if any, were affected by TNFα. These steps include virus adherence to the cell, release from the endosome to the cytosol, replication and new viral particle formation. Our studies demonstrate that Tnfa slightly reduces SVCV binding to the ZF4 cells yet the fact that this modest reduction is also observed when Tnfa is added simultaneously with the SVCV, suggests that Tnfa could be physically interfering with the SVCV rather than deterring its adhesion through the TNFα activation pathway. In addition, we also demonstrate that Tnfa does not affect the SVCV capability to escape from the endosome to the cytosol.</p>
<p>Here, we have characterized the possible interference of TNFα in two key antiviral cell mechanisms that restrict virus replication: interferon response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref030">30</xref>] and autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref031">31</xref>]. Our studies demonstrate that while Tnfa does not alter the interferon response during SVCV infection, it is able to diminish the viral-induced autophagic cell response <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although TNFα has generally been linked to an up-regulation of autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref035">35</xref>], it has also been shown that, in certain contexts, TNFα up-regulates mTOR activity through NF-κB, leading to autophagy inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref036">36</xref>]. In agreement with this, we provide evidences that Tnfa inhibits autophagy, which leads to increased viral susceptibility. Interesting, TNFα can also have a dual role in viral infection by promoting cell survival or cell death depending on the expression and activation balance of its receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref037">37</xref>]. Although further studies should be conducted to address whether the TNFα/TNFR2 axis indeed inhibits autophagy through the activation of NF-κB, this is quite plausible since Tnfr2 mainly regulates NF-κB activation in zebrafish larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref029">29</xref>]. It would be of interest to inhibit TNFα, or potentially TNFR2, in SVCV-infected carps for the treatment of this viral disease that produces abundant losses in aquaculture worldwide. In addition, it would be advantageous to manipulate the activation of TNF receptors in those viral infections in which autophagy plays an antiviral role, such as HSV1, HIV-1, Sindbis virus, chikungunya virus and West Nile virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref038">38</xref>]. It is important to emphasize that anti-TNFα therapies have already been suggested to be helpful for the treatment of some of these aforementioned viral infections, such as HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref005">5</xref>]. This therapeutic approach could have important health implications for the treatment of these devastating viral infections since, to date, there are no available treatments for the majority of them.</p>

<p>The SVCV infectivity <italic>in vitro</italic> was evaluated by two different methods, RT-qPCR and foci forming unit assays. To detect SVCV by RT-qPCR, ZF4 cells were cultured in 25 cm2 flasks at 80% confluence and treated with 100 ng/ml of zebrafish recombinant Tnfa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref009">9</xref>] or Ifn1 (dilutions 1/100 or 1/500) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref043">43</xref>] for 4 hours at 28°C and 5% CO2. Subsequently, the media was removed, cells were washed twice with the cell media containing 2% FBS and infected with SVCV (multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10<sup>−3</sup>) in the presence or in absence of Tnfa (100 ng/ml) at 22°C for 24 hours. Afterward, the media was removed, RNA extracted, cDNA obtained and qPCR carried out as below indicated. Two different sets of primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005699.s001">S1 Table</xref>) were used for SVCV detection: i) to quantify virus replication a primer pair amplifying the mRNA of N protein of SVCV and ii) to quantify the amount of viral genomes (negative sense RNA), a primer pair designed to detect the negative sense RNA encoding the gen of SVCV G protein.</p>
<p>For foci forming unit assays a previously developed methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005699.ref044">44</xref>] with minor modifications was used. Briefly, ZF4 cells, grown on 96-well plates, were treated with 0.1 μg/ml or 1 μg/ml Tnfa, 1 μg/ml heat inactivated (C Tnfa), 1 μM RAP or 10 mM 3MA at 28°C for 4 hours. After incubation, cell culture medium was removed and cells were infected with SVCV (multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10–2) at 22°C. Two hours post-infection, the supernatants from infected cell cultures were removed to eliminate non-bound virus, cell media containing 2% FBS added and plates further incubated for 24h. On the one hand, supernatants form infected cells were harvested and stored at -80°C for viral tritation to determine the virus yield as below indicated. On the other hand, cell were fixed with a solution of 4% formaldehyde (Sigma, F1635) for 15 min, washed with PBS and further fixed with cold methanol (−20°C) for 15 min.

<title>Viral binding assays</title>
<p>To analyze whether or not TNFα impairs the binding of SVCV viral particles to target cells, ZF4 cells grown in 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks at 80% confluence, were treated with TNFα (100 ng/ml) for 4 hours at 28°C. The media was then removed, cells were washed twice with the cell media containing 2% FBS and infected with SVCV (10<sup>−3</sup> MOI) in the presence or absence of TNFα (100 ng/ml) for 30 minutes at 4°C to allow virus binding/attachment but not its endocytosis.

After 24 h, the different treatments (1 μM RAP, 10 mM 3MA, Tnfa (100 ng/ml) or CTnfa (100 ng/ml) were added. After 4 hours of incubation, culture media was removed and cell monolayers were resuspended in 500 μl of PBS with a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma). Cells were then processed to a frozen/thawed cycle 4 times and protein concentration adjusted before loading protein samples onto the gel. Samples were then loaded in Tris—Glycine sodium dodecyl sulfate 17% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and the electrophoresis performed at 100 V for 90 min. The proteins in the gel were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad) for 75 min at 100 V in transfer buffer (2.5 mM Tris, 9 mM glycine, 20% methanol). The membranes were then blocked with 8% dry milk, 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS. Then, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibody microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain-3 (LC3)-I/LC3-II, a polyclonal antibody anti-LC3A/B (Cell Signaling Technology) diluted 1000-fold in PBS containing 5% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20 as indicated by the manufacturer. Membranes were then washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 for 15 min before incubation with GAR-Po in 0.5% milk in PBS for 90 min. After the last 3 washes with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, the peroxidase activity was detected by using ECL Select chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences, RPN2232) and revealed by exposure to X-ray. Protein bands were analyzed by densitometry using the Totalab Software. Analysis of LC3-I and LC3-II bands was performed and calculated as relative to the actin intensity band.
