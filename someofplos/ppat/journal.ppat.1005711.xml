<abstract>
<p>Biofilms are communities of bacteria that grow encased in an extracellular matrix that often contains proteins. The spatial organization and the molecular interactions between matrix scaffold proteins remain in most cases largely unknown. Here, we report that Bap protein of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> self-assembles into functional amyloid aggregates to build the biofilm matrix in response to environmental conditions. Specifically, Bap is processed and fragments containing at least the N-terminus of the protein become aggregation-prone and self-assemble into amyloid-like structures under acidic pHs and low concentrations of calcium. The molten globule-like state of Bap fragments is stabilized upon binding of the cation, hindering its self-assembly into amyloid fibers. These findings define a dual function for Bap, first as a sensor and then as a scaffold protein to promote biofilm development under specific environmental conditions. Since the pH-driven multicellular behavior mediated by Bap occurs in coagulase-negative staphylococci and many other bacteria exploit Bap-like proteins to build a biofilm matrix, the mechanism of amyloid-like aggregation described here may be widespread among pathogenic bacteria.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Major components of the biofilm matrix scaffold are proteins that assemble to create a unified structure that maintain bacteria attached to each other and to surfaces. We provide evidence that a surface protein present in several staphylococcal species forms functional amyloid aggregates to build the biofilm matrix in response to specific environmental conditions. Under low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and acidic pH, Bap is processed and forms insoluble aggregates with amyloidogenic properties. When the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration increases, metal-coordinated Bap adopts a structurally more stable conformation and as a consequence, the N-terminal region is unable to assemble into amyloid aggregates. The control of Bap cleavage and assembly helps to regulate biofilm matrix development as a function of environmental changes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Biofilm formation is universal for all bacteria. The molecular mechanisms governing this process vary among bacteria, but they all culminate in the synthesis of an extracellular matrix. The composition of the extracellular matrix is complex and variable, even within the same bacterial species when environmental conditions are altered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref002">2</xref>]. However, one common principle is that the matrix scaffold is built from exopolysaccharide or proteins, which eventually can be interwoven with extracellular genomic DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref005">5</xref>]. The reasons underlying the election of a polysaccharide or protein-based biofilm matrix are not well understood, but an increasing number of studies indicate that proteinaceous scaffolds are more common than previously anticipated. Proteins anchored to the bacterial cell surface can assemble the matrix scaffold through homophilic interactions between identical molecules expressed on neighboring cells or through heterophilic interactions with other surface proteins or with non-proteinaceous cell wall structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref007">7</xref>]. Members of this group of proteins include autotransporter adhesins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref011">11</xref>], carbohydrate-binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref014">14</xref>], and cell-wall anchored proteins covalently linked to the peptidoglycan (CWA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref021">21</xref>]. Another strategy by which proteins can contribute to the formation of the matrix scaffold is through polymerization into functional amyloid fibers. Secreted proteins can assemble to form insoluble fibers with a characteristic cross-β-strand structure, where the β-sheets run perpendicular to the fibril axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref022">22</xref>]. Once polymerized, amyloid fibers constitute a strong platform able to mediate interactions between the neighboring cells and surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref026">26</xref>]. Examples of amyloid fibers mediating biofilm development include curli pili present in <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref028">28</xref>], FapC in <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref029">29</xref>], TasA in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref030">30</xref>], the aggregative flexible pili named MTP in the pathogen <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref032">32</xref>] and phenol soluble modulins (PSMs) in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Biofilm associated proteins (Bap) are high molecular weight multi-domain proteins, characterized by a repetitive structure and localized at the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref034">34</xref>]. The first member of this family of proteins was identified in a mobile pathogenicity island (SaPIbov2) present in some strains of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. So far, the <italic>bap</italic> gene has been identified in mastitis-derived staphylococcal species, but has never been found in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> human isolates. However, <italic>bap</italic> orthologous genes are present in the core genome of several coagulase-negative staphylococcal species that belong to the human commensal microbiota such as <italic>S</italic>. <italic>saprophyticus</italic> ATCC15305 (Accession number GCA_000010125.1), <italic>S</italic>. <italic>epidermidis</italic> (GCA_000759555.1) and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>warneri</italic> SG1 (GCA_000332735.1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref035">35</xref>]. Bap promotes the initial attachment to inert surfaces and cell-to-cell interactions through a mechanism that is independent of exopolysaccharide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref036">36</xref>]. During infection, Bap facilitates the persistence in the mammary gland by enhancing adhesion to epithelial cells and prevents cellular internalization through the binding to GP96 host receptor, which interferes with the FnBPs mediated invasion pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref038">38</xref>]. Overall these results indicated that Bap plays a dual function: on the one hand, mediating bacterial-bacterial interactions and on the other, bacterial-host interactions. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Bap performs these functions and the region of the protein involved in each process remain unexplored.</p>
<p>In this report, we investigated the mechanistic basis by which Bap proteins promote the formation of the biofilm matrix scaffold. Our results have shown that Bap is constitutively expressed along the growth curve and processed. The resulting fragments, which likely contain mainly the N-terminal region of the protein, form insoluble amyloid–like aggregates when the pH of the media becomes acidic and the concentration of calcium is low. If calcium concentration increases, metal-coordinated Bap adopts a more stable conformation as shown by thermal denaturation monitored by intrinsic fluorescence, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), proteinase K digestion and analytical ultracentrifugation. As a consequence, the N-terminal region is unable to self-assemble and to mediate intercellular aggregation and biofilm formation. Furthermore, we show that biofilm assembly by Bap orthologs also depends on the critical N-terminal domain suggesting that the mechanism of biofilm assemblage is conserved in staphylococci. In view of these results, we propose that Bap plays dual role in the bacterial physiology, acting as a sensor and promoting biofilm formation, a configuration that has not hitherto been described for any component involved in biofilm formation.</p>

<title>Bap forms aggregates under acidic solution conditions</title>
<p>To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying Bap-mediated staphylococcal biofilm development, we monitored the expression of Bap in rich liquid media (LB-glu) along the growth curve using native and denaturing gel electrophoresis. Western immunoblotting under denaturing conditions revealed the presence of Bap from early stages of growth until the population entered stationary phase (OD<sub>600nm</sub> = 5). From that point, the levels of Bap decreased significantly in denaturing gels, whereas a band of high molecular weight appeared in the native gels suggesting that Bap formed aggregates when bacteria entered stationary growth phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>When <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> is grown in a media containing glucose, the entry in stationary phase is accompanied by a decrease in pH due to the accumulation of acidic byproducts from glucose fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref039">39</xref>]. We therefore investigated whether Bap aggregation and Bap mediated biofilm development were related and occurred in response to changes in the media pH. To investigate this hypothesis, bacteria were grown in LB-glu, where the pH levels dropped below 5 when bacteria reached stationary phase (OD<sub>600nm</sub> = 5) and in LB without glucose, where the pH remained neutral all along the growth curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Western immunoblotting revealed that Bap failed to form protein aggregates when bacteria grew in LB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Moreover, results showed a strong correlation between Bap protein aggregates and Bap mediated biofilm formation since bacteria grown in LB-glu (pH&lt;5) formed bacterial clumps and strong biofilms in microtiter plates whereas in LB media (neutral pH) Bap failed to promote bacterial clumping and biofilm development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). To further corroborate the effect of pH on aggregation of Bap-positive strains we evaluated cell clumping of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> V329 and ∆<italic>bap</italic> grown in LB medium acidified with 0.1 M HCl to pH 4.5.

Moreover, the two strains were also grown in LB-glu and, after an overnight incubation the medium was replaced by LB to evaluate the possible disassembly of bacterial aggregates. Indeed, no bacterial clumps and no biofilm were observed after media were exchanged indicating that the process of interbacterial interaction mediated by Bap is reversible when pH arises (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s002">S2C and S2D Fig</xref>). Together, these results suggest that acidification of the growth media promotes Bap aggregation and biofilm development.</p>

<title>N-terminal region of Bap forms oligomers and mediates biofilm development</title>
<p>If Bap is engaged in homophilic interactions during biofilm development, Bap aggregates should be composed primarily of the Bap protein. In contrast, if Bap mediates heterophilic interactions with other surface proteins, Bap aggregates should also contain additional proteins. To distinguish between these possibilities, we determined the protein content of the Bap aggregates by recovering the insoluble protein material retained within the wells of the stacking gel from preparations of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> grown in LB-glu and LB and analyzing their identity by mass spectrometry (MS). MS analysis of the material retained in gel pockets from preparations of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> grown in LB-glu identified peptides that corresponded mostly to the Bap protein strongly suggesting that this polypeptide is the main constituent of the aggregates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s018">S3 Table</xref>). Apart from Bap and some ribosomal proteins, the vast majority of the other identified peptides corresponded to proteins that were also detected by MS analysis from preparations of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> grown in LB medium, where no presence of Bap was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s018">S3 Table</xref>). We also discarded the possibility that additional matrix molecules such as PNAG or eDNA could be involved in the formation of the Bap aggregates since neither Bap insoluble aggregates nor Bap-mediated biofilms were affected by the treatment with dispersin B (DspB) and DNase I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s003">S3A, S3B and S3C Fig</xref>). MS analysis also showed that the identified peptides covered the N-terminal sequence of mature Bap almost completely (amino acid 49 to 819), but only a single short peptide from C repeats region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>) was observed. These results suggest that the insoluble aggregates likely contain Bap fragments that at least include N-terminal region.</p>

<p>To further investigate the mechanism of Bap proteolytic cleavage, we performed western immunoblotting of cell wall extracts of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> V329 grown in LB-glu and LB culture conditions. Results revealed that Bap was proteolytically processed in both media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), but the cleavage products obtained in LB were unable to form high molecular weight aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Western immunoblotting of surface proteins from cells grown in LB-glu extracted at different points of the growth curve showed the presence of degradation bands that increased in number and intensity as bacteria grew (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). Mass spectrometry analysis of the largest processed band confirmed that it corresponded to a degradation product of Bap containing at least the N-terminal region of the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Interestingly, when bacteria entered stationary phase (OD600nm≈4, pH&lt;5) bands corresponding to full-length and the resulting processed fragments of Bap disappeared from the gel and insoluble aggregates recognized by anti-Bap antibody were readily detectable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s004">S4B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>With the aim to identify the extracellular proteases responsible for the proteolytic processing of Bap, we constructed mutants in 3 extracellular proteases: a serine protease (V8 protease; SspA), a cysteine protease (SspB) and its specific inhibitor (SspC) and a metalloprotease (aureolysin; Aur). The resulting protease-deficient strains showed similar Bap cleavage patterns and formed cell clumps and biofilm at levels similar to wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s004">S4 Fig</xref>, left panels). Besides, addition to the culture media of protease inhibitors such as α<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin, E-64 (cysteine protease inhibitor), PMSF (serine protease inhibitor) and the inhibitor Staphostatin A (ScpB) that specifically targets the extracellular cysteine protease ScpA, did not interfere with Bap-mediated aggregation and biofilm development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s004">S4 Fig</xref>, right panels). Taking together these findings suggest that Bap is processed either by spontaneous cleavage or by the activity of a protease different from the ones tested here, or perhaps by the action of more than one protease. The resulting processed products are more aggregation prone and form the high molecular weight aggregates under acidic conditions.</p>

<title>Purified recombinant Bap_B protein adopts amyloid conformation at acidic pH</title>

<p>Next, we performed a biophysical characterization of the rBap_B domain. First, we determined the relative size of the aggregates by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The graphic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g004">Fig 4C</xref> illustrates the size characterization (hydrodynamic radius R) of rBap_B in solution at different pH. In the table, the correlation between the diffusion coefficient (D) of each population and its corresponding radius is shown. It can be observed that pH 4.4 is the condition at which rBap_B protein presented the highest hydrodynamic radius and the lowest D value (peak 2), as expected for aggregated particles that move slower that smaller particles, with a polydispersity percentage below 15% characteristic of monodispersed samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). At pH 3, rBap_B presented protein populations with intermediate R values. At neutral pH the obtained peak showed a D that once substituted in the Svedberg equation, together with the previously obtained experimental sedimentation coefficient, buffer density and partial specific volume, corresponded to the monomer of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Far-UV circular dichroism spectra (CD) of rBap_B showed a moderate increase in β-sheet structure (+5%) when the pH was acidified, at the expense of the predominant non-regular secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g004">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s019">S4 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we analyzed more in depth these β-sheet-rich rBap_B aggregates formed at acidic pH. We examined the amide I region of the Attenuated Total Reflectance–Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) spectrum (1700–1600 cm<sup>-1</sup>) of rBap_B ring assemblies. This region corresponds to the absorption of the carbonyl peptide bond group of the protein main chain and is a sensitive marker of the protein secondary structure. Deconvolution of the FTIR-absorbance spectra allowed us to assign the individual secondary structure elements and their relative contribution to the main absorbance signal. The FTIR spectra of rBap_B aggregates was dominated by β-sheet/β-turn components contributing &gt;80% to the signal. In particular, the strong bands at 1628 and 1694 cm<sup>-1</sup> were consistent with the presence of amyloid-like intermolecular β-sheet structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). To assess whether the prevalent intermolecular β-sheet in the rings formed by rBap_B aggregates was amyloid-like in nature, we evaluated the binding of the aggregates to the amyloid diagnostic dyes Thioflavin-T (ThT), Congo Red (CR) and ProteoStat. The presence of rBap_B aggregates induced a 25-fold increase in ThT maximum fluorescence emission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Interestingly, when fresh rBap_B was incubated at pH 4.5 for 5 min it bound readily to ThT in a concentration dependent manner, indicating a fast assembly of rBap_B into ThT positive structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). In contrast, no change in ThT fluorescence was observed when the protein was incubated at pH 7.0, independent of the protein concentration assayed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). The fast assembly of rBap_B at pH 4.5 was also evident from the strong increase in light scattering relative to the signal obtained at pH 7.0. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). These early assemblies displayed a strong binding to the dye bis-ANS, evidencing the presence of hydrophobic patches exposed to solvent, which potentially might recruit rBap_B monomers into the aggregates and/or contact other cellular molecules through non-polar interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s007">S7D Fig</xref>). In agreement with an amyloid-like conformation the absorbance of CR and its spectrum maximum red-shifted in the presence of rBap_B ring aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). The absorbance of ProteoStat, a novel fluorescent dye able to stain specifically amyloid aggregates <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref040">40</xref>], showed a 20-fold increase in its fluorescence maximum at 550 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Altogether, these data strongly suggest that the intermolecular β-sheet structures formed upon aggregation of rBap_B at pH 4.5 posses an amyloid-like conformation.</p>

<title>Identification and characterization of short amyloid stretches in Bap_B</title>

To identify the likely amyloidogenic regions in the series of Bap_B peptides previously identified by MS in the biofilm we used computational algorithms: AGGRESCAN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref044">44</xref>], PASTA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref045">45</xref>], WALTZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref046">46</xref>] and ZipperDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref047">47</xref>]. The predictions converged to indicate two Bap_B short sequence stretches as potentially amyloidogenic: TVGNIISNAG named as peptide I (aa 487 to 496), and GIFSYS named as peptide II (aa 579 to 584) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). We synthetized the two peptides and incubated them at 10 μM at pH 4.5. Both peptide solutions formed an evident gel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s008">S8 Fig</xref>), a property shared by many amyloidogenic peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref048">48</xref>] as well as biofilm matrices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref049">49</xref>]. Analysis of the structure of the two gels by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that they comprise fibrils with a typical amyloid morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>), and bound to ThT with high affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Taken together these data indicate that Bap_B contains at least two short regions with high amyloidogenic propensity. Analysis of these peptides using the RosettaDesign program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref050">50</xref>] implemented in ZipperDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref051">51</xref>] rendered average interaction energies of -25.0 and -25.9 kcal/mol for peptide I and peptide II and shape complementarities between strands of 0.87 and 0.81, respectively. These parameters are compatible with these peptides being able to form steric-zippers that might contribute to N-terminal Bap amyloid assembly. Of course, we cannot discard that the presence of several additional or alternative short amino acid stretches with amyloidogenic tendencies in the sequence of B-domain of Bap would be required for the assembly of the complete domain into aggregated structures at acidic pH.</p>

Similar fibers were detected in the surface of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> Δ<italic>bap</italic> when bacteria were grown in the presence of exogenously added rBap_B under acidic culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). We further analyzed the presence of fibers in wild-type <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> V329 grown under biofilm forming conditions. Consistent with all the findings obtained for the rBap_B domain, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> V329 contained fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>) that specifically reacted with gold-labelled anti-Bap antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g006">Fig 6G and 6H</xref>). Finally, we determined the presence of amyloid fibers in the Bap-mediated biofilm by staining the extracellular matrix of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> V329 grown in LB-glu medium with ProteoStat, a dye specific of amyloid fibers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s009">S9A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref040">40</xref>]. We also extracted from a gel native pocket the insoluble aggregated material of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> V329 strain and stained it with ProteoStat. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s009">S9B Fig</xref>, the dye stained the protein aggregates formed by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> V329 but not the Δ<italic>bap</italic> strain.</p>
<p>Also, we tested the effect of the compound (-)-epigallocatechine gallate (EGCG), known to exert an anti-amyloidogenic effect in the case of proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref052">52</xref>], on biofilm development by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> V329 wild type strain.

<title>Calcium inhibits the formation of Bap amyloid aggregates</title>

On the other hand, the wild type V329 and the Δ<italic>bap</italic> Bap_B strains mutated in their EF-hand 2–3 calcium binding motifs (ΔEF and Bap_B_ΔEF respectively) showed no disruption of either biofilm phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s010">S10C Fig</xref>) or protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s010">S10A and S10B Fig</xref>, right panels) in the presence of calcium. Moreover, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> V329 strain was grown in LB-glu and, after an overnight incubation the medium was replaced by LB-glu containing 20 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> to evaluate the possible disassembly of formed biofilm.

<p>To determine whether the inhibitory effect of Bap-amyloid aggregation induced by calcium is due to a change in protein structure upon binding to the cation we used several biophysical approaches. For this, it is important to clarify that because fast aggregation of rBap_B at pH 4.5 even at low protein concentration (0.01 mg/ml) makes difficult the characterization of the conformational properties of the soluble monomers at this pH, we analyzed the biophysical properties of the Bap_B domain in the presence of calcium at neutral pH. First, 1 and 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> are sufficient to induce a concentration dependent increase in the ellipticity of the far-UV CD spectra of rBap_B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Deconvolution of the spectra in the absence and in the presence of 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicated that the protein displays very similar secondary structure content in these conditions. The spectrum is dominated in both cases by disordered conformations, although a small reduction in the overall β-sheet content could be observed in the presence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> (the 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> spectrum could not be deconvoluted due to the strong increase in HT voltage below 200 nm in this condition). We next decided to monitor by near-UV CD and intrinsic fluorescence the overall tertiary structure of rBap_B in the presence or absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Despite no significant impact of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the environment of rBap_B aromatic residues could be observed by near-UV CD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s011">S11B Fig</xref>), the cation promotes a detectable increase in intrinsic fluorescence emission (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s011">S11C Fig</xref>), suggesting rearrangements in the tertiary context of the protein. To confirm the existence of a change in the aromatic residues environment, we performed thermal denaturation in the absence and in the presence of 1 and 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Results indicated that the temperature at which the protein loses half of its intrinsic fluorescence, augmented in the presence of increasing concentrations of calcium (1 and 10 mM), suggesting that the cation exerts a global stabilizing effect on Bap conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Further techniques support this idea. Analytical ultracentrifugation analysis revealed that, in the presence of calcium the rBap_B monomer exhibited a significantly higher sedimentation coefficient (s(20,w)∼3.4 versus ∼3.0). Additionally, rBap_B protein showed a frictional ratio f/f0 = 1.39, compatible with a slightly elongated protein, while in the absence of the cation the protein showed a frictional ration of 1.66 indicating a more elongated and moderately asymmetric protein shape (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g008">8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s012">S12A</xref>). Size exclusion chromatography analysis supported this by revealing that rBap_B is eluted with retard in the presence of calcium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s012">S12C Fig</xref>). Additionally, when we performed 1D-NMR of rBap_B in the presence or absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we observed an increase in the number of peaks corresponding to the methyl (0.5 ppm) and amide (8.5 ppm) regions of the spectrum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s012">S12D Fig</xref>). The broader line-widths observed in these regions in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> are in concordance with a molten globule that is semi stable and fluctuates between several conformations. The sharpening of the peaks when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is present would then be indicative of protein ordering into a more stable state with a smaller hydrodynamic radius (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s012">S12D Fig</xref>). Finally, analysis of Bap accessibility to proteolytic degradation in the presence of calcium showed that rBap_B was readily hydrolyzed by proteinase K in the absence of calcium, whereas it was protected from proteinase K activity when the cation was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g008">Fig 8F</xref>). Together all these results are consistent with the idea that Bap protein adopts a transient molten globule-like state in the absence of calcium prior to amyloid formation that is stabilized upon calcium binding thus impeding amyloid assembly due to tertiary rearrangements of Bap conformation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There is a growing recognition that proteins play an important role building biofilm matrix scaffold. To fulfill this function these proteins need to provide stable intercellular connections and at least in some cases, also mediate adhesion to the surface. In this report, we have shown that Bap forms extracellular amyloid-like fibers that assist in building the biofilm matrix in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. Bap shares structural and functional properties with SasG and Aap proteins of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>epidermidis</italic> respectively, implicated in cell-to-cell accumulation and adhesion to epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref054">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref056">56</xref>]. However, the mechanims of action of SasG and Aap are completely different to the one reported here for Bap. All three proteins undergo a limited proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal domain that induces biofilm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref057">57</xref>]. The mechanism underlying this processing is different among the three proteins. SasG is known to suffer spontaneous cleavage at labile bonds in its B domain, since protease inhibitors added to the growth medium, as well as strains deficient in each known extracellular and membrane-bound proteases, had no effect on the pattern of SasG processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref015">15</xref>]. In the case of Aap, endogenous and also exogenous host-derived proteases are the responsible for protein cleavage, and addition of α<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin to the growth medium specifically led to the loss of cell clumping and biofilm formation of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>epidermidis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref057">57</xref>]. We failed to identify a staphylococcal protease responsible for Bap cleavage, because protease mutants (∆<italic>aur</italic>, ∆<italic>sspA</italic> and ∆<italic>sspBC</italic>) and protease inhibitors (α<sub>2</sub>-macroglobulin, E64, ScpB and PMSF) did not change the proteolytic pattern of Bap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). However, the possibility that a protease different from the ones tested cannot be discarded and requires further study. In the case of SasG and Aap, the N-terminal domain is removed by proteolysis allowing the C-terminal region containing the G5 domains to promote zinc-dependent self-association of opposing molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref058">58</xref>]. In contrast, it is the N-terminal region of Bap that is released to the extracellular media and self-assembles into amyloid-like fibers, whilst part of the C-terminal repeats region remains anchored to the membrane. Several pieces of experimental evidence support the amyloid-like properties of the Bap_B domain aggregates. First, far-UV CD spectra reveal a modest switch in secondary structure of Bap from disordered to β-sheet, as the pH becomes more acid. Second, FTIR spectrum of Bap aggregates is dominated by β-sheet/β-turn secondary structure. Third, rBap_B binds to the amyloid diagnostic dyes Thioflavin-T, Congo Red and Proteostat and forms aggregates with fibrillar morphology when observed by electron microscopy. Finally, rBap_B contains short-sequence stretches with significant amyloidogenic potency that together with other unknown sequence stretches could contribute to the fibrillogenesis of Bap fragments. The self-assembly of rBap_B at acidic pH is a fast process, where hydrophobic interactions appear to play an important role, at least at the early stages of the reaction. Genuine bacterial functional amyloids utilize sophisticated machineries that direct the polymerization of amyloid fibers outside the cell.

Bap appears to follow a more simplistic model of amyloid auto-aggregation, which does not require the expression of accessory proteins. In this respect, amyloidogenic behavior of Bap could be similar to the mechanism conducted by the surface protein antigen I/II (adhesin P1) of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref063">63</xref>].</p>
<p>What are the underlying reasons for the conversion of a cell wall anchored protein like Bap into an amyloid fiber? Our results suggest that this strategy allows Bap to play a dual role during biofilm development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Initially, Bap is secreted and covalently anchored to the cell wall. Then, Bap is processed or non-enzymatically cleaved releasing fragments containing the N-terminal region to the media that remain soluble at neutral pH. If the pH of the environment decreases, the N-terminal domain of Bap would transition from its partially ordered native state to an aggregation-prone conformation that would facilitate polymerization into amyloidogenic fibrillar structures. The presence of calcium drastically influences the multicellular behavior promoted by Bap. From a biophysical perspective, the binding of calcium probably to the EF-hand domains of the protein, stabilizes its initial molten globule-like state, likely sequestering the functional N-terminal fragments released from Bap cleavage, and consequently impairing their self-assembly into amyloid structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g010">Fig 10</xref>).</p>

<title>Summary illustrating the effect of pH and calcium in Bap-mediated multicellular behavior.</title>
<p>Once located on the bacterial surface, Bap is processed or non-enzymatically cleaved liberating fragments containing the N-terminal domain of the protein that adopt a molten globule-like state. In acidic environments, Bap N-terminal fragments start to self-assemble and ultimately form amyloid fibers that mediate cell-to-cell contacts and biofilm formation through the interaction with the bacterial cell surface by a still unknown mechanism. On the contrary, and in spite of medium acidification, the presence of calcium divalent cations bound to Bap stabilizes the protein. Consequently, Bap is unable to self-assemble into amyloid fibers and does not mediate biofilm formation.</p>

<p>In eukaryotes, there are several examples of proteins involved in aggregation disorders, whose capacity to form multimeric aggregates depend on changes in protein folding caused by binding of metal ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref064">64</xref>]. This is the case of S100A6, an amyloid protein largely expressed in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) disease. When S100A6 binds calcium, it suffers a remodeling of the surface electrostatics and hydrophobic patch exposure at the aggregation hotspot inhibiting protein self-assembly into amyloid fibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref065">65</xref>]. In the case of bacteria, Ca<sup>2+</sup> bound to α-haemolysin secreted by pathogenic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, makes the protein more compact, stabilizing its structure and making it less prone to oligomerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref066">66</xref>]. In a similar way, the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to Bap causes tertiary rearrangements that increase the stability of the intermediate molten globule-like state of Bap in solution and thus decrease its aggregation behavior. This ultimately prevents cellular interactions and biofilm formation in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>.</p>
<p>Amyloid structures are especially well suited for assembling the biofilm matrix scaffold, as polymerization can occur in the extracellular media in the absence of energy. Furthermore, the amyloid structure provides high stability and inherent resistance against protease digestion and denaturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref067">67</xref>]. The pH at which the B domain of Bap shows aggregation activity (pH∼5, early stationary phase) is very close to the isoelectric point (pI∼4.61), where lack of a net charge facilitates interactions between protein molecules, making protein self-assembly more likely. Indeed, a large number of globular and non-globular proteins, including the pathogenic amyloid β peptide and α-synuclein have been shown to display maximum amyloid propensity when they approach their pI, indicating that the solubility of a polypeptide chain is a major factor that determines its conversion to the amyloid state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref068">68</xref>]. Because Bap assembly can be reversed when pH is restored to neutrality, it is not difficult to imagine that Bap is able to withstand pH fluctuations, adapting its function by switching from aggregated to soluble forms (and <italic>vice versa</italic>). The ability to fluctuate between soluble and amyloid-like states has been shown to underlie key physiological processes like processing bodies and stress granules formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref069">69</xref>], the cellular response to DNA breakage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref070">70</xref>] or the integrity of the cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref071">71</xref>]. In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> this mechanism may have a relevant physiological effect during infectious processes, in which local acidosis usually arises from the accumulation of acidic products as a result of an inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref072">72</xref>], and bacterial metabolism. Also, this pH-driven Bap-mediated bacterial aggregation mechanism would be physiologically significant for those <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> species expressing Bap homologous proteins that are capable of colonize human host niches displaying mildly acidic conditions (e.g., skin, anterior nares, vagina, urinary tract and mouth) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref073">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref074">74</xref>], as in the case of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>epidermidis</italic> (skin, vagina during prepubertal phase), <italic>S</italic>. <italic>saprophyticus</italic> (urinary tract and vagina) and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>warneri</italic> (skin, nasal cavity, urinary tract).</p>
<p>In a similar way, Foulston <italic>et al</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref039">39</xref>] demonstrated that many cytoplasmic proteins reversibly associated with the cell surface in response to pH, acting as a biofilm scaffold matrix in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. Regarding calcium ion, its effect on Bap functionality might serve to explain how changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels during the stages of the lactation cycle affect intramammary infections caused by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. Bap displays low binding affinity to calcium, thus medium-to-high millimolar concentrations of the cation are required to saturate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites in the protein. Normally, the concentration of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> in mammalian blood is strictly maintained between 1.1–1.3 mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref075">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref076">76</xref>]}. However, the total Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in milk is higher, around 1.2 mg/liter (~30 mM), being one third of this total amount free in serum (~11 mM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref077">77</xref>]. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels present in the milk during the lactation period are sufficient to inhibit Bap-mediated biofilm development. On the contrary, the low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration conditions that occur in the udder during the dry period allow the formation of Bap-mediated biofilms and the establishment of long-term persistent infections on the mammary gland epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>One question that remains open from this study is how Bap amyloid fibers interact with the bacterial surface to induce cell-to-cell aggregation? In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>coelicolor</italic>, it has been proposed that covalently linked cell wall chaplin variants ChpA–C contribute to anchoring the fibers to the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref059">59</xref>]. Following the same reasoning, one would expect that Bap amyloid fibers might interact with the C-terminal domain of Bap that remains covalently anchored to the cell wall. However, the finding that extracellular addition of rBap_B to <italic>bap</italic> deficient <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005711.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) and also to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>faecalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005711.s015">S15 Fig</xref>) promoted intercellular adhesion and biofilm formation makes this possibility very unlikely.</p>
<p>Finally, our results indicated that Bap orthologs share similar molecular mechanisms as Bap for mediating biofilm development. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>saprophyticus</italic> is a notable human uropathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref078">78</xref>]. The pH of the urinary tract varies between 4.5 and 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref074">74</xref>], representing an environment in which Bap, through the formation of amyloid aggregates and together with urease, UafA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref078">78</xref>] and other virulence factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005711.ref079">79</xref>] could play an important role in the survival and uropathogenesis of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>saprophyticus</italic>. Except for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>saprophyticus</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>simiae</italic>, the rest of CNS strains used in this study were mostly isolated from mastitis of lactating dairy cows (cultured from milk samples), a physiological situation in which the presence of calcium, as previously explained, can actually play a relevant role in regulating the functionality of Bap. The diversity of yet unknown factors that could affect Bap amyloid behaviour among different bacterial species is worthy of further study.</p>

The methyl region of the NMR spectrum includes high-field proton resonances observed at low chemical shifts (&lt;0.5 ppm), which indicate the presence of characteristic clusters of aromatic and methyl groups in the core of a structured protein. In addition, the envelope of peaks resonating at high chemical shift (&gt;8.5 ppm) correspond to highly ordered backbone amides present in secondary structure elements. The increase in the number of peaks within the fingerprint methyl and amide regions (arrowed) in the presence of Calcium indicate binding and induced structure in the Bap_B region.</p>
