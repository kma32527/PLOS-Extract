<abstract>
<p>Noroviruses (NoV) are the most common cause of non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis and cause local outbreaks of illness, especially in confined situations. Despite being identified four decades ago, the correlates of protection against norovirus gastroenteritis are still being elucidated. Recent studies have shown an association of protection with NoV-specific serum histo-blood group antigen-blocking antibody and with serum IgA in patients vaccinated with NoV VLPs. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of human monoclonal IgG and IgA antibodies against a GI.I NoV, Norwalk virus (NV). A higher proportion of the IgA antibodies blocked NV VLP binding to glycans than did IgG antibodies. We generated isotype-switched variants of IgG and IgA antibodies to study the effects of the constant domain on blocking and binding activities. The IgA form of antibodies appears to be more potent than the IgG form in blocking norovirus binding to histo-blood group antigens. These studies suggest a unique role for IgA antibodies in protection from NoV infections by blocking attachment to cell receptors.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Human noroviruses (HuNoV) have become the major etiologic agent of epidemic and sporadic acute gastroenteritis. There are currently no licensed vaccines or drugs to prevent or treat NoV infection. HuNoV infects people of all ages and, even though infection is characteristically acute and self-limiting, infection can become life threatening in children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. Human challenge studies have shown that HuNoV infection elicits a robust humoral immune response and that antibodies that block virus-like particles (VLPs) from binding to host attachment factors are a correlate of protection. Using high-efficiency hybridoma technology, we isolated binding and blocking human monoclonal IgA antibodies (mAbs) and additional human IgG mAbs specific to GI.1 NoV. When comparing blocking efficiencies between both isotypes, we also found that human IgAs blocked GI.1 NoV VLPs from binding to synthetic host attachment factors more effectively than did IgGs. To design a vaccine that elicits broad protective immunity, we must have a solid understanding of the NoV-mediated human antibody response to infection. This study provides valuable insight into the human humoral response to NoV infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Norwalk virus, the prototype of human noroviruses (NoVs), was the first virus identified in 1972 as a causative agent for acute gastroenteritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref001">1</xref>]. NoVs are the leading cause of epidemic acute and sporadic cases of gastroenteritis responsible for about 19‚Äì21 million cases of infection leading to &gt;70,000 hospitalizations and about 800 deaths annually in the U.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref002">2</xref>]. NoVs recently surpassed rotaviruses as the leading cause of pediatric non-bacterial gastroenteritis after the introduction of vaccines against rotaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref003">3</xref>]. The infection is typically self-limiting, lasts for 1‚Äì3 days, and is characterized by diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, stomach pain and fever, with more severe complications and chronic disease in the immunocompromised. Therapy involves rest and rehydration, and no specific therapeutic agent is currently available.</p>
<p>NoVs, members of the <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> family, are non-enveloped and contain a positive-sense, non-segmented single stranded RNA genome enclosed by a protein capsid. The genome codes for three open reading frames (ORF), with the first ORF coding for six non-structural proteins involved in viral transcription and replication. The second and third ORFs encode virus protein 1 (VP1) and VP2, respectively. VP1 is a major capsid ~60 kDa protein and can self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLP) that resemble native virions both morphologically and antigenically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref004">4</xref>]. The viruses are classified into at least six genogroups (GI, GII, GIII, GIV, GV and GVI), based upon the sequence of VP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref005">5</xref>]. The genogroups are further subdivided into genotypes, with GI and GII accounting for the most diversity with 9 and 22 genotypes, respectively. GI and GII NoVs are responsible for the majority of human infections, with the genotype GII.4 responsible for most. Human susceptibility to NoVs depends on the expression of histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) on the intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref006">6</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref008">8</xref>]. These blood group carbohydrates are thought to play a role as receptors or co-receptors based on recent studies of correlations between susceptibility, HBGA profile and secretor status (expression of secretor enzyme Œ±1,2 fucosyltransferase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>The correlates of protection in NoV infections are not completely understood. Almost all infected persons seroconvert, but epidemiological observations and clinical studies suggest that serum antibody measurable by traditional ELISA assays may not be long-lived or is otherwise insufficient to protect individuals from re-infection. Instead, the presence of anti-NoV Abs that block binding of virus to HBGA <italic>in vitro</italic> can protect from NoV gastroenteritis in the context of experimental challenge, suggesting a potential correlate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref012">12</xref>]. We showed previously that a serum HBGA blocking antibody titer &gt;200 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref013">13</xref>] or a serum hemagglutination inhibition titer of &gt;40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref014">14</xref>] is associated with protection of susceptible individuals from an experimental challenge. Deeper understanding of the immune response to human norovirus infection is hampered by the lack of a robust <italic>in vitro</italic> culture model and immunological reagents.</p>

<title>Ethics statement</title>
<p>Persons previously challenged experimentally with norovirus Hu/NoV/GI.1/Norwalk/68/US (Norwalk virus [NV]) were recruited to donate peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples for study.The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was obtained from the participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Donors</title>
<p>We obtained PBMCs that were isolated from heparinized blood by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Histopaque from donors 1‚Äì2 years following oral challenge with a GI.1 NV inoculum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref015">15</xref>]. The donors from whom the panel of antibodies were isolated had been challenged 26 or 12 months prior. Infection was demonstrated in the laboratory by detection of viral genome and antigen in fecal samples, by RT-qPCR and ELISA, respectively. In addition, the donors demonstrated a greater than four-fold rise in serum antibody levels by total antibody ELISA and by HBGA blocking activity.</p>

<title>Generation of EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) secreting NV-specific human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)</title>
<p>B cells were transformed by infection with Epstein Barr virus (obtained from supernatant of cultured B95.8 cotton top tamarin lymphoblastoid line) in the presence of 2.5 Œºg/mL TLR agonist CpG (phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotide ZOEZOEZZZZZOEEZOEZZZT, Life Technologies), 10 ŒºM Chk2 inhibitor [Chk2i] (Sigma), 10 Œºg/mL cyclosporine A (Sigma) and plated in 384-well culture plates. After 7 days of culture, cells from one 384-well culture plate were expanded into four 96-well culture plates containing CpG, Chk2i and irradiated heterologous human PBMCs to serve as feeder layers for the growth of lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) clusters. After an additional 3 days of culture, the supernatants were screened for binding to NV GI.1 VLP or disruption of the NV VLP‚Äìglycan interaction (described below). Briefly, 5 ŒºL of supernatant from each well of transformed B cell cultures (in a total assay volume of 50 ŒºL) were added to the wells coated with 1 Œºg/mL NV VLP. The bound antibodies were detected using alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-human Ig (Œ≥ and Œ±chain specific) (Southern Biotech). In blocking assays, 50 ŒºL of diluted supernatant as described above were mixed with NV VLP and the complexes were added to H3-PAA (Glycotech, Rockville, MD) immobilized on neutravidin-coated plates, as described below. Supernatants from LCL cultures (diluted 1:10 in assay buffer) that had been selected for rotavirus-reactive antibody were used as negative controls.</p>

<sec id="sec006">
<title>Generation of hybridomas secreting NV-specific mAbs from LCLs</title>
<p>Cells from wells with desired activity were subjected to electrofusion with HMMA2.5 myeloma cells. The fused cells then were cultured in a selective medium containing 100 ŒºM hypoxanthine, 0.4 ŒºM aminopterin, 16 ŒºM thymidine (HAT Media Supplement, Sigma HO262), and 7 Œºg/mL ouabain (Sigma O3125) and incubated for 14‚Äì18 days before screening hybridomas for antibody production by ELISA. Cells from the positive wells were cloned biologically by sorting single cells into 384-well plates using a FACSAria III fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Becton Dickinson), cultured for about 14 days and screened for antibody production.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Sequence analysis of antibody variable region genes</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from hybridoma cells and used for amplification of genes coding for the variable domains of the antibody clones. First-strand cDNA synthesis and RT-PCR were done with gene-specific primers as previously described (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005719.s006">S1 Table</xref>) using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer‚Äôs protocols.

<title>Isolation of NV-specific human IgG or IgA mAbs</title>
<p>Currently there is not a robust method for growing NoVs, but studies suggest that blocking the interaction of VLP with glycan moieties can be used as a surrogate for neutralization activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref025">25</xref>]. We sought to isolate blocking mAbs to the NoV capsid protein from volunteers challenged with NV. PBMCs isolated from two NV-immune donors were transformed with EBV, and the LCL supernatants were screened for binding to NV VLPs and separately for blocking of binding to H3-PAA glycan. The transformed B cells from cell line supernatants exhibiting IgG or IgA binding to VLPs or blocking of VLPs to the glycan, or exhibiting both activities, were expanded. The supernatants from expanded LCLs then were assayed again for binding to VLPs, and bound antibodies were detected using either polyclonal anti-IgG (Œ≥-specific) or anti-IgA (Œ±-specific) secondary antibodies to determine the isotype of the binding antibodies. We used polyclonal secondary antibodies, instead of monoclonal antibodies, to minimize any differences in sensitivity of the secondary antibody to gamma or alpha chains and confirmed that the affinities of secondary antibodies did not differ measurably (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005719.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). About 100 wells of the 384 wells tested were positive for NV binding. Of all the binding antibodies, a higher proportion of lines contained NV-specific antibodies that were IgG than IgA. However, the proportion of NV-binding antibodies that also exhibited blocking activity was higher for IgA antibodies than for IgG, suggesting that mAbs of the IgA isotype are highly over-represented in the repertoire of antibodies that block receptor binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005719.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The cells in the positive wells were fused with a myeloma partner to generate a hybridoma clone.

The VP1 protein has two major domains, the highly conserved shell domain and the highly variable protruding (P) domain. Each of the 10 mAbs bound to recombinant P domain preparations, suggesting that their binding epitopes are contained within the P domain.

<title>Isotype-switch variant IgG or IgA mAbs</title>
<p>Although IgA mAbs as a group appeared more potent in receptor blocking, that comparison is complicated by the fact that the IgA or IgG antibodies compared above with respect to blocking activity do not share the same variable regions. To determine if the variable domains of these antibodies contribute to the differences in activity, we analyzed the variable heavy and light chain genes of the antibodies, but did not find any unusual features in any of the antibody class in terms of gene families, mutation rate or CDR3 lengths (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005719.s007">S2 Table</xref>). To study the effects of antibody isotype on functional activity in a more defined manner, we prepared IgG or IgA versions of representative blocking antibodies using mammalian cell recombinant expression of isotype-switch variant Ig molecules. We synthesized cDNAs coding for the variable domains after optimizing the sequence of the genes computationally for expression in mammalian cells. The heavy chain antibody variable genes were cloned in expression vectors for expression as Œ≥ or Œ± chain. The light chain antibody variable genes were cloned in expression vectors for expression as Œ∫ or Œª chains. Recombinant polymeric IgA was obtained by co-expression of joining (J) chain along with the heavy and light chains. Electrophoresis of purified proteins on SDS-PAGE gels under non-reducing conditions confirmed the correct assembly of IgG and dimeric IgA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005719.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

To enable comparison between the molecular forms of each antibody, we calculated the ratio of <italic>blocking</italic> EC<sub>50</sub> to <italic>binding</italic> EC<sub>50</sub> for each antibody. A lower ratio of blocking to binding indicated that smaller amounts of antibodies bound to VLP were needed for blocking the VLP binding to their receptor.

This observation suggested that the higher potency of the IgA class of antibodies for blocking stems not only from their potential to make large polymeric Ig molecules with large capacity for steric hindrance following binding, but also from structural or functional features that are found even in the monomeric form of Ig molecules of that isotype.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The molecular basis of antibody-mediated inhibition of human NoV infection is poorly understood. It has been difficult to study NoV neutralization because of the lack of a robust cell culture system for growing virus. Recent studies suggest, however, that the presence of antibodies that block NoV-HBGA interactions is associated with protection against illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref024">24</xref>]. In this model, antibodies that disrupt the interaction of NoV VLPs with HBGA ligands thus act as putative virus neutralizing antibodies. The structural and functional features of these putative neutralizing antibodies are not known. Blocking activity of purified, serum-derived IgA antibodies was recently described, and our group recently identified serum IgA and salivary IgA antibodies as novel correlates of protection from NoV gastroenteritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref028">28</xref>]. In the studies presented here, we isolated a panel of hmAbs with potent NoV-HBGA blocking activity, representing IgA and IgG isotypes, from an immune individual following experimental virus challenge. The features of these antibodies reveal new aspects of antibody-mediated NoV inhibition.</p>
<p>The most interesting finding from these detailed studies is that naturally-occurring NoV-specific human antibodies of the IgA isotype exhibit enhanced potency for receptor blocking, compared to IgG antibodies isolated in a similar fashion. These data suggest that this enhanced potency stems from two principal factors. First, there appears to be some intrinsic structural or functional features of the IgA isotype that confer enhanced blocking activity, even in monomeric forms of IgA antibodies, compared to a matched IgG variant. It is known that IgG and IgA molecules differ in certain functional aspects, due to sequence polymorphisms in the constant domain[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref030">30</xref>]. In fact, previous studies with antibodies to other microbial agents have suggested that polymorphisms in the constant regions even of differing IgG subclasses can mediate a profound phenotypic change in the pattern binding of antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref031">31</xref>]. We did not determine the molecular basis for this effect against NV virus, but the enhancement is of interest as it has relevance to both antibody and vaccine design efforts.</p>
<p>Second, we found that dimeric IgAs exhibited enhanced potency for blocking compared to matched monomeric IgA or IgG counterparts. Most likely, this finding is due to the large molecular weight of dimeric IgA, which probably facilitates a more profound receptor blocking capacity.</p>
<p>It was interesting that many of the B cells we isolated from blood that encoded NoV-specific IgA secreted polymeric IgA in the naturally-occurring form. It has been noted previously that secreted IgA proteins in the serum typically are almost exclusively monomeric. However, we did not study serum antibodies here; rather we isolated NoV-specific IgA-encoding B cells from the blood, and many of these secreted dimeric IgA after recovery. It is possible that these cells are circulating in peripheral blood en route to mucosal tissues. The technique that we used predominantly isolates memory B cells, and we isolated these cells during the convalescent phase from the donor. Therefore, it is not anticipated that the cells would have been secreting dimeric IgA into the serum in the donor.</p>
<p>We performed sequence analysis of the antibody variable genes encoding these mAbs. The data show that there is a wide diversity of antibody variable genes that encode antibodies that block receptor binding. This finding is encouraging, because it suggests that there is no genetic restriction on the ability of diverse humans to make receptor-blocking antibodies to NoV. We examined the genetic features of the antibodies to see if there were any unusual characteristics. Some especially important domains in viral surface proteins that are susceptible to recognition by potent virus-neutralizing antibodies, such as HIV envelope or influenza hemagglutinin, are associated with unusual genetic and structural features such as long heavy chain CDR3 regions or a very high level of somatic mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref032">32</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref034">34</xref>]. We found that the NoV receptor-blocking antibodies did not possess any extreme genetic features. Diverse antibody variable genes were used, and the level of somatic mutation observed was typical of that found in human memory B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref036">36</xref>]. The length of heavy chain CDR3 regions was average, and there was no unusual occurrence of insertions or deletions.</p>
<p>Human NoVs cause acute gastroenteritis worldwide, and they exhibit a high degree of genetic variation in different geographical locations. Field strains of NoV evolve, and dominant novel strains emerge periodically that exhibit antigenic variation and differential glycan-binding specificities due to genetic changes that alter structure in the P domain of the NoV capsid protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref038">38</xref>]. HBGAs most likely function as co-receptors or cell attachment factors to NoVs, and thus they determine susceptibility to infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref039">39</xref>]. The structural basis for the interaction of the P domain of the NoV capsid protein with HBGAs is fairly well understood, but how particular sequence polymorphisms in this domain determine the effect on genogroup-specific biology is less well understood. We also do not understand how such sequence variations mediate binding or escape from human neutralizing antibodies. Further study of the mAbs that we isolated here should prove useful in this regard. These antibodies exhibited GI.1 NoV specificity, consistent with the background of the virus that was used for the donor challenge and with the antigen used to screen for the NoV-specific antibodies. Structural studies of the interaction of antigen-antibody complexes with these mAbs could elucidate the critical residues in the P domain that contribute to antibody recognition in a genogroup-specific manner. Further studies also would allow us to understand the mechanism by which NoV-neutralizing antibodies block HBGA binding, whether it is by directly binding or altering the conformation of the HBGA binding site or by sterically hindering access to the HBGA binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005719.ref040">40</xref>]. Such studies will shed light on additional factors that regulate protection from human NoV infection and disease.</p>

Monoclonal antibodies (mAb; starting concentration 60 Œºg/mL) were diluted initially 1:10 in PBS with 0.85% saline (pH 5.5), and then serially 2-fold diluted. Four hemagglutination units (~2 ng) of Norwalk virus VLPs were mixed with the diluted monoclonal antibodies and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The VLP-mAb mixture was added to an equal volume of 0.5% washed type O erythrocytes in 0.85% saline (pH 6.2) and incubated for 2 h at 4¬∞C. The HAI titer was determined by identifying the reciprocal of the highest dilution of mAb that inhibited hemagglutination by the VLPs.</p>
