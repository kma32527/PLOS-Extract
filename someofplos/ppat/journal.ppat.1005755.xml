<abstract>
<p>In human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), tropism to epithelial and endothelial cells is dependent upon a pentameric complex (PC). Given the structure of the placenta, the PC is potentially an important neutralizing antibody target antigen against congenital infection. The guinea pig is the only small animal model for congenital CMV. Guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) potentially encodes a <italic>UL128-131</italic> HCMV PC homolog locus (<italic>GP128-GP133</italic>). In transient expression studies, GPCMV gH and gL glycoproteins interacted with UL128, UL130 and UL131 homolog proteins (designated GP129 and GP131 and GP133 respectively) to form PC or subcomplexes which were determined by immunoprecipitation reactions directed to gH or gL. A natural GP129 C-terminal deletion mutant (aa 107–179) and a chimeric HCMV UL128 C-terminal domain swap GP129 mutant failed to form PC with other components. GPCMV infection of a newly established guinea pig epithelial cell line required a complete PC and a GP129 mutant virus lacked epithelial tropism and was attenuated in the guinea pig for pathogenicity and had a low congenital transmission rate. Individual knockout of <italic>GP131</italic> or <italic>133</italic> genes resulted in loss of viral epithelial tropism. A <italic>GP128</italic> mutant virus retained epithelial tropism and GP128 was determined not to be a PC component. A series of GPCMV mutants demonstrated that gO was not strictly essential for epithelial infection whereas gB and the PC were essential. Ectopic expression of a <italic>GP129</italic> cDNA in a <italic>GP129</italic> mutant virus restored epithelial tropism, pathogenicity and congenital infection. Overall, GPCMV forms a PC similar to HCMV which enables evaluation of PC based vaccine strategies in the guinea pig model.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Congenital CMV is a leading cause of mental retardation and deafness in newborns. An effective vaccine against congenital CMV remains an elusive goal. HCMV encodes a pentameric glycoprotein complex (PC) necessary for tropism to epithelial, endothelial and myeloid cells. Given the structure of the placenta, the viral PC is considered important for congenital infection and potentially an important neutralizing antibody vaccine target antigen. The guinea pig, with a placenta structure similar to humans, is the only small animal model for congenital CMV. In this paper, GPCMV is shown to encode a homolog PC which enables epithelial tropism on a newly established cell line. It is likely that the GPCMV PC improves virus tropism to various cell types as PC positive virus has improved virus pathogenicity and congenital infection in vivo. This study lays important foundations for development of a PC based intervention strategy against congenital CMV in this model.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV or Human herpesvirus 5) is a member of the <italic>Betaherpesvirinae</italic> genus and encodes over 165 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref001">1</xref>]. Viral infection is largely asymptomatic in healthy individual but establishes a lifelong mainly latent state in the host. However, infection of an immune compromised host (AIDS and transplant patients) or virus reactivation because of an impaired immune system can have severe consequences of morbidity or mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref003">3</xref>]. An additional important aspect of HCMV is congenital infection, where the virus crosses the placenta and infects the fetus in utero. This occurs in approximately less than 1% of live births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref004">4</xref>] in the US and causes serious symptomatic disease including mental retardation and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in newborns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref008">8</xref>]. The greatest risk of congenital infection is to mothers who acquire a primary infection during pregnancy and prior immunity can reduce the risk by up to 69% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref009">9</xref>]. Hence, the impact of a vaccine is potentially substantial, especially in countries where there is a greater risk of primary infection during pregnancy. These regions include the US, EU and Japan, where up to 50% of women of child bearing age are negative for HCMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref010">10</xref>]. Licensed HCMV antivirals are available for transplant and AIDS patients but not congenital CMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref011">11</xref>]. Consequently, development of a vaccine against congenital CMV is a high priority.</p>
<p>Any proposed intervention for the prevention or treatment of HCMV infection should ideally be evaluated in a pre-clinical model. Unfortunately, HCMV is extremely species-specific. Consequently, animal model pathogenicity, vaccine and antiviral studies are carried out using animal-specific CMVs, including mouse, rat, guinea pig and rhesus macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref016">16</xref>]. The guinea pig is unique insofar as it is the only small animal model to allow the study of congenital CMV infection, where the virus crosses the placenta and infects the fetus in utero unlike the mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref017">17</xref>]. Both human and guinea pig placentas are hemomonochorial containing a homogenous layer of trophoblast cells separating maternal and fetal circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref020">20</xref>]. Additionally, as with human pregnancy, the gestation period (approximately 65 days) can be divided into trimesters. Importantly, GPCMV congenital infection causes disease in the fetus and in newborn pups similar to those found in humans including SNHL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref023">23</xref>]. Consequently, the guinea pig model is best suited for testing of intervention strategies aimed at preventing congenital CMV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>A major drawback in GPCMV research has largely been overcome by the recent sequencing of the viral genome and the development of infectious BAC clones of GPCMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref029">29</xref>]. Indeed, manipulation of GPCMV BACs has allowed the preliminary study of some viral genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref036">36</xref>]. Additionally, the guinea pig animal genome has been sequenced (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/Cavia_porcellus/Info/Index" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ensembl.org/Cavia_porcellus/Info/Index</ext-link>) which enables the development of new reagents for this model. Analysis of the GPCMV genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref029">29</xref>] indicated that the virus encoded homologs to the HCMV glycoproteins (gB, gH, gL, gM, gN, gO) in genes co-linear with the HCMV genome (designated GP55, GP75, GP115, GP100, GP73 and GP74 respectively). In HCMV, these six glycoproteins (gB, gH, gL, gM, gN, gO) are required for fibroblast cell entry and they form the glycoprotein complexes, gCI (gB), gCII (gM/gN), gcIII (gH/gL/gO) on the viral membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref039">39</xref>]. Additionally, in HCMV these complexes are important neutralizing antibody targets and as such potential vaccine candidates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref044">44</xref>]. We recently demonstrated that GPCMV forms functionally similar glycoprotein complexes and these complexes are essential for infection of fibroblast cells as well as important target antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref036">36</xref>]. In both HCMV and GPCMV, the viral glycoprotein gB is the immunodominant neutralizing viral antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref049">49</xref>]. A recombinant HCMV gB has been investigated as a candidate subunit vaccine in phase II clinical trials but this provides at best approximately 50% efficacy despite high antibody titers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>The process of HCMV entry into the cell was assumed to occur via the mechanism of cell fusion mediated by gB but also requiring other glycoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref052">52</xref>]. Current studies indicate that it is the triplex (gH/gL/gO) and specifically gH/gL that promotes gB cell fusion in fibroblasts. This is in keeping with the general model for herpesviruses with core fusion being related to gB and gH/gL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref053">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref058">58</xref>]. However, gM/gN is considered essential for virus infection of all cell types and is the most abundant complex in the virion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref059">59</xref>]. Most of the earlier HCMV cell entry studies were performed on fibroblast cells with lab adapted strains of HCMV (eg. AD169). These viral strains lack the capacity to efficiently infect other cell types such as endothelial, epithelial cells. Clinical strains of HCMV also encode a pentameric glycoprotein complex (gH/gL/UL128/130/131) that enables viral entry into epithelial, endothelial and myeloid cells via an alternative pathway of cell entry that requires the pentameric complex (PC) in association with gB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref060">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref066">66</xref>]. Alphaherpesviruses, unlike CMV, only encode one type of gH/gL complex. However, some gammaherpesviruses (eg. Epstein-Barr virus) encode two different gH/gL complexes to enable gB fusion into different cell types entry which potentially provides a model for CMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref054">54</xref>]. It is likely that gH/gL based complexes work upstream of gB for cell entry but this is poorly defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref058">58</xref>]. The alternative route of CMV cell entry will be referred to as the PC dependent pathway in this report. However, studies suggest that gO, which is unique to all CMV, also enhances infection of epi/endothelial cells by an undefined mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref067">67</xref>]. PC dependent virus infection of epithelial and endothelial occurs via a clathrin-independent endocytosis pathway with the endosomes undergoing an acid flux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref068">68</xref>]. PC dependent virus infection of dendritic cells is independent of pH but dependent upon cholesterol via macropinocytosis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref069">69</xref>]. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that virus entry into fibroblast cells can also occur via a pH/clathrin independent macropinocytosis pathway in virus devoid of the PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref070">70</xref>]. Undoubtedly, the PC is necessary for efficient entry into epithelial and endothelial cells. The viral locus encoding the PC unique genes (<italic>UL128-131</italic>) is unstable upon passage of clinical HCMV strains on fibroblast cells and encoded genes rapidly acquire point mutations or deletions with the subsequent loss of epi/endothelial viral tropism associated with the inability to form a functional PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref071">71</xref>]. Lab adapted strains of HCMV (eg. AD169) can infect epi/endothelial cells when the mutated locus is repaired or functional genes are expressed in an ectopic location which enable PC formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref072">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref073">73</xref>]. The basis for HCMV forming gH/gL/gO triplex or gH/gL PC is poorly defined but both complexes are present on the virion of clinical strains but ratios differ between strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref074">74</xref>]. Potentially, competitive binding of gO or UL128 with gH/gL might be a key stage but UL148 protein has also been suggested to play a role in the balance between these complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref075">75</xref>].</p>
<p>The PC is considered an important neutralizing target for HCMV on epithelial/endothelial cells and presumably for congenital infection, given the epi/endothelial structure of the placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref076">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref078">78</xref>]. The importance of the PC as a target antigen was confirmed by the isolation of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies to the PC which had higher potency than antibodies to other target antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref076">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref077">77</xref>]. In the context of congenital infection, high titer neutralizing antibodies are thought to be effective against transplacental viral transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref076">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref079">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref080">80</xref>]. Potentially, a delay in the immune response to the PC results in fetal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref081">81</xref>]. The importance of the PC in virus infection of cells is underscored by a recent finding for the gB subunit HCMV vaccine. In clinical trials, the gB vaccine induces a high titer neutralizing immune response which is effective in neutralizing virus on fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref082">82</xref>]. However, in separate studies sera from gB vaccinated individuals is less effective at neutralizing virus infection on endothelial and epithelial cells in comparison to convalescent sera from HCMV infected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref078">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref083">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref084">84</xref>]. This demonstrated the importance of other viral neutralizing target antigens for infection on these cell types. Consequently, other target antigens should be considered important in the development of a vaccine against congenital CMV. Importantly, a gB vaccine fails to fully protect against congenital CMV in the guinea pig model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref085">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref086">86</xref>].</p>
<p>Potentially, GPCMV encodes a homolog PC as a <italic>UL128-131</italic> homolog locus (<italic>GP128-133</italic>) was identified in low pass ATCC viral stock of GPCMV, strain 22122 (ATCC VR682) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref087">87</xref>]. The sequence of this virus also matched that of salivary gland (SG) GPCMV (extensively serially passaged in vivo in guinea pigs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref025">25</xref>]. However, a plaque purified isolate (designated PP ATCC), used to establish the first GPCMV sequence, carried a deletion in this locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref015">15</xref>]. PP ATCC had normal growth kinetics in tissue culture but was attenuated in vivo compared to SG GPCMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref026">26</xref>]. We hypothesized that the viral attenuation was linked to the inability of the virus to form a homolog pentameric complex which impacted on virus cell tropism to specific cell types (eg. epithelial cells) and consequently pathogenicity in the animal. Virus cell tropism was evaluated with a newly established guinea pig renal epithelial cell line. The potential interactions of GPCMV homolog glycoproteins gH and gL with proteins encoded in the <italic>GP128-133</italic> locus were studied to provide evidence of a GPCMV PC. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref063">63</xref>]. Additionally, a GPCMV mutant virus which encoded an intact locus but a mutated <italic>GP129</italic> gene (<italic>UL128</italic> homolog) was restored for epithelial tropism by expression of a full length <italic>GP129</italic> cDNA in an ectopic location. This recombinant virus (GP129FRT) incorporated a myc tagged GP129 into the viral particle as part of the PC. Knockout of <italic>GP129</italic>, <italic>GP131</italic> or <italic>GP133</italic> (<italic>UL128</italic>, <italic>UL130</italic> and <italic>UL131</italic> homologs respectively) in recombinant GPCMV impaired virus replication on epithelial cells but not fibroblasts. Importantly, virus restored for PC had improved pathogenicity and congenital transmission rates compared to mutant virus lacking the complex. Overall, the similarity of function between HCMV and GPCMV pentameric complexes strengthens the guinea pig model in the development of an effective preclinical vaccine strategy against epithelial and congenital infection based on the CMV PC.</p>

<title>GPCMV epithelial tropism requires a full length <italic>UL128-131</italic> homolog locus</title>
<p>In earlier reported studies of GPCMV, strain 22122 (ATCC VR682), the pathogenic salivary gland (SG) virus was maintained by serial passage in animals but could be attenuated by extensive serial passage of the virus on fibroblast cells, &gt;11–25 passes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref088">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref089">89</xref>]. However, the molecular basis for this attenuation was undefined and the viral stocks of the SG and fibroblast passaged virus are no longer available (Griffith (Yale University, CT) personal communication to AM). A potential basis for the viral attenuation in GPCMV might be by modification of a homolog <italic>UL128-133</italic> locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref087">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref090">90</xref>]. In clinical HCMV strains, adaptation of the virus to growth on fibroblast cells rapidly resulted in mutations in this locus and impaired virus tropism to various cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref060">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref071">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref091">91</xref>]. Inoue and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref087">87</xref>] identified two variants of GPCMV in low pass ATCC stock of GPCMV (strain 22122). One GPCMV variant was intact for the homolog <italic>UL128-131</italic> locus (<italic>GP128-GP133</italic>), whereas the other carried a deletion in the locus and was similar in sequence to the tissue culture adapted GPCMV isolate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref029">29</xref>]. GPCMV, strain 22122 (ATCC), was serially propagated in guinea pigs at Children’s Hospital Research Foundation, Cincinnati (Ohio, USA) from the late 1980s-2005. Salivary gland (SG) viral stocks were extensively used in congenital GPCMV challenge studies by a number of investigators. This SG virus stock was recently sequenced and shown to encode a full length <italic>GP128-133</italic> locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref092">92</xref>], whereas the tissue culture adapted virus derived from the SG GPCMV stock used to establish the first viral genome sequence carried a deletion in this locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref015">15</xref>]. In this present study, GPCMV salivary gland stock SG11 (11 direct serial passages in guinea pigs) was used to evaluate the sequence of the <italic>GP128-133</italic> locus in the virulent virus. Additionally, plaque purified (PP ATCC) virus stock extensively passaged on fibroblast cells was used to evaluate the sequence of lab adapted virus. PCR primers ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref087">87</xref>], <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s001">S1 Table</xref>) were used to amplify the <italic>GP128-GP133</italic> locus and the PCR product cloned prior to sequencing. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g001">Fig 1(i)</xref> shows the structure of the <italic>GP128-133</italic> locus and the analysis of the cloned PCR products for the <italic>GP128-133</italic> locus from respective viruses. Sequence analysis of the cloned PCR products (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g001">Fig 1(ii)A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s003">S1 Fig</xref>) confirmed that the two virus stocks (SG GPCMV and PP ATCC plaque isolate) differed in an identical fashion to the two isolates reported in low pass ATCC stock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref087">87</xref>]. The SG GPCMV had a complete <italic>GP128-133</italic> locus (2 kb PCR product), whereas the PP ATCC virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref026">26</xref>] carried a 1.6 kb deletion (0.4 kb PCR product) which removed the majority of the <italic>GP129-133</italic> coding sequence (196,925–198,573) as shown by PCR analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g001">Fig 1(ii)A</xref>). This potentially supports the hypothesis that a full length <italic>GP128-133</italic> locus is necessary for full tropism/pathogenicity in vivo since GPCMV mutated in the <italic>GP128-133</italic> locus is attenuated in the animal model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref029">29</xref>].

<p>In HCMV, a consequence of adaptation of clinical strain virus to fibroblast cells is an inability for the virus to form a functional PC (gH/gL/UL128-131) necessary for infection of epithelial or endothelial cells and other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref060">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref062">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref071">71</xref>]. Potentially, GPCMV encodes a homolog PC but cellular tropism associated with this locus has not been successfully demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref090">90</xref>] except for infection of macrophage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref093">93</xref>]. A major limitation in GPCMV studies is the availability of different types of tissue culture cell lines to evaluate virus tropism. Consequently, we generated a novel guinea pig renal epithelial cell line from the kidney. Colonies were clonally isolated, characterized by cytokeratin marker and cell lines immortalized as described in materials and methods. Epithelial cells were characterized by assay for cytokeratin, either by western blot or immunofluorescence assay (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s005">S3 Fig</xref>). The guinea pig epithelial cells were positive for cytokeratin unlike GPL cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s005">S3 Fig</xref>). Importantly, SG GPCMV was capable of infecting and replicating on epithelial cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g001">Fig 1(ii)</xref> shows virus infected epithelial cells co-stained for cytokeratin (cytoplasm) and GPCMV IE2 protein (nucleus), see panels C and B respectively. In contrast, viral antigens failed to be detected in PP ATCC GPCMV infected epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s006">S4 Fig</xref>) but control studies demonstrated virus infection of fibroblast cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s006">S4 Fig</xref>). Additionally, a growth curve of SG GPCMV vs PP ATCC demonstrated that virus with an intact <italic>GP128-133</italic> locus can infect and replicate on epithelial cells, whereas the PP ATCC mutant virus was highly impaired for growth on epithelial cells, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g001">Fig 1(iii)A</xref>. In contrast, both viruses were capable of normal growth on fibroblast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g001">Fig 1(iii)B</xref>).</p>
<p>It was concluded that the SG GPCMV has the ability to replicate on epithelial cells, unlike lab adapted GPCMV. Additionally, tropism was a result of a SG GPCMV virus encoding a complete <italic>GP128-133</italic> locus unlike lab adapted virus. This could be verified by comparative sequence analysis between isolates which indicated that the only difference between viruses related to the <italic>GP128-133</italic> locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref087">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref094">94</xref>].</p>

<title>Pentameric glycoprotein complex formation and impact of GP129 mutants</title>
<p>In order to study GPCMV pentameric glycoprotein complex formation, full length cDNA clones of <italic>GP128</italic>, <italic>GP129</italic>, <italic>GP131</italic> and <italic>GP133</italic> were cloned into mammalian expression vectors or recombinant adenovirus vectors under HCMV MIE promoter control as described in materials and methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref036">36</xref>]. Additionally, ORFs were C-terminal epitope tagged to enable detection: GP129 (myc); GP131 (HA); GP128 (FLAG); and GP133 (FLAG). Also, previously described GP75 (gH ORF) and GP115 (gL ORF), C-terminal tagged with GFP or mCherry respectively, in mammalian expression plasmids or recombinant defective adenovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref036">36</xref>] were utilized in the study. All constructs were verified by sequencing and are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s007">S5 Fig</xref>.</p>
<p>An initial series of experiments examined the cellular localization of the various GPCMV proteins. Cells transduced with defective adenoviruses expressing gH, gL, GP129, GP131 and GP133 resulted in a cytoplasmic co-localization of gH and gL with GP129, GP131 and GP133 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s007">S5 Fig</xref>). Next, an immunoprecipitation assay was performed on cells that expressed all the components of the potential pentameric complex to demonstrate protein:protein interactions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g002">Fig 2(i)</xref> demonstrated that transduction of epithelial cells with recombinant adenovirus encoding a single glycoprotein enabled their successful detection by western blot analysis using their respective epitope tag marker. Transient expression of gHGFP and gLmCherry have previously been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref036">36</xref>]. Western blot analysis of transiently expressed GP129myc, GP131HA and GP133FLAG produced proteins with larger than expected size: GP129myc (expected 24 compared to 40kDa); GP131HA (25 compared to 31 kDa); GP133FLAG (16.7 compared to 19 kDa) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s002">S2 Table</xref>). It was presumed that this was a result of post-translation modification such as glycosylation as previously demonstrated for gH and gL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref036">36</xref>]. Potentially, both glycosylated and non-glycosylated versions of GP131HA are seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g002">Fig 2(i)</xref> as proteins at two different molecular weights (approximately 31 and 25 kDa) are detected.

<p>Next, GFP-trap (Chromotek) immunoprecipitation (IP) assays were used to detect interaction with gH-GFP/ PC formation in cells transduced by all five recombinant adenoviruses (AdgHGFP, AdgLmCherry, AdGP129myc, AdGP131HA and AdGP133FLAG), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g002">Fig 2(ii)</xref>.

Interestingly, both species of GP131HA were immunoprecipitated. In contrast, a control GFP trap IP of cells transduced with AdGFP, AdgLmCherry, AdGP129myc, AdGP130HA and AdGP133FLAG but not AdgHGFP resulted in successful IP of GFP but none of the components of the PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g002">Fig 2(iii)</xref>), which demonstrated the specificity of the IP assay as well as the importance of gH in the interactions with other PC proteins. A similar series of PC immunoprecipitation reactions were also performed using RFP-trap (Chromotek) with gLmCherry and control mCherry. All PC components were able to be precipitated by gLmCherry IP which demonstrated the importance of gL for PC formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s009">S7 Fig</xref>).

<p>Next, we investigated the impact of C-terminal GP129 (UL128 homolog) mutants on the ability to form a pentameric complex with other GPCMV proteins. An initial study was carried out with a natural GP129 mutant. The second generation GPCMV BAC derived virus encodes the full spectrum of viral genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref095">95</xref>] but contains a 4 bp deletion in the <italic>GP129</italic> gene, which places the ORF out of frame and truncated the encoded protein at codon 102 (NRD13, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s010">S8 Fig</xref>). Virus derived from this BAC has normal growth kinetics on fibroblast cells but lacked the ability to grow on epithelial cells (see section on restoration of epithelial tropism). A cDNA clone of the truncated GP129 mutant (designated GP129NRD13) was myc-epitope tagged and cloned into a transient expression vector and assayed for an ability to form a PC in a GFP trap immunoprecipitation assay. Despite detectable GP129NRD13 expression levels, the protein failed to be immunoprecipitated as part of a PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This indicated the importance of the C-terminal domain of GP129 in complex formation. A chimeric GP129 C-terminal mutant was also generated synthetically that encoded the C-terminal domain of HCMV UL128 (Merlin strain) in place of GP129 after the NRD13 truncation site (designated GP129UL128, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s010">S8 Fig</xref>). In transient expression studies, the GP129UL128 chimeric protein failed to form a PC with other components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This indicated that there was insufficient conservation between the C-terminal domains of GPCMV GP129 and HCMV UL128 to enable PC formation. Although the GP129 mutants could not be precipitated as part of a PC, the gHGFP immunoprecipitation reactions did pull down other components of the complex (gL, GP131 and GP133). Potentially, components of the PC were capable of forming subcomplexes with gH/gL. Consequently, the ability of GP129, GP131 and GP133 to independently form triplexes with gH/gL was investigated. In transient expression immunoprecipitation assays based on gHGFP, gH/gL formed triplex complexes with GP129, GP131 or GP133 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Protein cellular co-localization could also been demonstrated in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g004">Fig 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s011">S9 Fig</xref>). The relevance of the various subcomplex triplexes to the PC or to the gH/gL/gO triplex formation and viral assembly remains to be more fully investigated in future studies but would indicate that gH/gL interaction is not solely dependent upon GP129. Subcomplex formation was also investigated for the GP129 mutant. Triplex formation could not be demonstrated to occur with gH, gL and GP129 NRD13 with a similar outcome to that obtained for interaction with all PC components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This implied that the C-terminal portion of GP129 was also important for subcomplex formation. Overall, it was concluded that GPCMV forms a homolog pentameric complex and that the UL128 homolog (GP129), especially the C-terminal domain is important for complex formation.</p>

<title>Restoration of epithelial tropism in lab adapted GPCMV and requirement for components of the <italic>GP128-133</italic> locus</title>
<p>GPCMV serially passaged in animals as salivary gland stock retained an ability to infect epithelial cells unlike lab adapted virus. The second generation GPCMV BAC encoded a full length <italic>GP128</italic>-<italic>GP133</italic> locus but carried a 4 bp deletion that truncated the GP129 ORF (NRD13 mutant, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s010">S8 Fig</xref>) compared to wild type virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref095">95</xref>]. Transient expression of GP129NRD13 protein together with other components of the pentameric complex (gH, gL, GP131 and GP133) failed to generate a detectable PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Additionally, BAC derived GPCMV lacked epithelial tropism but grew normally on fibroblast cells (see below) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref096">96</xref>]. The capability of BAC derived GPCMV to form a functional pentameric complex and potentially restore epithelial tropism was evaluated by the introduction of a full length <italic>GP129</italic> cDNA expression cassette into the GPCMV genome in a non-essential intergenic locus. The intergenic site between <italic>UL25</italic> and <italic>UL26</italic> homologs <italic>(GP25</italic> and <italic>GP26)</italic> was selected on the basis of co-terminal transcripts ending in this locus with sufficient intergenic sequence to enable insertion of an ectopic cassette without interfering with GP25 or GP26 expression based on previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref025">25</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s012">S10 Fig</xref>). A cDNA myc tagged GP129 ORF used in transient expression studies was cloned initially into a shuttle vector (pGP2526GP129LinkKm) which placed the <italic>GP129</italic> cDNA under SV40 promoter and SV40 polyA control as described in materials and methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s013">S11 Fig</xref>). Mutant GPCMV BAC clones were selected by kanamycin (Km) marker. Full length GPCMV BAC mutants encoding GP129myc in the <italic>GP25/GP26</italic> locus were verified by restriction enzyme profile analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s014">S12 Fig</xref>) and by PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s013">S11 Fig</xref>) and sequencing. DNA from correctly identified mutant GPCMV BACs were transfected onto GPL cells to generate virus (GP129FRT). Virus expression of myc tagged GP129 and protein incorporation into the virus particle was demonstrated by western blot analysis of sucrose gradient purified viral particles. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g005">Fig 5</xref> demonstrated that GP129myc was expressed in virus infected cells. Additionally, that GP129 was present in the purified viral particles as was GP131, another unique component of the PC. Glycoprotein gH could also be detected in virus particles, presumably as part of the triplex homolog (gH/gL/gO) and also the pentameric complex (gH/gL/GP129/GP131/GP133). Additionally, gB glycoprotein could be detected as a viral particle component but not GFP, which was expressed in infected cells but not incorporated into the viral particle. A growth curve confirmed that GP129FRT GPCMV was highly trophic for epithelial cells with efficient virus growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g006">Fig 6</xref>). In comparison, the parental derived GPCMV BAC virus NRD13 which encoded a truncated GP129 but viable GP131 and GP133 failed to efficiently replicate on epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Overall, it was concluded that epithelial tropism could be restored to lab adapted GPCMV by ectopic expression of a missing full length GP129 protein. This virus (GP129FRT) expressed GP129 and GP131 proteins as part of the viral particle. Knockout of individual genes in the <italic>GP128-GP133</italic> locus in the backdrop of virus expressing the ectopic full length GP129 also confirmed the essential role of GP131 and GP133 in PC formation and epithelial tropism. Knockout of the <italic>GP128</italic> gene did not prevent epithelial tropism and transient expression of GP128 demonstrated that it was a nuclear targeting protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g007">Fig 7</xref>). The functional significance of GP128 in the GPCMV life cycle remains unknown. BLAST analysis of the predicted GP128 protein sequence indicated that it was a potential homolog of MCMV IE2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref015">15</xref>] and therefore is unlikely to be relevant to PC formation.</p>

<title>Alternative pathway of cell entry can be demonstrated in GPCMV by elimination of glycoprotein triplex formation (gH/gL/gO) and retention of glycoprotein PC formation</title>
<p>In a previous study, it was demonstrated that GPCMV forms a homolog gH/gL/gO glycoprotein triplex and that gO (GP74) was only essential in lab adapted virus which lacked a PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref036">36</xref>]. In an effort to demonstrate that the PC is more important than the triplex complex for infection of epithelial cells, a series of gO (GP74)/ GP129 mutant GPCMV BACs were transfected onto GPL or epithelial cells to evaluate virus spread. Three GPCMV BAC mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g008">Fig 8</xref>) were used: (1) GP74Km, which contains a GP74 knockout on a GPCMV BAC that lacked a full length GP129 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref036">36</xref>]; (2) NRD13, GPCMV BAC that lacked full length GP129; (3) GP129FRT/GP74Km, GPCMV BAC that encoded a GP74 knockout and a full length GP129 cDNA in the GP25/GP26 intergenic locus. Transfection of GP74Km GPCMV BAC DNA (1) onto GPL or epithelial cells failed to enable the development of viral plaques but instead remained as single transfected cells which could be identified by GFP reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g008">Fig 8A–8C</xref>). Transfection of NRD13 (GP129 mutant) GPCMV BAC (2) onto GPL or epithelial cells resulted in the development of viral plaques and spread on fibroblast cells but failed to produce virus on epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g008">Fig 8D–8F</xref>). Transfection of GPCMV BAC GP129FRT/GP74Km onto GPL and epithelial cells resulted in the development of viral plaques on both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g008">Fig 8G–8I</xref>). Importantly, virus derived from BAC GP129FRT/GP74Km demonstrated that gO was not completely essential for epithelial cell infection.as virus spread across the entire monolayer of epithelial cells. Although GPCMV infection of epithelial cells could occur in the absence of gO via the PC, the gB glycoprotein was presumed to be required for epithelial cell infection as demonstrated for fibroblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref036">36</xref>]. In an additional experiment, a PC+ /gO+/gB (GP55) negative mutant GPCMV BAC (GP129FRT/GP55Km) when transfected onto epithelial cells failed to produce infectious virus. In contrast, a gB rescue virus had restored epi-tropism which emphasized the essential nature of the gB protein for epithelial infection despite the requirement for a PC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s016">S14 Fig</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref036">36</xref>]</p>

<p>Since infection of epithelial cells occurred for a PC+/gO negative virus but not for a PC negative/gO+ virus, we concluded that epithelial cell infection is not absolutely dependent upon gO or the gH/gL/gO triplex but the PC is essential for epithelial cell infection. Admittedly, this particular assay was relatively crude since it fails to fully discriminate between cell to cell spread and infection from cell release virus. However, the strategy demonstrated an importance of the PC for epithelial cell infection. A similar approach defined the essential nature of the GPCMV glycoproteins (gB, gH, gL, gO, gM and gN) for fibroblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref036">36</xref>]. In HCMV, a PC+/gO+ virus can more easily infect epithelial cells than a PC+/gO negative virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref067">67</xref>]. Therefore in HCMV, gO has an undefined role in infection of cell types other than fibroblasts via an undefined mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref036">36</xref>]. The role of gO in potentially enhancing GPCMV infection of epithelial cells and other cells types remains to be evaluated.</p>
<p>In HCMV, PC dependent infection of epithelial and endothelial cells occurs via an endocytic pathway that requires an acid flux in the endosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref061">61</xref>]. The antibiotic bafilomycin prevents HCMV infection of epi/endothelial cells by inhibiting the ATPase and subsequent acidification of the endosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref097">97</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref098">98</xref>]. Pretreatment of guinea pig epithelial cells with 50nM bafilomycin dramatically inhibited virus infection of epithelial cells but did not greatly impact on fibroblast cell infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s017">S15 Fig</xref>). This potentially indicated that GPCMV entry into epithelial cells is via a similar pathway to HCMV. More focused future studies on the process of GPCMV entry into epithelial cells might provide better insight into the entry pathway for GPCMV and the similarity to HCMV. Analysis of the level of PC compared to gH/gL/gO on GPCMV particles might be worthy of future investigation as this might help to define virus cell tropism.</p>

<p>In an effort to determine if expression of the PC increased virus pathogenicity, comparative animal studies were performed with different GPCMV: GP129FRT (group 1); SG GPCMV (group 2); and NRD13, BAC derived GPCMV (group 3). Seronegative animals were randomly divided into three groups (n = 12 per group) and animals were each inoculated with 10<sup>6</sup> pfu of virus (either GP129FRT, SG GPCMV or NRD13 dependent on their specific group). At various time points (4, 8, 12 and 27 days post infection), three animals per group were euthanized and the viral load in target tissue and blood were determined by real time PCR as described in materials and methods. The results of the viral pathogenicity study are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g009">Fig 9</xref>. Statistical analysis (Student t test) was carried out for GP129FRT vs SG GPCMV and GP129FRT vs NRD13 on tissue from similar target organs at similar time points. Overall, the GP129FRT virus had a dissemination pattern that resembled SG GPCMV during the first 12 days of infection in target organs lung, liver and spleen (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g009">Fig 9A–9C</xref>). The viral load in the salivary gland was not evaluated until day 27 and was detected for both GP129FRT and SG GPCMV. The viral load in the salivary gland was approximately 1 log higher for the SG GPCMV compared to GP129FRT which was significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.005). Additionally, at day 27 the SG GPCMV could be detected in the target organs lung, liver and spleen, whereas GP129FRT could only be detected in the spleen. Overall, in the target organs there was a statistically significant difference (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.05 to &lt;0.005) in viral load between GP129FRT and SG GPCMV except in the liver (D4 and D8) and spleen at D4. Both SG GPCMV and GP129FRT exhibited similar viremia levels at days 4, 8 and 12 post infection, with peak levels detected at 8 days post infection. No viremia was detected at day 27.</p>

<p>In contrast to GP129FRT and SG GPCMV, the parental BAC derived NRD13 virus (encoding a truncated GP129) was highly attenuated in the animal model, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g009">Fig 9</xref>. NRD13 was detected in lung, liver spleen at days 4, 8 and 12 post infection but at substantially reduced levels compared to GP129FRT and SG GPCMV. At all comparable time points, viral titer in all NRD13 tissues were significantly lower with <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005 when compared to GP129FRT (except D4 lung and liver, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). NRD13 failed to be detected in any target organs at day 27 and was not present in the salivary gland. In contrast to the other viruses, NRD13 viremia at all time points was below the level of detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g009">Fig 9E</xref>). Presumably, the inability of NRD13 to form a pentameric complex and inability to infect a wider range of cell types precluded the ability of NRD13 to effectively disseminate or replicate in target organs. Overall, it was concluded that restoration of an ability to express a missing full length GP129 protein resulted in a virus that could not only infect epithelial cells in tissue culture but also had a greater pathogenicity in the animal model compared to the parental GP129 mutant virus (NRD13). Importantly, the GP129FRT virus was capable of disseminating to the salivary glands unlike the GP129 mutant.</p>

<title>Ectopic expression of GP129 and increased viral congenital infection</title>
<p>The placenta consists of both epithelial and endothelial cells, the improved tropism of the GP129FRT virus for epithelial cells and other cell types in vivo could also potentially increase the congenital transmission rate of the virus compared to the parental NRD13 virus. Seronegative pregnant dams were challenged with 10<sup>6</sup> pfu of NRD13 (group 1, n = 8) or GP129FRT (group 2, n = 11) at late second trimester via subcutaneous inoculation and animals were allowed to go to term. The viral load in pup target organs (liver, lung, spleen, brain) of live or still born animals was evaluated. <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1005755.t001">Table 1</xref> has the mortality outcome for live vs still born pups for the groups. <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1005755.t002">Table 2</xref> has the viral load in the target organs of the pups (live and dead).There was a higher number of still born pups in the GP129FRT group (9 pups, 17.3%) compared to the NRD13 group (2 pups, 6.5%).</p>

<p>Overall, there was a greater incidence of organs positive for virus in the GP129FRT group compared to the NRD13 group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In the latter group, only the brain was detected positive for virus in one pup and all organs were negative in all other animals. In the GP129FRT group, 20/52 pups had virus detected in various organs (brain, liver, spleen and lung). The transmission rate for the GP129FRT virus was 38.46% compared to 3.2% for the NRD13 virus, which was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0002). It should be noted that none of the still born pups in the NRD13 group were positive for virus and their death in utero was likely a complication of pregnancy and not associated with congenital CMV infection.</p>
<p>Only a limited number of term placentas were available for evaluation of viral load (2 for GP129FRT group and 7 for NRD13 group) but only the GP129FRT infected animals had CMV positive placentas (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1005755.t002">Table 2</xref>). The presence of GP129FRT virus in the placenta (3<sup>rd</sup> trimester) of an additional pregnant guinea pig was evaluated by immunohistochemistry at day 22 post-infection. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g010">Fig 10</xref> shows the results for immunohistochemistry staining of cryostat sections of placenta for GPCMV gB antigens. The presence of virus in placenta tissue was also verified by DNA extraction and PCR. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g010">Fig 10</xref> Panel A shows a cartoon of the placenta structure and indicated regions where viral antigen was detected in cryostat sections (C and D). Panel B shows an agarose gel PCR analysis for DNA extracted from virus infected epithelial cells or placenta section. The PCR was for the <italic>GP128-GP133</italic> locus and only a full length locus (2 kb) was detected. Panels C and D are sections stained for GPCMV gB protein. Representative control sections (no primary antibody) are shown in panels E and F. Virus was mainly detected in the interface of the labyrinth region of the placenta. These results confirm the presence of viral antigens in the placenta. We concluded that the GPCMV congenital transmission rate was highly dependent upon the virus encoding a functional GP129/ PC. A wider range of virus cell tropism would presumably be a requirement for effective congenital transmission to the fetus since the maternal fetal barrier in the placenta consists of a layer of epithelial syncytiotrophoblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref099">99</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref100">100</xref>].</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Electron microscopy histopathology studies of guinea pig salivary gland (duct cells) and placental tissue (trophoblast cells) from GPCMV infected animals suggested that GPCMV can infect epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref101">101</xref>]. Retrospectively, these were important observations in the context of viral tropism and recent identification of a novel mechanism of HCMV infection of epithelial and endothelial cells and other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref060">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref064">64</xref>]. Our recent knockout mutagenesis studies of GPCMV glycoprotein genes (encoding homologs of gB, gH, gL, gO, gM, or gN) demonstrated a conservation of essential function and homolog glycoprotein complex formation (gB, gH/gL/gO and gM/gN) between HCMV and GPCMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref102">102</xref>]. This present study demonstrated that the <italic>UL128-131</italic> homolog locus (<italic>GP129-GP133</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref028">28</xref>] was necessary for GPCMV infection of guinea epithelial cells in tissue culture and that tropism is dependent upon the ability to form a pentameric homolog complex which is structurally present in the viral particle. GPCMV knockout mutagenesis demonstrated that pentameric complex formation and epithelial tropism was dependent upon an ability of the virus to express wild type GP129, GP131 and GP133 but that GP128 was non-essential for complex formation, nor epithelial tropism. Furthermore, improved epithelial tropism, pathogenicity and congenital infection in the animal model could be established for a mutant virus (<italic>GP129</italic> mutant in the <italic>GP128-133</italic> locus) via ectopic expression of a wild type <italic>GP129</italic> cDNA and subsequent ability to form a homolog pentameric complex. Importantly, GPCMV pentameric complex formation is dispensable for infection of fibroblast cells, as is the case for HCMV. Curiously, Auerbach et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref090">90</xref>] showed an enhancement of GPCMV fibroblast infection associated with a full length <italic>GP129-133</italic> locus. Our studies with both GPL fibroblast cells and in house primary fetal embryo fibroblasts did not determine a dependence upon an intact <italic>GP128-133</italic> locus for fibroblast virus infection. Similarly, Inoue and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref026">26</xref>] did not see PC dependence for infection of primary or immortalized guinea pig fibroblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref028">28</xref>]. Surprisingly, Auerbach and colleagues failed to demonstrate a specific tropism for endothelial cells in virus with an intact <italic>GP128-133</italic> locus compared to virus with a deletion in that locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref090">90</xref>]. Based on our epithelial tropism data and in vivo pathogenicity studies, the prediction would be that PC positive GPCMV would exhibit increased tropism to a wider range of cell types. This increased range would include endothelial cells. HCMV exhibits the same requirement for the PC for cell entry in both epithelial and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref064">64</xref>]. In addition to the current reported epithelial cell line, we have recently isolated two guinea pig placenta derived epithelial cell lines which have the same stringency of requirement for the GPCMV pentameric complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref103">103</xref>]. Importantly, studies on guinea pig leukocyte cells suggest that the PC is necessary for infection on these cell types, which is a similar requirement as seen for HCMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref093">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref104">104</xref>].</p>
<p>Potentially, in the Auerbach et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref090">90</xref>], the endothelial cell population, which were isolated by flow cytometry using cross reacting antibodies, there was a low level of contaminating fibroblast cells, which would prevent a contrasting requirement for the pentameric complex for cellular infection. In our study, epithelial cell isolation was carried out by conventional cloning strategy and antibody staining of cells for cytokeratin marker. Additionally, the immortalized cell lines were re-cloned and characterized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s005">S3 Fig</xref>). In contrast, Auerbach et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref090">90</xref>], elected to employ RT-PCR analysis of total cell monolayer lysate to characterize their primary endothelial cells despite von Willebrand factor antibody being successfully used to identify guinea pig endothelial cells in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref105">105</xref>]. Consequently, the uniformity of their endothelial cell line remains to be fully confirmed. Importantly, newly isolated epithelial cell lines from the guinea pig placenta demonstrate that GPCMV infection of specialized placental cells requires the PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref103">103</xref>] which further supports the hypothesis that increased congenital transmission is PC dependent. This also explains the increased congenital infection rate observed in virus encoding the full length <italic>GP128-133</italic> locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref106">106</xref>].</p>
<p>Transient expression of the homolog components of the penatmeric complex (gH, gL, UL129, UL131, UL133) in epithelial cells resulted in complex formation in the absence of other viral components and this confirmed the results by Auerbach et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref090">90</xref>] which used purified recombinant baculovirus expressed protein to form pentameric complex in vitro. Importantly, a natural C-terminal deletion mutant of the GP129 protein (codons 102–179) from a virus lacking epithelial tropism (NRD13) was incapable to forming a pentameric complex with other complex components. The importance of C-terminal domain of GP129 for stable PC formation in recombinant GPCMV remains to be further evaluated.</p>
<p>In this current report, PC mutant studies were limited to GP129 but the generation of mutants of other PC components (eg. GP131 or GP133) would be worth evaluation in future studies to aid in the definition of critical domains for complex formation. In HCMV, the UL128 protein interaction with gH/gL is a potentially important key stage because of disulphide bond formation with gL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref055">55</xref>]. In our GPCMV studies, we demonstrated that interactions with gL as well as gH is important for PC formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s009">S7 Fig</xref>). Additionally, gH/gL/GP129 triplex complexes occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g004">Fig 4</xref>), but disulphide bond formation was not investigated. Most certainly, conservation of cysteine amino acids means that the GP129 has the possibility of interacting with gL in the same specific manner. Importantly, the GP129 mutant was unable to form a triplex complex with gH/gL. Triplex complexes with gH/gL and GP131 or GP133 could also be demonstrated. Subcomplex formation has been demonstrated to occur for HCMV between various components of the PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref062">62</xref>]. An evaluation of the stoichiometry of these subcomplexes in various cell types might be important in the determination of their influence on the immune response of the host. The GPCMV PC is highly immunogenic but not individual unique components (GP129, GP131 or GP133) based on newly developed ELISA assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref103">103</xref>]. Consequently, the homolog PC would appear an important target antigen in GPCMV as is the case for the PC in HCMV.</p>
<p>A fundamental question is what dictates formation of a gH/gL/gO triplex, or gH/gL/UL128-131 pentamer in HCMV, and the homolog complexes in GPCMV infected cells. In GPCMV, GP129, GP131 and GP133 would have a theoretical 3:1 advantage over gO for interaction with gH/gL and the same would be the case for HCMV (UL128, UL130 and UL131). In a recent model for HCMV pentamer complex formation, Ciferri et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref055">55</xref>] proposed that UL128 and gO each compete to form a disulphide bond with gL at codon 144 in an exclusive way in the gH/gL complex and that this is the most important interaction since UL130 and UL131 attach to gH/gL via non-covalent bonds. Alternatively, in HCMV an additional protein encoded in the ULb’ region (UL148) has been proposed to regulate gH/gL/gO or gH/gL pentamer formation in an undefined manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref107">107</xref>]. Identification of a homolog UL148 might be worthwhile exploring in future GPCMV studies as would evaluation of the ability of GP129 to bind gH/gL competitively in the presence of gO.</p>
<p>Curiously, gO in human and animal CMV is heavily N-glycosylated. In a previous publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref036">36</xref>], we investigated the importance of the N-glycosylated or non-glycosylated gO protein in GPCMV gH/gL/gO triplex formation. Both wild type (N-glycosylated) gO and a gO mutant (lacking N-glycosylation sites) were equally capable of forming a triplex. Additionally, in GPL cells infected with GPCMV, the wild type gO could be detected as both glycosylated and non-glycosylated in equal amounts but in transient plasmid expression studies only the N-glycosylated gO could be detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref036">36</xref>]. Potentially, the gO glycosylation state could have ramifications for the steady state of gH/gL available to interact with pentameric complex components. A heavily N-glycosylated gO protein may have a more effective interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calnexin chaperone protein system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref108">108</xref>]. This in turn may enhance the movement of gO or gH/gL/gO complex through the ER resulting in more efficient virion maturation and egress. Consequently, if the glycosylation status of gO in fibroblast vs epithelial cells was different then potentially this might influence the ability of one complex to form over another and subsequently augment viral tropism by the variation of triplex vs pentameric complex on the outside of the viral particle. However, to more fully investigate these possibilities in GPCMV would require the development of a gO specific antibody for full evaluation of these effects.</p>
<p>The animal pathogenicity studies demonstrated that a restoration of an ability of the virus to form a pentameric complex not only resulted in epithelial tropism but also increased viral pathogenicity as well as congenital transmission rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g009">Fig 9</xref>, Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1005755.t001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1005755.t002">2</xref>). The ectopic expression of GP129 cDNA resulted in a virus with similar pathogenicity pattern to SG GPCMV and importantly the virus reached the salivary glands. In contrast, the parental GPCMV BAC derived virus (NRD13) lacked viremia and poorly disseminated. Additionally, the GP129FRT virus had a congenital transmission rate of 38.4% compared to 3.2% for NRD13. Congenital GPCMV challenge studies are normally carried out with virus stock generated by serial passage in the animal and virus generated as salivary gland stock. The SG GPCMV stock of wild type virus has a congenital transmission rate between 55–75% based on previous publications. Potentially, passage of GP129FRT in animals to generate a salivary gland stock might be enhance the congenital rate of the virus and these studies are currently underway.</p>
<p>The basis for the viral attenuation occurring in fibroblast cells (<italic>GP128-133</italic> locus mutation) is undetermined. Most certainly there appears to be a bias in fibroblast cells for the production of cell free virus encoding the triplex compared to virus that also encodes the pentameric complex. The spliced nature of the encoded <italic>GP129</italic> and <italic>GP131</italic> genes might be a contributing factor to a rate limiting step on expression kinetics. Alternatively, the gO glycosylation status in fibroblast cells compared to epithelial or other cell types might influence triplex (gH/gL/gO) formation. Overall, these factors might also be a basis for the rapid generation of <italic>GP128-133</italic> locus mutants when SG GPCMV is serially passaged on fibroblast cells. However, this remains to be further investigated and may potentially require the development of additional epithelial and fibroblast cell lines to demonstrate that this phenomenon is not limited to the cell lines used in this study.</p>
<p>In summary, this study demonstrated that the <italic>UL128-131</italic> homolog locus (<italic>GP129-GP133</italic>) is necessary for GPCMV to form a homolog PC. Additionally, loss by GPCMV of the capability to form the PC impaired epithelial cell tropism and attenuated the virus in the animal model. Importantly, restoration of GPCMV epithelial tropism resulted in increased pathogenicity and congenital transmission rates. Overall, these findings strengthen the guinea pig as a highly relevant model for HCMV congenital infection and the development of CMV vaccine or intervention strategies against congenital infection. Additionally, these studies emphasize the importance of the PC for congenital transmission and strongly suggest that a vaccine aimed at preventing congenital infection should incorporate the pentameric complex as part of a vaccine design.</p>

Pup specific placenta was collected and preserved for DNA extraction when applicable. For tissue DNA extraction, FastPrep 24 (MP Biomedical) was used to homogenize tissues as a 20% weight/volume homogenate in Lysing Matrix D (MP Biomedicals). To obtain DNA from whole blood, 500ul of blood was collected (by toe nail clip bleed) into tubes containing ACD anticoagulant and 200μl of blood was subsequently used per extraction. DNA was extracted using the QIAxtractor (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s liquid (blood) or tissue protocol instructions. Viral load was determined by real time PCR on Lightcycler 480 (Roche Applied Science). Primers and hydrolysis probe were designed using the Lightcycler Probe Design2 program to amplify a product from the GPCMV GP44 gene: Forward primer 5’TCTCCACGGTGAAAGAGTTGT; Reverse primer 5’GTGCTGTCGGACCACGATA; hydrolysis probe 5’FAM-TCTTGCTCTGCAGGTGGACGA-BHQ1.

Designated GPCMV restriction fragment band nomenclature described by Gao and Isom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref111">111</xref>] was used to identify specific band shifts, except that the 5’ and 3’ genome terminal ends were considered linked in a covalent closed circle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref026">26</xref>]. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s014">S12 Fig</xref> shows the <italic>GP128</italic> mutant <italic>Eco</italic>R I profile and <italic>Hind</italic> III profiles for <italic>GP129-13</italic>1 and <italic>GP133</italic> mutants compared to the wt GPCMV BAC profiles. Specific gene locus modifications were further verified by PCR analysis and sequencing as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref036">36</xref>]. The <italic>GP128</italic> gene encoded in the 4.9 kb <italic>Eco</italic>R I GPCMV genomic fragment (192,215–197,167) was modified in the <italic>GP128</italic> mutant by insertion of the 1.1 kb Km cassette which shifted the fragment to 6 kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s014">S12 Fig</xref>). The <italic>GP129</italic>, <italic>GP131</italic> and <italic>GP133</italic> genes are encoded in the 19.7 kb <italic>Hind</italic> III GPCMV genomic fragment and targeted knockout of these genes introduced a new <italic>Hind</italic> III site encoded in the inserted Km marker. The GP129-GP131 deletion mutant <italic>Hind</italic> III fragment was modified from 19.7 kb to 5 kb and approximately 15 kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s014">S12 Fig</xref>). In the <italic>GP133</italic> deletion mutant the 19.7 kb <italic>Hind</italic> III GPCMV genomic fragment was modified to 6 kb and 14.9 kb fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s014">S12 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Mutant GPCMV BACs were independently subject to an additional round of mutagenesis to introduce a wild type <italic>GP129</italic> (myc tagged) cDNA into the <italic>GP25/26</italic> intergenic locus under SV40 promoter control as described in an earlier section for ectopic expression of GP129. This required excision of the Km FRT cassette from the originally mutated locus by Flp recombinase as described (see above section). Excision of the Km cassette was confirmed by patching of colonies for the loss antibiotic resistance and the integrity of the GPCMV BAC confirmed by restriction profile analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s014">S12 Fig</xref>). GPCMV BACs retained a FRT site at the original site of excision. <italic>E</italic>.<italic>coli</italic> (DH10B) cells carrying respective GPCMV BAC mutants underwent ET recombination induction and targeted modification with the shuttle vector pGP129limkKmFRT as previously described. <italic>GP25/GP26</italic> locus mutants (carrying GP129myc cDNA) were isolated by Km marker insertion as previously described. Full length GPCMV BAC clones were identified by <italic>Eco</italic>R I restriction profile analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s014">S12 Fig</xref>) and subsequently confirmed by PCR of the <italic>GP25/GP26</italic> locus and sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s013">S11 Fig</xref>). Mutants carrying <italic>GP129</italic> cDNA in the <italic>GP25/GP26</italic> locus were designated: (1) GP129FRT (wt GPCMV BAC); (2) GP128FRT/GP129Link (<italic>GP128</italic> mutant); (3) GP129-GP131FRT/ GP129Link (<italic>GP129-GP131</italic> deletion mutant); (4) GP133FRT/GP129Link (<italic>GP133</italic> deletion mutant). In regard to the ectopic insertion of a GP129 cDNA into the <italic>GP25/GP26</italic> intergenic locus, the modification generated a characteristic altered GPCMV <italic>Eco</italic>R I profile. The 5.2 kb GPCMV <italic>Eco</italic>R I genomic fragment (nucleotides 35,537–40,739) containing the <italic>GP25/GP26</italic> locus was modified by the insertion of the SV40 promoter /GP129 expression cassette/SV40 polyA sequence and Km marker into the <italic>Bam</italic> H I site (nucleotide 38,538). The modified sequence also introduced two novel <italic>Eco</italic>R I sites. As predicted the original 5.2 kb genomic fragment was modified to two novel fragments (3.5 and 3.9 kb). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s014">S12 Fig</xref> shows the modified profiles for wt GPCMV, <italic>GP128</italic> and <italic>GP129-131</italic> mutants (GP128FRT/GP129Link and GP129-GP131FRT/ GP129Link respectively) but not the GP133 mutant to limit redundancy. An additional GPCMV BAC mutant was engineered into GP129FRT GPCMV BAC which introduced a Km cassette into the <italic>GP74</italic> gene (glycoprotein gO) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref036">36</xref>]. This generated a GPCMV BAC mutant that encoded a GP129 cDNA in the <italic>GP25/26</italic> locus (Km replaced by FRT sites only) and a <italic>GP74</italic> knockout by insertion of a Km cassette which disrupted the ORF at codon 110 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref036">36</xref>] (double mutant was designated GP129FRT/GP74Km). The <italic>GP74</italic> mutation was confirmed by <italic>Eco</italic>R I profile analysis of the GPCMV BAC genome. The original 18 kb <italic>Eco</italic>R I genomic fragment (nucleotides 102,796–120,821) that encoded the <italic>GP74</italic> locus was increased in size by 1.1 kb by the insertion of a Km cassette which modified the size of the fragment to 19.1 kb, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005755.s014">S12 Fig</xref>.</p>
<p>The gB (<italic>GP55</italic>) knockout mutant was generated on the backdrop of GP129FRT GPCMV BAC. The GP55 gene (94,164–96,869) was knocked out by insertion of a Km cassette which disrupted the ORF at codon 528 as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref036">36</xref>]. The insertion of the Km cassette modified the size of the 4470 <italic>Eco</italic>R I subgenomic fragment (91,190–95,659) by approximately 1 kb generating a novel <italic>Eco</italic>R I restriction fragment of approximately 5.5 kb on the GP129FRT/GP55km GPCMV BAC <italic>Eco</italic>R I profile.

<title>Generation of mutant GPCMV</title>
<p>For generation of recombinant viruses, large-scale GPCMV BAC DNA was purified from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> DH10B strain using a maxi plasmid kit (Qiagen). BAC DNA was transfected onto GPL cells in six well dishes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref033">33</xref>]. GPCMV BAC transfections were carried out with two independent clones for each gene knockout. Transfections were followed for at least 3–4 weeks for the production of viral plaques. GFP positive viral plaques were detected via microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref033">33</xref>]. Non-infectious mutants produced only single GFP positive cells that did not progress to viral plaques. GPCMV mutant BAC transfections were carried out multiple times (minimum of 6 times) for each clone. Excision of the BAC plasmid from recombinant viral genome was carried out by co-transfection of BAC DNA with plasmid encoding CRE recombinase (pCRE), a generous gift from Dr. Mike McVoy (Virginia Commonwealth University). Cre BAC excised virus also lost the GFP reporter cassette encoded on the BAC plasmid and therefore GFP negative plaques confirmed successful BAC plasmid excision. Large scale virus stocks were generated as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005755.ref033">33</xref>] and additionally epitropic viruses were generated as virus stocks on epithelial cells following the same procedure.

<title>Triplex formation immunoprecipitation assays (full length blots).</title>
<p>GP129, GP131, GP133 and gO were evaluated for an ability to form triplex complexes with gH and gL. Transient expression of epithelial cells with gHGFP, gLmCherry, GP129myc, GP131HA and GP133FLAG was as described in materials and methods. Evaluation of triplex formation was by cellular colocalization or by GFP trap immunoprecipitation assay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This Figure shows the full length western blots of the results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005755.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Western blots of triplex immunoprecipitations: (E) gHGFP/gLmCherry/GP129myc; (J) gHGFP/gLmCherry/GP131HA triplex; (O) gHGFP/gLmCherry/GP133FLAG triplex; (T) gHGFP/gLmCherry/gOFLAG triplex. Lanes: 1, 4 and 7 total cell lysate; 2, 5 and 8 wash flow through; 3, 6 and 9 immunoprecipitation. Specific proteins detected indicated in brackets under each blot. Detection by appropriate primary antibody: gHGFP (anti-GFP); gLmCherry (anti-mCherry); GP129myc (anti-myc); GP131 (anti-HA); GP133 (anti-FLAG).</p>
