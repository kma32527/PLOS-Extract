<abstract>
<p>The healthy lung maintains a steady state of immune readiness to rapidly respond to injury from invaders. Integrins are important for setting the parameters of this resting state, particularly the epithelial-restricted Î±VÎ²6 integrin, which is upregulated during injury. Once expressed, Î±VÎ²6 moderates acute lung injury (ALI) through as yet undefined molecular mechanisms. We show that the upregulation of Î²6 during influenza infection is involved in disease pathogenesis. Î²6-deficient mice (Î²6 KO) have increased survival during influenza infection likely due to the limited viral spread into the alveolar spaces leading to reduced ALI. Although the Î²6 KO have morphologically normal lungs, they harbor constitutively activated lung CD11b<sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophages (AM) and elevated type I IFN signaling activity, which we traced to the loss of Î²6-activated transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²). Administration of exogenous TGF-Î² to Î²6 KO mice leads to reduced numbers of CD11b<sup>+</sup> AMs, decreased type I IFN signaling activity and loss of the protective phenotype during influenza infection. Protection extended to other respiratory pathogens such as Sendai virus and bacterial pneumonia. Our studies demonstrate that the loss of one epithelial protein, Î±VÎ²6 integrin, can alter the lung microenvironment during both homeostasis and respiratory infection leading to reduced lung injury and improved survival.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The lung undergoes daily assault by microbes and other inhaled particulates and must maintain the balance between clearance of harmful microorganisms while protecting the delicate lung structure to avoid acute lung injury. Not surprisingly, this is a complex process requiring communication between the lung epithelial cells (first site of attack by invaders) and the cells of the intrinsic immune response. We demonstrate the Î±VÎ²6 integrin is an important player in this interface. Loss of Î±VÎ²6 during influenza infection, and other respiratory infections, leads to bolstered protection against severe lung disease and improved survival in mice. Even in the absence of infection, Î²6 KO animals have a distinct anti-microbial lung microenvironment as evidenced by increased type I IFN activity and activated alveolar macrophages that appear âpoised to defendâ. These studies explore how the epithelial-specific Î±VÎ²6 integrin regulates the lung microenvironment to alter alveolar macrophage activity through a TGF-Î²-dependent mechanism, leading to changes in both the homeostatic lung and responses to respiratory infections as a way of balancing microbial clearance with protection of the lung from excessive damage.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>At each breath, the lung is challenged by a large number and diversity of microbes and other foreign material such as pollen and dust. Many inhaled microbes cause lethal infections if not contained by the lung immune system, which has evolved to balance rapid and efficient microbial clearance with protection of the delicate lung structure from excessive damage. Lung damage caused by microbial pathogens is the cause of acute lung injury (ALI), which leads to increased edema, alveolar permeability, and impaired oxygen exchange. In severe cases, ALI can result in impaired gas exchange function and ultimately death (acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref001">1</xref>]. To mitigate lung damage after infection, inflammation resolves, returning to homeostasis that restores normal lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref003">3</xref>]. The air-interface structure of the lung involves a complex immune cell population including resident interstitial macrophages and dendritic cells, and GM-CSF-dependent alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref004">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref007">7</xref>]. A key question in understanding pulmonary immunity concerns how the balance between effective immune surveillance and maintenance of lung anatomy and physiology is achieved through life.</p>
<p>Integrins are heterodimers composed of Î± and Î² subunits that regulate a plethora of cellular functions including cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion, cell activation, and the recognition and post-translational processing of molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref008">8</xref>]. In the lung microenvironment, Î²6 (encoded by <italic>Itgb6</italic>) exclusively pairs with the Î±V subunit and expression of the Î±VÎ²6 heterodimer is limited to epithelial cells. In this context, Î±VÎ²6 plays a key role in controlling several steps in lung homeostasis. Mice lacking the Î²6 subunit (Î²6 KO) have highlighted the central role Î±VÎ²6 integrin plays in balancing the pulmonary environment during injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref010">10</xref>]. For example, in both bleomycin-induced and PAR1-mediated ventilator-associated lung injury and airway hyper-responsiveness models, Î²6 KO mice were protected from ALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref011">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref013">13</xref>]. Î²6 KO mice also had reduced IL-1Î²-mediated lung injury in a model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia due to decreased inflammation and cellular infiltrate to the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref014">14</xref>]. Alveolar macrophages isolated from Î²6 KO are characterized as large and foamy and express high amounts of MMP12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Severe respiratory infections are often associated with ALI/ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref017">17</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref019">19</xref>], and the pathophysiology is similar for a variety of infectious pathogens. For example, patients with SARS and MERS-CoV were found to have increased infiltration of inflammatory macrophages, accumulation of debris in the lung, and diffuse alveolar damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref021">21</xref>]. Similarly, elderly patients suffering from RSV sustained widespread alveolar damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref022">22</xref>]. Bacterial pneumonia can result in increased formation of hyaline membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref023">23</xref>]. Deposition of collagen and fibrin, while necessary for lung repair, can also build up and block gas exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref024">24</xref>]. In the case of influenza, the major complication leading to ALI/ARDS is pulmonary edema and impaired fluid clearance due to dysregulation of transporters that clear fluid from the alveolus such as ENaC and Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>ATPase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref026">26</xref>]. The virus itself can also directly kill epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref027">27</xref>]. ALI/ARDS has a mortality rate of 30â50%, therefore it is critical from a public health perspective to understand the mechanisms at play [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>Given the role of the Î²6 integrin in modulating ALI, we hypothesized that its upregulation during respiratory infections such as influenza would be important for viral pathogenesis. To test this, Î²6 KO mice were infected with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Î²6-deficient mice were protected from influenza virus-induced disease as well as a broad range of respiratory pathogens, in most cases independent of effects on overall microbial numbers. Mechanistically, we found that epithelial Î²6 controls the homeostatic lung interferon response. In the absence of Î²6, type I interferon signaling is constitutive, causing the host to have an advantage over the spread of the virus. This protective phenotype was reversed by exogenous TGF-Î²1 or elimination of the type I interferon receptor, suggesting that Î±VÎ²6 controls a communication system between lung epithelia and immune cells through a TGF-Î²-dependent mechanism. These studies have important implications as transient inhibition of Î±VÎ²6 may represent a potential therapy for the management of acute lung injury.</p>

<title>Î²6 KO mice are protected from diverse respiratory infections</title>
<p>Î²6 expression is induced upon mechanical or inflammatory injury and is an important mediator of ALI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref030">30</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesized that upregulation of the Î²6 integrin during respiratory infections would be involved in viral pathogenesis. To test this, we measured Î²6 expression by quantitative RT-PCR at different times post-influenza infection. Consistent with lung injury models, Î²6 mRNA was significantly upregulated in whole lung homogenates by 3 days post-infection (dpi) and expression remained elevated through 5 dpi (p &lt; 0.0001) correlating with the appearance of ALI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). We then intranasally infected WT and <italic>Itgb6</italic>-deficient mice (Î²6 KO mice) with A/California/04/2009 (CA/09) H1N1 virus and monitored morbidity for 12 dpi. Compared to WT controls, Î²6 KO mice lost significantly less weight (4, 6, and 8 dpi p &lt; 0.0001) and began to recover by 10 dpi, while WT mice lost weight and either succumbed to infection or were euthanized due to morbidity between 6â10 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). The dose of CA/09 virus used (10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>) was lethal to all WT mice, while 70% Î²6 KO mice survived the infection (p = 0.0090). Mouse lethal dose 50 (MLD<sub>50</sub>) studies demonstrated the resistance of the Î²6 KO to influenza infection, with WT mice having an MLD<sub>50</sub> of 10<sup>2.5</sup> versus 10<sup>5.3</sup> for the KO to the CA/09 virus. Protection was not limited to H1N1 infection; Î²6 KO mice were also protected from an emerging strain of avian influenza virus associated with severe and even fatal human respiratory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref017">17</xref>], A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) influenza virus (p = 0.0326, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).

<p>A major risk factor for influenza infection is secondary bacterial pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref031">31</xref>]. As Î²6 KO mice were protected from individual influenza and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> challenges, we tested the Î²6 KO mice with a secondary bacterial challenge model. Mice were inoculated intranasally with a sublethal dose of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 influenza virus, and 7 dpi administered a low dose of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> (D39X strain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref032">32</xref>]. This dual infection model is generally lethal in WT mice, although neither challenge alone causes death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref033">33</xref>]. Survival of WT mice after secondary challenge was ~30%, while Î²6 KO mice were significantly protected (p = 0.0226) with 70% survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g001">Fig 1G</xref>) highlighting the importance of Î²6 integrin in the pathogenesis of respiratory infections.</p>

<title>Î²6 KO mice have decreased ALI and influenza spread within the lungs</title>
<p>To determine if the enhanced survival seen in the Î²6 KO mice was associated with decreased ALI, we examined histological sections for evidence of tissue injury, alterations of the alveolar capillary barrier, and inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref001">1</xref>]. Although groups were histologically similar at 3 dpi, at 7 dpi inflammation and thickened septa involving extensive areas of alveolar parenchyma was seen in WT lungs. In marked contrast, evidence of inflammation and tissue damage in the Î²6 KO lungs was generally limited to terminal bronchioles and small numbers of adjacent alveoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Infected WT mice had increased TNF-Î± and IL-6 throughout the duration of infection, while the inflammatory cytokine response in Î²6 KO mice was less robust (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Evidence of alterations to the alveolar capillary barrier was found in infected WT mice beginning at 5 dpi as compared to KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g002">Fig 2Câ2F</xref>) including heavier lungs as determined by wet/dry weight ratios (5 dpi p = 0.0077, 7 dpi p = 0.0063) indicating increased edema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), accompanied by increased total protein (p &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g002">Fig 2D</xref>) and albumin in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (7 dpi p &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g002">Fig 2E</xref>) and accumulation of Evans blue dye in the lungs of WT mice (p = 0.0071, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g002">Fig 2F</xref>).

<p>The most likely mechanism of protection in influenza infected Î²6 KO mice was decreased viral titers. However, tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID<sub>50</sub>) and quantitative real-time PCR showed no significant differences in viral titers, although RT-PCR suggested a trend towards lower titers in Î²6 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). We therefore spatially monitored viral spread in the lungs by immunohistochemistry for viral nucleoprotein (NP) and use of a reporter virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref035">35</xref>]. Viral spread into the alveolar spaces was reduced in Î²6 KO mice in comparison to WT mice, which had extensive NP staining of type II pneumocytes and macrophages in the alveolar spaces by 5 dpi. In contrast, NP staining in Î²6 KO mice was largely restricted to the terminal bronchiolar epithelium and adjacent alveoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). This is even more evident using our NLuc CA/09 reporter virus, which clearly demonstrates decreased virus in Î²6 KO ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref035">35</xref>], <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005804.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Finally, WT lungs had a higher percentage of sites of active infection at 5 and 7 dpi as well as more viral antigen detected in the alveolar spaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). Collectively, viral spread in KO lungs was limited compared to WT mice, with less extensive involvement of alveolar epithelial cells possibly explaining the improved lung function relative to controls. These findings are consistent with studies suggesting that increased survival during influenza infection can be independent of changes in viral titers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref036">36</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref040">40</xref>].</p>

<title>Loss of the Î²6 integrin leads to a modified lung microenvironment</title>
<p>To understand the underlying mechanism(s) for the decreased viral spread within the lungs of Î²6 KO mice, we performed flow cytometry on BALF and lungs at different times post-infection. No significant differences were noted in numbers of TNF-Î±/iNOS-producing (tip)DCs, neutrophils, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, or influenza PB1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in either BALF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g004">Fig 4Aâ4E</xref>) or whole lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g004">Fig 4Fâ4J</xref>). However, we noted substantial differences in the resident lung F480<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> populations (macrophages and dendritic cells), namely that Î²6 KO mice lacked a conventional CD11c<sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophage (AM) population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). AMs have characteristic flow cytometry properties as compared to dendritic cells (DCs) or incoming activated bone marrow-derived inflammatory monocytes including autofluoresence in the FITC channel, high constitutive expression of CD11c, F4/80 and SiglecF and low expression of CD11b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref042">42</xref>]. By contrast, incoming activated bone marrow-derived inflammatory monocytes express CD11b, providing a means to distinguish between resident AM, inflammatory bone marrow-derived monocytes and DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref043">43</xref>]. When we examined the lung macrophage/DC populations in uninfected Î²6 KO mice we found they had higher numbers of autofluorescent cells indicating AMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) but instead of the normal CD11c<sup>hi</sup> CD11b<sup>-</sup> phenotype, the vast majority of the Î²6 KO AM were MerTK<sup>+</sup>, CD64<sup>+</sup>, CD11c<sup>+</sup>, and uniformly CD11b<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g005">Fig 5C</xref>; See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005804.s002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005804.s003">S3</xref> Figs for gating strategies). These cells maintained expression of F4/80 and SiglecF, suggesting they are AMs with altered properties. They were also phenotypically distinct from those of WT mice, with a âfoamyâ appearance typical of activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Importantly, the Î²6 KO CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> AM were present at the earliest times tested (d3 after birth), continued to be present at all points of adulthood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005804.s004">S4A Fig</xref>), and were not affected by reducing neonatal exposure to airborne particulate matter by using HEPA-filtered cages or low dust cage bedding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005804.s004">S4B Fig</xref>).

<p>Most pulmonary AM originate from embryonic erythro-myeloid progenitors whose replacement by blood monocytes under steady state is extremely slow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref044">44</xref>]. To test whether the Î²6 KO CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> AM were predominantly derived from embryonic progenitors, we created mice where the blood monocyte pool was severely depleted by loss of the chemokine receptor CCR2, which is the predominant mediator for monocyte egress from the bone marrow. In the lungs of Î²6/CCR2 doubly-deficient mice, CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> AM were present in identical amounts compared with those of Î²6 KO mice, arguing these cells are unlikely to be derived from peripheral blood monocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005804.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). Although other unknown pathways to recruit monocytes to the lung cannot be discounted, they are not as well characterized or understood as the CCR2 pathway. Taken together, we concluded loss of an epithelial integrin alters the phenotype of lung AMs.</p>
<p>Next we tested whether the Î²6 KO CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> AM were a consequence of exposure to an altered lung microenvironment caused by loss of Î²6, or were caused by a cell-intrinsic mechanism. Adoptive transfer of congenically marked WT AM into Î²6 KO animals led to the CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> AM phenotype after 7 days while transfer of Î²6 KO AMs into WT animals results in a WT CD11c<sup>hi</sup> CD11b<sup>-</sup> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g006">Fig 6Aâ6C</xref>). Importantly, the effect of the Î²6 KO lung microenvironment was not unique to transferred AM. Adoptive transfer of peritoneal resident macrophages into Î²6 KO animals resulted in conversion into the CD11c<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> AM phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>) highlighting that it is the altered lung microenvironment of the Î²6 KO that controls AM phenotype.

<p>What could be different about the Î²6 KO lung microenvironment? Î²6 integrin is the primary way to endogenously activate transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²) in the lung, which is known to restrain AM activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref045">45</xref>]. Thus, we next asked if the altered macrophage phenotype in the Î²6 KO mice was TGF-Î²1 dependent. As expected, endogenous lung TGF-Î²1 activity was reduced in Î²6 KO mice as compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). To test the hypothesis that reduced TGF-Î²1 activity contributed to the altered lung microenvironment of Î²6 KO mice, we intranasally administered exogenous TGF-Î²1 to WT and Î²6 KO mice every other day for 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref046">46</xref>].

<title>Î²6 KO mice have increased Type I IFN signaling</title>
<p>Î²6 KO mice had an altered lung environment resulting in decreased viral spread. Type I IFNs are amongst the most potent cytokines limiting viral spread. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that Î²6 KO mice had increased type I IFN than WT. We used phosphorylated STAT1 levels (pSTAT1) as a marker for type I IFN signaling. Increased pSTAT1 along with increased type I IFN gene expression and unchanged expression of type II IFN-dependent targets such as IDO1 are indicative of a type I IFN dominated environment. Further, STAT1 is a robust marker of type I IFN signaling due to its weak activation by other cytokines such as IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref047">47</xref>]. Immunoblot analysis of whole lung homogenates showed the Î²6 KO mice had robust type I IFN signaling at baseline that increased 3â5 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). We sought to determine the source of type I IFNs and how epithelial-expressed Î²6 regulated the IFN response. We noted that type I IFN mRNAs were not substantially altered in uninfected Î²6 KO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005804.s006">S6AâS6D</xref> Figs). Furthermore, ELISA measurements for type I IFNs did not show substantial differences between WT and Î²6 KO mice within whole lung homogenates. Therefore, we generated Î²6 KO mice crossed to an IFN-Î²-YFP reporter strain. In these mice, YFP expression in the whole lung was predominantly found in CD45<sup>+</sup> cells and increased in the absence of Î²6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g008">Fig 8B</xref>); although immunofluorescent microscopy of frozen lung sections from WT and Î²6 KO YFP reporter mice showed increased YFP<sup>+</sup> cells scattered throughout the lung; including in the epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g008">Fig 8C and 8D</xref>). Further delineation of the exact cell types in this system expressing YFP is precluded by the strong autofluorescence in the FITC channel in lung macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref004">4</xref>]. Thus, we examined isolated AMs and primary epithelial cells grown at the air-liquid interface from Î²6 KO and WT mice for increased type I IFN signaling.</p>

<p>To determine if type I IFN signaling was also increased in epithelial cells, primary bronchotracheal epithelial cells (mTEC) from WT and Î²6 KO mice were isolated, differentiated and grown at the air-liquid interface prior to infection with CA/09 virus (MOI 0.1). Phosphorylated and total levels of STAT1 and IRF3 were quantitated at 24 hours post-infection by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g008">Fig 8H</xref>). Î²6 KO mTEC exhibited significant increases in total STAT1 and IRF3 levels as compared to WT mTEC after infection as well as at baseline, although differences in phosphorylated STAT1 and IRF3 were minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g008">Fig 8H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005804.s006">S6E Fig</xref>). Based on these data, we concluded that regulation of type I IFNs was dysregulated in the lungs of Î²6 KO mice at baseline, and that hematopoietic cells as well as epithelial cells may be involved.</p>
<p>Finally, to determine if this is regulated by TGF-Î²1, lung homogenates from mice administered exogenous TGF-Î²1 were monitored for total and phosphorylated STAT1. Treatment decreased phospho-STAT1 in whole lung homogenate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g008">Fig 8I</xref>). Macrophages isolated from TGF-Î²1-treated Î²6 KO mice also displayed significantly decreased mRNA encoding levels of the IFN associated transcripts Irf7, Ifit1, and Oas1g that were comparable to levels in WT macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g008">Fig 8G</xref>) highlighting that the loss of Î²6 activated TGF-Î² results in an altered lung macrophage population and increased type I IFN activation. We question whether this was the reason for the enhanced protection from influenza infection.</p>

<title>Increased survival in Î²6 KO mice is dependent on type I IFN activity</title>
<p>To determine if the increased type I IFN signaling in Î²6 KO mice was responsible for the enhanced protection, we crossed Î²6 KO with <italic>Ifnar</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (Î²6/IFNAR double KO), which lack the type I IFN receptor and all type I IFN signaling, then challenged these mice and their cognate controls created from the same heterozygote crosses with 10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> of CA/09 virus.

Further, imaging WT, Î²6 KO, IFNAR KO, and Î²6/IFNAR double KO mice infected with CA/09-NLuc reporter virus at 3 and 7 dpi showed that the Î²Î²6 KO mice had reduced viral spread in the lungs as compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005804.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). In contrast, viral spread in Î²6/IFNAR double KO mice was comparable to WT and IFNAR KO mice, highlighting the importance of type I IFN signaling in limiting viral spread during infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We propose a model where during pulmonary homeostasis, Î²6 integrin, possibly by activation of endogenous TGF-Î²1, suppresses CD11b expression on alveolar macrophages and type I IFN signaling within the lung microenvironment. However, in the absence of Î²6 integrin, CD11b expression is increased as is type I IFN signaling inducing a âprimedâ antiviral state in the absence of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Through the use of TGF-Î²1 ârescueâ experiments and Î²6 KO mice lacking type I IFN signaling, we were able to demonstrate the resistance of Î²6 KO mice to influenza depended on the loss of TGF-Î²1 and this elevated type I IFN signaling, while the phenotypic changes in lung macrophages were independent of the type I IFN pathway at least at the level of type I IFN signaling as shown in the Î²6/IFNAR double KO mice.</p>

<p>Shown is a depiction of a model whereby TGF-Î²1, processed by the Î±VÎ²6 integrin, directly regulates macrophage cell surface CD11b and the type I IFN response. Other pathways may cooperate with TGF-Î²1. The exact relationship between the suppression of type I signaling versus the production of type I IFNs through Î±VÎ²6 remains to be established.</p>

<p>Overall, our data argue Î²6 expression leads to changes in the lung microenvironment that are mediated immediately after birth and include alterations in the AM population, and repressed type I IFN signaling in the lung most likely through a major contribution from TGF-Î²1. This pathway might lead to selective regulation of pathogen colonization or spread, depending on the pathogenâs sensitivity to the pre-existing interferon milieu. Two caveats to the model proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g010">Fig 10</xref> include (i) the fact that Î²6 may regulate factors other than TGF-Î²1 that cause the downstream effects, and (ii) that we cannot yet definitively distinguish whether Î²6 negatively regulates type I IFN signaling, type I IFN production or both pathways. In our hands, assays quantitating type I IFN amounts by ELISA or bead-based assays are variable, lacking sensitivity or reproducibility. Furthermore, the potential increase in type I receptor expression on Î²6 KO macrophages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1005804.t001">Table 1</xref>) could cause increased uptake of type I IFNs and not accurately reflect the soluble amounts present in the lung at a given time in homeostasis. Thus, the identification of the point at which Î²6 (with or without TGF-Î²1) negatively regulates IFN signaling will require new tools and approaches investigating regulation in both macrophages and epithelial cells.</p>
<p>Mice lacking the Î²6 integrin are protected from disease caused by influenza infection. Compared to WT controls, Î²6 KO mice develop less severe ALI, as characterized by edema, inflammatory cytokine expression, and vascular permeability of the lung epithelium. Î²6 KO mice also have altered baseline homeostasis possessing high baseline CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> macrophages as opposed to CD11b<sup>-</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophages. A reasonable interpretation of these data is that Î²6 KO mice are âprimedâ for a more efficient response to respiratory pathogens, due to constitutively increased type I IFN signaling at baseline. Importantly, protection extended beyond pandemic H1N1 influenza virus strain to include other influenza virus strains, Sendai virus, and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> infection. However, protection did not extend to all infections tested. We challenged Î²6 KO mice with <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> Schu4 strain using 25 live organisms via the intranasal route. Schu4-infected Î²6 KO mice had no differences in survival compared to controls consistent with experiments performed in the <italic>Ifnar</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref049">49</xref>] (CB, personal communication) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005804.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). Although Î²6 KO mice were significantly protected from disease caused by H7N9 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005804.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) they were not protected from the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/Hong Kong/483/1997 H5N1 infection (HK/483, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005804.s008">S8B Fig</xref>). HPAI H5N1 viruses are unique in their ability to rapidly spread beyond the respiratory tract and cause systemic, including neurological, disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref018">18</xref>] and productively replicate in alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref050">50</xref>]. It is possible that HPAI H5N1 viruses are more resistant to type I IFN, that mice succumb due to direct viral cytopathic effect, or complications of systemic infection. Further studies are needed to understand why Î²6 KO mice are not protected against HPAI H5N1 infection. Taken together, these data suggest Î²6-mediated modulation of IFN responses affects responses to multiple respiratory pathogens whereas protective responses depend on IFN signaling.</p>
<p>The airway epithelium is a complex barrier comprised of multiple cell types that acts as an interface between the external environment and the internal lung milieu. It serves three main functions in a healthy lung; providing a tight mechanical barrier that rapidly repairs upon insult, mediating innate immune activity to limit foreign antigen invasion, and initiating an inflammatory response through production of cytokines and chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref051">51</xref>]. A variety of experimental models and human studies demonstrate the host response to respiratory infection involves initiation, resolution, and restoration phases, all of which must be tightly regulated to prevent disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref052">52</xref>]. However, little is known about how interactions between epithelial cells, which are often the primary targets of respiratory pathogens, and alveolar macrophages, which play a critical role in controlling infections, and the regulation of these responses. Our data identify a pathway by which alveolar epithelial cells normally suppress the anti-microbial activity of alveolar macrophages through a pathway that may involve local activation of TGF-Î² and subsequent suppression of IFN signaling. In terms of homeostasis, little is known about how type I IFNs control the status of tissue microenvironments. Most work on type I IFN signaling has been associated with anti-viral responses and the regulation of inflammation over the first 18â24 months of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref016">16</xref>]. The implication of our findings is that the lung can tolerate a homeostatic increase in IFN signaling, which provides an advantage against viral spread, but likely comes with âcostsâ that are not yet clear. We note a recent study has shown homeostatic IFN-Î² and IFNAR signaling in the brain has an essential role in suppressing neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref053">53</xref>]. Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding of the hitherto unknown tissue-specific homeostatic roles of type I IFN signaling is warranted. During infection, although it would seem that upregulation of Î²6 would only have a negative impact on the host by limiting the anti-viral response, it could also be important for balancing the inflammatory response by suppressing activated macrophages through a TGF-Î²-dependent process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref045">45</xref>], initiating wound repair, or by recruiting macrophages to the site of infection. Attempts to address the role of TGF-Î² in influenza pathogenesis by systemic inhibition resulted in lethal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref054">54</xref>]. Thus, future studies will focus on inhibiting the Î²6 integrin at different times post-infection to understand its precise role in viral infection and its potential as a therapeutic target.</p>
<p>Why is the lung macrophage population different in the Î²6 KO mice? The Î±VÎ²6 integrin is expressed at low amounts in healthy adult tissue but is rapidly upregulated during development and in response to injury and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref030">30</xref>]. Once expressed, Î²6 activates latent TGF-Î²1 by binding to the RGD motif in the latency-associated peptide (LAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref055">55</xref>]. Upon activation, TGF-Î²1 regulates a variety of genes associated with the immune response and pulmonary fibrosis and is thought to negatively restrict inflammation in macrophages through an unknown mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref045">45</xref>]. However, systemic inhibition of all TGF-Î² isoforms by a broadly neutralizing antibody led to lethal influenza infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref054">54</xref>] suggesting that the role of TGF-Î² during infection may be complex and depend on both the cellular milieu and TGF-Î² isoform. Recent work has shown that the pulmonary microenvironment dictates the behavior of alveolar macrophages to a greater extent than the origin of the macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref042">42</xref>]. Based on our studies we propose that in the lung microenvironment, upregulation of the Î²6 integrin leads to localized activation of TGF-Î²1 that negatively regulates alveolar macrophages leading to decreased type I IFN activity in the microenvironment through an as yet undefined mechanism that will require further molecular investigation. An important extension of this model is that influenza viruses themselves activate latent TGF-Î² during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref056">56</xref>] and global inhibition of TGF-Î² during infection is lethal, suggesting an important role in protection from influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref054">54</xref>]. Therefore, it will be important to be able to experimentally segregate the host- versus virus-specific TGF-Î² processing events in mice expressing or lacking Î²6 integrin.</p>
<p>Overall, loss of the Î²6 integrin resulted in protection from a variety of respiratory infections including influenza and Sendai viruses, bacterial pneumonia, and viral-bacterial co-infections. Î²6 KO mice had significantly reduced extent and severity of lung injury and inflammation, reduced collagen deposition despite no difference in viral titer, consistent with studies using Î²6 integrin function blocking antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref057">57</xref>], with virus infection being more restricted to airways instead of infiltrating the deep-lung alveolar spaces. Î²6 function blocking antibodies have been successfully used to improve outcome in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and currently recruiting for phase II human clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref059">59</xref>]. While the Î²6 integrin represents an attractive therapeutic target to combat pulmonary disease, it does play a role in lung homeostasis. While transient inhibition of Î²6 in the lung results in resistance to infection, complete lack of Î²6 function for long periods of time could be detrimental. Over long periods of time, Î²6 KO mice over produce macrophage-derived matrix metalloprotease MMP12, leading to emphysema and destruction of pulmonary tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005804.ref016">16</xref>]. However, for short-term protection against the adverse consequences of potentially lethal pulmonary viral infections, our work identifies the Î±VÎ²6 integrin as a potentially attractive therapeutic target for transient intervention in lung viral infection.</p>
