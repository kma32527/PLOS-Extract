<abstract>
<p>The nuclear lamina lines the inner nuclear membrane providing a structural framework for the nucleus. Cellular processes, such as nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis or nuclear export of large ribonucleoprotein complexes, are functionally linked to the disassembly of the nuclear lamina. In general, lamina disassembly is mediated by phosphorylation, but the precise molecular mechanism is still not completely understood. Recently, we suggested a novel mechanism for lamina disassembly during the nuclear egress of herpesviral capsids which involves the cellular isomerase Pin1. In this study, we focused on mechanistic details of herpesviral nuclear replication to demonstrate the general importance of Pin1 for lamina disassembly. In particular, Ser22-specific lamin phosphorylation consistently generates a Pin1-binding motif in cells infected with human and animal alpha-, beta-, and gammaherpesviruses. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we showed that binding of Pin1 to a synthetic lamin peptide induces its <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerization <italic>in vitro</italic>. A detailed bioinformatic evaluation strongly suggests that this structural conversion induces large-scale secondary structural changes in the lamin N-terminus. Thus, we concluded that a Pin1-induced conformational change of lamins may represent the molecular trigger responsible for lamina disassembly. Consistent with this concept, pharmacological inhibition of Pin1 activity blocked lamina disassembly in herpesvirus-infected fibroblasts and consequently impaired virus replication. In addition, a phospho-mimetic Ser22Glu lamin mutant was still able to form a regular lamina structure and overexpression of a Ser22-phosphorylating kinase did not induce lamina disassembly in Pin1 knockout cells. Intriguingly, this was observed in absence of herpesvirus infection proposing a broader importance of Pin1 for lamina constitution. Thus, our results suggest a functional model of similar events leading to disassembly of the nuclear lamina in response to herpesviral or inherent cellular stimuli. In essence, Pin1 represents a regulatory effector of lamina disassembly that promotes the nuclear pore-independent egress of herpesviral capsids.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Viruses often adopt preexisting cellular pathways to promote their own replication. In this regard, the recently discovered alternative mechanism for the nuclear export of large messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes is particularly noteworthy. This process is mechanistically similar to the nuclear egress of herpesviruses, which appear to utilize cellular pathways and effectors to release assembled capsids from the host nucleus. While vesicle formation and scission events at nuclear membranes are now increasingly understood in greater detail, the precise mechanism of the preceding disassembly of the nuclear lamina still awaits a defined molecular characterization. Here, we used herpesviruses in their property to induce a nucleocytoplasmic viral capsid export for our investigation of nuclear lamina disassembly. We identified a mechanism that promotes lamina disassembly by a conformational change of lamins, mediated by the cellular isomerase Pin1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Intriguingly, Pin1 appeared to control the rearrangement of phosphorylated lamins and their transient displacement from the nuclear lamina. Our study suggests that Pin1 functions as a major regulatory effector of lamina disassembly and thus determines the nuclear egress pathway of herpesviruses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The nuclear envelope represents a physical barrier separating the nucleus from the cytoplasm. It consists of three distinct elements: nuclear membranes, nuclear pores, and the proteinaceous network of the nuclear lamina. The main constituents of the nuclear lamina are nuclear lamins that belong to type V intermediate filament proteins and are grouped into type A and B. Type A includes lamins A and C (lamin A/C) that are derived from the LMNA gene by alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref001">1</xref>]. Like all intermediate filaments, lamins are composed of a central alpha-helical coiled-coil rod domain flanked by globular head (N-terminal) and tail (C-terminal) domains. Parallel lamin dimers are formed by coiled-coil interactions of the rod domains of two lamin monomers. The lamin dimers form polar head-to-tail polymers, and several polymers associate side by side into lamin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Reversible disassembly of the nuclear lamina was described for several cellular processes including mitosis and nuclear export of large messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. During open mitosis of higher eukaryotes, lamina disassembly starts in early prophase, and reassembly of the nuclear lamina is completed in telophase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref003">3</xref>]. Recent work by Speese <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref004">4</xref>] demonstrated an alternative route for nuclear mRNP export besides translocation of mRNP complexes through nuclear pores. In particular, the alternative export process is based on membrane budding of mRNP complexes at the nuclear envelope which requires local disassembly of the nuclear lamina. Intriguingly, this pathway closely resembles nuclear egress of herpesvirus capsids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Herpesviruses are large, enveloped viruses with linear double-stranded DNA genomes. They are divided into alpha-, beta-, and gammaherpesvirus subfamilies based on their cell tropism, productive replication, latency, and genome sequence. Primary infections are followed by lifelong persistence in their hosts. However, viral pathogenesis and clinical manifestations can differ substantially between individual herpesviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref006">6</xref>]. Synthesis of viral genomic DNA and assembly of viral capsids occur in the nucleus. Upon packaging of the genome, capsids are translocated into the cytoplasm. This multistage process is termed nuclear egress and is crucial for herpesviral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref007">7</xref>]. Due to their large size, herpesviral capsids cannot be transported through nuclear pores. Instead, nucleocytoplasmic transport of viral capsids is mediated by budding through nuclear membranes. Notably, access of viral capsids to the inner nuclear membrane (INM) is impeded by the nuclear lamina. A large body of evidence established that nuclear egress of herpesviral capsids is facilitated by local disassembly of the nuclear lamina [reviewed in 8].</p>
<p>Site-specific phosphorylation of lamin A/C at Ser22 and Ser392, which is mainly mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), promotes the transient disassembly of the nuclear lamina during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref010">10</xref>]. However, it seems that phosphorylation of one of these âmitotic sitesâ, namely Ser22, is sufficient to induce disassembly of at least lamin A/C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref011">11</xref>]. Besides Ser22 and Ser392, mitotic phosphorylation of further serine residues by CDK1, such as Ser404 and Ser406, was shown to be associated with increased depolymerization of lamin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref012">12</xref>]. It is generally accepted that herpesvirus-induced lamina disassembly during nuclear egress is based on a similar phosphorylation-dependent process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref013">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Importantly, our studies on nuclear egress of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) suggested that the cellular peptidyl-prolyl <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerase (PPIase) Pin1 is involved in lamina disassembly during herpesvirus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref016">16</xref>]. Pin1 is a nuclear PPIase that induces conformational changes in its substrates by isomerization of phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro bonds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref017">17</xref>]. Notably, we recognized that Ser22-specific phosphorylation, mediated by the viral protein kinase pUL97 during HCMV infection, generates a Pin1-binding motif in lamin A/C. Moreover, we demonstrated coprecipitation of lamin A/C by a Pin1 antibody from HCMV-infected cell lysates and translocation of Pin1 to the nuclear periphery of HCMV-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the role of Pin1 during herpesviral nuclear egress and, particularly, its importance for lamina disassembly in general. Phosphorylation of Ser22 of lamin A/C consistently generates a Pin1-binding motif in cells infected with human and animal alpha-, beta-, and gammaherpesviruses. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we demonstrated that binding of human Pin1 to a synthetic lamin peptide induces its <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerization <italic>in vitro</italic>. A detailed bioinformatic evaluation strongly suggests that this structural conversion induces larger scale secondary structural changes in the lamin N-terminus. Thus, we propose that a Pin1-induced conformational change of lamins may result in the disassembly of the nuclear lamina. Consistent with this concept, we observed that a phospho-mimetic lamin A mutant still forms a regular lamina structure and that overexpression of a lamin-phosphorylating kinase is not sufficient to induce lamina disassembly in Pin1 knockout (KO) cells. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of Pin1 interfered with the efficient lamina disassembly in herpesvirus-infected human fibroblasts, and consequently, resulted in decreased virus replication. Pin1 inhibition also causes association of phosphorylated lamins with the nuclear lamina, which would become dispersed throughout the nucleus without inhibition. Strikingly, we observed this phenomenon not only in herpesvirus-infected cells but also in uninfected cells. Our results therefore suggest that a Pin1-induced conformational change of lamins generally facilitates disassembly of the nuclear lamina.</p>

First, to further investigate the importance of site-specific phosphorylation during HCMV replication, we infected primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) with HCMV laboratory strain AD169 (HCMV AD), harvested the cells at 72 hours post-infection (hpi), and performed Western blot analysis using phosphorylation-specific antibodies. While the expression level of lamin A/C remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, lanes 1â4, third panel), a multiplicity of infection (MOI)-dependent increase of Ser22 phosphorylation was detected in HCMV-infected cells compared to the uninfected control (mock; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, lanes 1â4, upper panel). In contrast, phosphorylation of Ser392 was detectable, but not increased in HCMV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, lanes 1â4, second panel). Notably, the fact that Ser22 and Ser392 are generally phosphorylated in HCMV-infected cells was previously described by Hamirally <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref019">19</xref>]. However, our data indicate that only Ser22 phosphorylation is specifically induced during HCMV replication whereas Ser392 phosphorylation levels are not considerably elevated in HCMV-infected cells.</p>

<title>Site-specific phosphorylation of lamin A/C at Ser22 and Ser392 in herpesvirus-infected primary fibroblasts analysed by western blot.</title>
<p>HFFs were infected with different herpesviruses belonging to subfamily alpha (A), beta (B), and gamma (C). For HSV-1, HCMV, RhCMV, and MHV-68 infections, increasing MOIs were applied in a range between approx. 0.1â1. Cells were lysed at 24 hpi (HSV-1) or 72 hpi (HCMV, RhCMV, and MHV-68). Virus-positive carrier cells were cocultivated in serial dilutions with host HFFs for VZV and HHV-6A infections, producing ~60% and ~30% of infected cells, respectively. Cells were lysed at 72 h post-cocultivation. In all cases, total lysates were subjected to standard Western blot analysis for detection of lamin A/C phosphorylated at Ser22 (pSer22) or Ser392 (pSer392) (upper two panels), total lamin A/C (third panels), viral marker proteins (fourth and fifth panels), and loading control Î²-actin (lower panels). <italic>*</italic>, detection of a viral 17 kDa protein using a polyspecific MHV-68 post-infection murine antiserum.

<p>In the next step, we compared phosphorylation levels of Ser22 and Ser392 in cells infected with representatives of the three subfamilies of <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> in addition to HCMV: i.e. three human viruses (HSV-1, VZV, and HHV-6A), one non-human primate virus (RhCMV), and one murine virus (MHV-68). Similarly to HCMV, these viruses have the ability to infect HFFs under cell culture conditions. While HFFs are not susceptible to infection with the human gammaherpesviruses EBV and KSHV, infection with murine MHV-68 was positive in leading to the expression of viral proteins and site-specific lamin phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Intriguingly, Ser22 phosphorylation consistently increased in cells infected with the analysed herpesviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g001">Fig 1Aâ1C</xref>, upper panels), while Ser392 was phosphorylated in a virus-specific manner. In particular, a strong increase of Ser392 phosphorylation compared to uninfected cells was detected for HSV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, lanes 1â4, second panel), but no increase for VZV, HHV-6A, RhCMV, and MHV-68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, lanes 5â7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, lanes 5â12, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, lanes 1â3, second panels). Lamin A/C expression levels remained unaltered for HSV-1, RhCMV, MHV-68, VZV, and HHV-6A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g001">Fig 1Aâ1C</xref>, third panels).</p>
<p>In addition to Western blot analysis, cells were subjected to confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005825.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Notably, viral proteins stained as markers for infection are expressed at early (E) or late (L) kinetics: the viral DNA polymerase processivity factors pUL44 and p41 of HCMV and HHV-6A, respectively, and the nuclear egress protein encoded by orf24 of VZV are E gene products; the major capsid protein ICP5 of HSV-1 and glycoprotein B (gB) of RhCMV are L gene products. While nuclear egress is expected to occur at the L phase of viral replication, Western blot kinetics experiments showed that lamin phosphorylation is already markedly increased along the proceeding of the E phase (i.e. â¥ 48 hpi) of HCMV replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005825.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Lamin A/C and lamin B differ in their ability to remain associated with the INM. Whereas lamin A/C can be found solubilized in the nucleus, lamin B is permanently membrane associated due to post-translational isoprenylation and specific protein interactions with membrane proteins such as the lamin B receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref020">20</xref>]. We detected dispersed lamin A/C phosphorylation signals in virus-infected cells entirely inside the nucleus by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005825.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). The localization of phosphorylated lamins in infected cells clearly differed from mitotic cells that showed a wide nucleocytoplasmic pSer22 distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, panels Mock and HCMV AD, indicated by asterisks). We quantified signal intensities of lamin A/C phosphorylation in virus-infected cells in comparison to uninfected cells within z-series for individual nuclei with standardized conditions and identical imaging areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Staining of viral marker proteins was used to localize infected cells. Importantly, signal intensities of Ser22 phosphorylation were increased in more than 80% of cells infected with HSV-1, HCMV AD, HCMV TB, and RhCMV to approx. 2-fold over uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1005825.t002">Table 2</xref>). For VZV and HHV-6A, more than 50% of infected cells showed a moderate increase in Ser22 phosphorylation (1.41Â±0.09- and 1.69Â±0.20-fold, respectively). In case of HCMV infection, Ser22 phosphorylation was dependent on the viral protein kinase pUL97 as seen with HCMVs AD, TB and ÎUL97 (a recombinant HCMV lacking pUL97 kinase). In particular, infection with HCMV ÎUL97 did not alter Ser22 phosphorylation compared to uninfected cells. In contrast, cells infected with HSV-1 ÎUS3, lacking pUS3 kinase, showed a moderately lower Ser22 phosphorylation efficiency than those infected with parental HSV-1, but still increased compared to uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1005825.t002">Table 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005825.s009">S1 Dataset</xref>). This suggests that Ser22 might also be phosphorylated by the second viral protein kinase, pUL13, or cellular kinases (such as protein kinase C, PKC) in HSV-1-infected cells.</p>

<title>The cellular PPIase Pin1 promotes efficient herpesviral replication</title>
<p>We previously identified Pin1 as a phosphorylation-dependent binding partner of lamin A/C in HCMV-infected cells, suggesting that Pin1 might play a role during herpesvirus-induced lamina disassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref016">16</xref>]. Analyses of lamin phosphorylation during infection with selected members of the <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> revealed the generation of a common Pin1-binding motif in lamin A/C comprising pSer22 and Pro23. A multiple sequence alignment of LMNA sequences demonstrated conservation of the Pin1-binding motif at least in lamin A/C of humans, rhesus macaques, and mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). We then analysed Pin1 expression levels in infected cells by Western blot analysis. Since Pin1 expression is activated by the transcription factor E2F [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref021">21</xref>], which is subject to the control of cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref022">22</xref>], HHFs were synchronized at the G0 phase by serum starvation prior to HCMV infection. At 72 hpi, an upregulation of Pin1 was demonstrated in an MOI-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, lanes 1â3). An increase in Pin1 levels was also observed for infection with HSV-1, VZV, or RhCMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, lanes 4â14), but not as efficient as seen for HCMV. The upregulation of Pin1 expression might be explained by the fact that several herpesviruses are able to activate E2F-mediated gene expression by a modulation of the degree of phosphorylation and degradation of the major cell cycle-controlling retinoblastoma protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref023">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref025">25</xref>].</p>

Amino acid sequences of the lamin A/C precursor from humans (UniProt accession number: P02545), rhesus macaques (F7GLE9), and mice (P48678) were analysed by multiple sequence alignment. Note the 100% conservation of the lamin A/C N-terminus including the Pin1-binding motif. Depicted are the N-terminal 30 amino acids of each sequence. (B) Pin1 upregulation in herpesvirus-infected cells. HFFs were infected with HSV-1, VZV, HCMV, or RhCMV at increasing MOIs. Cells were lysed at 24 hpi (HSV-1) or 72 hpi (VZV, HCMV, and RhCMV). Lysates were subjected to standard Western blot analysis for detection of Pin1 (rabbit mAb-Pin1; upper panels), viral marker proteins (middle panels), and loading control Î²-actin (lower panels). Pin1 signal intensities were quantified by densitometry using AIDA image analyser. (C) Effect of pharmacological Pin1 inhibition on herpesviral replication efficiency. HFFs were infected with HCMV GFP at a MOI of 0.2 or remained uninfected (mock). The Pin1 inhibitor PiB and the anti-HCMV reference drug ganciclovir (GCV) were added immediately post-infection at 10 Î¼M and 20 Î¼M, respectively. Cells were lysed at 7 days post-infection to perform quantitative GFP fluorometry (n = 3; mean Â± standard deviation; statistical significance was determined by Studentâs t-test). Potential cytotoxic effects of these compounds in the concentrations used were excluded by microscopic evaluation before cell lysis.</p>

<p>To determine if Pin1 PPIase activity possesses a general function during herpesviral replication, we inhibited Pin1 PPIase activity by addition of the Pin1 inhibitor PiB. The effect of Pin1 inhibition on herpesviral replication efficiency was analysed using an established HCMV green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based reporter assay at day 7 post-infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref026">26</xref>]. HCMV replication was reduced by the presence of PiB during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Notably, PiB produced a moderate inhibitory effect when compared to the anti-HCMV reference drug ganciclovir (GCV). Pin1 inhibition by PiB was not associated with general cytotoxicity at the concentration used of 10 Î¼M, indicated by microscopic evaluation of cell morphology and cell growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005825.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Moreover, the data derived from a standard trypan blue exclusion assay demonstrated that PiB-induced cytotoxicity occurred only with drug concentrations of 60 Î¼M and higher (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005825.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). The total cell numbers (dead and living cells) were not significantly reduced under PiB treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005825.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). In conclusion, Pin1 expression is regulated in herpesvirus-infected cells and its activity is important for efficient viral replication.</p>

<title>Pin1 catalyses the prolyl <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerization of a phosphorylated lamin A/C peptide</title>
<p>Pin1 is a PPIase that isomerizes specific phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs resulting in conformational changes in target proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref027">27</xref>]. On this basis we postulated that herpesvirus-mediated and mitotic Ser22 phosphorylation might trigger a Pin1-induced conformational change in lamin A/C. At present, there is no technique available to study prolyl <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerization at atomic resolution <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has been proven as a suitable method to provide information about PPIase interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref028">28</xref>], in particular for Pin1 activity directed to phosphorylated Pro-containing peptides at atomic resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref029">29</xref>]. Moreover, we have previously demonstrated that enzymatic catalysis of prolyl <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerization observed for domain peptides are also valid for the full length protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref030">30</xref>]. In order to assign the <sup>1</sup>H chemical shifts of phosphorylated or unphosphorylated lamin A/C peptides (comprising amino acids 11 to 40), catalytic amounts of Pin1 were added to the peptide solution and data were then recorded in a complete series of NMR experiments. In the presence of Pin1, exchange peaks between related NH signals from Ser22 of the <italic>cis</italic> Pro23 and <italic>trans</italic> Pro23 isomers of phosphorylated lamin A/C peptides were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). In contrast, no exchange peaks were observed after addition of Pin1 to the solution of the analogous unphosphorylated lamin A/C peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). This result was not unexpected since phosphorylated Ser and Thr preceding Pro in this type IV WW binding motif have hitherto been recognized as substrates for Pin1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref031">31</xref>]. To confirm the specificity of interaction between Pin1 and the Ser22-phosphorylated lamin A/C peptide, the known Pin1 inhibitor juglone was applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref032">32</xref>]. The NOESY NMR spectrum of the phosphorylated lamin A/C peptide revealed that after the sequential addition of Pin1 and juglone, the prolyl <italic>cis/trans</italic> exchange peaks disappeared and the NMR spectra closely resembled those of the untreated phosphorylated peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005825.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Thus, Pin1 behaves as a lamin A/C PPIase <italic>in vitro</italic> causing an increase in the interconversion rate of Pro23 in a Ser22-phosphorylated state of the peptide.</p>

<title>The Pin1-induced isomerization directed to the pSer/Thr-Pro motif is predicted to affect the overall structure of the N-terminus of nuclear lamins</title>
<p>Since NMR data revealed that Pin1 activity increases the interconversion rate of Pro23, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the structural effect of Ser22 phosphorylation and Pro23 isomerization. For this purpose, three different peptides spanning residues 1â30 of lamin A/C that differ either in the phosphorylation state of Ser22 or the isomerization state of Pro23, i.e. (i) with Ser22 not phosphorylated and Pro23 in <italic>trans</italic> configuration (Ser22 / <italic>trans</italic> Pro23), (ii) Ser22 phosphorylated and Pro23 in <italic>trans</italic> configuration (pSer22/Pro23 <italic>trans</italic>), and (iii) Ser22 phosphorylated and Pro23 in <italic>cis</italic> configuration (pSer22/Pro23 <italic>cis</italic>), were simulated. A comparison of the Ser22/Pro23 <italic>trans</italic> and pSer22/Pro23 <italic>trans</italic> peptides revealed that phosphorylation itself has only a small effect and both peptides represented similar conformations over the simulation time. This is evidenced by the histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g004">Fig 4C</xref>. As one minor difference, we noted a slight decrease in the helix stability of residues 23â30 upon Ser22 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, left and middle panel), which most likely results from electrostatic interactions of phosphorylated Ser22 with the adjacent arginines, thus favouring alternative backbone conformations. A comparison of the pSer22/Pro23 <italic>trans</italic> and pSer22/Pro23 <italic>cis</italic> peptides revealed that Pro23 <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerization has a more pronounced effect on the overall shape of the lamin A/C N-terminus. For Pro23 in <italic>cis</italic>, a kink emerges in the lamin A/C structure, which causes the sampling of less extended peptide conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, middle and right panel). This is also evident from the histogram showing that the length of the most prevalent peptide conformations is reduced by more than 10% from 35 Ã to 31 Ã (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Therefore, an increased interconversion between the Pro23 <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> isomers might have an impact on the structure of lamin A/C, thereby also affecting its ability to form lamin multimers as a requirement to constitute a structurally interconnected nuclear lamina.</p>

<title>The nuclear lamina of Pin1 knockout cells is resistant to kinase-induced disassembly</title>
<p>To substantiate the hypothesis that a Pin1-induced conformational change of lamins may result in lamina disassembly, we first analysed if the nuclear lamina is sensitive to kinase-mediated disassembly in absence of Pin1. Therefore, we generated Pin1 knockout (KO) HeLa cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Efficiency of the Pin1 KO was monitored by Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). The morphology of the nuclear lamina was investigated by confocal microscopy and visualized effects produced by the expression of the HCMV kinase pUL97 in wild-type (wt) and Pin1 KO HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>). Previously, it has been shown that overexpressed HCMV pUL97 is generally able to induce lamina disassembly in transiently transfected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref024">24</xref>]. In this study, only wt Hela cells showed a decrease of endogenous lamin signals upon expression of HCMV pUL97, while the nuclear lamina of Pin1 KO HeLa cells remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). The endogenous lamin A/C staining of vector-transfected showed a strict rim signal in both wt and Pin1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Quantitation of signal intensities further indicated that lamin A/C levels are generally higher in Pin1 KO compared to wt HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). This might suggest that the nuclear lamina is more densely packed in absence of Pin1.</p>

<title>The negative charge conferred by Ser22 phosphorylation is not sufficient for lamina disassembly</title>
<p>In a next step, we generated red fluorescent protein (RFP)-fused lamin A mutants which do not generate a Pin1-binding motif upon phosphorylation of Ser22. Since mutation of Pro23 is likely to affect the overall structure of the lamin N-terminus, we substituted Ser22 with glutamic acid (Glu) or alanine (Ala) to produce a phosho-mimetic (Ser22Glu) and a phospho-deficient (Ser22Ala) lamin A mutant, respectively. To test whether the negative charge conferred by Ser22 phosphorylation was sufficient to induce lamina disassembly, we analysed the localization of these lamin mutants by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Intriguingly, the phospho-mimetic lamin A mutant Ser22Glu showed a uniform localization along the nuclear rim of transfected wt HeLa cells similar to the phosho-deficient mutant Ser22Ala or wt lamin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). This indicated that the phospho-mimetic lamin A mutant cannot be recognized by Pin1 which is consistent with the observation of Moretto-Zita <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref033">33</xref>] describing the failure of Ser-to-Glu mutants of the transcription factor Nanog to interact with Pin1. Moreover, coexpression with HCMV pUL97 induces a disruption of the uniform staining of wt lamin A illustrated by dot-like accumulations along the nuclear rim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Importantly, the phospho-mimetic and -deficient lamin A mutants were both resistant to the pUL97-mediated drastic redistribution observed for wt lamin A, however, the Ser22Glu mutant showed a thinning of the lamin staining at certain areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). These minor alterations in the localization of the phospho-mimetic mutant might be explained by the fact that pUL97 can phosphorylate lamin A/C at further sites besides Ser22, at least <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref019">19</xref>]. Confirming the effect on endogenous lamin A/C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>), pUL97 was also not able to disrupt the rim staining of overexpressed wt lamin A in Pin1 KO HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g006">Fig 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005825.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Taken together, the negative charge conferred by Ser22 phosphorylation is not sufficient for lamina disassembly, but Ser22 phosphorylation appears to be a prerequisite for the activity of Pin1.</p>

<title>Pharmacological inhibition of Pin1 activity partially restores the integrity of the nuclear lamina in HCMV-infected cells</title>
<p>To investigate whether Pin1 is also required for lamina disassembly during herpesviral infection, we inhibited Pin1 activity in HCMV-infected cells and analysed the integrity of the nuclear lamina by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Since Pin1 might also affect different phases of herpesviral replication besides nuclear egress, the inhibitor treatment was not started immediately after virus infection as performed for the GFP-based replication assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Notably, local lamina disassembly (i.e. lamina-depleted areas) was detected in HCMV-infected cells at 72 hpi and later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref016">16</xref>]. Thus, the Pin1 inhibitor PiB was provided at 48 hpi to ensure that Pin1 activity was inhibited before the major onset of virus-induced lamina disassembly. Addition of PiB at 48 hpi did not affect levels of viral marker proteins in Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005825.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). This suggests that early viral regulatory steps preceding nuclear egress were not or only poorly inhibited by this experimental strategy. Intriguingly, lamina disassembly, typically detectable by decreased lamin A/C signals at the nuclear rim of HCMV-infected cells, was attenuated in the presence of PiB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g007">Fig 7A and 7C</xref>). Moreover, local depletion of the nuclear lamina was also impaired upon PiB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Notably, similar effects were detected by application of the HCMV pUL97 kinase inhibitor maribavir (MBV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g007">Fig 7Aâ7C</xref>). To exclude a direct effect of PiB on pUL97 activity during infection, we performed comparative Western blot analysis with lysates from HCMV-infected cells treated at 48 hpi with PiB, MBV, or the solvent control DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Importantly, PiB treatment neither affected Ser22 phosphorylation levels nor expression of pUL97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g007">Fig 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005825.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). These findings additionally confirmed that the inhibitory effect of PiB was directed to the late phase of HCMV replication, particularly to nuclear egress including the phosphorylation-dependent disassembly of the nuclear lamina. Moreover, we analysed the subcellular localization of the INM protein emerin to exclude a general effect of PiB on nuclear envelope integrity. Of note, we observed no differences in the regular rim staining of emerin at the nuclear envelope of uninfected (mock) and HCMV-infected cells treated with PiB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005825.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). In conclusion, Pin1 activity is essential for efficient lamina disassembly and the induction of lamina-depleted areas in HCMV-infected cells.</p>

<title>Association of phosphorylated lamins with the nuclear lamina upon inhibition of Pin1 activity</title>
<p>Phosphorylation of lamins at âmitotic sitesâ disassembles the nuclear lamina and causes a diffuse nuclear localization of lamin A/C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005825.s001">S1A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref001">1</xref>]. If a Pin1-induced conformational change is responsible for lamina disassembly, then Pin1 inhibition should reduce phosphorylated lamin A/C dissolving away from the nuclear lamina. Thus, finally, we analysed the localization of phosphorylated lamin A/C in the presence of the Pin1 inhibitor PiB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed an accumulation of Ser22-phosphorylated lamin A/C at the nuclear rim of HCMV-infected cells treated with PiB at 72 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). This phenotype was detected in 61.4% of infected cells upon PiB treatment, in contrast to 15.4% of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Here again, PiB treatment was started at 48 hpi to reduce effects on other phases of viral replication besides nuclear egress. Interestingly, we also detected increased accumulation of Ser22-phosphorylated lamin A/C in a subset of uninfected cells treated with PiB for 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). In this experiment, we evaluated uninfected interphase cells with detectable levels of Ser22 phosphorylation indicating imminent cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref034">34</xref>]. In this setting, 10.4% of cells showed pSer22 staining exclusively at intranuclear locations. Of these cells, 22.9% of PiB-treated cells in contrast to 7.6% of DMSO-treated control cells showed Ser22 staining at the nuclear rim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Taken together, inhibition of Pin1 during HCMV replication, as well as in uninfected cells, prevents Ser22-phosphorylated lamin A/C from becoming dispersed throughout the nucleoplasm suggesting an association with the nuclear lamina despite its phosphorylated state.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although site-specific lamin phosphorylation has been known for a long time to cause disassembly of the nuclear lamina, the underlying mechanism is still not completely understood. It has been proposed that phosphorylation interferes with electrostatic interactions between lamin dimers, thereby promoting lamina disassembly. This scenario was challenged by the identification of a phosphorylation-dependent binding motif for the PPIase Pin1 in lamins and that Pin1 might induce a conformational change to facilitate lamina disassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref035">35</xref>]. In this study, we used herpesvirus-mediated lamin phosphorylation during nuclear egress as a tool to analyse the role of Pin1 in lamina disassembly. Consistent phosphorylation of the âmitotic siteâ Ser22 in infected cells suggested a common mechanism of lamina disassembly which is conserved among herpesviruses and might involve Pin1. Notably, we demonstrated isomerization of a Ser22-phosphorylated lamin A/C peptide by Pin1 <italic>in vitro</italic> using NMR spectroscopy. Bioinformatics analysis further suggested that Pin1-mediated <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerization of Pro23 induces a kink in the lamin N-terminus. Cell culture experiments finally provided evidence that the presence of Pin1 and its PPIase activity are essential for the efficient disassembly of the nuclear lamina. Thus, we propose a model in which Pin1 facilitates depolymerization of lamin filaments by inducing a conformational change in nuclear lamins.</p>
<p>As a main finding of the present study, Ser22 and Ser392 phosphorylation of lamin A/C was consistently detected for several herpesviruses, although quantitative differences were identified. While Ser22 phosphorylation has been constantly found for various herpesviruses, increase of Ser392 phosphorylation, compared to uninfected cells, has been observed mostly for the alphaherpesvirus HSV-1. Earlier reports suggested that cellular protein kinases, such as PKC isoforms, are specifically recruited during herpesviral infection to phosphorylate nuclear lamins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref036">36</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref038">38</xref>]. In more recent reports, it was shown that virus-encoded protein kinases, such as HCMV pUL97, HSV-1 pUS3, and others, are involved in lamin phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref039">39</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref041">41</xref>]. Accordingly, we found in the present study that high levels of Ser22 phosphorylation were missing in cells infected with a UL97-deficient HCMV. In contrast, infection with a US3-deficient HSV-1 resulted in a limited but still detectable increase in Ser22 phosphorylation compared to uninfected cells. Notably, alphaherpesviruses encode two protein kinases such as pUS3 and pUL13, belonging to the HvUS and HvUL group, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref014">14</xref>], while beta- and gammaherpesviruses exclusively encode HvUL group homologues such as HCMV pUL97 (also termed as conserved herpesvirus protein kinases, CHPKs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref042">42</xref>]. As reported by Kuny <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref024">24</xref>], transient overexpression of HvUL group homologues of human beta- and gammaherpesviruses, but not those of alphaherpesviruses, resulted in a Ser22-specific phosphorylation of lamins leading to nuclear lamina disassembly in plasmid-transfected cells. Thus, the consistent phosphorylation of lamin A/C at Ser22 in herpesvirus-infected cells demonstrated in the present study indicates that different lamin-directed viral and probably also cellular protein kinases may act in concert to modify the nuclear lamina.</p>
<p>The lamin phosphorylating viral and cellular protein kinases are recruited to the nuclear lamina by viral egress core proteins to form a multimeric nuclear egress protein complex (NEC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref015">15</xref>]. The core of this NEC is formed by a heterodimer of the two conserved herpesviral nuclear egress proteins, designated as pUL50 and pUL53 in the HCMV nomenclature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref043">43</xref>]. The core NEC serves as a scaffold for the association of further viral and cellular NEC components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref044">44</xref>]. Proteomic analyses recently provided candidate lists of proteins contained within the NECs of cells infected with human or murine cytomegaloviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref046">46</xref>]. Of note, it was demonstrated that the NEC has additional activities beyond the regulation of nuclear lamina disassembly. The core NEC is sufficient for membrane deformation and scission which is necessary for budding of viral capsids at the INM, a process which requires previous lamina disassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref047">47</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref049">49</xref>].</p>
<p>CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of Ser22 and Ser392 is associated with lamina disassembly during mitosis. In particular, based on the crystal structure of a lamin A fragment, it has been suggested that phosphorylation of Ser22 and, possibly, Ser392 interferes with electrostatic interactions between the head and tail domains with the N- and C-terminal regions of the rod domain, respectively, and thereby initiates lamin disassembly down to the dimeric level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref050">50</xref>]. The presented data of this study now suggests that phosphorylation alone is not sufficient for lamina disassembly <italic>in vivo</italic>. In fact, phosphorylation at Ser22 might be required for a Pin1-induced conformational change of lamin A/C which finally triggers depolymerization of lamin filaments. Confirming this hypothesis, we demonstrated that the phospho-mimetic Ser22Glu lamin A mutant was still able to form a regular lamina structure and that a Ser22-phosphorylating kinase did not induce lamina disassembly in absence of Pin1. In addition, we showed that pharmacological inhibition of Pin1 activity interferes with efficient lamina disassembly during nuclear egress of herpesviral capsids. Alternatively, the effect of Pin1 inhibition or Pin1 knockout might also be explained by the possibility that the Pin1-catalysed conformational change keeps lamins in a phosphorylated state and thereby dissolved from the nuclear lamina. In this scenario, the compact conformation of lamin A/C with a <italic>cis</italic> Pro23 might impede lamin dephosphorylation by phosphatases which would be required for reassembly of the nuclear lamina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref001">1</xref>]. Importantly, activity of Pro-directed phosphatases is configuration specific and substrate residues can only be dephosphorylated in the <italic>trans</italic> isomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref017">17</xref>]. However, our observation that Pin1 inhibition results in the association of Ser22-phosphorylated lamin A/C with the nuclear lamina favours the setting of a conformational change-driven depolymerization of lamin filaments or even a combination of both scenarios.</p>
<p>During cell cycle progression, Pin1 activity is regulated by post-translational modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref017">17</xref>]. In particular, Pin1 is inactivated by phosphorylation at Ser16 during G2/M transition. After entry into mitosis, Pin1 activity is restored by the dephosphorylation of Ser16 and the activating phosphorylation at Ser65 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref051">51</xref>]. Thus, Pin1 is in an active state during mitosis to facilitate lamina disassembly. At the end of mitosis, the nuclear lamina reassembles along with the reformation of the nuclear envelope. Dephosphorylation of lamins is required for lamina reassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref052">52</xref>]. Inactivation of Pin1 might be, therefore, required to shift the balance to the <italic>trans</italic> isomer to allow lamin dephosphorylation by phosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref017">17</xref>]. In herpesvirus-infected cells, we detected increased Pin1 expression. Analysis of post-translational modifications in future studies might reveal similar mechanisms of Pin1 regulation as seen during mitosis.</p>
<p>In addition to the targeting of Pin1 to lamins during nuclear egress, Pin1 might also have importance for further regulatory steps in herpesviral replication. It was demonstrated for the EBV DNA polymerase catalytic subunit BALF5 that it interacts with Pin1 in GST pulldown and immunoprecipitation assays. Since the DNA replication defect of a recombinant BALF5-deficient virus could be efficiently complemented only by exogenous supply of wild-type BALF5, but not by a binding-deficient BALF5 mutant, a regulatory role for Pin1 in herpesviral DNA replication was postulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref053">53</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings provide evidence for a conserved phosphorylation-triggered mechanism of lamina distortion during herpesviral nuclear egress. The presented data provide evidence for a specific functional role for Pin1 in herpesvirus-induced lamina disassembly. Our findings also suggest a functional model of similar events that mediate lamina disassembly during mitosis or the non-canonical nuclear export of large mRNP complexes in uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Specifically, site-specific lamin phosphorylation by herpesvirus-encoded or host cell protein kinases initiates lamina disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). In HCMV-infected cells, cellular (e.g. PKC) and viral protein kinases (e.g. pUL97) are recruited to the nuclear lamina by the viral NEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g009">Fig 9A</xref>, left). In uninfected cells, lamins can be phosphorylated by various endogenous protein kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g009">Fig 9A</xref>, right). In both cases, Ser22-specific lamin phosphorylation generates a Pin1-binding motif. After binding, Pin1-mediated <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerization of Pro23 then induces a conformational change in the lamin N-terminus resulting in local lamina disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). In herpesvirus-infected cells, the produced disassembly of the nuclear lamina enables budding of viral capsids at the INM for nuclear egress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g009">Fig 9C</xref>, left). Intriguingly, the lamina disassembly during the herpesviral nuclear egress pathway appears to be similar to the lamina disassembly required for nuclear envelope budding of large mRNP complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g009">Fig 9C</xref>, middle) and for nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005825.g009">Fig 9C</xref>, right). These novel insights into the concerted action of protein kinases and Pin1 improve our understanding of various effector functions controlling nuclear herpesvirus-host interaction.</p>

Inhibition of prolyl <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerase interaction of Pin1 with phosphorylated lamin A/C peptide by addition of juglone: The catalytic prolyl <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerase interaction of Pin1 with phosphorylated lamin A/C peptide was inhibited by addition of excessive amounts of the Pin1 inhibitor juglone dissolved in 5 Î¼l deuterated dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO-D6). We have previously shown that the presence of 1% DMSO does not inhibit catalytic prolyl <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerase interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref028">28</xref>]. The disappearance of NMR exchange peaks, originating from the catalytic prolyl <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerase interaction of Pin1 with the phosphorylated lamin A/C peptide, after addition of juglone was revealed by superimposition of analogous NOESY spectra prior to and after addition of the inhibitor, using Bruker Topspin 1.3 software. Peptide synthesis was performed by Metabion International AG (Germany). Recombinant human Pin1 was purchased from Biotrend Chemikalien GmbH (Germany).</p>

<p>The computational investigation of linear peptides with the sequence METPSQRRATRSGAQASSTPLSPTRITRLQ followed an approach similar to earlier work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref066">66</xref>]. Three systems were set up in an initial extended conformation, differing in the phosphorylation state of Ser22 and the configuration of Pro23: (1) Ser22 not phosphorylated, Pro23 in <italic>trans</italic> configuration (Ser22/Pro23 <italic>trans</italic>); (2) Ser22 phosphorylated, Pro23 in <italic>trans</italic> configuration (Ser22 phos/Pro23 <italic>trans</italic>); and (3) Ser22 phosphorylated, Pro23 in <italic>cis</italic> configuration (Ser22 phos/Pro23 <italic>cis</italic>). All systems were subjected to 1000 steps of energy minimization in order to remove any steric clashes and to relax the peptide. The systems were then brought to the target simulation temperature of 310 K in 0.2 ns and subsequently simulated in an NPT ensemble for 200 ns with a time step of 2 fs. During the production phase, coordinate snapshots were saved every 20 ps. The parm99SB force field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref068">68</xref>] with additional parameters for phospho-serine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref069">69</xref>] was applied and a Generalized Born implicit solvent model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref070">70</xref>] with Bondi atomic radii was used to account for the correct environmental properties. All Coulomb and van der Waals interactions were taken into account; no cut-off was applied. Structure representatives for each system were obtained via hierarchical clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref071">71</xref>]. All simulations and analyses were performed with programs from the Amber14 suite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref072">72</xref>]; structural representations were generated with VMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005825.ref073">73</xref>].</p>

<p>(A) HFFs were infected with different herpesviruses or remained uninfected (mock) as indicated. Cells were fixed at 24 hpi (HSV-1 and HSV-1 ÎUS3) or 72 hpi (VZV, HCMV AD, HCMV TB, HCMV ÎUL97, HHV-6A, and RhCMV) followed by immunofluorescence analysis using phospho-specific antibodies to detect lamin A/C phosphorylated at Ser392 in red. Staining of viral proteins or the green fluorescent protein (GFP) served as viral markers in green. Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (4â,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Samples were analysed by confocal microscopy and a representative image of the focal plane is depicted for each setting. <italic>Filled arrows</italic>, nuclei of virus-positive cells; <italic>open arrows</italic>, nuclei of virus-positive cells showing increased Ser392 phosphorylation compared to virus-negative cells; <italic>scale bars</italic>, 30 Î¼m.
