<abstract>
<p>Little is known about the relative contributions and importance of antibacterial effectors in the nematode <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, despite extensive work on the innate immune responses in this organism. We report an investigation of the expression, function and regulation of the six <italic>ilys</italic> (invertebrate-type lysozyme) genes of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. These genes exhibited a surprising variety of tissue-specific expression patterns and responses to starvation or bacterial infection. The most strongly expressed, <italic>ilys-3</italic>, was investigated in detail. ILYS-3 protein was expressed constitutively in the pharynx and coelomocytes, and dynamically in the intestine. Analysis of mutants showed that ILYS-3 was required for pharyngeal grinding (disruption of bacterial cells) during normal growth and consequently it contributes to longevity, as well as being protective against bacterial pathogens. Both starvation and challenge with Gram-positive pathogens resulted in ERK-MAPK-dependent up-regulation of <italic>ilys-3</italic> in the intestine. The intestinal induction by pathogens, but not starvation, was found to be dependent on MPK-1 activity in the pharynx rather than in the intestine, demonstrating unexpected communication between these two tissues. The coelomocyte expression appeared to contribute little to normal growth or immunity. Recombinant ILYS-3 protein was found to exhibit appropriate lytic activity against Gram-positive cell wall material.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Innate immune defenses against bacterial pathogenesis depend on the activation of antibacterial factors. We examined the expression and relative importance of a gene family encoding six invertebrate-type lysozymes in the much-studied nematode <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. The <italic>ilys</italic> genes exhibit distinct patterns of tissue-specific expression and response to pathogenic challenge and/or starvation. The most abundantly expressed, <italic>ilys-3</italic>, exhibits constitutive pharyngeal expression, which we show is essential for efficient disruption of bacteria under non-pathogenic growth conditions, and consequently it contributes to normal longevity. <italic>ilys-3</italic> is also strongly up-regulated in intestinal cells after starvation or exposure to Gram-positive pathogens such as <italic>Microbacterium nematophilum</italic> and acts as a ‘slow-effector’ in limiting pathogenic damage from intestinal infections. We show that this induction by pathogens depends on the action of an ERK-MAPK cascade, which acts in pharyngeal rather than intestinal cells; this implies communication between pharynx and intestine. Tagged ILYS-3 protein was detected mainly in recycling endosomes of intestinal cells and in the intestinal lumen after starvation. ILYS-3 was also expressed in coelomocytes (scavenger cells) but we found that these cells make little or no contribution to defense. We examined the enzymatic properties of recombinant ILYS-3 protein, finding that it has lytic activity against <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> cell-walls.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Most animal epithelia possess innate defense systems that sense pathogenic and toxic insults and transmit stranger/danger signals to activate appropriate counter measures. The efficacy with which animals can respond to pathogens determines whether organismal homeostasis can be maintained and microbial clearance achieved. In vertebrates, the transcriptional programs that control the epithelial production of antimicrobials and mucosal homeostasis both act via coordinated activation of common innate immune receptors: Toll-like receptors (TLR), Nod-like receptors (NLR) and the cytosolic helicases RIG-1 and MDA5. Some of these also function as sensors of endogenous or exogenous damage-associated molecular patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>The invertebrate <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> has proved a valuable model to deconstruct biological processes that deal with the way animals detect danger signals and respond to life-threatening events such as toxic chemicals, DNA damage, metabolic stress and pathogens. Damage inflicted on nematode tissues can trigger a variety of functionally conserved molecular events aimed at limiting and repairing damage or sustaining viability while adverse conditions persist (reviewed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref006">6</xref>]).</p>
<p>This nematode is a bacterial feeder that spends much of its life in decomposing vegetable matter and depends on microbes as its source of food. To survive an environment rich in potentially damaging microorganisms, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> has evolved an epithelial defense system that is able to carry out complex functions. Thus surface-exposed tissues such as epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref007">7</xref>], pharynx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref008">8</xref>], intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref009">9</xref>], vulva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref010">10</xref>], and hindgut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref011">11</xref>] are not simple physical barriers, but have all been shown capable of eliciting appropriate immune defense when exposed to potential pathogens. A crucial regulatory challenge to the nematode is the requirement for an adequate discrimination between real threats and innocuous edible food sources.</p>
<p>Much of what we know about the way this nematode is able to cope with pathogen insults comes from studies with intestinal infections. The response of intracellular signaling pathways within the intestine to microbial pathogens has been studied extensively in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and has been reviewed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref012">12</xref>]. Intestinal epithelia recognize and respond to extracellular pathogens by activating specific intracellular programs that include families of MAP kinases such as p38 and JNK, among others, that result in expression of candidate immune effectors that fight pathogens.</p>
<p>Predicted antimicrobial proteins elicited in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> after immune challenge include among others, C-type lectins, CUB-like domain proteins and lysozymes. Many of them probably help the organism maintain intestinal homeostasis under normal intestinal growth conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref013">13</xref>]. However, and except for the saposins <italic>ssp-1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref014">14</xref>] and <italic>ssp-5</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref016">16</xref>], for all the others their critical effector function in antimicrobial defense remains to be demonstrated.</p>
<p>We have studied the response of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> to a Gram-positive bacterium that adheres to the rectal and anal cuticle, <italic>Microbacterium nematophilum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref017">17</xref>]. This nematode-specific pathogen has provided a means to analyze the complex biochemistry of the surface coat and the underlying cuticle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref020">20</xref>] as well as innate immune responses. Orally ingested <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> alone instigates inflammation and tail swelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref021">21</xref>]. Despite the fact that the most obvious response to infection is rectal colonization and the induction of inflammation in the rectal tissues, this bacterium also establishes itself in the gut of the worm. This makes it a good system to investigate complex effects that occur in the digestive tract associated with chronic gut colonization.</p>
<p>We, and others, have previously found a cluster of invertebrate lysozymes that include <italic>ilys-2</italic> and <italic>ilys-3</italic>, (and the probable pseudogene <italic>ilys-1)</italic> is upregulated upon exposure to many different bacteria, namely <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref022">22</xref>], <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref008">8</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref023">23</xref>]), <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> DB27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref023">23</xref>], <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref024">24</xref>], <italic>Cronobacter sakazakii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref025">25</xref>], <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar <italic>Typhimurium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref026">26</xref>], <italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref027">27</xref>] as well as fungi <italic>Candida albicans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref028">28</xref>] and <italic>Drechmeria coniospora</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Lysozymes are important bactericidal effectors present in phylogenetically diverse organisms from vertebrates to bacteriophages. In addition to promoting digestion, lysozymes confer direct broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties and perform essential functions in innate immunity. They are effective at targeting the cell wall of many Gram-positive bacteria by hydrolyzing the 1,4-β-glycosidic linkages between <italic>N-</italic>acetylmuramic acid and <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine that make up the carbohydrate backbone of cell wall peptidoglycan. Although primarily associated with defense against Gram- positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacterial cell walls can also be attacked by these enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref030">30</xref>]. Based on their structural, catalytic and immunological differences, lysozymes have been classified into 6 sub-types. Major lysozymes found in animals belong to chicken(c), goose (g), invertebrate (i) or protist-type groups. All these four groups have been identified in invertebrates. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> has numerous lysozyme genes belonging to both the protist-type (<italic>lys-1</italic> to <italic>lys-10)</italic> and invertebrate type (<italic>ilys-1</italic> to <italic>ilys-6)</italic> lysozymes reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref031">31</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref032">32</xref>] and this study. Besides their ability to hydrolyse 1,4-β-glycosidic bonds in the glycan moiety of peptidoglycan, invertebrate lysozymes can also exhibit an isopeptidase (known as destabilase) activity, which specifically targets the isopeptide bonds established between D-Glutamate and L-Lysine present in some Gram-positive peptidoglycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref035">35</xref>]. An additional activity attacking isopeptide-type substrates can potentially enhance the lytic activity of invertebrate lysozymes. However, in most cases such synergy is still elusive and awaits further evidence.</p>
<p>While the protist-type lysozymes have been shown to play a role in host defense in interactions that involve <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>thuringiensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref036">36</xref>], <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref037">37</xref>], <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref038">38</xref>], <italic>S. aureus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref008">8</xref>]</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref022">22</xref>], little is known about the function of the i-type lysozymes in the worm. We therefore investigated expression, induction and function of <italic>ilys-1-6</italic> focusing our attention on ILYS-3.</p>
<p>Here we show that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> invertebrate lysozyme ILYS-3 has important roles in both healthy and diseased worms; it is required to enable normal pharyngeal grinder function and to defend against bacterial pathogens. We find that ILYS-3 is a slow effector that is induced by danger signals generated both by bacterial pathogens and starvation. Under non-pathogenic conditions, in the gut <italic>ilys-3</italic> expression levels undergo a post-developmental regulatory oscillation. Levels increase after L1 hatching, decline after the L2 transition, and after L4 transition increase again becoming abundantly expressed in the intestine of adult worms.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we provide evidence that the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic>-mediated intestinal induction of <italic>ilys-3</italic> is regulated through the pharyngeal action of the extracellular signal-regulated MAP kinase (ERK) pathway in a non-cell- autonomous manner. This effect implies a mechanism whereby pharyngeal cells sense and propagate danger signals and further instruct antimicrobial responses in distal tissues. This systemic immune regulation of <italic>ilys-3</italic> reveals an unexpected communication between the pharyngeal and intestinal tissues in this multicellular organism.</p>
<p>Finally, using recombinant ILYS-3 fusion proteins we demonstrate their <italic>in vitro</italic> hydrolytic activity against the peptidoglycan of Gram-positive <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic>. Such lytic activity will impact on the integrity of the cell walls and bacterial viability, which ultimately will affect proliferation in the nematode intestine. In addition, ILYS-3 probably contributes to the ability to digest and cope with the large amount of peptidoglycan fragments generated by a Gram positive diet (either pathogenic or non-pathogenic).</p>

<p>To provide insights into their site of action and response to infection, we investigated the expression pattern of the six invertebrate lysozymes present in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> genome.

<p>This analysis revealed an unexpected variety in the <italic>ilys</italic> expression patterns, suggesting that these genes may have distinct biological roles. Anatomically, expression of <italic>ilys-1</italic>,<italic>-3</italic> and <italic>-6</italic> covers the whole pharynx suggesting that they may have complementary functions. Given the considerable chemical, organizational and architectural diversity within bacteria cell walls and peptidoglycans (PGNs), one might expect little or no redundancy among <italic>ilys</italic> genes.</p>
<p>We found distinct allelic forms of <italic>ilys-1</italic> in various natural isolates of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. These included several exonic SNPs and a 10 bp insertion in the second intron that is likely not to impact on the coding region. Unlike all the other <italic>ilys</italic> genes, <italic>ilys-1</italic> does not encode a signal sequence, its first exon consists only of two methionines, and this together with the accumulation of several polymorphisms suggests that this invertebrate lysozyme is a pseudogene, despite its functional promoter.</p>
<p>The functional relevance of the neuronal expression of invertebrate lysozymes is unknown. However, lysozymes have been thought to play a role in neurodegenerative diseases as a part of amyloid plaque pathology. In a fly model of Alzheimer's disease for example, neuronal co-expression of lysozyme and amyloid-β<sub>1–42</sub> diminished soluble and insoluble amyloid species, and prolonged survival of Aβ-expressing flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we focused our attention on the <italic>ilys-3</italic> gene because this was one of highly expressed genes induced in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> upon exposure to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> and its reporter showed strong induction under various conditions (as described below).</p>
<p>To determine its spatial distribution and responses to infection, we generated four expression reporters. Two of these consisted of a short (1.05 kb) and a long (4.5 kb) version of the <italic>ilys-3</italic> 5' sequence (presumed promoter) driving GFP expression. The third and fourth types were translational reporters with GFP or mCherry fused to ILYS-3 ORF at the N- or C-terminus, respectively. Both translational reporters used the 4.5 Kb <italic>ilys-3</italic> promoter.</p>
<p>The short promoter drove GFP expression mainly in the pharynx grinder muscles pm7, the isthmus marginal cell mc2 and muscle cell pm5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Grinder action is believed to disrupt bacterial cells. In addition, all intestinal cells exhibited <italic>ilys-3</italic> promoter activity, with some variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). Intestinal expression of <italic>ilys-3</italic> appeared to be temporally regulated. GFP was first detected in intestine of L1 hatchlings but declined at the L2 transition. By the L4 stage, the intestinal GFP signal became stronger and continued through adulthood. The intensity of GFP was very high in aging adult worms that were no longer self-fertile. Whereas the intestinal expression of <italic>ilys-3</italic> changed during larval growth and adult life, the pharyngeal GFP reporter expression remained constant in larval and adult stages. Weak epidermal promoter activity was also detected.</p>
<p>The long promoter revealed additional GFP expression in the six scavenger coelomocyte cells, but at a significantly lower level in other tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g001">Fig 1K</xref>). This reporter included only part of the 28 Kb sequence between <italic>ilys-3</italic> and its closest upstream neighbor, C45G7.4, but most of the region is occupied by a large cadherin gene <italic>cdh-10</italic>, on the other strand, whose 3' end is only 1.2 Kb from the predicted ATG of <italic>ilys-3</italic>.</p>
<p>N and C terminal tags showed essentially the same spatial expression patterns. However, higher levels of fluorescence intensity were seen in transgenic animals harboring extrachromosomal arrays of the C-terminal mCherry translational fusion, so this reporter was used in most subsequent experiments.</p>
<p>Steady-state levels of ILYS-3::mCherry were barely detectable until late L4 stage. When the animals entered adulthood, the mCherry signal became stronger in the pharynx, the intestine and in the coelomocytes. The epidermis also expressed mCherry albeit at low levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Representative images of this expression are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g001">Fig 1D–1I</xref>. ILYS-3::mCherry was abundant in the intestinal lumen in old adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) and in animals subjected to starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). Such luminal secretion of ILYS-3 by intestinal cells was most conspicuous in dauers induced on nutrient-depleted plates. By contrast, we noted surprisingly little of the ILYS-3::mCherry signal in the intestinal lumen of animals under normal growth. To attain additional evidence that tagged ILYS-3 accumulates in the intestinal lumen, we fed animals with fluorescent microspheres just prior to their imaging. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g001">Fig 1F and 1I</xref> ingested microspheres accumulated in the intestinal lumen marked with red fluorescence.</p>
<p>The translational mCherry fusion protein shows a punctate expression pattern in most tissues in the pharynx and intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). In the intestinal cells, ILYS-3::mCherry positive vesicles were enriched in the cytosol.</p>
<p>Together these data show that ILYS-3 has a dynamic expression pattern under standard growth conditions and is found primarily in the digestive tract of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> in the pharyngeal cells and the intestine, indicating that it may play roles both in early stages of bacterial grinding and in further lysis required for nutrient digestion.</p>

<title>ILYS-3 constitutively localizes to intestinal vesicles and is secreted in the lumen at dauer arrest</title>
<p>Given the unexpected paucity of the ILYS-3::mCherry signal in the intestinal lumen of young animals, we examined the subcellular trafficking of ILYS-3. For this, we used well-established markers for early endosomes (GFP::RAB-5), late endosomes (GFP::RAB-7), and Trans-Golgi Network (TGN) and apical recycling endosomes (GFP::RAB-11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The intestine of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> is a polarized epithelium with apical membranes and microvilli facing the lumen and a basolateral surface contacting the body cavity (pseudocoelom).These two domains are separated by apical junctions. Molecules that reach the lumen are believed to be delivered through complex sorting machineries in four distinct ways: 1. directly, 2. indirectly, via specifically dedicated vesicles, 3. via apical recycling endosomes or 4. through transcytosis by means of membrane-bounded carriers.</p>

</fig>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g002">Fig 2</xref> only a subpopulation of ILYS-3::mCherry colocalized and appeared as puncta around the rim of the GFP::RAB-7 labeled late endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref>). This population of mCherry-positive vesicles was distributed through the cytoplasm, in the middle focal plane. We found a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.39, indicating a low degree of colocalization with the total population of RAB-7-positive endosomes. Some of the RAB-11-positive recycling endosomes that appeared scattered in the cytoplasm were also mCherry positive. Pearson's coefficient at 0.47, suggested some degree of correlation. However no ILYS-3::mCherry signal could be detected at the apical membrane and its associated puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g002">Fig 2D–2F</xref>). Likewise, no mCherry and GFP-double labeling was detected with the transmembrane marker for the apical intestinal membrane OPT-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>A separate but pertinent population of ILYS-3-positive vesicles was associated with the acidic lysosome-related organelles (LROs) in the intestine and were LysoTracker Green-labelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g002">Fig 2G–2I</xref>). The Pearson's coefficient was 0.62, implying a greater degree of correlation of ILYS-3 signal with these organelles. LROs are destination vesicles for degradation of extracellular macromolecules from both the apical and basolateral trafficking routes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g002">Fig 2I</xref> illustrates also the lack of ILYS-3::mCherry in the apical membrane in contrast to the positive green-labelled-LysoTracker, internalised from apical uptake.</p>
<p>At its simplest, the surprising absence of strong apical and luminal mCherry signal in young animals could indicate that these animals simply degrade the tagged ILYS-3 more efficiently than older siblings. However, the presence of the ILYS-3:mCherry in endosomal and LRO compartments suggests that there could be fast turnover and/or re-uptake of the luminal ILYS-3 through an endocytic recycling route. Hence, the protein could still be present in the apical compartments, but below thresholds of detection.</p>
<p>Endocytic recycling of proteins from endosomes to the plasma membrane is important in cellular processes such as nutrient uptake and immune functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref041">41</xref>]. We next sought to determine whether the reason why we were unable to detect apical mCherry was because ILYS-3 was associated with endosomes that perform basolateral recycling. We used the <italic>rme-1</italic> mutant that specifically accumulates abnormally high numbers of basolateral recycling endosomes but does not accumulate increased numbers of early, late, or apical recycling endosomes in their intestines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref042">42</xref>]. In the <italic>rme-1</italic> mutants a large number of ILYS-3::mCherry vesicles associated with a basolateral tubule-vesicular network were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g002">Fig 2K</xref>) relative to WT background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g002">Fig 2J</xref>). Together these results suggest that at least part of ILYS-3::mCherry associates with the interconnected endosomal tubules and that basolateral recycling of ILYS-3 does not require RME-1. Rather than being actively delivered to the apical plasma membrane domain, ILYS-3::mCherry appeared to be dispatched, via the basolateral route, to recycling endosomes. We also found that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> infection induced high ILYS-3::mCherry signals in the tubular-vesicular recycling endosome network of the intestinal cells, strongly resembling animals lacking RME-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The basolateral recycling endosomal location of ILYS-3 was surprising given that abundant ILYS-3::mCherry was observed in the lumen of old animals and dauers.</p>
<p>RAB-10 has been shown to function in basolateral recycling in the intestine upstream RME-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref043">43</xref>]. <italic>rab-10</italic> mutants exhibit enlarged early endosomes that are likely to play roles in receiving, sorting and also recycling cargo received from both the apical and the basolateral domains. We therefore tested whether a defect in such key endocytic route could interfere with the distribution of basolateral-destined ILYS-3::mCherry. In <italic>rab-10(ok1494)</italic> deletion mutants we observed an aberrant accumulation of the red signal on the apical membrane and its associated vesicles of the intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g002">Fig 2L</xref>). This was consistent with an impairment on basolateral recycling that characterizes this genetic background. We interpret these results, as an indication that ILYS-3 can be routed to the apical side of the intestinal cells, albeit at low levels in WT backgrounds.</p>
<p>As described above, only in old adults and dauer larvae do we see abundant luminal accumulation of ILYS-3::mCherry. The simplest explanations for this are that the turnover of the protein is impeded in intestinal epithelial cells of these animals and/or it resulted from the leakage due to apical cell damage. Tight junctions act as fences, preventing leakage of basolateral components into the apical compartment. However, if their integrity is compromised, leakage may ensue. While these two scenarios seemed possible in old animals, they appeared unlikely in dauers. To address this issue we first examined where ILYS-3 accumulated in dauers. For this, we co-expressed ILYS-3::mCherry and the intestinal marker RAB-11 tagged to GFP, which labels the apical plasma membrane. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g003">Fig 3A–3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g003">Fig 3J</xref>, most of red signal conferred by ILYS-3::mCherry accumulated within the extracellular milieu, i.e. in the pharyngeal and intestinal lumina. In the intestine mCherry was detected between cells marked by GFP::RAB-11 and the intensity profiles of the two proteins have little overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g003">Fig 3J</xref>). Steady levels of high luminal ILYS-3::mCherry could still be observed in 25-day old dauer larvae, suggesting that the protein was not actively degraded in these animals.</p>

<p>Strikingly, ILYS-3::mCherry expression pattern in the lumen of dauers rapidly returned to the original localization when animals resumed development after re-exposure to OP50. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g003">Fig 3D</xref> mCherry began to accumulate intracellularly even before animals resumed feeding in the first hour after they encountered food. The figure is representative of a recovering dauer larva transferred to a bacterial lawn mixed with fluorescent microspheres. No fluorescent beads were detected in the intestinal lumen, indicative of no feeding activity. The transgenic animal shown co-expressed ILYS-3::mCherry and the GFP::RAB-7, a marker for early endosomes near plasma membrane and late endosomes deeper in the cytoplasm. Red fluorescence signal was seen in the lumen and the cytosol at the most anterior and posterior intestinal cells, respectively. Three hours later, fluorescent beads denoting feeding activity could be found in the intestinal lumen, where mCherry was still highly abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g003">Fig 3E and 3F</xref>). Upon overnight feeding the punctate expression pattern of ILYS-3::mCherry in the cytosol was re-established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g003">Fig 3G–3I</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together these data show that the vesicular and luminal ILYS-3::mCherry distribution is modifiable and regulated by nutritional conditions. This invertebrate lysozyme is secreted in the intestinal lumen but it can also be detected deeper in the cytosol in LROs and recycling-associated vesicles, both of which are known final destinations for internalized fluid-phase cargos. Our observations suggest an intracellular role for the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> ILYS-3 in addition to luminal activity, which includes intracellular intestinal compartments where it could be acting to degrade residual peptidoglycan fragments.</p>

<p>Previous microarray analysis showed that during early infection by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic>, <italic>ilys-2 and ilys-3</italic> were upregulated by 3 and 4- fold, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref022">22</xref>]. To further investigate the role of <italic>ilys-3</italic> gene in host-pathogen defense, we visualized <italic>ilys-3</italic> transcriptional activation <italic>in vivo</italic> using L1 transgenic worms expressing the GFP reporter transgene (short <italic>ilys-3</italic> promoter). We used this promoter because the corresponding transgene showed stronger inducibility than the longer version.</p>
<p>We found that <italic>ilys-3</italic> is highly responsive to immune challenges by different Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. Under steady state conditions, when animals develop on lawns of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> OP50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g004">Fig 4Ai</xref>), only low levels of GFP expression are detected in the gut. In contrast, 48 h after exposure to both virulent and attenuated strains of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic>, CBX102 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g004">Fig 4Aii</xref>) and UV336 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g004">Fig 4Aiii</xref>) or to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>luteus</italic> DMS20030 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g004">Fig 4Aiv</xref>), strong GFP expression is induced in the intestine, irrespective of whether these pathogens induce an inflammatory swelling response in the worm rectum. The increased levels of GFP signal were quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the intestinal cell int8 in individual transgenic worms that express the <italic>ilys-3</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Single-cell measurements revealed a 3-fold induction of <italic>ilys-3</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic> in response to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> CBX102 and UV336.</p>

Shown are box plots distributions for the GFP expression in the intestinal cell of L1 animals maintained on the three bacteria for 48 hours at 25°C. The focal plane with the highest GFP signal was used to measure fluorescence intensity within a region of interest (ROI) set to 40 μ diameter and 0.4 μ thickness. Graph is representative of two independent experiments. Asterisks indicate the results of Mann Whitney test of fluorescence values, 95% confidence interval relative to OP50 of worms on CBX102 (** <italic>p</italic> = 0.0012), and on UV336 (*** <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). NS: not significant. N = 15 per group. (C) qRT-PCR analysis of <italic>ilys</italic> genes from L1 larvae propagated on OP50, CBX102, UV336 for 48 hours, showing high levels of <italic>ilys-2</italic> and <italic>ilys-3</italic>. Expression levels were normalized to OP50, and to the endogenous control gene <italic>rla-1</italic>. <italic>ilys-2</italic> and <italic>ilys-3</italic> transcripts were clearly responsive to Gram-positive bacteria. In contrast, <italic>ilys-4</italic> and <italic>ilys-5</italic> mRNA levels remained mainly unchanged. Data were analyzed with two-way Anova, Holm-Sidak's multiple comparison tests (99% CI) and showed that the increased levels of induction of <italic>ilys-3</italic> mRNA by CBX102 and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>luteus</italic> were significantly different (** <italic>p</italic> = 0.0059) but there was no statistically significant change (NS) between animals on CBX102 and UV337 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.4644). Gene expression was analyzed using the comparative ΔΔCt method. Data are representative of four independent experiments. Error bars are SEM. (D) Quantification of the <italic>ilys-3p</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic> fluorescence in the intestinal cell int2 of the <italic>ilys-3</italic> reporter in animals subjected to nutrient depletion.

Graph is representative of two independent experiments. Mean values for one-day-old adults off food differ significantly from their sibling controls on OP50 (**** <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Statistically significant differences were also seen in one-day-old arrested larvae (off OP50) when compared to naïve animals hatched overnight (* <italic>p</italic> = 0.0237). N = 12/group.

<p>To quantify the pathogen-induced activation of <italic>ilys-3</italic> gene transcription and in non-transgenic animals we used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of whole worm extracts, a method that allows a more reliable quantification of endogenous <italic>ilys-3</italic> mRNA than reporter genes. Strong induction of <italic>ilys-3</italic> (between 370 and 590x) was observed after animals were challenged for 24h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) and 48h by the three Gram-positive bacteria strains, CBX102, UV336 and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>luteus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>A clear increase in transcriptional response (above 50x) was also seen for <italic>ilys-2</italic> and less markedly for <italic>ilys-6 (</italic>above 10x, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), whereas for <italic>ilys-4</italic> and <italic>ilys-5</italic> no significant changes were observed. Neither <italic>ilys-2</italic>,<italic>-3</italic> nor<italic>-6</italic>, were changed in expression levels after exposure to the moderately lethal pathogen <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> CBX102 causes a distinctively cell swelling in the tail and infected animals become constipated 24 hours after feeding on this bacterial pathogen. In contrast, worms feeding on the attenuated strains <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> UV336 or <italic>M</italic>. <italic>luteus</italic> DMS20030 appear superficially healthy, but their rate of development is slower compared to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> OP50 controls, and they take one extra day to reach adulthood.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the activation of <italic>ilys-3</italic> following bacterial exposure could be caused by a stress response due to nutrient deprivation resulting from low quality food ingested by the worms. To test this we monitored the levels of expression of <italic>ilys-3</italic> GFP reporter (GFP driven by the short promoter) in animals subjected to starvation. A 24 hour-starvation regime in young adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g004">Fig 4Avi</xref>) or in arrested L1 larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g004">Fig 4Aviii and 4Ax</xref>) provoked a significant intestinal induction of the GFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Nutrient depletion led to a 14.5-fold and a 2.3-fold increase in the intestinal GFP signal detected in adults and larvae, respectively. The addition of live <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> OP50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g004">Fig 4Av</xref>), [or HB101 (even better quality food, as reported by Shtonda &amp; Avery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref044">44</xref>]) restored the low levels of basal GFP expression of <italic>ilys-3</italic> in the intestine.</p>
<p>A strong GFP expression of the <italic>ilys-3</italic> reporter was also seen in animals fed on diets of heat-killed OP50, or heat-killed CBX102 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s005">S5A and S5C Fig</xref>). Heat-killed bacteria are more likely to be harder-to-eat and to provide a bad quality diet. In fact, at 72 hours post-hatching all animals on dead bacterial cells had only reached the L2-L3 transitional larval stage. The response elicited to dead bacteria therefore represents a starvation rather than a pathogen response.</p>
<p>The starvation-induced GFP pattern was specific to the <italic>ilys-3</italic> reporter lines as all the other <italic>ilys</italic> transgenes failed to show induction when worms were starved for 24 hours. In fact the <italic>ilys-5</italic> reporter was repressed whereas transgenic animals expressing <italic>ilys-2</italic> and <italic>ilys-4</italic>, CFP or GFP levels remained unchanged. The strong GFP signal present in the intestine of <italic>ilys-5</italic> transgenic animals was completely abolished when animals were starved for 24 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s006">S6 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our results indicate that <italic>ilys-3</italic> activation is responsive to both Gram-positive bacteria and starvation signals. Although a previous microarray analysis identified a rapid up-regulation of ILYS-3 in response to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref022">22</xref>], our real-time PCR analysis revealed a much larger delayed increase of mRNA levels 24 and 48 h after bacterial challenge (590 and 430x, respectively).</p>

<title>ILYS-3 is required in the pharynx and intestine to promote bacterial lysis and to confer protection against bacterial pathogens</title>
<p>To investigate the function of the <italic>ilys-3</italic> gene we analyzed the phenotype of the recessive mutation <italic>ok3222</italic>, which has an 855 bp deletion that removes most of the coding region. On standard bacterial food OP50 the mutants appeared superficially healthy, with no gross abnormalities and with fertility (self-progeny brood size) only slightly reduced relative to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s007">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>If <italic>ilys-3</italic> is expressed in the pharyngeal tissue because it is required for efficient lysis then the mutant might be expected to show signs of defective grinder activity and consequently accumulate live bacterial cells in the gut. To address this possibility we compared the kinetics of bacterial accumulation in the gut of mutant and WT animals of the same age. L4 animals were exposed to GFP-expressing <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and SYTO 13-labeled CBX102 and visually scored at different times for presence of a green signal in the intestinal lumen. Although intestinal <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> can be normally detected in old WT animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref046">46</xref>], they are rarely seen in the younger animals used in this experiment indicating efficient bacterial lysis. In contrast, we observed that <italic>ilys-3</italic> mutants accumulated substantially more un-lysed <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>::GFP positive cells in their guts relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g005">Fig 5Aiii–5Aiv and 5Ai and 5Aii</xref>). These differences were clear within four hours of feeding on GFP-expressing <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. Furthermore, an even higher intestinal bacterial load was observed when <italic>ilys-3</italic> mutants were challenged with CBX102 labeled with SYTO 13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g005">Fig 5Bii</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g005">Fig 5Bi</xref>). SYTO 13 is a cell-permeant nucleic acid stain that permits visualization of unlysed live bacterial cells. The high green fluorescence of CBX102 cells seen in the lumen of <italic>ilys-3</italic> mutants suggests that most bacteria that have passed through the pharyngeal grinder remain viable.</p>

<p>Bacterial survival in the alimentary tract was also measured directly by homogenizing washed whole animals and counting colony-forming units. In one-day old adults CFU numbers of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> in <italic>ilys-3</italic> mutants were two-fold higher than WT controls [note that these counts include bacteria from both pharyngeal and gut lumen, and therefore underestimate the difference in intestinal burden] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). The intestinal proliferation of CBX102 was also assayed in animals of the same age and we found that <italic>ilys-3</italic> mutants had significantly higher bacterial loads than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). We estimated that mutant animals had around 3.6-fold more cell counts than WT. Restoration of ILYS-3 in <italic>ok3222</italic> mutants using the transgene e<italic>Ex752</italic> rescued this phenotype and transgenic animals were able to grind bacteria more efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g005">Fig 5Av and 5Avi</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g005">Fig 5Biii</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). In addition, the accumulation of viable CBX102 cells in <italic>ilys-3</italic> transgenic animals carrying the <italic>eEx752</italic> array was comparable to that observed for WT (<italic>p</italic> = 0.4090).</p>
<p>We therefore concluded that ILYS-3 is required in the pharynx for efficient disruption of live bacteria and to reduce bacterial colonization in the intestine of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>.</p>
<p>Standard <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> OP50 is commonly used as food despite the fact that it can be mildly pathogenic and its accumulation in the intestine is responsible for much variability in the lifespan of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref047">47</xref>]. Given this, we compared the life expectancy of wild-type and <italic>ilys-3</italic> null mutant strains grown on OP50 and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> lawns.</p>
<p>Under our experimental conditions, the mean lifespan of wild-type <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> propagated from L1 on OP50 was approximately 17 days. However, the deletion mutation in <italic>ilys-3</italic> decreased the mean lifespan by 24% to 13 days (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g005">Fig 5D and 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s020">S2 Table</xref>). The reduced life expectancy observed in <italic>ilys-3</italic> mutants was restored to that of wild-type in transgenic animals carrying transgenes <italic>eEx752</italic> or <italic>eEx754</italic>. Moreover, both transgenes extended average survival of mutant animals growing on OP50 by 20% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), probably as a consequence of ILYS-3 overexpression.</p>
<p>Despite their identical average lifespans on pathogen lawns of CBX102 (10 days) N2 animals overexpressing ILYS-3 with <italic>eEx754</italic> also exhibited increased adult longevity relative to control animals without this transgene. Compared to N2 the average lifespan of <italic>ilys-3</italic> mutants on pathogen lawns decreased by 30% (from 10 days to 7 days, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g005">Fig 5G and 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s021">S3 Table</xref>). Interestingly, supernumerary copies of <italic>ilys-3</italic> seemed to have a protective effect mainly during adulthood. Animals carrying transgenes <italic>eEx752</italic> and <italic>eEx754</italic> showed statistically significant survival curves relative to WT in both <italic>ilys-3</italic> and WT backgrounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s021">S3 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>The translational fusion ILYS-3 protein appears to be fully functional and reverses the shortened lifespan of <italic>ilys-3(ok3222)</italic> when mutants were fed either OP50 or CBX102 diets.</p>
<p>To address the possibility that the reduced lifespan of <italic>ilys-3</italic> mutants was a consequence of subtle developmental defects and/or to a reduced fitness of animals, we measured the developmental rate of WT and mutants on live bacterial cells of OP50 and on the pathogen CBX102 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Synchronized animals were added to each of the diets as L1 larvae and their developmental age was assessed 48 hours later. No significant differences were found between wild-type and mutants fed on live OP50 or CBX102 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.9 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.7, respectively, 99% confidence level). On pathogen lawns both WT and mutants exhibited similar developmental progression rates at 48 hours and the majority of the animals were of the same developmental age, at the L2 stage.</p>
<p>We therefore concluded that the pathogen-response differences between WT and mutants that we observed were acquired after larval development rather then early in life. Thus, infection by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> might therefore pose a higher risk in mature and elder animals when immunity wanes.</p>
<p>Altogether these results show that ILYS-3 has an important role in the pharyngeal grinder for proper lysis of bacterial cells. The reduced enzymatic activity by this tissue results in increased bacterial colonization in the gut, and reduced lifespan.</p>

<title>Abrogated coelomocyte activity does not compromise functional immune response, but exerts a small effect when combined with the loss of <italic>ilys-3</italic></title>
<p>Although the major tissues that express ILYS-3 are associated with the digestive tract, we also detected expression in the coelomocytes. These are scavenger cells in <italic>C</italic>.<italic>elegans</italic> and have been shown to perform unspecific endocytosis of fluid-phase markers and macromolecules from the body cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref048">48</xref>]. Although similar cells are believed to have an immune function in many invertebrates, in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> their specific involvement in phagocytosis of whole bacteria seems unlikely and this arm of innate defense is apparently missing. Nevertheless, how did ILYS-3 appear in these cells? One possible scenario would be that ILYS-3::mCherry is secreted by intestinal and pharyngeal tissues and eventually taken up and degraded by the coelomocytes. Proteins with a secretion signal, such as ILYS-3 are translated and processed in the ER and might be secreted into the pseudocoelom before being endocytosed by coelomocytes. However, several lines of evidence indicate that coelomocytes directly produce ILYS-3. First, we observed coelomocyte expression in transgenic animals expressing the long promoter version of the GFP transcriptional reporter, thus suggesting that they are among the primary sites of <italic>ilys-3</italic> transcription activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g001">Fig 1K</xref>). Second, we found that absence of functional coelomocytes did not result in an increased level of ILYS-3:mCherry in the body cavity; for this we used the coelomocyte-deficient strain, NP717 (kind gift of H. Fares). NP717 animals have genetically ablated coelomocytes due to expression of a variant of the Diphtheria toxin A fragment (E148D) driven by the coelomocyte-specific <italic>unc-122</italic> promoter. These animals also express an ssGFP that is secreted by the body wall muscles and accumulates in the body cavity, demonstrating lack of coelomocytes and scavenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref048">48</xref>]. No accumulation of ILYS-3::mCherry in the pseudocoelom was detected in CB7137 animals (NP717 derivative strain) with ablated coelomocytes relative to their respective control counterparts. Finally, we found that in a <italic>rme-1</italic> deletion mutant which has impaired coelomocyte up-take of endocytosis markers, the population of ILYS-3::mCherry positive vesicles was unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s009">S9C Fig</xref>). These mutants exhibit an accumulation of the soluble GFP secreted from body-wall muscle cells in their pseudocoelom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref042">42</xref>]. However, examination of ILYS-3 expression in this genetic background revealed that compromising endocytic function did not affect the fluorescence intensity, the size or the number of the coelomocytic vesicles. These findings indicate that coelomocytes directly produce ILYS-3.</p>
<p>In the coelomocytes, ILYS-3 is present in presumptive endosomes and lysosomes. This was observed by injecting Alexa-488 BSA into the body cavity of animals expressing ILYS-3::mCherry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s009">S9A Fig</xref>). An hour after injection, a population of endocytosed Alexa-488-BSA bearing vesicles co-localized with mCherry positive compartments. These were subsequently confirmed as late endosome/lysosomes vesicles by doubly labeling ILYS-3::mCherry transgenic animals with the endocytic compartment marker GFP::RAB-7, which detects early/late endosomes and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s009">S9D–S9F Fig</xref>). We also found that in the <italic>cup-5</italic> mucolipin-1 mutants <italic>(ar465)</italic> the population of large vacuoles that correspond to late endosome-lysosome hybrids, were positive for ILYS-3::mCherry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s009">S9B Fig</xref>). In these mutants, although lysosomes are able to fuse with late endosomes, the autolysosomes fail to degrade endocytosed material, thus resulting in accumulation of large vacuoles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref049">49</xref>].</p>
<p>Given the ILYS-3 coelomocyte expression pattern, we reasoned that perhaps these cells might confer some protection against microbial pathogenesis, similar to their mammalian counterparts. To test this hypothesis we examined the effect of removing these cells on the lifespan of animals exposed to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> and compared their response to that of wild-type worms. Depleting coelomocytes resulted in a wild-type response to the pathogen and the median lifespans of coelomocyte-ablated NP717 and N2 were indistinguishable (approximately 7 days) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). In contrast, in the coelomocyte-minus <italic>ilys-3</italic> double mutants (CB7137, an NP717 derivative strain) an enhanced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen was observed relative to NP717 and to N2. The overall median lifespan of both NP717 and CB7137 animals decreased from 7 to 5 days, (p &lt; 0.0001), and <italic>ilys-3</italic> double mutants were no different from <italic>ilys-3</italic> single mutants. However, a greater proportion of double mutant larvae succumbed to the pathogen at early time points, while older animals that managed to escape the initial bacterial burden exhibited similar mortality risk rates to those of the <italic>ilys-3</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). When analyzed the two early survival curves were statistically different (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004). We concluded that removing coelomocytes <italic>per se</italic> did not shorten survivorship of wild-type worms and therefore these cells do not seem to provide a protective response to the pathogen <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic>. However, when combined with a defective <italic>ilys-3</italic> function, lower survival rates in the younger cohorts were observed. Combined absence of functional <italic>ilys-3</italic> and coelomocytes contribute to disease pathogenesis, presumably due to a compound effect of gut luminal colonization and failure to remove/recycle unwanted macromolecules in younger animals. It is therefore likely that these cells play a more important role in hatchlings then in their older siblings and specially in situations where peptidoglycan overload occur.</p>

<p>These results were confirmed by assaying the effect of the MEK inhibitor U0126 on the expression of <italic>ilys-3</italic> reporter in the gut of L4 WT animals grown on HB101 or on 10% CBX102 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g006">Fig 6Bi and 6Bii</xref>). Exposure of the worms to the MEK inhibitor resulted in a statistically significant decrease of GFP in the intestinal cell int8, when compared to DMSO controls. This effect was seen when worms were grown on <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> or challenged with CBX102 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). We also confirmed the effect of inhibition of ERK signaling pathway on the reduction of intestinal <italic>ilys-3</italic> expression, by feeding L4 animals with <italic>mpk-1</italic> dsRNA. Consistent with our mutant analysis, knockdown of this gene also diminished the GFP transcriptional reporter intensity in the intestine but not in the pharynx (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). We concluded that intestinal induction of <italic>ilys-3</italic> triggered by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> infection is dependent on MPK-1 activity.</p>
<p>ERK activation has also been shown to mediate the detrimental effect of starvation in pharyngeal muscle of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, via the signaling transduction pathway muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-Gqα-PKC-MAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref052">52</xref>]. We hypothesized that if activation of <italic>ilys-3</italic> was also due to a response to starvation, then the loss-of-function <italic>gpb-2</italic> mutants that are hypersensitive to muscarinic signaling and starvation should show increased <italic>ilys-3</italic> activity in the gut. We found that this was the case. <italic>gpb-</italic>2 is the ortholog of vertebrate G β5 and encodes the β subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein that binds the Gqα EGL-30, functioning to negatively regulate signaling in the pharyngeal muscle. In these mutants <italic>ilys-3</italic> was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). GFP was abundant not only in the pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g006">Fig 6Eii</xref>), intestine and rectal epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g006">Fig 6Eiii</xref>) but also in other tissues such as epidermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g006">Fig 6Ei</xref>). In <italic>gpb-2</italic> mutants the muscarinic acetylcholine signal cannot be down-regulated and starvation has detrimental effects in the pharynx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref053">53</xref>].</p>
<p>We next asked whether hyperactivation of the pharyngeal MAPK pathway could affect the worm responses to CBX102. In assays with 100% lawns of CBX102, <italic>gpb-2(ad541)</italic> L1 larvae die in 3 days whereas WT had an average lifespan of 10 days. This early death is likely due to unrestrained pharyngeal damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref052">52</xref>], despite the fact that in this mutant background expression of an <italic>ilys-3</italic> reporter was markedly induced following <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g006">Fig 6F and 6G</xref>). We estimated a two-fold increase of the <italic>ilys-3p</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic> transcriptional reporter in the intestinal cells of transgenic mutant animals, relative to uninfected siblings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s012">S12 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, our results revealed a transcriptional program leading to ILYS-3 induction upon <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> infection, which is mediated at least in part by the ERK-MAPK and the negative regulator GPB-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g005">Fig 5H</xref>). Loss-of-function in GPB-2 causes MAPK hyperactivation, damage to the pharynx with probably enhanced susceptibility to both starvation and pathogen despite increased ILYS-3 expression. Our results also suggest that <italic>ilys-3</italic> is a useful <italic>in vivo</italic> sensor for monitoring responses to starvation as well as to pathogens.</p>

<title>The pathogen-induced activation of intestinal ILYS-3 is cell-non-autonomous and requires MPK-1 activity in the pharynx</title>
<p>The <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans mpk-1</italic> gene is expressed in the nervous system and in many tissues including the pharyngeal-intestinal valve, intestine, body wall muscles and rectal epithelium ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref054">54</xref>] and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.wormbase.org/" xlink:type="simple">https://www.wormbase.org</ext-link>).

<p>We also tested whether increased expression of the MAP kinase cascade in the rectal epithelium could lead to increased <italic>ilys-3p</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic> signal in the intestine in view of the known importance of ERK signaling in the rectal cells. For this, we used a strain that bears a rectal enhancer element of <italic>egl-5</italic> coupled with the <italic>pes-10</italic> minimal promoter driving expression of LIN-45(S312A,S453A) (Raf) (RE::LIN-45*), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref055">55</xref>].

<p>We next tested whether restoring MPK-1 specifically in the pharynx of <italic>mpk-1(ku1)</italic> mutants had an effect on intestinal induction of <italic>ilys-3p</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic>. We used a strain that expressed the wild-type <italic>mpk-1</italic> from the pharyngeal specific promoter <italic>myo-2</italic>, a myosin heavy chain isoform gene expressed specifically in pharyngeal muscles (kind gift of L.

We measured the fluorescence of intestinal <italic>ilys-3</italic> in int2 and int8 cells in <italic>mpk-1</italic> and wild-type single and double transgenic animals and compared to levels of expression in their single transgenic siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g008">Fig 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s015">S15 Fig</xref>). Pharyngeal expression of MPK-1 completely recapitulated the intestinal expression of <italic>ilys-3</italic> pattern generated in the wild-type reporter strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Statistically significant high levels of intestinal GFP were detected in <italic>mpk-1</italic> double transgenic animals compared to their single transgenic sibling mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Furthermore, and as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g008">Fig 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s015">S15 Fig</xref>, no significant differences were found in the average levels of intestinal <italic>ilys-3</italic> fluorescence between mutant and wild-type double transgenes. Thus, presence of MPK-1 in the pharynx resulted in an increased expression of <italic>ilys-3p</italic>::<italic>GFP</italic> and also rescued reporter gene induction in the intestine of the <italic>mpk-1(ku1)</italic> mutant. To corroborate the results described above, we used quantitative real-time PCR analysis to determine <italic>ilys-3</italic> transcriptional activity in whole organism in <italic>mpk-1</italic> mutants harboring the tissue specific transgenes that rescue MPK-1 activity in the pharynx and in the intestine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s016">S16 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s022">S4 Table</xref>). Consistent with our confocal microscopy analysis we were able to observe high <italic>ilys-3</italic> mRNA induction levels in the <italic>mpk-1</italic> mutant only when the pharyngeal but not the intestinal MPK-1 transgene was present. Particularly high levels of <italic>ilys-3</italic> basal transcription activity were detected in animals harboring the pharyngeal MPK-1 cDNA transgene reared on OP50 lawns.

<p>Overall, these results indicate that for its response to infection by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic>, intestinal ILYS-3 induction depends on MPK-1 activity in the pharynx. High levels of MPK-1 activity in the pharynx of <italic>mpk-1</italic> mutant resulted in generally detrimental effects in most animals, making it impossible to complete pathogenicity assays, as the transgenic line was difficult to maintain. We therefore could not directly test whether activation of pharyngeal MPK-1 was protective against bacterial infections. This deleterious effect is consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref052">52</xref>].</p>
<p>Altogether these results showed that intestinal MPK-1 activity is not required for <italic>ilys-3</italic> pathogenic induction in this tissue, whereas pharyngeal MPK-1 activity is.</p>
<p>However, under nutrient depletion, and in contrast to the bacterial-mediated response, inactivation of ERK-MAPK by mutation did not block induction of the <italic>ilys-3</italic> reporter in the intestine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s017">S17 Fig</xref>); thus indicating that immunity and nutrient depletion can be uncoupled and are presumably, under the control of two distinct regulatory networks.</p>

<p>In view of the evident importance of this invertebrate lysozyme, both in healthy and diseased worms we next wanted to analyze the enzymatic properties of ILYS-3, and prepared a purified recombinant protein. A construct was designed that allowed expression of the full length of ILYS-3 (139 amino acids) fused with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> maltose-binding protein (MBP, 367 amino acids) via a 47 amino acid linker.

The size of the fusion protein was approximately 58 kDa (including MBP-tag; 42.5 kDa), which was consistent with the predicted size of the fusion protein.

<p>Next rILYS-3 was tested <italic>in vitro</italic> for its ability to cleave peptidoglycan in cell walls of the standard bacterial strain, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>luteus</italic>. For this, we employed a zymogram assay, an electrophoretic method that is based on an SDS polyacrylamide gel impregnated with bacterial cells as substrate, which becomes hydrolyzed by the protein during the renaturation period. Methylene blue staining of the gel reveals sites of hydrolysis as white bands on an otherwise dark blue background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref056">56</xref>]. Hen egg-white lysozyme (Hen Lys) served as a positive control in this assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g009">Fig 9B</xref> both Hen Lys and rILYs-3 display cell-wall degrading lytic activity, suggesting that ILYS-3 is capable of releasing peptidoglycan fragments in the same way as Hen Lys. A recombinant ILYS-3 fused to GST at the N-terminus, was also made and IPTG-induced bacterial cell extracts were found active on dead cells from both <italic>M</italic>. <italic>luteus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g009">Fig 9B</xref>) and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). In contrast, Hen Lys was only active on <italic>M</italic>. <italic>luteus</italic>.</p>
<p>The pH of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> lumen ranges from 5.96 ± 0.31 in the anterior pharynx to 3.59 ± 0.09 in the posterior intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref057">57</xref>]. We investigated whether ILYS-3 is active under these conditions. For this we performed zymogram analysis with proteins renatured on gels exposed to buffers at different pH values. We found it maximally active between pH4.5 and 5.0, although a pronounced activity of the rILYS-3 was also seen at pH3.0. This coincides with the luminal pH of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> intestine and the highly acidic digestive organelles lysosomes. The zymograms shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005826.g009">Fig 9B and 9C</xref> depict rILYS-3 activity at pH5.0.</p>
<p>The hydrolytic activity by ILYS-3 is in agreement with its high sequence homology to the bivalve invertebrate lysozymes in <italic>Tapes japonica</italic> (PDB No 2DQA) and <italic>Meretrix lusoria</italic> (PDB No. 3AB6), which have muramidase activity [Percentage of pairwise sequence identity with ILYS-3 were of 51%, and 49% with 7.00 × 10<sup>−24</sup> and 6.00 × 10<sup>−23</sup> blast expectation values, respectively) [(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.predictprotein.org/" xlink:type="simple">https://www.predictprotein.org/</ext-link>)] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s018">S18 Fig</xref>). The tertiary structural model of ILYS-3 shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005826.s018">S18A Fig</xref> was constructed by performing homology-based modeling using the iTasser server. The model matches the crystal structure of the NAG-bound lysozyme from <italic>Meretrix lusoria</italic> (Chain A; PDB No. 3ab6) that has six α-helices and two β-sheets.</p>
<p>We concluded that the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> ILYS-3 appears to be largely similar to the invertebrate lysozymes from bivalves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref058">58</xref>]. Given that an intact cell wall is essential for bacterial viability and that the invertebrate lysozyme ILYS-3 has an <italic>in vitro</italic> lytic activity, we propose that ILYS-3 is likely to be an effector that affects this cell integrity thus reducing bacterial proliferation in the nematode and aiding in the digestion of shed PGN.</p>
<p>Attempts to demonstrate direct bactericidal action of recombinant ILYS-3 on live <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> cells were not successful, probably due to protein aggregation and perhaps a need for additional digestive factors that are present in the natural situation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Central to the capacity of intestinal epithelial cells to maintain immune barrier functions is an ability to produce inducible antimicrobial effectors. Our results show that the intestinal cells of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> are capable of producing and inducing a candidate bactericidal effector, ILYS-3 that helps prevent Gram-positive bacterial pathogen colonization, by cleaving and perhaps recycling the load of peptidoglycan fragments which might otherwise overwhelm the whole epithelia. Moreover, we show that pharyngeal ILYS-3 has an important role for lysing both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.</p>
<p>In multicellular organisms danger inflicted on cells results in alarm signals that activate innate immune responses. Thus, a host mechanism that propagates danger signals to neighboring cells and tissues is advantageous for pathogen clearance and damage repair. In the present study, we show that during <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> infection, the activation of the intracellular ERK-MAPK signaling cascade in the pharynx results in a signal that leads to <italic>ilys-3</italic> transcription in a distal tissue, the intestine. This communication between pharyngeal muscle and intestinal epithelium enables host cells to increase the expression of effector ILYS-3, at a site where bacterial colonization occurs.</p>
<p><italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> infection represents a suitable model system to study chronic colonization of the intestinal epithelium in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. This is because in contrast to what is seen with bacterial pathogens that rapidly kill the nematode, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> affects the worm fitness and elicits immune reactions as a consequence of its persistent infection in the intestine. Faced with continuous pathogen stimulation, the intestinal epithelium of infected worms thus requires a balance between mounting an exacerbated response or maintaining steady-state levels of antimicrobial expression.</p>
<p>Here we have elucidated the biological function of the <italic>C</italic>.<italic>elegans ilys-3</italic>, a member of the invertebrate type of lysozymes. We have found that one of the biological roles of <italic>ilys-3</italic> is to aid bacterial grinding and lysis, which are required for nutrient digestion. Firstly, <italic>ilys-3</italic> is expressed primarily in digestive tissues of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>: the pharyngeal grinder and the intestine. Furthermore, upon ingestion of non- or mildly-pathogenic bacteria, animals with depleted levels of ILYS-3 showed increased intestinal bacterial cell counts, indicative of enhanced bacterial proliferation. This intestinal bacterial overgrowth is likely to be associated with the acquisition of the aging-related phenotype observed in <italic>ilys-3</italic> mutants which exhibited reduced lifespan on both OP50 and CBX102. This is in line with findings in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref059">59</xref>] and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref060">60</xref>]. In these two models of aging, bacterial overgrowth acts on the organismal lifespan. Manipulations on the microbial dynamics with antibiotics were seen not only to prevent bacterial cell proliferation within their hosts but also to increase fly and worm lifespans.</p>
<p>Several lines of evidence indicate that ILYS-3 works as immune effector in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. First, we provide biochemical evidence that ILYS-3 has <italic>in vitro</italic> hydrolytic activity for the Gram-positive bacterial cell walls of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>luteus</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic>. Peptidoglycan consists of glycan strands of alternating β-1,4-linked <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (Glc<italic>N</italic>Ac) and <italic>N</italic>-acetylmuramic acid (Mur<italic>N</italic>Ac) residues cross-linked to each other by short peptides made of L- and D-amino acids. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> ILYS-3 has the conserved Aspartate and Glutamate residues responsible for muramidase activity and is probably capable of generating PGN fragments by hydrolyzing the β(1,4) linkages between <italic>N</italic>-acetylmuramic acid and <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine residues in PGN. However, we have not established the exact sites of ILYS-3 cleavage in the complex peptidoglycan polymer. Likewise, we have not demonstrated that purified ILYS-3 can act alone as bactericidal protein. Animal lysozymes have been implicated in peptidoglycan hydrolysis and innate immunity, via the generation of soluble and immunogenic PGN fragments, which themselves act as ligands and can be detected by the host immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref061">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref062">62</xref>]. In mice, the cutaneous innate defense response and subsequent NOD2 detection of the extracellular pathogen <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, requires the intracellular delivery of peptidoglycan-derived muramyl dipeptides through the insertion of the pore-forming toxin α-hemolysin into the host membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref063">63</xref>]. The second domain of catalytic activity predicted in invertebrate lysozymes is isopeptidase. However, our homology searches revealed that of the six invertebrate-type lysozymes present in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> genome, only <italic>ilys-4</italic> has intact isopeptidase putative residues (S95 and H123). All the others appeared to have lost the Serine residue, which has been substituted by Alanine. Therefore they are expected to lack isopeptidase activity.</p>
<p>Second, the prolonged induction of <italic>ilys-3</italic> suggests that sustained high levels of this antimicrobial are necessary to provide protection against a persistent pathogen such as <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic>. This suggests that ILYS-3 is a slow and long-lasting effector, which takes longer to attain maximal levels and strengthen its antimicrobial function. Such sustained antimicrobial induction could be designed to entail an efficient protection against more persistent pathogens that resist the first line of effectors and remain resident within the host tissues. As mentioned above, ILYS-3 can also be induced by the Gram-positive <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, which is capable of activating a strong transcriptional response in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> intestinal epithelial cells. Work by Irazoqui showed that <italic>ilys-3</italic> is highly responsive to this pathogen and its transcriptional activity started early in time by 4 hours, but continued to increase by their final assayed time point (12 hours) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Intestinal function is reinforced by the luminal secretion of antimicrobials which disrupt essential features of bacterial biology and creates the first line of immune defense. We wished to address the localization of ILYS-3 and to identify the machinery responsible for its transport in the polarized intestinal epithelia and secretion to the gut lumen. Surprisingly, and despite the many candidates for secretion into the intestinal lumen, there is no published direct evidence for a secreted gut enzyme in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. We have been unable to ascertain the route of the abundant luminal ILYS-3::mCherry secretion detected in old adults and dauers, as our experiments using markers for apical secretion were inconclusive. Although apical levels of ILYS-3::mCherry were usually below thresholds of detection, we found that the fusion protein can be routed to the apical domains of the intestinal cells. This conclusion was based on experiments that reduced the function of basolateral recycling vesicles in the <italic>rab-10</italic> genetic background. We also observed that ILYS-3::mCherry can be recycled basolaterally in a <italic>rme-1</italic> independent manner which suggests that ILYS-3 may work partly within the recycling endosomes and acidic vesicles of the intestinal epithelium. Digestion of PGN fragments and bacterial fragments may require the coordinated action of lysozymes that work effectively both in apical and basolateral environments. In this scenario, ILYS-3 would help detoxifying and clearing the remained PGN fragments that managed to escape the initial action of lytic enzymes and end up intracellularly and/or in the body cavity. This is in keeping with the observations that ILYS-3 is expressed in the recycling endosomes and the acidic vesicles LROs of the intestine but also in the late endosomes and lysosomes in the coelomocytes.</p>
<p>The expression patterns we observed were obtained using protein expressed from multicopy arrays, and therefore potentially affected by overexpression artifacts. However, the transgenes used efficiently rescued all mutant phenotypes and did not exhibit obvious dominant effects. Moreover, the rapid and reversible changes in distribution in response to nutrient availability indicate that the reporter reliably reflect endogenous protein distribution.</p>
<p>Third, disruption of <italic>ilys-3</italic> renders mutant animals more susceptible to the bacterial pathogen <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic>. Fourth, overexpression of ILYS-3 leads to an enhanced protection against <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> in both <italic>ilys-3</italic> mutants and wild-type backgrounds.</p>
<p>It is intriguing that ILYS-3 is detected in coelomocytes, the six scavenger cells present in the adult hermaphrodite that continuously and nonspecifically recycle and endocytose macromolecules from the pseudocoelom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref048">48</xref>]. These cells are believed to perform detoxification, acting like hepatic cells in higher animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref064">64</xref>]. In addition, they have been shown to work as sensors for dietary restriction-mediated longevity in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref065">65</xref>]. Our results suggest that coelomocytes are ILYS-3-producing cells but we ruled out the possibility that they contribute in any major way to the defense response of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> wild-type to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic>. Nevertheless, once the combined functions of <italic>ilys-3</italic> and the coelomocytes were compromised, a small effect was observed. The effect could be due to the excessive tissue exposure to PGNs resulting from lack of active processing.</p>
<p>Actively growing Gram-positive bacteria release large amounts of peptidoglycan fragments as a consequence of cell remodeling during cell division. Work done in <italic>Bacillus megaterium</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> established that 30–50% of PGN can be shed into the growth medium in each bacterial generation during exponential growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref066">66</xref>]. The intestinal environment of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> can not be reproduced in a liquid-based medium, and consequently bacterial growth may differ in these two situations. However, bacteria that reside and proliferate in the nematode intestine, like <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic>, can be expected to shed PGN fragments as part of normal growth, which may represent a significant burden on the intestinal cell function.</p>
<p>We found that in the intestine <italic>ilys-3</italic> has a post-embryonic regulated expression pattern, suggesting that it might be important for maintaining nutrient levels or immune homeostasis during certain developmental transitions. In conventionally reared animals, high levels of <italic>ilys-3</italic> transcriptional activity were detected in the intestinal cells of L1 at hatching, but these declined as animals reached L2. In early adults however, levels of intestinal <italic>ilys-3</italic> increased and were sustained thereafter. The physiological relevance of such transient expression pattern where steady state levels of <italic>ilys-3</italic> are kept high in hatchlings and adults may reflect the distinct needs to provide protection against bacterial colonization during key post-developmental stages. In the early phase of post-embryonic life, the intestine of naïve L1 may need to be primed with effectors that ensure safe first contact with food, in adulthood, the hermaphrodite intestine may become more vulnerable as its resources become directed towards nurturing the germline with yolk proteins.</p>
<p>With the onset of larval diapause, dauers might also need to be primed with effectors and signaling molecules that help them withstand harsh conditions and/or prepare them to get ready for feeding. We showed that upon nutrient depletion, luminal secretion of ILYS-3::mCherry was both very dynamic and reversible in these larvae. The fusion protein was secreted and seen to accumulate in the intestinal lumen, only to return rapidly to its cytosolic default state when animals encountered food and resumed development. A similar changing pattern of secretory polarity has also been reported for INS-35 and INS-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref067">67</xref>], two insulin-like peptides that suppress larval diapause. These peptides, are usually secreted into the pseudocoelom in larval stages during normal development, but during diapause they are routed to the intestinal lumen where they are degraded. However, we do not have any evidence for the luminal degradation of ILYS-3:mCherry. In fact, in 25-day-old larvae the signal of fusion protein did not decrease and only changed as larvae adapted to resume development upon feeding. Unlike in starvation-induced dauers, food deprivation during other larval stages did not provoke accumulation of ILYS-3 in the lumen. These changing patterns of ILYS-3 distribution reveal yet another facet of that adaptive changes that occur in dauer development and demonstrate remarkable plasticity in the intestinal cells.</p>
<p>In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, most intestinal immune effectors that protect against many pathogens appear to act locally and respond cell autonomously to the activation afforded by key regulators such as the p38 MAP kinase PMK-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref068">68</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref069">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref070">70</xref>], DAF-16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref071">71</xref>] and ZIP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref072">72</xref>]. Interestingly, in the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> model of infection intestinal <italic>ilys-3</italic> induction requires the proline hydroxylase EGL-9 which under normal O<sub>2</sub> levels, functions in a conserved hypoxia-sensing pathway to convert the hypoxia-inducible factor, HIF-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref073">73</xref>].</p>
<p>In contrast, our results indicate that for the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic>-induced <italic>ilys-3</italic> transcription an ERK/MAPK activity is required just as the starvation-mediated response in the pharyngeal muscle of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> does [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref052">52</xref>]. Intense induction of <italic>ilys-3</italic> was found in <italic>gpb-2</italic> mutant animals in which the ERK/MAP kinase signaling could not be down-regulated. However, in contrast to starvation-effects on pharyngeal muscles, the starvation/pathogen induction of <italic>ilys-3</italic> occurs in the intestine. The transcriptional programs that govern pathogen- and starvation are likely to be distinct despite the fact that they share at least one downstream molecular target, <italic>ilys-3</italic>.</p>
<p>We discovered a cell non-autonomous regulation of the <italic>ilys-3</italic> transcriptional response following <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> infection. ERK expression in the pharynx alone was sufficient to restore intestinal <italic>ilys-3</italic> induction in the loss-of-function mutant <italic>mpk-1;</italic> while the activation of ERK MAP kinase in the intestine was not able to activate <italic>ilys-3</italic> transcription in this tissue. How can ERK signaling in the pharynx trigger <italic>ilys-3</italic> transcription in the gut? The ability of multicellular organisms to mount an efficient innate response against pathogen infections is likely to be aided by systemic communication between individual cells and tissues. In the intestine of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> cell non-autonomous effects have been suggested in many contexts, ranging from the regulation of organismal response to oxidative and heat stress and lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref074">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref076">76</xref>] to the modulation of immune response against the bacterial pathogen <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref077">77</xref>]. In most of these examples however, the signaling between tissues requires a neuronal component. However, it has been shown that upon DNA damage, germ cells are capable of eliciting a systemic pathogen and stress resistance response in the somatic tissues of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref078">78</xref>]. Such induction depends on the germline specific activity of the ERK/MAK kinase <italic>mpk-1</italic>, which evokes the transcriptional activation of innate immune genes, similarly to the local response evoked by p38 MAPK upon intestinal infection by pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref068">68</xref>].</p>
<p>The results shown here suggest a communication between two non-neuronal distal tissues. This is reminiscent of a mammalian epithelial cell-to-cell communication strategy that propagates NF-kB and ERK- dependent pro-inflammatory signals from infected cells to bystander cells following infections by <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref079">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005826.ref080">80</xref>]. However, in our context the signaling pathway that activates <italic>ilys-3</italic> in the pharynx is not required for its action in the other tissue.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data suggest a model whereby upon <italic>M</italic>. <italic>nematophilum</italic> stimulation, the pharyngeal muscles activate the MAPK pathway leading to the transmission of an alarm signal to the intestinal epithelium. This results in the activation of an innate immune response, with transcription of the antimicrobial <italic>ilys-3</italic>. Whether the pharyngeal signal induces other intestinal responses, or acts on other distal tissues, remains to be seen. We also cannot exclude more complex models, in which the primary pathogen detection occurs in the intestine or elsewhere, and the danger signal is then amplified by the pharyngeal muscle. However, the pharynx is well placed to act as a site for primary danger detection.</p>
<p>Our work demonstrates the importance of a specific lysozyme gene both to normal nutrition and to defense. The unexpected complexity of its expression, both in different tissues and subcellular compartments, suggest that it may have functions within cellular vesicles, as well as in the digestive tract.</p>
<p>Our work also reveals the existence of a new tissue-tissue communication acting at the organismal level and reveals a strategy whereby the pharynx activates an antimicrobial intestinal defense by propagating bacterial/danger signals.</p>
