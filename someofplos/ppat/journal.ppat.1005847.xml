<abstract>
<p>The phytohormone auxin plays critical roles in regulating myriads of plant growth and developmental processes. Microbe infection can disturb auxin signaling resulting in defects in these processes, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Auxin signaling begins with perception of auxin by a transient co-receptor complex consisting of an F-box transport inhibitor response 1/auxin signaling F-box (TIR1/AFB) protein and an auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) protein. Auxin binding to the co-receptor triggers ubiquitination and 26S proteasome degradation of the Aux/IAA proteins, leading to subsequent events, including expression of auxin-responsive genes. Here we report that <italic>Rice dwarf virus</italic> (RDV), a devastating pathogen of rice, causes disease symptoms including dwarfing, increased tiller number and short crown roots in infected rice as a result of reduced sensitivity to auxin signaling. The RDV capsid protein P2 binds OsIAA10, blocking the interaction between OsIAA10 and OsTIR1 and inhibiting 26S proteasome-mediated OsIAA10 degradation. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing wild-type or a dominant-negative (degradation-resistant) mutant of OsIAA10 phenocopy RDV symptoms are more susceptible to RDV infection; however, knockdown of <italic>OsIAA10</italic> enhances the resistance of rice to RDV infection. Our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of viral protein reprogramming of a key step in auxin signaling initiation that enhances viral infection and pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Auxin regulates plant growth and development through auxin signaling, which begins with the interaction of an F-box transport inhibitor response 1/auxin signaling F-box (TIR1/AFB) protein and an auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) protein co-receptor. Auxin binding to the co-receptor complex triggers ubiquitination and 26S proteasome degradation of Aux/IAA proteins, leading to a downstream signaling cascade that induces the expression of auxin-responsive genes. Auxin signaling is manipulated by plant pathogens to maximize their own multiplication, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we report that the P2 capsid protein encoded by <italic>Rice dwarf virus</italic> (RDV) sabotages auxin signaling by interacting with the rice Aux/IAA protein, OsIAA10, thereby shielding it from degradation and causing infected plants to display typical RDV symptoms including dwarfism, excessive tillering and stunted crown roots. Importantly, these symptoms are phenocopied by transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsIAA10 or its degradation-resistant mutant. Conversely, down-regulating OsIAA10 expression in rice led to milder RDV infection. Together these findings reveal a novel mechanism by which RDV reprograms auxin signaling, leading to enhanced viral infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Viral infection causes enormous losses in crop yield and crop quality, posing a constant threat to food security. These losses are attributed to virus-induced abnormal growth and development, exhibited as disease symptoms. However, The molecular basis of disease symptom development in plants remains poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref001">1</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref005">5</xref>]. Plant hormones control many aspects of the plant growth and development by orchestrating the expression of plant genes in a temporally and spatially regulated manner, and by coordinating plant responses to environmental cues. Perturbation of hormone signaling in plant often causes developmental defects, some of which share characteristics with virus-induced disease symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref006">6</xref>]. Viral infections also interfere with plant hormone homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref006">6</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Auxin is one of the major phytohormones that controls many aspects of plant growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref012">12</xref>]. Auxin signaling begins with perception of auxin by a transient co-receptor complexes consisting of an auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) protein and an F-box transport inhibitor response1/auxin signaling F-box (TIR1/AFB) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref013">13</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref018">18</xref>]. Auxin binding to the co-receptor triggers the ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins by TIR1/AFBs and their degradation by the 26S proteasome, causing derepression of auxin response factors (ARFs), a class of transcriptional regulators that are sequestered by Aux/IAAs through heterodimerization or oligomerization. Then the ARFs reprogram the transcription of auxin-responsive genes, resulting in adjustments to plant growth and/or development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref019">19</xref>]. Genes that are rapidly and transiently induced or repressed by auxin include Small Auxin-up RNAs (SAURs), GH3 proteins, and Aux/IAA proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Aux/IAA proteins are at the nexus of the auxin signaling. A total of 31 and 29 <italic>Aux/IAA</italic> genes have been found in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref021">21</xref>] and Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref022">22</xref>] genomes, respectively, most of which encode proteins containing four conserved domains designated domains I, II, III, and IV. Domain I confers repressor activity by recruiting the Topless1 corepressor, whereas domain II is responsible for interaction with TIR1. Domains III and IV, later referred to as the Phox/Bem 1 (PB1) domain, mediates interactions with ARFs as well as other Aux/IAA proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref022">22</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref030">30</xref>]. Mutations in domain II have been shown to disrupt the interaction of Aux/IAAs with TIR1, causing stabilization of Aux/IAA proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref024">24</xref>]. The resulting mutant plants are insensitive to auxin treatment, and display characteristic Aux/IAA gain-of-function phenotypes including stunted stature, decreased apical dominance, low fertility, and darker mature leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref031">31</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>Aux/IAA gain-of-function mutant plants share striking phenotypic resemblance with rice plants infected by the <italic>Rice dwarf virus</italic> (RDV). RDV, a member of the genus <italic>Phytoreovirus</italic> in <italic>Reoviridae</italic> family, is transmitted by the green rice leafhopper (<italic>Nephotettix cincticeps</italic>), and is a devastating pathogen that periodically causes rice yield losses. Its genome comprises 12-segmented double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that encode seven structural proteins (P1, P2, P3, P5, P7, P8, and P9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref010">10</xref>] and at least five nonstructural proteins (Pns4, Pns6, Pns10, Pns11, and Pns12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref037">37</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref039">39</xref>]. RDV-infected plants exhibit disease symptoms including severe stunted growth, increased tiller number, and shorter and fewer roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref040">40</xref>], which resemble the phenotypes of Aux/IAA gain-of-function mutant plants described above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref034">34</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref036">36</xref>]. The morphological similarities shared by RDV-infected rice plants and mutant plants defective in auxin signaling suggest that RDV infection might manipulate auxin signaling cascades.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that RDV infection interferes with auxin signaling in rice plants by stabilizing the rice Aux/IAA protein, OsIAA10. This occurs through a highly specific interaction between the RDV P2 protein and domain II of OsIAA10, which thwarts the interaction of OsIAA10 with OsTIR1, thereby preventing its degradation upon auxin perception. In addition, we show that this interaction causes alterations in rice morphogenesis and is needed for optimal RDV infection. Finally, we show that knock-down of OsIAA10 enhances the resistance of rice to RDV infection, whereas OsIAA10 overexpression has the opposite effect. Together, these data show the novel mechanism used by which RDV reprograms auxin signaling cascades, resulting in enhanced viral infection and disease development.</p>

<title>RDV infection alters the response of rice to auxin</title>
<p>We were interested in determining whether RDV infection interferes with auxin signaling in rice plants because symptoms in RDV-infected plants, including severe stunting, increased tiller number, and shorter crown roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g001">Fig 1Aâ€“1D</xref>), are strikingly similar to the auxin-resistant phenotypes caused by transgenic overexpression of microRNA393 (miR393), which targets mRNAs encoding <italic>TIR1/AFB2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref041">41</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref043">43</xref>]), or OsIAA4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref044">44</xref>]. To assess whether the auxin signaling pathway is indeed compromised by RDV infection, we used quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to analyze changes in the expression levels of a panel of auxin-related genes upon RDV infection. The results showed that RDV infection caused significant changes in the expression of <italic>OsIAA21</italic>, <italic>OsSAUR13</italic>, <italic>OsSAUR44</italic>, <italic>OsGH3</italic>.<italic>8</italic> and <italic>OsPIN1b</italic>, and less pronounced changes in the expressions of <italic>OsIAA1</italic>, <italic>OsIAA11</italic>, <italic>OsSAUR39</italic>, and <italic>OsGH3</italic>.<italic>2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). This pattern of extensive perturbation of auxin signaling genes at the transcription level is consistent with the previously reported microarray analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref045">45</xref>], suggesting that RDV manipulates auxin signaling pathways.</p>

<p>To further test the auxin responsiveness of RDV-infected rice plants, we subjected them to treatment with the auxin analogue Î±-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>, elongation of the crown roots of mock-inoculated rice seedlings was significantly inhibited by 0.1Î¼M NAA; however RDV-infected rice seedlings with or without NAA treatment grew much shorter crown roots compared to control seedling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>). There was no significant difference between treated and untreated RDV-infected rice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>). These data show that RDV infection causes rice plants to be less responsive to auxin application.</p>

<title>The RDV P2 protein interacts with OsIAA10</title>
<p>Next, we determined the mechanism by which RDV infection perturbs auxin signaling. The P2 protein encoded by RDV is a multi-functional protein that, in addition to being part of the viral capsid, induces dwarfism in RDV-infected rice by binding to <italic>ent</italic>-kaurene oxidases, thereby disrupting gibberellins biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref046">46</xref>]. To assess its potential interference with auxin signaling, we used the yeast two-hybrid screening assay to identify candidate rice proteins that physically interact with RDV P2. Our initial screening revealed a rice cDNA encoding the C-terminal residues 91â€“280 of OsIAA10. The interaction between P2 and full-length OsIAA10 in yeast was also confirmed in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The <italic>in planta</italic> interaction was verified by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of endogenous P2 with overexpressed FLAG-OsIAA10 in RDV-infected transgenic rice plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), and by co-IP of transiently overexpressed FLAG-OsIAA10 and HA-P2 in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> (<italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic>) leaves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). A firefly luciferase complementation imaging (LCI) assay also showed the interaction of the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). OsIAA10 belongs to the Aux/IAA protein family, of which 31 members have been identified in rice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s001">S1B Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref021">21</xref>]. The RDV P2 protein specifically interacts with OsIAA10, but not with the 19 other OsIAAs that have varying degrees of relatedness to OsIAA10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). Conversely, among all of the RDV-encoded proteins, P2 is the only one that interacts with OsIAA10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s001">S1D Fig</xref>), indicating a high level of specificity. Similar to other Aux/IAA proteins, OsIAA10 contains four conserved domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s002">S2A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref023">23</xref>], and is degraded through the ubiquitin-26S proteasome degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s002">S2B Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref019">19</xref>]. We also demonstrated the auxin-dependent interaction of OsIAA10 with the auxin receptor OsTIR1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s002">S2C Fig</xref>) through its domain II (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s002">S2D Fig</xref>). Finally, we mapped the P2-interacting of OsIAA10 to domain II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s002">S2D Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>The RDV P2 protein stabilizes OsIAA10 by blocking its interaction with OsTIR1</title>
<p>Because both P2 and OsTIR1 bind OsIAA10 domain II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s002">S2D Fig</xref>) but P2 and OsTIR1 do not interact with each other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), we speculated that P2/OsIAA10 interaction might prevent OsTIR1 from accessing OsIAA10 by binding to the same interaction domain. To test this hypothesis, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down assay with purified recombinant proteins to assess whether P2 interferes with the OsIAA10/OsTIR1 interaction. Because the full-length P2 protein could not be adequately expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>), we tried to map the minimal P2 region required for the OsIAA10 interaction using yeast two-hybrid assays. The results showed that P2 fragments P2(1â€“786), P2(1â€“140) and P2(49â€“90), all of which comprised amino acids (aa) 49â€“90, each interacted with OsIAA10, whereas fragments lacking these aa residues did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, We expressed P2 (1â€“786) in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> as a maltose binding protein (MBP)-P2 fusion protein, and purified it from the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> extracts. MBP alone as well as MBP-OsIAA10 were similarly purified from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. HA-OsTIR1 was extracted from <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> leaves transiently expressing HA-OsTIR1 and immobilized onto anti-HA-affinity gel beads. The same amounts of MBP or MBP-OsIAA10, or MBP-OsIAA10 mixed with MBP-P2 (1â€“786) or MBP, were incubated with the immobilized HA-OsTIR1, respectively. The immunoprecipitated fractions were detected with the anti-MBP antibody. MBP-OsIAA10 was pulled down by HA-OsTIR1, and MBP-P2 (1â€“786) disrupted the interaction between MBP-OsIAA10 and HA-OsTIR1, whereas MBP did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Additionally, we performed dose dependent <italic>in vitro</italic> competitive pull-down assays with purified glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-tagged OsIAA10 and P2(1â€“786), and MBP-OsTIR1 proteins. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, increasing amounts of GST-P2 (1â€“786) reduced the amount of GST-OsIAA10 bound to MBP-OsTIR1, indicating that P2 interferes with the OsIAA10/OsTIR1 interaction by binding to OsIAA10.</p>

<p>Then we used Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref048">48</xref>] to quantify the binding affinity between OsIAA10 and OsTIR1, as well as the extent to which P2 interferes with the binding. In this experiment, OsTIR1 was labeled with the red fluorescent dye N-hydroxylsuccinimide (NHS), and the results showed that NHS-labeled OsTIR1 bound to OsIAA10 with a <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> value of 1.18 Î¼M +/- 0.244 Î¼M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Addition of 2.5 Î¼M free MBP did not result in significant changes in binding kinetics (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> = 1.07 Î¼M +/- 0.242 Î¼M). In contrast, addition of 2.5 Î¼M MBP-P2 (1â€“786) completely abolished OsTIR1/OsIAA10 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), further confirming that P2/OsIAA10 binding impedes the OsTIR1/OsIAA10 interaction.</p>
<p>The OsIAA10/OsTIR1 interaction is expected to lead to degradation of OsIAA10 by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref024">24</xref>]. Thus, we tested whether disruption of the OsIAA10/OsTIR1 interaction by P2 leads to inhibition of OsIAA10 degradation and hence its stabilization. This was first assessed in a cell-free assay in which MBP-OsIAA10 was incubated in protein extracts prepared from RDV-infected or mock-inoculated rice plants. The half-life of MBP-OsIAA10 more than doubled in the RDV-infected extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), suggesting attenuation of OsIAA10 degradation following RDV-infection. This P2-mediated inhibition of degradation is specific to OsIAA10, because degradation of OsIAA1, which does not interact with P2, was not affected by P2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). We further confirmed this attenuation in cell-free extracts prepared from <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> leaves transiently expressing HA-P2, which did not occur in extracts from leaves expressing an empty vector (mock) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> results, the OsIAA10 protein accumulated to significantly higher levels in RDV-infected rice plants compared to mock-inoculated wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g003">Fig 3F</xref>), despite the fact that its mRNA levels, as measured by qPCR were mostly unchanged by RDV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g003">Fig 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). To test if P2 inhibits OsIAA10 degradation <italic>in vivo</italic>, we co-expressed FLAG-OsIAA10 and HA-P2 in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> leaves. An HA-P2Î” (1â€“90)-expressing construct was used as a negative control. In addition, we included a Î²-glucuronidase (GUSA)-expressing construct to ensure that protein translation occurred in all of the samples at similar levels. The results showed that the FLAG-OsIAA10 protein accumulated to higher levels in the presence of full-length P2, but not in the presence of the P2Î”(1â€“90) mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g003">Fig 3H</xref>), suggesting that the P2/OsIAA10 interaction caused stabilization of OsIAA10. Together these data provide molecular and biochemical evidence consistent with the interpretation that P2 manipulates the initiation of auxin signaling by shielding OsIAA10 from OsTIR1-mediated degradation.</p>

<title>Rice plants overexpressing a degradation-resistant OsIAA10 mutant phenocopy the symptoms of RDV-infected rice</title>
<p>To determine the biological significance of OsIAA10 stabilization by the RDV P2 protein, we generated a degradation-resistant OsIAA10 mutant by altering the highly conserved proline residue at position 116 (the second P of the 13 conserved aa within domain II) to a leucine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s006">S6A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref031">31</xref>]. This OsIAA10P116L mutant, although still bound to P2, failed to interact with OsTIR1 in yeast (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s006">S6B Fig</xref>), and hence became resistant to degradation mediated by the ubiquitin ligase, SCF<sup>OsTIR1</sup>, in the cell-free assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s006">S6C Fig</xref>). Consistent with an active role of OsIAA10 in auxin signaling in rice, transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsIAA10P116L were substantially stunted compared to non-transgenic control plants or transgenic plants overexpressing the wild-type OsIAA10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s006">S6D Fig</xref>). Notably, these transgenic plants also developed more tillers, shorter crown roots and lower fertility rates, strikingly similar to the symptoms exhibited in RDV-infected rice plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g004">Fig 4Aâ€“4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s007">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s008">S8</xref> Figs). Overexpression of wild-type OsIAA10 caused a moderately increased tillering and dwarf phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s006">S6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s007">S7</xref> Figs). The severity of which correlated with the accumulation levels of the OsIAA10 (or OsIAA10P116L) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s006">S6D Fig</xref>). Importantly, OsIAA10P116L-transgenic plants also exhibited insensitivity to auxin treatment typical of RDV-infected plants, as measured by crown root elongation under different NAA concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g004">Fig 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Specifically, as expected, treatment with 10<sup>âˆ’8</sup> M NAA caused inhibition of root elongation in mock-inoculated wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). In contrast, 10<sup>âˆ’7</sup> M NAA was required to trigger similar inhibition in the OsIAA10P116L-overexpressing M7 and M9 plant lines or RDV-infected rice plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Furthermore, qPCR results showed that the expression of auxin-inducible genes was severely diminished in both M7 seedlings and RDV-infected plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g004">Fig 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the collective symptoms of RDV infection, including dwarfism, increased tiller number, shorter crown roots, and decreased seed fertility, are adequately explained by RDV P2-mediated stabilization of OsIAA10, which in turn leads to auxin-resistant phenotypes reminiscent of the OsIAA10 gain-of-function mutant.</p>

<title>OsIAA10 stabilization is needed for optimal RDV infectivity</title>
<p>Next, we determined whether the process of RDV infection is affected by P2-mediated stabilization of OsIAA10 protein and/or subsequent manipulation of auxin signaling. To this end, we subjected transgenic plants overexpressing wild-type OsIAA10 (lines L12 and L20) and OsIAA10P116L (lines M7 and M9) to RDV inoculation via feeding by the viruliferous insect vector <italic>N</italic>. <italic>cincticeps</italic>. Specifically, two-week-old seedlings were exposed to the viruliferous leafhoppers for two days, during which time, the number of insects settling on each particular type of plants was recorded twice a day and used to calculate the index of non-preference for each line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref049">49</xref>]. The insects did not show a preference for a particular type of plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s015">S1 Table</xref>). The insects were removed after the 2-day feeding period, the infected plants were monitored on a daily basis, and the percentage of plants showing RDV symptoms was recorded once a week since the date the insects were removed. The earliest symptom evident on the systemic leaves of RDV-infected wild-type rice plants is the appearance of tiny chlorotic spots commonly referred to as specks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref050">50</xref>]. We found that the speck size dramatically increased on the leaves of transgenic L12, L20, M7, and M9 plants, frequently becoming chlorotic strips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). RDV-induced stunting was also more pronounced in the transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>).

<p>In agreement with the intensified RDV symptoms, the symptomatic transgenic L12, L20, M7, and M9 lines accumulated higher levels of RDV genomic RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>) and RNA-encoded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). In addition, the percentage of plants with RDV symptoms recorded over an 8-week period was consistently higher in transgenic plants than in wild-type control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). These data demonstrate that higher levels of OsIAA10 protein correlated with more rigorous RDV infection, strongly suggesting that the RDV P2/OsIAA10 interaction, and possibly the resulting disruption of auxin signaling, confers a selective advantage to RDV multiplication.</p>
<p>If OsIAA10 stabilization directly benefits RDV infection, decreasing its expression should have the opposite effects. To test this hypothesis, we knocked down OsIAA10 expression in transgenic rice plants using dsRNA derived from the entire coding region of OsIAA10. More than 10 independent RNA interference (RNAi) lines (referred to as Ii lines), were obtained, and the significant reduction in OsIAA10 expression was confirmed by qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s010">S10A Fig</xref>). There was no obvious difference in growth between the Ii and wild-type rice lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s010">S10B Fig</xref>), and the leafhoppers showed no preference for either plant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s015">S1 Table</xref>). However, RDV-infected Ii-1-2 and Ii-10-1 plants displayed weaker symptoms than RDV-infected wild-type plants, such as less dwarfism, tillers, and specks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Likewise, there was less accumulation of RDV genomic RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>) and proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g006">Fig 6E</xref>) in the infected Ii-1-2 and Ii-10-1 rice lines, as well as a lower percentage of infected transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). Thus, knockdown of OsIAA10 negatively affects RDV infection, demonstrating its critical role in facilitating RDV infection, replication and symptom development.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the current study, we demonstrate a novel mechanism through which the initiation of auxin signaling pathways is reprogrammed by a viral protein, thereby causing morphogenesis alterations in rice and enhancing the viral infection (for a model, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Biochemically, this has evolved to be a highly specific process in which the RDV P2 protein interacts with OsIAA10, but not with other tested Aux/IAA proteins; and P2 binds domain II of OsIAA10, thereby inhibiting its interaction with SCF<sup>TIR1/AFBs</sup> and subsequent degradation that is key for the regulation of normal growth and development. Biologically, this reprogramming of auxin signaling initiation leads to the abnormal expression of rice genes that apparently benefit viral infection and enhance disease symptoms. The importance of this new mechanism, from a practical point of view and as demonstrated here, is that the engineered reduction of OsIAA10 can improve the resistance of rice to RDV infection. RDV-mediated alterations in the auxin signaling pathway are not just limited to OsIAA10, the mRNA expression of downstream genes with auxin response elements (AuxREs), including genes from the Aux/IAA, GH3, and SAUR families, were directly or indirectly affected by RDV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). However, OsIAA10 protein levels but not mRNA levels were changed upon RDV infection (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g001">1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g003">3G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Proposed model.</title>
<p>In mock rice plants, high auxin concentration promotes the interaction between OsIAA10 and OsTIR1, leading to the ubiquitination and 26S proteasome degradation of OsIAA10, releasing the specific OsARFs. Then genes of auxin signaling pathway were adequately regulated by corresponding ARF transcription factors, promoting normal rice growth. Under RDV infection condition, P2 binds to the domain II of OsIAA10, blocking its association with OsTIR1 for degradation. The stabilized OsIAA10 binds to corresponding OsARFs, manipulating down-stream gene expression in the auxin signaling pathway. Reprogramed auxin signaling causes stunting, more tillering, shorter crown roots to the rice plants and promotes RDV propagation in rice.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) replicase protein interacts with several Aux/IAA proteins, including AtIAA26, to prevent their nuclear localization, resulting in transcriptional reprogramming of a large number of auxin-responsive genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref007">7</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref009">9</xref>]. In our study, the RDV P2 protein interacted with OsIAA10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g002">Fig 2</xref>), and RDV infection manipulated the auxin pathway in rice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g001">Fig 1</xref>). To determine if RDV causes alterations in the auxin signaling pathway by the same mechanism as the TMV, we examined the subcellular localization of OsIAA10 and found that it was localized in both the nucleus and cytoplast when transiently expressed in the tobacco leaf alone or together with P2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s011">S11 Fig</xref>); P2 does not affect its nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). The interaction of P2 with OsIAA10 does not change the sub-cellular localization and furthermore, P2 interacted with domain II of OsIAA10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s002">S2D Fig</xref>) whereas OsARFs and Aux/IAA proteins form heterodimers with their PB1 domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref022">22</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref030">30</xref>]. Taking these data together, we presume that the interaction between P2 and OsIAA10 would not inhibit the binding of OsIAA10 to OsARFs, and thus exclude the possibility that P2 prevents OsIAA10 from interacting with ARFs by sequestering it outside the nucleus, as the TMV 126K protein does with its interacting Aux/IAA proteins. We also showed that P2/OsIAA10 interaction prevented OsTIR1 from accessing OsIAA10 by occupying the same interaction domain (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g002">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g003">3</xref>.). Thus our work shows a novel mechanism underlying viral protein interference with auxin signaling.</p>
<p>There are 31 Aux/IAA proteins in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref021">21</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis of the full-length rice Aux/IAA proteins sequences showed that the overall identities range from 14% to 76%. However, identities of the aa sequences within the four conserved domains reaches up to 96% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref021">21</xref>]. Protein from plants like LRT2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref051">51</xref>] and pathogen component or protein like the TMV replicase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref008">8</xref>] are able to interact with most or several Aux/IAA proteins. In our yeast two-hybrid system, P2 only interacted with OsIAA10, but not with the other 19 family members tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s001">S1C Fig</xref>), possibly because P2 interacts with domain II of OsIAA10 (aa 91â€“141) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), including the conserved portion (16 aas) and the left flanking domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s002">S2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s012">S12</xref> Figs). The aa sequence identity in the conserved domains of the rice Aux/IAA proteins are very conserved and reach up to 96%, but significantly varied in the left flanking domain, suggesting that the left flanking domain may play an important role in the P2/OsIAA10-specific interaction. In addition, the domains or sections for OsIAA10 to interact with P2 and OsTIR1 are very close, but the sites for each specific interaction are different because the OsIAA10P116L mutant still interacts with P2, but not with OsTIR1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). These results suggest that the interaction of P2 with OsIAA10 may shield the site in OsIAA10 that is necessary for OsTIR1 binding.</p>
<p>Stabilization of OsIAA10 causes phenotypes similar to that of the RDV symptoms such as stunted growth, increased tiller number, shorter crown roots, and lower fertility rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005847.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Previously findings in our laboratory showed that the dwarf symptom resulting from RDV infection is due to the interaction between P2 and <italic>Î²</italic>-<italic>ent</italic>-kaurene oxidases, which catalyze <italic>ent</italic>-kaurene to <italic>ent</italic>-kaurene acid in gibberellic acid synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref010">10</xref>]. This interaction caused significant decreased levels of gibberellic acid (GA) in RDV-infected plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref010">10</xref>]. However, the crosstalk involved to produce disease is unknown. To address this issue, we infected a natural rice mutant of <italic>Î²</italic>-<italic>ent</italic>-kaurene oxidases, named <italic>d35</italic>, which contains a single nucleotide substitution located in exon 5 of OsKO2 resulting in a replacement of an arginine by serine and a semi-dwarf phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref052">52</xref>]. The infection of <italic>d35</italic> by RDV caused even more severe stunting of this rice mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s013">S13 Fig</xref>). These results suggest that another pathway also causes the dwarf phenotype upon RDV infection, such as manipulation of auxin signaling by P2, as shown in this study.</p>
<p>Different host plant-virus combinations may affect auxin homeostasis differently, and vice versa. Auxin signaling would be modulated to either promote or disrupt virus biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref004">4</xref>]. The results from this study show that auxin signaling plays an active role in antiviral defense that needs to be repressed by RDV in order to attain productive infection. Consistent with this idea, it was previously shown that TMV replicase protein interacts with several Aux/IAA proteins to prevent their nuclear localization, leading to transcriptional reprogramming of auxin-responsive genes that favors viral multiplication and symptom development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref007">7</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref009">9</xref>]. Likewise, the external application of IAA reduced the replication of a different virus, namely, the white clover mosaic virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref053">53</xref>], further corroborating the antiviral role of auxin signaling. Therefore, modulation or reprogramming of auxin signaling is a key factor in the successful infection for many viruses. While this remains to be an interesting, but poorly understood phenomenon, the existing literature does provide some clues. Viruses are intracellular pathogens that need to cross cellular boundaries to spread through the entire infected plant. Enhanced auxin signaling could accelerate the division of primordial cells, allowing the host to outcompete viruses, thereby keeping a fraction of dividing cells virus-free [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref039">39</xref>]. Additionally, auxin signaling may also activate the expression of certain antiviral defense genes. It was reported that in IAA26-stablized <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> plants, TMV infection and accumulation were inhibited, and defense response genes were induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref054">54</xref>]. In this study, OsIAA10-stablized rice plants were more hypersensitive to RDV infection, and the defense response genes, such as <italic>PR2</italic>, <italic>PR10</italic>, <italic>JAZ12</italic>, <italic>WRKY13</italic> and <italic>WRKY45</italic>, were downregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005847.s014">S14 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The reprogramming of auxin signaling initiation by P2, together with P2 inhibition of GA synthesis via interaction with rice <italic>ent</italic>-kaurene oxidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref010">10</xref>], demonstrate the broad significance of viral inhibition or manipulation of multiple hormonal pathways to benefit infection and enhance disease symptoms. Importantly, P2 is targeted for degradation by the rice protein OsRFPH2-10, a RING FINGER type E3 ubiquitin ligase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref050">50</xref>]. In light of these findings, we propose that the RDV P2 protein interacts with diverse rice proteins to inhibit plant hormone biosynthesis or to reprogram hormone signaling, and that OsRFPH2-10 interactions with P2 to promote its degradation, represent a new paradigm of arms race between viruses and their hosts, one of the defining factors of evolution, and provide information on the mechanism of viral protein reprogramming, which may be extrapolated to other microbe-plant interaction systems.</p>

Soluble GST fusion proteins were extracted and immobilized onto glutathione sepharose beads (GE Healthcare; Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). For competitive pull-down assays, 3 Î¼g of GST-OsIAA10 with 0, 3, 6, or 12 Î¼g GST-P2(1â€“786) or 6 Î¼g of GST alone were incubated with immobilized MBP-OsTIR1 (6 Î¼g) at 4Â°C for 1 h. Proteins retained on the beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected with anti-GST or anti-MBP antibodies, respectively.</p>

<title>MST assays</title>
<p>The MST assay was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref058">58</xref>]. MBP-OsTIR1 proteins were labeled with the red fluorescent dye NHS according to the Monolith NT<sup>â„¢</sup> Protein Labeling Kit RED-NHS instructions (NanoTemper Technologies GmbH; MÃ¼nchen, Germany). In OsTIR1/OsIAA10 interaction assays, the concentration of NHS-labeled OsTIR1 was kept constant at 75 nM and that of NAA was kept constant at 2.5 Î¼M whereas the concentrations of OsIAA10 were gradient-diluted (80,000 nM, 40,000 nM, 20,000 nM until 1.44 nM). After a short incubation, the samples were loaded into MST standard treated glass capillaries. Measurements were performed at 25Â°C in buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl, using 30% LED power and 20% MST power. The assays were repeated three times for each affinity measurement. Data analyses were performed using the Nanotemper Analysis and OriginPro 8.0 software provided by the manufacturer. In competitive interaction assays, 2.5 Î¼M of MBP-P2 or MBP was added to 75 nM NHS-labeled-OsTIR1, 2.5 Î¼M of NAA and gradient-diluted concentrations of OsIAA10. After a short incubation, the samples were loaded into MST standard treated glass capillaries for MST analysis as described above.</p>

<title>Cell-free protein degradation assays</title>
<p>Cell-free protein degradation assays were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref059">59</xref>]. Briefly, fresh total protein extracts were prepared from 0.5 g of rice or <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> leaves in 1 mL cell-free degradation buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 4 mM PMSF, 5 mM DTT, and 10 mM ATP) to establish the cell-free degradation system. Then 100 Î¼g of MBP-OsIAA10, MBP-OsIAA10P116L, or MBP-OsIAA1 was added into the system. For the 26S proteasome degradation assay test, MG132 (final concentration of 50 Î¼M, dissolved in DMSO) or DMSO was added into the test system or control system, respectively. Degradation assays with the rice extracts were incubated at room temperature for 120 min, and samples were collected at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min for standard immunoblot assays as described above. Degradation assays with <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> extracts were incubated at 4Â°C for 180 min, and samples were collected at 0, 20, 40, 80, and 180 min for standard immunoblot assays.

<title>Auxin response assays</title>
<p>For assays on auxin inhibition of root elongation, 4-week-old rice plants of wild-type (WT), WT-RDV, M7, and M9 were cultured in a liquid rice culture solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005847.ref032">32</xref>] supplemented with different concentrations of NAA. After 10 days, the root phenotypes were photographed using a digital camera and the root lengths were measured. To analyze induction of auxin-responsive genes, leaves of 2-month-old WT, WT-RDV, and M7 plants were cut into 0.5â€“1 cm pieces, immersed into the liquid rice culture solution with 20 Î¼M IAA, and sampled at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min for isolation of the total RNA.</p>
