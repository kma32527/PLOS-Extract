<abstract>
<p>All three pathogenic <italic>Yersinia</italic> species share a conserved virulence plasmid that encodes a Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) and its associated effector proteins. During mammalian infection, these effectors are injected into innate immune cells, where they block many bactericidal functions, including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pseudotuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Yptb</italic>) lacking the T3SS retains the ability to colonize host organs, demonstrating that chromosome-encoded factors are sufficient for growth within mammalian tissue sites. Previously we uncovered more than 30 chromosomal factors that contribute to growth of T3SS-deficient <italic>Yptb</italic> in livers. Here, a deep sequencing-based approach was used to validate and characterize the phenotype of 18 of these genes during infection by both WT and plasmid-deficient <italic>Yptb</italic>. Additionally, the fitness of these mutants was evaluated in immunocompromised mice to determine whether any genes contributed to defense against phagocytic cell restriction. Mutants containing deletions of the <italic>dusB-fis</italic> operon, which encodes the nucleoid associated protein Fis, were markedly attenuated in immunocompetent mice, but were restored for growth in mice lacking neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes, two of the major cell types responsible for restricting <italic>Yersinia</italic> infection. We determined that Fis was dispensable for secretion of T3SS effectors, but was essential for resisting ROS and regulated the transcription of several ROS-responsive genes. Strikingly, this protection was critical for virulence, as growth of <italic>ÎdusB-fis</italic> was restored in mice unable to produce ROS. These data support a model in which ROS generated by neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes that have not been translocated with T3SS effectors enter bacterial cells during infection, where their bactericidal effects are resisted in a Fis-dependent manner. This is the first report of the requirement for Fis during <italic>Yersinia</italic> infection and also highlights a novel mechanism by which <italic>Yptb</italic> defends against ROS in mammalian tissues.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The pathogenic members of the genus <italic>Yersinia</italic> share a conserved virulence plasmid that primarily serves to encode a Type 3 Secretion System and its associated effector proteins. During mammalian infection, these effectors are targeted toward phagocytic cells, where they neutralize a multitude of functions, including oxidative burst. However, it has previously been reported that strains of <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> lacking the virulence plasmid retain the ability to grow in mammalian tissue sites, suggesting that the <italic>Yersinia</italic> chromosome encodes a number of poorly appreciated factors that enable survival in mammalian tissue sites, even in the absence of a functional T3SS. Here, we further characterize a number of these factors, including the operon <italic>dusB-fis</italic>. Using a variety of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>vivo</italic> approaches, we determined that Fis regulates the transcription of several genes implicated in ROS resistance and that <italic>dusB-fis</italic> is essential for preventing growth restriction by ROS produced by the NADPH complex of phagocytes, even in a T3SS-expressing strain. Combined, these data suggest a model in which, during tissue infection, <italic>Yersinia</italic> evade killing by ROS through both T3SS-dependent and independent mechanisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bacterial pathogens utilize both âdefensiveâ and âoffensiveâ strategies to survive in mammalian tissue sites and withstand the host immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref001">1</xref>]. âDefensiveâ strategies often consist of physiological adaptations to stresses encountered in tissues, such as changes in pH or temperature, nutrient restriction, or influxes of toxic gases or proteins released by immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref003">3</xref>]. Many of these stresses are also found in other environments pathogens inhabit, such as soil, fomites, or in aerosol particles. By contrast, âoffensiveâ strategies include the secretion of toxins or effector proteins that kill or block the actions of responding immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref001">1</xref>]. One such example is the Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) used by many bacterial pathogens, including <italic>Yersinia</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic>, <italic>Shigella</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, and <italic>Chlamydia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref004">4</xref>]. These systems translocate effector proteins into mammalian cells from the bacterial cytosol and, often, promote bacterial growth by neutralizing the anti-bacterial actions of these cells. Additionally, T3SS effectors are used by some pathogens to rearrange host cell processes to enable intracellular growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref004">4</xref>]. In other cases, effector proteins act to kill mammalian cells by targeting essential proteins or triggering cell death pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>T3SS effector proteins play critical roles in the virulence of the pathogenic <italic>Yersinia</italic> species, which include the pneumonic and bubonic agent <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, as well as the gastrointestinal pathogens <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> and <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Yptb)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref005">5</xref>]. These three organisms target the translocation of their T3SS effectors, called Yops, into responding phagocytic cells, particularly into neutrophils, where they dismantle a number of bactericidal responses, including the ability to phagocytose bacteria, release reactive oxygen species (ROS), and produce certain inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref005">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref011">11</xref>]. The contributions of the T3SS and Yops to <italic>Yersinia</italic> pathogenesis have been extensively studied for more than two decades, and a number of reports have been published on Yop targets and their actions in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref012">12</xref>]. However, during infection of mammalian tissue sites, not all immune cells are intoxicated with Yops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref014">14</xref>], indicating that <italic>Yersinia</italic> must also employ additional, T3SS-independent strategies for surviving within the host and resisting the immune response, as remaining, non-intoxicated immune cells are competent to execute bactericidal functions. For example, it is known that at least one of these bactericidal functions, release of nitric oxide, restricts bacterial growth from a distance by cells not directly intoxicated with Yops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref015">15</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>Yptb</italic> lacking the pIB1 virulence plasmid, which encodes the T3SS and Yops, is capable of infecting and replicating within mouse tissues, in some cases at levels equivalent to a WT strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref016">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref018">18</xref>]. Even though infection with this strain seldom leads to death, these findings indicate that T3SS-deficient <italic>Yptb</italic> can withstand host defenses for several days and thus, likely encode âdefensiveâ factors on its chromosome that allow for survival in harsh environments.</p>
<p>Indeed, some of these genes have been identified in high throughput screens in various <italic>Yersinia</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref019">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref024">24</xref>], but all of these screens were performed in the presence of the virulence plasmid, which may mask the functions of some chromosomal factors. To determine which chromosomal factors contribute to infection of <italic>Yptb</italic> in the absence of the T3SS, we previously screened a library of 20,000 transposon insertions in a plasmid-deficient (pIB1<sup>-</sup>) <italic>Yptb</italic> strain during systemic infection and identified more than 30 mutants that were attenuated in livers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref017">17</xref>]. One of these mutants, Î<italic>mrtAB</italic>, was attenuated for virulence in the absence of the T3SS in all tissues, but only attenuated in the mesenteric lymph nodes in the presence of the T3SS, indicating that this screen uncovered factors that are redundant with the T3SS and/or that pIB1<sup>+</sup> and pIB1<sup>-</sup> <italic>Yptb</italic> encounter distinct environments in some tissue sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we follow up on our original work by employing a high-throughput, sequencing-based assay to evaluate the contribution of 18 additional genes identified in the screen to infection by both a plasmid-deficient and WT <italic>Yptb</italic>. In contrast to our findings with Î<italic>mrtAB</italic>, we found that most of the genes evaluated were important for systemic infection by both pIB1<sup>+</sup> and pIB1<sup>-</sup> <italic>Yptb</italic>, indicating that these genes play essential roles in virulence, regardless of the T3SS. Additional testing of the mutants in immunocompromised mice demonstrated that 4 loci were critical for virulence when interfacing with phagocytic cells. One operon, <italic>dusB-fis</italic>, prevented growth restriction by phagocytes and killing by ROS both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, in the presence of the T3SS. This work highlights the importance of studying both âoffensiveâ (T3SS-dependent) and âdefensiveâ (T3SS-independent) mechanisms of survival during <italic>Yersinia</italic> infection models, as both strategies are essential for the establishment of virulent infection.</p>

<title>Mutants evaluated in mini-TnSeq assay were significantly defective for virulence in both T3SS<sup>-</sup> and T3SS<sup>+</sup> strains of <italic>Yptb</italic></title>
<p>By evaluating the virulence of 20,000 transposon mutants in a plasmid-deficient <italic>Yptb</italic> strain, we identified 33 mutants that were significantly defective for colonization of and/or growth within the liver, but were otherwise capable of growing in rich media at physiological temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref017">17</xref>]. However, using large pools of transposon mutants in animal infection models can sometimes result in âfalse negatives,â as libraries are subject to bottleneck constraints and transposon insertions can have polar effects on nearby loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref025">25</xref>]. Therefore, we devised and implemented a high-throughput, sequencing-based approach (a âminiâ TnSeq) to simultaneously compare the survival of multiple in-frame deletion mutants in small infection pools to further evaluate the loci identified in our previous TnSeq screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005898.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Eighteen gene or operon deletion mutants containing identical in-frame scar sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005898.s001">S1A Fig</xref>) were generated in both a plasmid-deficient (pIB1<sup>-</sup>) YPIII strain (the parental strain of our original transposon library) and a plasmid-containing (pIB1<sup>+</sup>) IP2666 strain to determine whether the <italic>in vivo</italic> contributions of some of these genes may be influenced by the T3SS. We chose the IP2666 pIB1<sup>+</sup> strain for further investigation because it encodes the known virulence factor, <italic>phoP</italic>, which is non-functional in YPIII due to a mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref026">26</xref>]. The 18 operons and genes examined represent several broad functional classes, including biosynthesis of metabolic compounds, LPS synthesis and modification, and several other previously uncharacterized virulence factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1005898.t001">Table 1</xref>). In order to ensure that the bacterial pools used to infect mice contained an equal proportion of attenuated mutants and WT bacteria, we also constructed two deletions of âneutral genesâ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1005898.t001">Table 1</xref>), which were selected because transposon disruptions in these genes had no deleterious effects in the original TnSeq screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref017">17</xref>].</p>

<p>Mice were infected intravenously with 10<sup>4</sup> or 10<sup>3</sup> CFU of the pIB1<sup>-</sup> or the pIB1<sup>+</sup> library, respectively. Following infection with these doses, equivalent bacterial loads were recovered from spleens at 3 days post-infection regardless of the presence of the T3SS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005898.s002">S2A Fig</xref>); however, livers infected with pIB1<sup>-</sup> bacteria contained lower bacterial loads than those infected with libraries generated in the WT background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005898.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). In each pool, the two neutral strains each comprised 25% of the inoculum, while the remaining 18 mutants each comprised ~3% of the population. Following recovery of bacteria from infected livers and spleens at 3 days post-infection, genomic DNA was processed for Illumina sequencing and fitness values were calculated for each mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Strikingly, 14 of the 18 mutants generated in the pIB1<sup>-</sup> YPIII background had statistically significant virulence defects in infected liver tissues. Of those 14 genes, all but one were also critical for growth of pIB1<sup>+</sup> IP2666 within the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1005898.t001">Table 1</xref>), indicating that more than 70% of the genes evaluated were important for infection, regardless of the presence of the T3SS. Mutants attenuated for growth within the liver included the auxotrophic strains Î<italic>aroA</italic> and Î<italic>aroE</italic>, which are unable to produce aromatic amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref028">28</xref>], and Î<italic>purM</italic>, which lacks a component of the purine biosynthesis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref029">29</xref>]. With the exception of one strain (Î<italic>YPK_3185</italic>), all of the strains with mutations in genes involved with LPS synthesis and modification were attenuated for virulence in at least one tissue site. Importantly, several factors that had not been previously characterized in <italic>Yersinia</italic> infection models, including <italic>YPK_2594</italic>, which has no predicted function, <italic>YPK_1920</italic>, which is predicted to encode a lipoprotein, <italic>YPK_3765</italic>, which is predicted to encode a murein peptide ligase, and the <italic>dusB-fis</italic> operon, which encodes the nucleoid associated protein Fis, were critical for infection. Six pIB1<sup>+</sup> mutants, Î<italic>aroA</italic>, Î<italic>YPK_3184</italic>, Î<italic>arnDT</italic>, Î<italic>YPK_1920</italic>, Î<italic>YPK_2594</italic>, and Î<italic>psaEFABC</italic>, were defective for growth in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), but not the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1005898.t001">Table 1</xref>), indicating tissue specific functions of these genes.</p>

<p>To evaluate whether mutants were attenuated when they were not a small minority of the input pool, traditional competition experiments were performed using bacterial mutants generated in the pIB1<sup>+</sup> background. Mutants were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with a drug resistant WT strain, and C.I. values were obtained after intravenous infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g002">Fig 2</xref>). All of the mutants evaluated were attenuated in this assay. In conclusion, using our efficient and highly sensitive mini-TnSeq assay many bacterial mutants were attenuated in both WT and plasmid-deficient <italic>Yptb</italic>, indicating that most of these loci do not have redundant roles with the T3SS.</p>

<title>Growth of Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic>, Î<italic>YPK_3765</italic>, Î<italic>rfaH</italic>, and Î<italic>psaEFABC</italic> mutants is altered in immunocompromised mice</title>
<p>Infection with <italic>Yptb</italic> produces a pronounced inflammatory response, where bacteria growing in tissue sites are surrounded by phagocytic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref015">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref017">17</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that some of the genes evaluated in the mini-TnSeq assay may encode proteins that directly interface with phagocytic cells, or are important for surviving in the face of anti-microbial responses generated by these cells. To test this, mice pre-treated with the RB6-8C5 antibody, which depletes Gr1<sup>pos</sup> cells (Ly6G<sup>pos</sup> neutrophils and Ly6C<sup>pos</sup> inflammatory monocytes, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes) or the 1A8 antibody, which depletes Ly6G<sup>pos</sup> cells (neutrophils only) were infected with the pIB1<sup>+</sup> mini-TnSeq library. Surprisingly, very few significant changes in fitness scores were detected following infection of immunocompromised mice with these mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005898.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), suggesting that most of these genes are important for bacterial colonization and growth in animal tissues, regardless of the presence of these innate immune cells. However, four mutants displayed significantly altered fitness scores upon infection of immunocompromised mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Growth of Î<italic>YPK_3765</italic> was restored to WT levels in the livers and spleens of both RB6-8C5- and 1A8-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g003">Fig 3Aâ3D</xref>), indicating that this gene is required for resisting growth restriction by phagocytic cells. Surprisingly, depletion with the RB6-8C5 and 1A8 antibodies resulted in decreased growth of the Î<italic>psaEFABC</italic> mutant in spleens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g003">Fig 3B and 3D</xref>), and depletion with 1A8 decreased the growth of Î<italic>rfaH</italic> in livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g003">Fig 3A and 3C</xref>). These results suggest that neutrophils may protect these mutants from further growth restriction by other cells or factors in these tissue sites. Interestingly, the growth changes observed with Î<italic>YPK_3765</italic>, Î<italic>rfaH</italic>, and Î<italic>psaEFABC</italic> were specific to neutrophil depletion, as treatment with 1A8 was sufficient to alter the fitness of these mutants. By contrast, the fitness of Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> was restored in mice treated with the RB6-8C5 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>), but not in mice treated with the 1A8 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). This result suggested that Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> is sensitive to all Gr1<sup>pos</sup> cells, to one or more Ly6C<sup>pos</sup> cell types (inflammatory monocytes, dendritic cells, and lymphocyte subsets), or to Ly6G<sup>pos</sup> neutrophils and a subset of Ly6C<sup>pos</sup> cells.</p>

<p>To distinguish among these possibilities, we performed 1:1 co-infection experiments with Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> in mice treated with an antibody, MC-21, which blocks the chemokine receptor CCR2 and prevents recruitment of Ly6C<sup>pos</sup> inflammatory monocytes to tissue sites during microbial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref030">30</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref033">33</xref>]. Additional cohorts of mice were treated with 1A8, RB6-8C5, or with a combination of the 1A8 and MC-21 antibodies prior to infection. Depletion of cell subsets was confirmed by flow cytometry using Gr1 and Cd11b markers to distinguish between neutrophil and inflammatory monocyte populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005898.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Treatment with either 1A8 or MC-21 alone did not restore the virulence of the Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g004">Fig 4</xref>), indicating that the presence of either Ly6G<sup>pos</sup> or Ly6C<sup>pos</sup> cell type(s) at the site of infection was sufficient to restrict the growth of this mutant. By contrast, depletion with a combination of the MC-21 and 1A8 antibodies restored growth of Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> in livers and spleens, demonstrating that Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> is specifically sensitive to neutrophils and CCR2-recruited inflammatory monocytes during tissue infection. Importantly, growth of Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> was also restored when we complemented this mutant by re-introducing the <italic>dusB</italic>-<italic>fis</italic> genes into the deleted strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g004">Fig 4</xref>). To determine whether a <italic>dusB-fis</italic> mutant was more attenuated than <italic>fis</italic>, a deletion of <italic>fis</italic> was generated and evaluated in mice. The <italic>fis</italic> mutant was attenuated to the same extent as Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>), indicating that Fis is essential for the virulence of <italic>Yptb</italic>.

<title>The <italic>dusB-fis</italic> mutant colonizes systemic sites efficiently, but is restricted for growth after colonization</title>
<p>Because the virulence of the Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> mutant was restored in the absence of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes, it is possible that these immune cells restricted survival of this mutant in the bloodstream after intravenous infection, thereby preventing high levels of tissue colonization. Alternatively, or in addition, neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes may restrict the growth of Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> in the systemic tissue sites once these cells surround the bacteria. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the growth kinetics of the Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> mutant were determined during systemic mouse infection at 4, 24, 48, and 72-hour time-points. In both co-infections with a WT strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>) and in single-strain infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>), the Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> mutant colonized tissue sites and grew for the first 24 hours post-infection with kinetics similar to WT <italic>Yptb</italic>. However, by 48 hours post-infection, the level of Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> failed to increase as rapidly as WT, indicating that the growth of this strain was not restricted until after initial seeding and expansion in tissue sites. Combined with our findings from the depletion experiments, these results suggest that Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> cannot adapt to a change in the tissue environment that likely occurs due to the influx and/or activities of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes.</p>

<title><italic>The dusB-fis</italic> operon is critical for resisting oxidative stresses and regulates the transcription of ROS-responsive genes</title>
<p>Fis serves as a transcriptional regulator of virulence factors in several pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref034">34</xref>]. Therefore, we speculated that the virulence defect of Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> was due to an inability to mount a transcriptional response to protect against the bactericidal actions of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes in systemic tissue sites. Neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes use a variety of mechanisms to restrict bacterial growth upon recruitment to tissue sites, including the phagocytosis of bacteria, release of toxic granules and diffusible reactive gases (ROS and reactive nitrogen species), and chelation of metals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref036">36</xref>]. Because T3SS effectors interfere with many of these processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref037">37</xref>], and because Fis regulates expression of the SPI-1 and SPI-2 pathogenicity islands in <italic>Salmonella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref038">38</xref>], we first tested whether Fis positively regulated expression of the T3SS or its effectors. Under conditions that induce expression and secretion of T3SS effectors, Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> and Î<italic>fis</italic> mutants secreted effectors into culture supernatants at equivalent levels to WT <italic>Yptb</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Additionally, engineered strains of WT and Î<italic>dusB-fis Yptb</italic> containing the beta-lactamase, TEM, fused to the first 100 amino acids of the T3SS effectors YopE or YopH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref039">39</xref>] exhibited no difference in cleavage of the beta-lactamase substrate nitrocefin by those effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). Because Fis could regulate other factors, such as adhesins, which also contribute to efficient effector translocation into host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref014">14</xref>], the ability of Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> to translocate T3SS effectors into cultured epithelial cells was measured using the CCF4-FRET based translocation assay. The Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> mutant had no defect in translocating YopE-TEM or YopH-TEM into cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>), suggesting that Fis plays no role in regulating the expression of the <italic>Yptb</italic> T3SS machinery or in regulating the expression of other factors that promote efficient effector translocation through this system. Furthermore, a <italic>dusB-fis</italic> deletion generated in a strain lacking the T3SS needle was attenuated for virulence in the presence of Gr1<sup>pos</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g006">Fig 6F and 6G</xref>), indicating that <italic>dusB-fis</italic> is critical for preventing growth restriction by phagocytes, even in the absence of a functional T3SS.</p>

<p>To evaluate whether Fis promotes resistance to one or more of the bactericidal stresses imposed by neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes, the Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> mutant was exposed to several conditions that simulate the actions of these cells. These conditions included exposure to low pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), low concentrations of iron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), nitric oxide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), and ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g007">Fig 7D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As bacteria evolve to adapt and grow in different niches, they often acquire new traits through the acquisition of plasmids, pathogenicity islands, or integration of phages or other mobile genetic elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref048">48</xref>]. However, these organisms can also exploit or rely on other traits they previously possessed to survive in these new environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref048">48</xref>]. These previously held abilities likely reflect the environments that had been central to the survival of the organism in prior niches. Thus, the observation that pIB1<sup>-</sup> strains of <italic>Yptb</italic> display a remarkable ability to grow and persist within several tissue sites during mammalian infection suggests that an ancestor of this bacterium may have relied on a number of chromosome-encoded factors to grow within mammalian tissue sites and withstand restriction by the host immune response prior to acquisition of the T3SS-encoding virulence plasmid. One of these host responses is the release of ROS, which are produced following the oxidative burst of phagocytic cells in response to fungal and bacterial infections in several tissue sites, including the GI tract, lungs, and systemic organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref049">49</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref051">51</xref>]. In phagocytic cells, oxidative burst occurs via the activation and assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex, usually in response to bacterial contact or pattern recognition receptor activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref052">52</xref>].</p>
<p>Our results, in aggregate, support a model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005898.s007">S7 Fig</xref>) whereby the <italic>dusB-fis</italic> operon in <italic>Yptb</italic> controls the transcription of genes critical for resisting killing by ROS that are generated by the NADPH oxidase complex of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes surrounding bacteria. Specifically, (1) <italic>dusB-fis</italic> was important for defense against both neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes, as the growth of this mutant was only restored when both immune cell populations were depleted (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g004">4</xref>); (2) Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> initially colonized spleens and livers, but was unable to sustain growth in these tissue sites by 48 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g005">Fig 5</xref>); (3) Fis was required for protection against oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g007">Fig 7D</xref>) and regulated the transcription of at least 4 genes, <italic>katG</italic>, <italic>ahpC</italic>, <italic>grxA</italic> and <italic>recA</italic>, which are predicted to contribute to resistance to ROS in <italic>Yersinia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g007">Fig 7E</xref>)<italic>;</italic> and (4) growth of Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> was restored in gp91<sup>phox-/-</sup> mice, whose immune cells lack a functional NADPH oxidase complex and thus cannot undergo oxidative burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Remarkably, these mice contained equal bacterial loads of WT and Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g008">Fig 8E and 8F</xref>), suggesting that the primary contribution of this operon to <italic>Yptb</italic> intravenous infection is to prevent against restriction by ROS.</p>
<p>The findings that <italic>dusB-fis</italic> was necessary for resisting killing by ROS <italic>in vitro</italic> and that this operon was dispensable for growth within gp91<sup>phox91-/-</sup> mice were unanticipated for several reasons. First, previous studies of <italic>Yersinia</italic> gene expression in animal models have observed little transcriptional induction of ROS-detoxifying genes during infection of lymphoid tissue sites, suggesting that <italic>Yersinia</italic> may not experience oxidative stress during growth in these organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref053">53</xref>]. However, these studies were largely directed at analyzing the transcriptional induction of ROS-responsive genes compared to <italic>in vitro</italic> growth, where bacteria may also encounter some endogenous oxidative stress, and did not assess the survival of <italic>Yptb</italic> mutants lacking one or more of these genes during animal infection. In fact, a prior study analyzing the phenotype of a mutant lacking the superoxide dismutase <italic>sodA</italic> determined that this gene was critical for growth of <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>enterocolitica</italic> within livers and spleens, suggesting that <italic>Yersinia</italic> do encounter ROS during tissue infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref054">54</xref>]. Second, it has been well established that two T3SS effectors, YopE and YopH, prevent oxidative burst in Yop-intoxicated phagocytic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref011">11</xref>]. However, YopE and YopH can only function within the cells into which they have been delivered. As only a small fraction of immune cells are intoxicated with Yops during infection of some tissue sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref013">13</xref>], it is possible that in these tissues, <italic>Yptb</italic> encounters ROS produced by non-injected cells, and would therefore require mechanisms to resist killing by these species. Because Fis is dispensable for T3SS effector translocation, but is required for protection against ROS both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, our work suggests that <italic>Yptb</italic> does encounter ROS during infection of the spleen and liver, and that these species must be coming from neighboring immune cells not intoxicated with Yops. Furthermore, the observation that gp91<sup>phox-/-</sup> mice were no more sensitive to WT <italic>Yptb</italic> than C57Bl/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g008">Fig 8E and 8F</xref>) suggests that WT <italic>Yptb</italic> is completely resistant to ROS produced by the immune response during infection. Therefore, we propose that <italic>Yptb</italic> utilizes both offensive and defensive measures to counteract ROS produced by phagocytic cells during mammalian infection by preventing oxidative burst in T3SS-intoxicated host cells, and also by initiating a Fis-dependent transcriptional response to protect against killing by ROS released by non-injected phagocytic cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005898.s007">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>dusB-fis</italic> operon is conserved in <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> family members of the <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref055">55</xref>] and encodes the nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) Fis. While no published work has characterized a function for Fis in <italic>Yersinia</italic>, Fis and other NAPs have been well studied in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and other organisms, where these small, histone-like proteins play important roles in modulating DNA architecture, as well as in directly and indirectly regulating transcription at a global level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref034">34</xref>]. In <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, the two genes are co-regulated and transcribed from a single promoter upstream of <italic>dusB</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref057">57</xref>], where the <italic>dusB</italic> mRNA transcript is believed to play a regulatory role in promoting translation of Fis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref055">55</xref>]. Interestingly, Fis serves as a transcriptional regulator of virulence factors in several mammalian pathogens, including <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic>, <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, and pathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref058">58</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref065">65</xref>]. In these organisms, it activates a diverse range of virulence functions, including quorum sensing, capsule production, adhesion, and Type 3 Secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref058">58</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref065">65</xref>]. Notably, a study performed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> also characterized a role for Fis in protection against oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref066">66</xref>], suggesting that defense against ROS may be a conserved function of Fis across multiple bacterial species. However, the contribution of Fis to ROS resistance has not been examined in other pathogens.</p>
<p>Our findings indicate that, following exposure of <italic>Yptb</italic> to oxidative stress, Fis promotes the transcriptional induction of several ROS-detoxifying genes, as well the SOS response regulator <italic>recA</italic>. This suggests that Fis may prevent ROS-mediated killing of <italic>Yptb</italic> both by stimulating detoxification as well as by promoting the repair of DNA damage. Expressing the detoxifying genes <italic>ahpC</italic> and <italic>katG</italic> under the control of a constitutive promoter did not restore resistance of Î<italic>dusB-fis</italic> to oxidative stress; however, this is not surprising because it is likely that Fis promotes expression of multiple genes that contribute to survival under these conditions. Future studies aimed at identifying global regulatory targets of this protein will further inform our understanding of how Fis promotes survival under these conditions.</p>
<p>Another surprise from our mini-TnSeq assay was the finding that the virulence defects of the <italic>ÎpsaEFABC</italic> and <italic>ÎrfaH</italic> mutants were exacerbated following neutrophil depletion during <italic>Yptb</italic> infections of the spleen and liver, respectively, indicating that these loci may promote survival in a non-inflammatory niche or in the presence of a host cell subset âunmaskedâ by neutrophil depletion. Consistent with this idea was the observation that the <italic>ÎpsaEFABC</italic> mutant was significantly attenuated in the pIB1<sup>-</sup>, but not the pIB1<sup>+</sup>, background in the spleen, as WT <italic>Yptb</italic> recruits a more robust, neutrophil-rich inflammatory response than its plasmid-deficient derivative in lymphoid tissue sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref017">17</xref>]. The <italic>psaEFABC</italic> operon encodes the fimbrial-like adhesin pH 6 antigen, which has been shown to contribute to lung colonization by <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref067">67</xref>]. Notably, <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> undergoes an early âquietâ stage during infection by the pneumonic route, in which neutrophils are not recruited to the lungs until at least 24 hours post-infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref068">68</xref>]. <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic> may therefore require pH 6 antigen to colonize and grow within the lungs at early time-points because neutrophils have not yet been recruited. RfaH has been characterized as a global regulator of LPS synthesis in several gram-negative organisms, including <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>enterocolitica</italic>, where deletion of this gene results in a âroughâ phenotype, in which core inner core LPS is exposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref069">69</xref>]. In <italic>Y</italic>. <italic>pestis</italic>, exposed core LPS promotes interactions with and uptake by dendritic cell subsets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref070">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref071">71</xref>]. While neutrophils are the primary cells contacting bacteria during <italic>Yptb</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref017">17</xref>]<bold>,</bold> upon neutrophil depletion, it is possible that bacteria encounter dendritic cell subsets. Thus, during this condition, the <italic>ÎrfaH</italic> mutant may come into contact with and be phagocytosed by certain dendritic cell subsets. In contrast to the <italic>ÎrfaH</italic> and <italic>ÎpsaEFABC</italic> mutants, the virulence of a mutant lacking <italic>YPK_3765</italic> was restored in the absence of neutrophils, indicating that this gene is important for protection against clearance by these cells. <italic>YPK_3765</italic> is predicted to encode a murein peptide ligase (Mpl), a class of proteins important for peptidoglycan synthesis and recycling in other organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref072">72</xref>]. Peptidoglycan is a known activator of pattern recognition receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref073">73</xref>], so a loss of this protein in <italic>Yptb</italic> may result in aberrant expression or release of peptidoglycan outside of the bacterial cell, which could further enhance killing by neutrophils during tissue infection.</p>
<p>Our mini-TnSeq assay offers a number of advantages in evaluating smaller cohorts of mutants initially identified in a large transposon-based screen, where extreme bottlenecks can inhibit the ability of an otherwise competent mutant to colonize tissues. In addition, transposon disruptions of genes can often have polar effects on the expression of nearby loci. Finally, screening individual mutants in single-strain and 1:1 co-infections often requires large numbers of mice. To address these issues, our assay utilizes deep sequencing as a read-out, where in-frame mutants contain scar sequences that can be used as a primer template for PCR amplification of Illumina libraries. This allowed us to use small pools of bacterial mutants in mouse infections, thereby bypassing bottleneck issues and also minimizing animal usage. Unlike our initial study, in which the operon containing the most significantly attenuated transposon mutant, <italic>mrtAB</italic>, was not required for systemic infection by a pIB1<sup>+</sup> strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref017">17</xref>], the vast majority of mutants with defects in the absence of the virulence plasmid were also attenuated for infection of pIB1<sup>+</sup> <italic>Yptb</italic> in the liver. In fact, only one mutant, Î<italic>oppD</italic>, was attenuated for growth in livers only in the absence of pIB1. Curiously, both <italic>oppD</italic> and <italic>mrtAB</italic> encode components of transporters, suggesting that they could carry out functions that are redundant with the T3SS, or that they are critical for survival in niches that are not predominantly inhabited by WT <italic>Yptb</italic>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, six mutants, Î<italic>aroA</italic>, Î<italic>YPK_3184</italic>, Î<italic>arnDT</italic>, Î<italic>YPK_1920</italic>, Î<italic>YPK_2594</italic>, and Î<italic>psaEFABC</italic>, were defective for growth of the WT strain in the liver, but not the spleen, reflecting the fact that the original screen was performed in the liver and suggesting that different tissue sites can influence the repertoire of bacterial virulence factors required during infection. Indeed, it has been established that mammalian organs differ in their mechanisms of sensing and responding to microbial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref074">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref075">75</xref>] and that, consequently, bacteria may utilize genes to survive in some tissues that are dispensable in others. For example, the bacterial pathogen <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> specifically requires tryptophan biosynthesis genes during infection of the lung in order to counteract restriction of this amino acid by a host-encoded enzyme expressed in this organ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref076">76</xref>]. Likewise, <italic>Yptb</italic> may require certain factors, such as <italic>aroA</italic>, to survive in the liver because their products are limiting in this organ. Additionally, certain mutants, such as Î<italic>YPK_3184</italic> and Î<italic>arnDT</italic>, may be more readily detected by pattern recognition receptors in the liver and would therefore fail to colonize or sustain growth in this organ. Future work with these mutants may help to uncover host immune mechanisms specific to this tissue site.</p>
<p>Altogether, our findings reinforce the argument that <italic>Yptb</italic> relies on a number of chromosome-encoded defense factors to grow within tissue sites and withstand restriction by immune cells. In particular, the small, histone-like protein Fis plays a critical role in protecting <italic>Yptb</italic> from ROS produced by phagocytic cells during tissue infection. Future work will be aimed at identifying the global network of Fis- regulated genes during conditions of oxidative stress to understand how this protein promotes bacterial adaptation to this condition.</p>

Deletions replacing genes of interest with in-frame scar sequences were created using allelic exchange as follows: primers were designed to amplify ~800bp regions directly up and downstream of each targeted gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005898.s009">S2 Table</xref>). These oligos also contained overlapping sequences necessary to create a ~60bp scar sequence after gene deletion.

<title>Mouse infections and immune cell depletions</title>
<p>All infections were performed by intravenous injection in 8â10 week C57Bl/6 or C67Bl/6 gp91<sup>phox-/-</sup> mice obtained from Jackson, NCI, and Taconic labs. For infections with strains constructed in pIB1<sup>-</sup> YPIII, mice were inoculated with 1 x 10<sup>4</sup> bacteria. For infections with strains constructed in pIB1<sup>+</sup> IP2666, mice were inoculated with 1 x 10<sup>3</sup> bacteria. Competition experiments were performed using a 1:1 mixture of an unmarked strain and a strain harboring an insertion of miniTn5 Kan<sup>R</sup> in a neutral locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref078">78</xref>]. Following infections, spleens and livers were isolated, weighed, homogenized, and plated on L agar containing 0.5 Î¼g/mL irgasan. The quantity of CFU/gram of organ was determined by dividing the number of recovered CFU by the weight of the tissue sample extracted, or in cases where the entire organ was extracted, CFU/organ values were determined. For competition experiments, tissue homogenates were plated onto non-selective media as well as onto media containing 50 Î¼g/mL kanamycin. The CFU count for each strain was determined by subtracting the number of Kan<sup>R</sup> colonies from the total number of colonies recovered on non-selective plates. The proportion of each strain in the inoculum was confirmed using the same methods. C.I values were determined by the following equation: C.I. = (mutant/WT output ratio)/(mutant/WT input ratio). For Ly6G and Gr1 cell depletions, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 50 Î¼g of 1A8 (Fisher) or RB6-8C5 (eBioscience) antibody 24 hours prior to and 24 hours post-infection.

<title>Mini-TnSeq infections and analysis</title>
<p>Overnight cultures of individual strains were mixed so that each putatively attenuated mutant would represent ~3% of the inoculum, and the combined neutral mutants would represent ~50% of the inoculum.

At 3 days post-infection, tissues were isolated, homogenized, and plated for CFUs on 150mm agar plates so that each plate would contain ~1x10<sup>4</sup> CFUs. Bacteria were scraped off plates, mixed, and genomic DNA was extracted from a volume equivalent to ~2x10<sup>9</sup> CFUs using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit. DNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using the homopolymer tail-mediated ligation PCR technique as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref081">81</xref>]. Briefly, genomic DNA was sheared by sonication and treated with terminal deoxytransferase in order to generate a 3â poly C-tail sequence. Two rounds of nested PCR were then employed to amplify regions immediately downstream of deleted genes. These products were multiplexed using 6bp indexing primers and sequenced on the Illumina Hi-Seq 2500. Following sequencing, reads were mapped to the region immediately downstream of the deleted genes and the total number of reads for each mutant in a given organ or input pool was divided by the total number of reads obtained for that organ or input pool.

<title>Mini-TnSeq assay schematic.</title>
<p>(A) Mutants containing identical in-frame scar sequences were prepared for Illumina sequencing. Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated from bacterial input and output pools, sheared by sonication, and treated with terminal deoxytransferase in order to generate a 3â poly C-tail sequence. Two rounds of nested PCR were then employed to amplify regions immediately downstream of deleted genes. These products were multiplexed using 6bp indexing primers and sequenced on the Illumina Hi-Seq 2500. (B) Depiction of mini-TnSeq experiment. Infection inoculums were prepared so that each putatively attenuated mutant represented ~3% of the pool, and the combined neutral strains represented 50%. Mice were infected with pIB1<sup>+</sup> and pIB1<sup>-</sup> libraries, and after 3 days, spleens and livers were isolated, homogenized, and plated to retrieve surviving bacteria. DNA was prepared for sequencing as indicated in (A) and fitness values were calculated by determining the percentage of reads for a mutant in an organ by the percentage of that mutant in its respective input pool.</p>

<title>Virulence of mini-TnSeq library in depleted mice.</title>
<p>Fitness of mutants in mini-TnSeq library following depletion of Gr1<sup>pos</sup> or Ly6G<sup>pos</sup> cells. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with RB6-8C5 (A-B) or 1A8 (C-D) 24 hours prior to and post-infection. Mice were inoculated intravenously with libraries of knockouts generated in IP2666/pIB1<sup>+</sup> at a dose of 10<sup>3</sup> CFU. Fitness values were obtained by dividing the proportion of sequencing reads for a mutant in the depleted liver (A, C) or spleen (B,D) by its proportion of reads in the inoculum. Each data point for a mutant represents an individual mouse. N = 4â10 mice. Non-depleted fitness values are the same as reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005898.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Fitness scores values were log<sub>10</sub> transformed and an unpaired t-test with the Holm-Sidak correction for multiple comparisons was performed to calculate statistical differences between the fitness scores of specific bacterial mutants in depleted versus non-depleted mice. * indicates pâ¤0.05, ** indicates pâ¤0.01, *** indicates pâ¤0.001, and **** indicates pâ¤0.0001.</p>

<title>Confirmation of neutrophil and inflammatory monocyte depletions.</title>
<p>(A) Representative FACs plots from spleens isolated from infected mice that were not depleted, or mice treated with either 1A8 or MC-21 antibodies. Tissues were extracted 3 days post-infection and single cell suspensions were prepared for FACs analysis by staining with Gr1 and Cd11b antibodies. Gating was performed as indicated, where neutrophils were designated as those cells expressing high levels of both Gr1 and Cd11b, and inflammatory monocytes were designated as those cells expressing intermediate levels of Gr1 and high levels of Cd11b. (B) Quantitation of FACs analysis described above. Statistical significance was determined using One Way ANOVA analysis with Dunnettâs multiple comparison post-test comparing the % total cell values of each depletion condition with that of non-depleted mice. * indicates pâ¤0.05 and ** indicates pâ¤0.01.</p>

<title>Proposed model of <italic>Yptb</italic> resistance to ROS during growth within systemic tissue sites.</title>
<p>During growth within livers and spleens, <italic>Yptb</italic> forms extracellular aggregates or microcolonies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005898.ref016">16</xref>]. Following stimulation of the immune response by infecting bacteria, neutrophils, macrophages, and inflammatory monocytes are recruited to sites of infection. (A) Some cells in close contact with bacteria on the periphery of the microcolony become translocated with T3SS effectors, (B) resulting in inhibition of NADPH oxidase activation and oxidative burst. (C) Other cells, which are not translocated with Yops, undergo oxidative burst in response to bacterial contact and/or PRR activation. (D) In WT infections, ROS released by these cells diffuse into the <italic>Yptb</italic> microcolony, where their bactericidal effects are resisted in a Fis-dependent manner, potentially through transcriptional induction of ROS-responsive genes. However, in Î<italic>fis</italic> infections, mutants are unable to resist the bactericidal effects of ROS and are killed or restricted for growth.</p>
