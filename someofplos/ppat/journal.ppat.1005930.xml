<abstract>
<p>Both type I interferon (IFN-I) and CD40 play a significant role in various infectious diseases, including malaria and autoimmune disorders. CD40 is mostly known to function in adaptive immunity, but previous observations of elevated CD40 levels early after malaria infection of mice led us to investigate its roles in innate IFN-I responses and disease control. Using a <italic>Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis</italic> N67 and C57BL/6 mouse model, we showed that infected CD40<sup>-/-</sup> mice had reduced STING and serum IFN-β levels day-2 post infection, higher day-4 parasitemia, and earlier deaths. CD40 could greatly enhance STING-stimulated luciferase signals driven by the IFN-β promoter <italic>in vitro</italic>, which was mediated by increased STING protein levels. The ability of CD40 to influence STING expression was confirmed in CD40<sup>-/-</sup> mice after malaria infection. Substitutions at CD40 TRAF binding domains significantly decreased the IFN-β signals and STING protein level, which was likely mediated by changes in STING ubiquitination and degradation. Increased levels of CD40, STING, and ISRE driven luciferase signal in RAW Lucia were observed after phagocytosis of N67-infected red blood cells (iRBCs), stimulation with parasite DNA/RNA, or with selected TLR ligands [LPS, poly(I:C), and Pam3CSK4]. The results suggest stimulation of CD40 expression by parasite materials through TLR signaling pathways, which was further confirmed in bone marrow derived dendritic cells/macrophages (BMDCs/BMDMs) and splenic DCs from CD40<sup>-/-</sup>, TLR3<sup>-/-</sup> TLR4<sup>-/-</sup>, TRIF<sup>-/-</sup>, and MyD88<sup>-/-</sup> mice after iRBC stimulation or parasite infection. Our data connect several signaling pathways consisting of phagocytosis of iRBCs, recognition of parasite DNA/RNA (possibly GPI) by TLRs, elevated levels of CD40 and STING proteins, increased IFN-I production, and longer host survival time. This study reveals previously unrecognized CD40 function in innate IFN-I responses and protective pathways in infections with malaria strains that induce a strong IFN-I response, which may provide important information for better understanding and management of malaria.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Malaria parasites infect millions of people and can cause severe disease with diverse symptoms. No highly effective vaccine is available to prevent malaria infection, largely due to the lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms of host-parasite interactions. Here we investigated the interaction of two important host molecules, CD40 and STING, in host type I interferon (IFN-I) responses to malaria infection using a mouse malaria model. For the first time, we showed that malaria infection could increase CD40 expression, which in turn enhanced the expression of STING, leading to increased production of IFN-I during early infection and better host survival. The increased CD40 expression could be stimulated by phagocytosis of infected red blood cells (iRBCs), parasite DNA/RNA and specific ligands of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), suggesting recognition of parasite materials and signaling by TLRs. This study reveals previously unrecognized protective pathways during malaria infection and provides important information for designing better strategies for malaria control and vaccine development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Malaria infection triggers strong host immune responses, which may lead to parasite elimination and/or severe pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref005">5</xref>]. Among the immune mechanisms, the role of type I interferon (IFN-I) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) in protection against malaria infection has been controversial, but is gaining more attention lately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref006">6</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that IFN-I responses involving pathways mediated by cytosolic DNA and RNA sensors/adaptors such as STING (Stimulator of interferon genes), MDA5 (Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5), and MAVS (Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein) can suppress early parasitemia and control liver stage development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref010">10</xref>], although the mechanism of the IFN-I response in malaria control and pathology is far from clear. STING recognizes AT-rich DNA motifs from malaria parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref007">7</xref>], whereas MDA5/MAVS can detect parasite RNAs from both sporozoite and blood stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref010">10</xref>]. However, whether cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) plays a role in sensing malaria parasite DNA remains to be determined. STING is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) adaptor that can activate TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1)/IRF3 (IFN regulatory factor 3) pathway to induce expression of IFN-I and ISG genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref012">12</xref>] by directly recognizing dsDNA or cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) generated by pathogens or metabolized from dsDNA by cGAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref015">15</xref>]. STING can also signal through TRAF3 (TNF receptor associated factor 3) or TRAF6 and activate canonical and non-canonical NFκB (Nuclear factor-kappa B) pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Another important molecule in host immune response to infections is CD40 (or TNF receptor superfamily member 5, TNFRSF5) that is a receptor expressed on the surfaces of many cell types, including B-cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref017">17</xref>]. CD40 is a type I transmembrane protein with four extracellular cysteine-rich domains that are important for interaction with its ligand CD40L (CD154) on T-cells. The intracellular region of CD40 includes binding domains to TRAF molecules (TRAF1, 2, 3, 5 and 6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref017">17</xref>]. CD40-mediated signal transduction activates multiple pathways, including those signaling through NFκB, STAT3 (Signal transducers and activators of transcription-3), MAPK (Mitogen-activated protein kinase), and other kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref019">19</xref>]. CD40 is mostly known to function in the initiation and progression of cellular and humoral adaptive immunity, including T cell-dependent immunoglobulin class switching, memory B cell development, and germinal center formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref020">20</xref>]. Engagement of CD40 on macrophages and CD40L on T-cells has been shown to promote inflammatory responses in many neurologic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref021">21</xref>]. CD40-CD40L interaction between the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and dendritic cells (DCs) primes the DCs to activate CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref024">24</xref>]. The process of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation is associated with induction of CD70 expression in activated DCs after combined TLR/CD40 stimulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref025">25</xref>]. More recently, ligation of CD40 by CD40L was shown to stimulate IFN-β expression through TRAF2/3 mediated NFκB pathways and sequential de novo synthesis of IRF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref027">27</xref>]. However, the increase in IFN-β expression by the CD40-mediated NFκB pathway was generally low, compared with those induced by other molecules such as STING or TLR7.</p>
<p>CD40 has been associated with many diseases or disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref029">29</xref>]. In addition to protection against viral and bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref032">32</xref>], CD40 also contributes to protection against parasitic infections such as <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, <italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic>, and <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref035">35</xref>]. Production of nitric oxide (NO), IL-12, and IFN-γ after ligation of CD40 is critical for controlling <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> parasitemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref033">33</xref>]. CD40 is required for the maturation of liver dendritic cells, accumulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the liver, and effective APC licensing during <italic>P</italic>. <italic>yoelii</italic> sporozoite infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref034">34</xref>]. Activation and ligation of CD40 and CD40L are also associated with many neurologic and autoimmune diseases that are characterized by elevated levels of IFN-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref037">37</xref>]. Considering the potential role of CD40 in IFN-I response and our observation of up-regulation of IFN-I and CD40 expression in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>yoelii nigeriensis</italic> N67 (N67) infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref008">8</xref>], we investigated the functional roles and the relationship of CD40 and STING in host response to N67 parasite infection and showed that the serum level of IFN-β was significantly reduced in CD40 knockout (KO) mice day 2 after N67 infection, leading to early host death. We further showed that CD40 could greatly enhance STING protein level and STING-mediated IFN-I responses. The effect of CD40 on STING and the IFN-I response was mediated through TRAF2/3 and/or TRAF6 binding domains, leading to changes in STING ubiquitination and protein level. We also showed that various TLR ligands, infected red blood cells (iRBCs), and parasite DNA/RNA could stimulate CD40 expression, establishing a signaling axis of TLR recognition and signaling, increased CD40 and STING levels, elevated IFN-I production, and longer host survival time.</p>

<title>CD40 plays a role in IFN-I response, parasitemia control and host survival</title>
<p>C57BL/6 mice infected with N67 parasite induced a strong IFN-I response, including increased expression of genes such as <italic>Cd40</italic>, <italic>Isg15</italic>, <italic>Isg20</italic>, <italic>Ifit2</italic>, <italic>Mx1</italic>, <italic>Mx2</italic>, <italic>Ddx58</italic>, <italic>and Usp18</italic> genes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005930.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref></bold>), leading to suppression of N67 parasitemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref038">38</xref>]. Ligation of CD40 with CD40L was recently shown to activate the NFκB pathway resulting in enhanced IFN-I response in carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref027">27</xref>]. The elevated levels of <italic>Cd40</italic> transcripts in the N67 infected mice suggest that it may play a role in regulating host IFN-I response to malaria infection.</p>
<p>To investigate the role of CD40 in IFN-I mediated protection against malaria infection, we infected wild type (WT) and CD40<sup>-/-</sup> mice with N67 and monitored parasitemia and host mortality. Compared with WT mice, both infected male (n = 9) and female (n = 3) CD40<sup>-/-</sup> mice had significantly higher day 4 parasitemia (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0078 for male; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0137 for female) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref></bold>) and died earlier (Ave survival days, WT over 25 days vs KO 15 days for male, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001; 15 days vs 10 days for female, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0623) than the WT mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g001">Fig 1C</xref></bold>). As expected, the day 2 (24 h after parasite injection) serum levels of IFN-β were significantly lower in the CD40<sup>-/-</sup> mice than those of WT mice after parasite infection; however, the IFN-β level quickly returned to low levels despite continuous increase of parasitemia (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g001">Fig 1D</xref></bold>). These observations were similar to our previous measurements of IFN-I in splenic cDCs after N67 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref008">8</xref>]. These results suggest that CD40 played a role, despite not a major role, in the IFN-β response and in controlling early parasitemia during N67 parasite infection, e.g., lower day 2 IFN-β level in the CD40<sup>-/-</sup> mice resulted in higher day 4 parasitemia and earlier host death. The decline of IFN-β after day 2 also suggests active regulation of IFN-I levels during the infection.</p>

<title>CD40 enhances STING/MAVS mediated IFN-I response</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanism as to how CD40 regulates IFN-I response, we transfected 293T cells with plasmids containing genes encoding CD40, a luciferase reporter plasmid driven by the IFN-β promoter (IFN-β-luciferase), and a plasmid containing renilla luciferase as control and measured luciferase activities as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref008">8</xref>]. Compared with cells transfected with control pCMV plasmid vector, introduction of the plasmid containing CD40 gene significantly increased luciferase signals with or without poly(dAdT) stimulation 18 h after transfection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>). However, the increases in luciferase signals were not significant when stimulated with poly(I:C) or N67 parasite gDNA (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>). We next co-transfected the cells with plasmids containing CD40 plus those carrying genes encoding STING, MAVS, TRIF, or TBK1 and showed that co-transfection with genes encoding STING, MAVS or TBK1 could significantly increase luciferase signals, but not those encoding TRIF (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>).

<p>The effect of CD40 on enhancing IFN-I production could be mediated by direct stimulation of STING expression and/or through protein modifications. To investigate the mechanisms of how CD40 enhances STING-mediated IFN-I production, we determined protein expression at different time points after introduction of the CD40 and/or STING plasmids into 293T cells and found that the levels of STING expression were greatly elevated 24–48 h post co-transfection with the CD40 expression vector, with the highest STING level at 48 h (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We also used various antibodies to detect CD40 protein expression. Protein bands could be detected from 12–48 h using antibodies against DDK-tag fused to CD40 and against N’- or C’-termini of CD40 (a small band could be seen 12 h post infection using anti-C-terminus and anti DDK tag). Interestingly, the presence of STING decreased CD40 levels between 12–48 h (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref></bold>). The decrease in CD40 protein appeared to be due to cleavage of CD40 N’-terminus because of the presence of lower molecular weight bands and the reduction in protein signals detected by anti-C’- and N’-terminal antibodies, respectively (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>). The higher STING protein levels in cells co-transfected with CD40 likely contributed to the elevated luciferase signals (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g003">Fig 3E</xref></bold>). Similarly, the CD40 protein degradation when co-transfected with STING could also explain the reduced NFκB signaling in cells co-transfected with STING (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g003">Fig 3F</xref></bold>). Both STING and CD40 have been shown to activate the canonical and non-canonical NFκB pathways and IFN-I production by recruiting various TRAF molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref027">27</xref>]. However, STING is a stronger IFN-I inducer than CD40, whereas CD40 is better at activating the NFκB pathway (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g003">Fig 3E and 3F</xref>)</bold>. These results show that CD40 can greatly enhance the STING-mediated IFN-I response, whereas STING can inhibit the CD40-mediated NFκB pathway.</p>
<p>We also investigated the effects of CD40 on endogenous STING expression in different cell lines and in mice after infection with N67 parasite. Introduction of CD40 expressing plasmid could increase STING levels in DC2.4 and J774A.1 cells, but not obvious in the RAW Lucia cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g003">Fig 3G</xref></bold>). In the spleen of uninfected mice, both CD40 and STING were expressed at low levels; however, both protein levels were increased in the spleen of N67-infected WT mice day-2 and -5 <italic>p</italic>.<italic>i</italic>. (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g003">Fig 3H–3J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005930.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). Compared with WT mice, STING expression was significantly reduced in infected CD40<sup>-/-</sup> mice on both days, whereas CD40 levels were significantly increased in the infected STING<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g003">Fig 3H–3J</xref></bold>). We also investigated CD40 and STING expression in TRIF<sup>-/-</sup>, TLR3<sup>-/-</sup>, TLR4<sup>-/-</sup>, and MyD88<sup>-/-</sup> mice infected with N67 and showed that CD40 protein level was decreased in all the KO mice, (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005930.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref></bold>), although the reductions in STING in the TLR3<sup>-/-</sup>, TLR4<sup>-/-</sup>, and MyD88<sup>-/-</sup> mice were minimum.

<title>CD40 signals through TRAF binding domains to regulate STING and IFN-I expressions</title>
<p>CD40 has intracellular domains that are known to bind TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF6 in canonical or non-canonical NFκB pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref018">18</xref>]. Recently, the TRAF2 and TRAF3 binding domains of CD40 were also found to be responsible for IFN-β gene transactivation through NFκB pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref027">27</xref>]. Similarly, STING can also function by signaling through TRAF3 and TRAF6 to modulate canonical and non-canonical dsDNA-mediated NFκB activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref016">16</xref>]. To investigate the functional role of CD40 TRAF domains in the IFN-I signaling, we first introduced amino acid substitutions in the CD40 TRAF2/3 and TRAF6 binding domains based on known mutations that are critical for its binding to TRAF molecules (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref039">39</xref>]. Plasmids containing one or more amino acid substitutions in the TRAF binding domains were generated using a site mutagenesis kit (Quick Change II, Agilent Technologies) and the expected substitutions were confirmed after DNA sequencing of the mutagenized clones (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005930.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>). Substitutions in the binding domains of TRAF2/3 (T255A), TRAF6 (Q238A; E239A), TRAF2/3/box2 (T255A; Q264A), TRAF6/box2 (Q238A; E239A; Q264A), TRAF2/3/6 (T255A; Q238A; E239A), and TRAF2/3/6/box2 (T255A, Q238A, E239A, and Q264A) significantly reduced luciferase signals driven by the IFN-I promoter in 293T cells, whereas the mutation in box2 (Q264A) alone did not alter the luciferase signals (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref></bold>). Generally, simultaneous mutations affecting two TRAF domains reduced luciferase signals more significantly than those affecting one single TRAF domain or box. These results show that TRAF2/3 and TRAF6 binding domains play a role in stimulating STING-mediated IFN-I response.</p>

<p>The luciferase signals were much higher when CD40 and STING were co-transfected into the 293T cells compared with expression of CD40 alone (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g003">Fig 3E</xref></bold>), suggesting that the impact of CD40 on IFN-I production is more significant when acting as regulator of STING than signaling through its own NFκB pathways. At the presence of a plasmid encoding STING, only the T255A mutation affecting TRAF2/3 could significantly reduce the luciferase signal, although all the constructs with mutations in more than one domain also had significant effects (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g004">Fig 4C</xref></bold>). The results again suggest that TRAF2/3 binding domain is the key domain affecting CD40 enhancement of the STING-mediated IFN-I response. As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref018">18</xref>], mutations in the TRAF2/3 and TRAF6 domains also significantly affect NFκB activation with or without STING expression, although the effect of TRAF6 mutations on NFκB activation was less than that of TRAF2/3 mutation in the presence of STING (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref></bold>). Mutations in the TRAF binding domains could indeed affect the ability of CD40 to enhance STING protein levels (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g004">Fig 4F and 4G</xref></bold>). These results suggest that the stimulation of STING expression and therefore IFN-I response is mainly mediated through the TRAF binding domains of CD40.</p>
<p>We also investigated whether overexpression of TRAF2, TRAF3, or TRAF6 affected</p>
<p>IFN-β and NFκB signaling with or without the presence of CD40, STING or both. As expected, overexpression of TRAF3, but not TRAF2 or TRAF6, greatly suppressed CD40 mediated NFκB activation (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005930.s004">S4A–S4C Fig</xref></bold>), suggesting inhibition of NIK disassociation from cIAP1/2 and of NFκB activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref041">41</xref>]. The patterns of TRAF2 and TRAF3 in affecting IFN-β responses were similar; both enhanced IFN-β signal when transfected with STING alone, but decreased IFN-I production when co-transfected with CD40 and STING (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005930.s004">S4D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005930.s004">S4E Fig</xref></bold>). TRAF6 increased IFN-β signals in all situations (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005930.s004">S4F Fig</xref></bold>). These results suggest that TRAF2/3 and TRAF6 play a role in the CD40 and/or STING signaling pathways leading to IFN-I production, but they may have different roles at high levels of CD40 and STING; TRAF2 and TRAF3 could affect the degradation of CD40, STING, or proteins in pathways leading to increased STING level or other IFN-I signaling.</p>

<title>CD40 interacts with STING through TRAFs and reduces STING ubiquitination</title>
<p>Because CD40 and STING regulate each other’s protein levels and molecular signaling, we next investigated whether there was any physical interaction between the two molecules by performing co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments, although CD40 and STING are known to localize at the plasma membrane and ER, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref017">17</xref>]. Protein complexes were pulled down using anti-HA antibody after co-transfection of 293T cells with plasmids containing HA-tagged STING and/or DDK/Myc-tagged CD40, and the bound/unbound proteins were detected using anti-DDK (or anti-CD40) and anti-HA antibodies. CD40-DDK was detected in the unbound fraction, but not in the fraction pulled down by anti-HA antibody (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g005">Fig 5A</xref></bold>). As expected, these results suggest that CD40 does not bind to STING directly.

<p>Next we investigated how TRAFs interact and regulate CD40 and STING protein interaction. We transfected 293T cells with V5-tagged TRAF2, TRAF3, or TRAF6 and CD40-DDK/Myc, STING-HA, or both, used anti-Myc or anti-HA to pull-down protein complexes, and detected the pulled-down proteins using anti-TRAFs (V5), anti-STING (HA), or anti-CD40 (Myc), respectively. We found that both CD40 and STING were directly associated with TRAF3, TRAF2, and TRAF6, and CD40 and STING could be pulled down together, at least with overexpression of the TRAFs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g005">Fig 5B–5D</xref></bold>), suggesting the presence of CD40/TRAF/STING complex. Compared with TRAF2 and TRAF6, overexpression of TRAF3 decreased CD40 protein level at 24 h (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g005">Fig 5E</xref></bold>) and 48 h (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g005">Fig 5F</xref></bold>) post transfection. Similarly, overexpression of TRAF3 greatly degraded STING, and co-expression of CD40 could protect some STING from degradation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g005">Fig 5E and 5F</xref></bold>). These observations can be explained by competition for binding the TRAFs between CD40 and STING. Increased binding of TRAF3 to CD40 decreased its availability to STING, leading to reduced STING degradation.</p>
<p>CD40 stimulation has been shown to facilitate K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of TRAF3, causing disassociation of NIK from cIAP1/2p100 processing and NFκB activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref040">40</xref>]. To investigate the mechanism of how increased CD40 expression affects STING protein levels, we assayed for STING ubiquitination with or without overexpression of CD40 in 293T cells. Our results showed that addition of CD40 could reduce STING ubiquitination, including at position K48 and K63 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g005">Fig 5G and 5H</xref></bold>). The TRAF molecules, particularly TRAF2 and TRAF3, could play an important role in STING ubiquitination and degradation.</p>

<title>TLR ligands and iRBCs can stimulate CD40 and STING expression and increase ISRE-luc signal</title>
<p>Many ligands are known to stimulate CD40 expression; CD40L, TNF-α, type I and II interferons, and LPS are known to induce or modulate CD40 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref042">42</xref>]. LPS was shown to induce IFN-β that in turn stimulated CD40 expression through TRAM/TRIF/IRF3 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref042">42</xref>]. To investigate possible mechanisms that stimulate CD40 expression and IFN-I production during malaria infection, we stimulated RAW Lucia cells with iRBCs, poly(I:C) (TLR3 ligand), LPS (TLR4 ligand), Pam3CSK4 (TLR1/2 ligand), and DMXAA (mouse STING ligand) and detected CD40 and STING expressions on Western blot 1, 8, and 24 h post stimulation. In all cases, higher CD40 expression levels were observed with increased incubation time; for STING, increased protein levels over time were observed only in cells stimulated with iRBCs and poly(I:C) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g006">Fig 6A</xref></bold>). We also measured luciferase activities driven by ISRE promoter and plotted the luciferase signals against CD40 and STING protein band intensities after stimulation of RAW Lucia cells for 1, 8, and 24 h. Interestingly, there were similar trends of protein intensities of CD40 and STING and luciferase signals after stimulations of the cells with poly(I:C), LPS, and iRBCs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g006">Fig 6B–6D</xref></bold>), suggesting direct relationships between CD40/STING levels and IFN-I response, but not those stimulated with Pam3CSK4 and DMXAA (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005930.s006">S6A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005930.s006">S6B Fig</xref></bold>). We next stimulated the RAW Lucia cells with additional ligands for 24 h and measured luciferase signals driven by ISRE promoter and CD40 protein expression with or without lipofectamine treatment on Western blot (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005930.s006">S6C</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005930.s006">S6D Fig</xref></bold>). Compared with un-stimulated cells, iRBCs, DMXAA, cGAMP, poly(I:C), LPS, and Pam3CSK4 again induced higher ISRE luciferase signals without lipofectamine, suggesting that TLR1/2, TLR3, and TLR4 may play a role in enhancing CD40 levels. However, the higher luciferase signals induced by poly(dAdT) and cGAMP at the presence of lipofectamine indicated that some of the signals could be from mechanisms bypassing signaling by receptors on the cell surface. CD40L, IFN-γ or both did not induce significant amounts of luciferase signals or CD40 protein expression. Stimulation of 293T cells with CD40L did not increase CD40 protein level either (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005930.s006">S6E Fig</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Phagocytosis of iRBCs and parasite DNA/RNA stimulate CD40 expression and ISRE induced signal</title>
<p>To investigate parasite ligands that may play a role in this process, we assayed various parasite materials for stimulation of CD40 expression and IFN-I responses. Because malaria parasites reside within RBCs, one potential mechanism for the host cells to detect parasite molecules is through phagocytosis and digestion of iRBCs. We therefore incubated iRBCs (schizonts) with RAW Lucia cells and measured CD40 levels and luciferase activities driven by the ISRE promoter. More than twice the numbers of iRBCs were phagocytized than those of uninfected RBCs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g007">Fig 7A</xref></bold>) and higher amounts of CD40 protein were detected 8 h post co-incubation in RAW Lucia cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g007">Fig 7B</xref>)</bold> and slightly higher amounts in DC2.4 cells <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g007">Fig 7C</xref>)</bold>. The higher level of CD40 level also led to increased luciferase signals driven by ISRE promoter (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g007">Fig 7D</xref></bold>), although the luciferase signals could also include signals from other IFN-I signaling pathways. Phagocytosis of RBCs did not induce CD40 expression or luciferase signal (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g007">Fig 7B and 7D</xref></bold>). The lack of CD40 expression and luciferase signal after phagocytosis of RBCs and the dose-dependent signals suggest that the CD40 expression and luciferase signals detected were parasite specific.</p>

<p>We next used parasite DNA and RNA to stimulate CD40 and ISRE luciferase expression in RAW Lucia cells and showed higher levels of CD40 protein and luciferase signals in the presence of lipofectamine (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g007">Fig 7E and 7F</xref></bold>). The increased CD40 levels stimulated by parasite DNA/RNA disappeared or were greatly reduced after treatment with nucleases (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g007">Fig 7G and 7H</xref></bold>). The results are consistent with the observation of reduced CD40 and STING levels in the spleen of TRIF<sup>-/-</sup> mice infected with N67 parasites (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005930.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>), suggesting involvement of TRIF (at least) signaling in regulating CD40 expression.

Similarly, stimulation of purified splenic DCs from CD40<sup>-/-</sup>, TLR3<sup>-/-</sup>, TLR4<sup>-/-</sup>, TRIF<sup>-/-</sup>, and MyD88<sup>-/-</sup> mice had reduced CD40 and/or STING protein levels (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g008">Fig 8I and 8J</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>One of the important discoveries of this study is linking the CD40 protective effect to elevated IFN-I responses in this N67 malaria parasite and C57BL/6 mouse model. CD40 is a TNF receptor superfamily member that provides critical activation signals in antigen presenting cells (APC) such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. When bound by its ligand CD40L that is transiently expressed on T cells and other non-immune cells, CD40 can activate a wide spectrum of molecular and cellular processes including the initiation and progression of cellular and humoral adaptive immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref018">18</xref>]. In malaria infection, CD40 was reported to be necessary for the maturation of liver DCs and for the accumulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the liver in response to the invading <italic>P</italic>. <italic>yoelii</italic> sporozoites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref034">34</xref>]. Mice without CD40 were not able to withstand infectious challenge after immunization with a <italic>P</italic>. <italic>yoelii</italic> mutant parasite (fabb/f<sup>-</sup>), suggesting that CD40 signaling is a key requirement for host immunity in a lethal <italic>P</italic>. <italic>yoelii</italic>/C57BL/6 model. Additionally, CD40 expression was elevated in DCs in the immunized mice. In a non-lethal model of <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> XAT and WT C57BL/6 mice, limited protective effects were observed after administration of an agonistic anti-CD40 mAb to activate CD40 signaling, although administration of the anti-CD40 antibody to γδ T cell-deficient mice 3–10 days p.i. could help eliminate the parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref043">43</xref>]. In another lethal model of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> ANKA/C57BL/6 mice, host mortality was greatly decreased in CD40<sup>-/-</sup> and CD40L<sup>-/-</sup> mice after infection with the parasite, even though parasitemia were similar in the WT, CD40<sup>-/-</sup> or CD40L<sup>-/-</sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref044">44</xref>]. In this model, mortality was attributed to the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, macrophage sequestration, and platelet consumption. Therefore, the protective effects of CD40 KO depend on infections of specific malaria strains: Larger improvement in host survival was observed in models of early lethal infections (references 34 and 43; mice died on day 7–8 p.i.) than those of moderate or non-lethal infections (mice died ~day 15 p.i. in our N67 model and the non-lethal model in reference 44). The mechanisms of CD40-mediated protection are likely different among the models of various disease severities because dramatically different host responses were observed in infections with different parasite strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref008">8</xref>]. A strong day-2 IFN-I response was induced after N67 infection, leading to suppression of early parasitemia, whereas infection with N67C parasites stimulated a lethal inflammatory response with little IFN-I production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref008">8</xref>]. In this regard, we should emphasize that the CD40/STING/IFN-I protective mechanism we observed in this N67/C57BL/6 mouse model may only apply to infections with parasite strains that can simulate strong IFN-I responses. Although the CD40/STING/IFN-I mechanism may not play an important role in some infections, it likely represents one of the possible protective mechanisms in human infections considering the potentially large number of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> strains in the field. Up-regulation of genes in IFN-I responses (ISG genes) has been associated with mild human <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria following an episode of severe malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref045">45</xref>], suggesting that CD40/STING/IFN-I and other IFN-I protective mechanisms may play a role in infections of some human parasite strains.</p>
<p>DCs are the major sources of IFN-I during early malaria infection, and CD40 and CD86 were up-regulated in splenic pDCs that were dependent on TLR7 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref047">47</xref>]. These data point to a potential link between up-regulation of CD40 expression and IFN-I production during malaria infection. Our current study showed that CD40 not only played a protective role during <italic>P</italic>. <italic>yoelii</italic> infection of C57BL/6 mice, but also regulated early IFN-I production for the first time. In our model, mice without CD40 had higher parasitemia on day 4 <italic>p</italic>.<italic>i</italic>., died earlier, and had lower levels of IFN-β than the WT mice day 2 <italic>p</italic>.<italic>i</italic>. Although there was no correlation between elevated expressions of CD40/STING and IFN-β level at day 5 <italic>p</italic>.<italic>i</italic>. <italic>in vivo</italic>, the down-regulation of IFN-I after day 2 <italic>p</italic>.<italic>i</italic>. was likely due to activation of negative regulators in some signaling pathways downstream of STING. Indeed, our recent study identified a large number of negative IFN-I response regulators, including several molecules (for example, <italic>Fosl1</italic>, <italic>Fcgr1</italic>, and <italic>selenbp2</italic>) that could down-regulate STING signaling during malaria infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref038">38</xref>]. However, the spike of day-2 IFN-I could affect the expression of ISGs and activate other immune pathways that could have some impact on host immune responses and survival in later phases of infection. The WT and CD40 KO mice also had similar parasitemia after day 8, but the CD40 KO mice died earlier. In the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> ANKA/C57BL/6 model, better survival rates were found in CD40<sup>-/-</sup> and CD40L<sup>-/-</sup> mice after infection with the parasite, despite similar parasitemia in the WT, CD40<sup>-/-</sup> or CD40L<sup>-/-</sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref044">44</xref>]. Similarly, mice infected with N67 and N67C parasites had almost identical parasitemia before day 5 p.i.; mice infected with N67C died on day 7, but those infected with N67 suppressed parasitemia to below 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref008">8</xref>]. These observations suggested that the main cause of host death was likely due to over-responses of host immunity, not parasitemia. Our results are consistent with most of the previous studies suggesting a protective role of CD40 during malaria infections, although its functional roles in different malaria models could be different, and provide a new mechanism on CD40 mediated protection through IFN-I production during early phase of malaria infection.</p>
<p>The second important discovery of this study is linking the increased CD40 expression to higher STING protein level that greatly elevates the IFN-I response. A large number of studies have been done on CD40; however, the previous studies on CD40 have focused on inflammatory and adaptive immune responses to infection, not stimulation of IFN-I in early innate response. CD40 is best known for its interaction with CD40L expressed on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the subsequent signaling events leading to activation of NFκB and NFκB-like transcription factors and secretion of Th1 cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN-γ and to recruitment and priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref018">18</xref>]. CD40-CD40L ligation regulates production of various inflammatory cytokines such as MIP-1α, TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-12 by DCs and IL-1α, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 by monocytes. CD40-mediated signaling leads to the transcription of host defense genes against pathogens through activation of NFκB, MAPK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) and STAT3 (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription-3) pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref048">48</xref>]. Recently, a role of CD40 in regulating IFN-β expression through canonical NFκB and non-canonical NFκB signaling pathways leading to recruitment of p52 to the IFN-β promoter was described, although the fold changes in IFN-β level mediated through the NFκB signaling were relatively small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref027">27</xref>]. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> transfection of cell lines, here we showed that over expression of CD40 in 293T or RAW Lucia cells increased STING protein levels, leading to highly elevated luciferase signals driven by ISRE and IFN-β promoters. The fold changes in luciferase signals in CD40+STING co-transfected cells were much higher than those transfected with CD40 or STING alone, suggesting that CD40 can greatly enhance STING-mediated IFN-I responses to infections. The role of CD40 in enhancing STING protein level was also confirmed using purified splenic DCs or total splenic cells from WT and CD40<sup>-/-</sup> mice after N67 infection. Additionally, phagocytosis of iRBCs or stimulations of BMDMs and BMDCs from infected or uninfected mice with parasite DNA/RNA also increased CD40 and STING protein levels. These <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data establish a relationship of increased CD40 and STING expression. The protective roles of IFN-I in malaria infections have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref010">10</xref>], including injection of recombinant IFN-α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref049">49</xref>]. Our observations of CD40 affecting STING expression and IFN-I production in the early hours of infection add a new function to CD40, in addition to its known functional roles in CD8+ T-cell activation and IgG isotype switching during host adaptive response. At day 11–15 <italic>p</italic>.<italic>i</italic>., CD40-CD40L ligation, activation of NFκB in APCs, and recruitment of CD8+ T-cells, as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref034">34</xref>], were likely to play a role in host survival. It would be interesting to investigate how the spike of day 2 IFN-I affects the adaptive immune response, including the effects of higher CD40 level on T-cell activation and isotype switching. Proper activations of T-cells and B-cells for antibody production are critical for immune protection and host survival in later phases of infection.</p>
<p>Interestingly, whereas CD40 could increase STING expression and greatly enhance IFN-I production, the presence of high levels of STING appeared to decrease CD40 protein levels both in transfected cells and in mice infected with malaria parasite N67, possibly through degradation of the N-terminus of CD40. Therefore, increased STING expression may dampen CD40 mediated inflammatory responses and damage to the host, while promoting a strong IFN-I response to control parasitemia. The negative regulatory role of STING in suppressing inflammation in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was reported recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref050">50</xref>]; our observations here add another mechanism explaining the role of STING in regulating inflammatory responses.</p>
<p>Many autoimmune diseases are associated with high levels of IFN-I and interferon induced genes (ISGs), particularly IFN-I produced by over-activation of STING signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref037">37</xref>]. Interestingly, high levels of CD40 and CD40L or engagement of CD40/CD40L are also associated with the same sets of autoimmune diseases such as SLE and Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref051">51</xref>]. However, the functional roles of CD40 in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases have been largely attributed to CD40-CD40L interaction that mediates T-dependent B cell responses and T cell priming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref029">29</xref>]. Our observation of CD40 enhancement of STING mediated IFN-I production provides an alternative mechanism that may unite these two hallmarks of autoimmune diseases. Higher expression of CD40 could increase STING level in DCs and greatly elevate IFN-I production, which may influence the susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in addition to traditionally known pathways of T- and B-cell activation.</p>
<p>To investigate how the signal from CD40 was relayed to the downstream pathways leading to higher STING level, we constructed plasmids with various mutations in the cytoplasmic TRAF binding domains of CD40 and showed that the TRAF binding domains played a role in the increased STING level and IFN-I activity. Mutations in both TRAF2/3 and TRAF6 binding domains could affect luciferase activities driven by IFN-β promoter; however, when co-transfected with STING, the effect of mutations in the TRAF6 binding domain disappeared. The mutations in the TRAF binding domains also affect STING protein level, consistent with the observations showing increased CD40 and STING proteins after co-transfection of plasmids containing genes encoding both molecules and decreased STING protein in CD40<sup>-/-</sup> mice after parasite infection. As expected, the mutations in the TRAF binding domains also influenced NFκB mediated signaling. In particular, introduction of TRAF3 greatly reduced CD40-mediated NFκB signaling, which was consistent with a role of TRAF3 in regulating NIK protein level. TRAF3 degradation is necessary for the cell to activate the alternative NFκB pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref041">41</xref>], and higher expression of TRAF3 will inhibit the alternative NFκB signaling. Overexpression of TRAF2 and TRAF3 also inhibited IFN-β production mediated by CD40 directly or by CD40-enhanced STING signaling. These observations suggest a role of TRAF2 and TRAF3 in regulating levels of STING protein and IFN-I. Both mutations in CD40 TRAF2/3 binding domains and overexpression of TRAF2/TRAF3 may lead to more ‘free’ TRAF2 and TRAF3 not associated with CD40, resulting in the observed lower levels of STING and IFN-β. On the other hand, increased CD40 levels will bind more TRAF2/TRAF3 and reduce the levels of ‘free’ TRAF2/TRAF3, resulting in higher STING and IFN-β levels because overexpression of TRAF3 led to STING degradation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g005">Fig 5</xref></bold>). It has been shown that Sendai virus (SeV) infection increased K48 and K63 ubiquitination of TRAF3/6 after recruitment of cIAP1/2 to mitochondrial associated TRAF3, which triggered IFN-I induction mediated through MAVS/VISA signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref052">52</xref>]. However, viral infection or cIAP1/2 overexpression did not cause noticeable degradation of TRAF3/6, and activation of downstream kinases such as TBK1 and TAK1 were proposed. Our data suggest a mechanism of reduced availability of TRAF2 and TRAF3 after binding to elevated level of CD40 and decreased STING ubiquitination and degradation, leading to higher STING level and IFN-I production. We showed that CD40 and STING could be co-IP when cells were transfected with TRAF2, TRAF3 or TRAF6, suggesting the presence of a CD40/TRAF/STING complex. This direct contact of the molecules may explain the reduced STING ubiquitination after CD40 expression, which could be mediated by TRAF2 and/or TRAF3 directly or by recruiting other enzymes with ubiquitinase activities. Reduced ubiquitination of STING at a site such as K48 may lead to higher protein levels. Our data suggest that TRAF3 plays an important role in STING stability; however, TRAF molecules are known to play a role in many signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref053">53</xref>], and any change in the TRAF protein levels in the cell will likely affect more than one pathways, which will require additional investigations.</p>
<p>Another interesting question is how CD40 is activated by malaria ligands. Some TLRs such as TLR2 and TLR4 have MyD88-dependent and MyD88–independent pathways, depending on cellular locations of the TLRs and adaptors recruited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref055">55</xref>]. When TLR4 is located at the plasma membrane, activation of the MyD88-dependent pathway leads to production of proinflammatory cytokines; whereas the MyD88-independent signaling pathway is involved when TLR4 is at the endosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref054">54</xref>]. The MyD88-independent pathway signals through a TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM), TRIF and IRF3, which leads to IFN-I production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref055">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref057">57</xref>] and/or activation of CD40, CD54 (ICAM1) and CD86 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref058">58</xref>]. Additionally, LPS has been shown to stimulate CD40 expression through TLR4 signaling that involved activation of both NFκB and signal transducer and activator of transcription1α (STAT-1α) in macrophages and microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref042">42</xref>]. Various TLRs are known to play a role in host response to malaria infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref060">60</xref>]. Consistent with these reports, we showed that over expressions of TLR1/2, TLR3, and TLR4 followed by stimulations with their ligands [Pam3CSK4, poly(I:C), and LPS, respectively] could increase CD40 protein levels as well as luciferase signals driven by ISRE promoter in 293T cells. Consistently, stimulations of BMDMs and BMDCs with TLR ligand poly(I:C) and LPS, parasite DNA/RNA, and iRBCs increased CD40/STING levels (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005930.s007">S7 Fig</xref></bold>), and compared with cells from WT, stimulations of BMDCs from TLR3<sup>-/-</sup> and TLR4<sup>-/-</sup> mice with parasite DNA/RNA and iRBCs had reduced CD40/STING proteins and IFN-β (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g008">Fig 8</xref>).</bold> Additionally, splenic DCs from TLR3<sup>-/-</sup>, TLR4<sup>-/-</sup>, TRIF<sup>-/-</sup>, and MyD88<sup>-/-</sup> had reduced CD40 and/or STING protein levels after <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulations with iRBC or <italic>in vivo</italic> N67 infection. These data support the involvement of TLR3 and TLR4 in CD40/STING expressions, although we still do not understand how TLR4 KO affects CD40/STING/IFN-β expression. TLR2 and to a lesser extent TLR4 were shown to mediate <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> GPI recognition and signaling leading to proinflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref061">61</xref>]. Patients with severe and mild malaria also showed increased surface expression of TLR2 and TLR4 on CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes and cDCs and decreased intracellular expression of TLR9 on pDCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref062">62</xref>]. However, these reported TLR signaling pathways may or may not lead to increased expression of CD40, STING, and IFN-I. TLR9 recognizes unmethylated CpG dinucleotides and signals mostly through the MyD88/NFκB pathway. TLR9 was reported to play an important role in the regulation and development of protective immunity to malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref064">64</xref>]. Although our data showed that stimulation of TLR9 only slightly increased CD40 expression in 293T cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, and we did not have TLR9<sup>-/-</sup> mice to confirm the role of CD40 expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, the effects of MyD88 KO on CD40/STING expression in the infected splenic DCs suggested a minor role of TLR9 in parasite DNA recognition and CD40 expression. Parasite DNA can be converted into 5’ppp-RNA and recognized by cytosolic RNA sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref008">8</xref>]. An unknown DNA sensor was reported to recognize AT-rich parasite DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref007">7</xref>]. This receptor could be the recently identified cGAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref065">65</xref>] or an additional unknown receptor that may stimulate CD40 expression. Additional investigations are necessary to identify parasite DNA receptor(s) that can stimulate CD40/STING expression during malaria infection.</p>
<p>Importantly, we also showed that iRBCs and parasite-derived materials including nucleic acids and possibly GPI could also increase CD40 levels and/or luciferase signals driven by ISRE promoter, although potential DNA contamination in GPI preparations might contribute to the observed activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref064">64</xref>]. Furthermore, there were good correlations between CD40/STING protein levels and ISRE driven luciferase signals after poly(I:C), LPS, and iRBC stimulations, indicating a causative effect of CD40/STING protein levels and IFN-I/ISG responses. These data suggest that these parasite molecules can first activate CD40 expression through TLR/TRIF and other signaling pathways, leading to increased STING and IFN-I expression. Although the observations of changes in CD40 expression after LPS and iRBC stimulations or TLR4 KO suggested potential involvement of TLR4 (maybe through TLR4/TRAM/TRIF/IRF3 signaling) in CD40 expression, we are not sure of the specific parasite ligands for TLR4. Parasite GPI could be a potential TLR2/4 ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref061">61</xref>]. Interestingly, we also showed that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> GPI could stimulate low level, but significant, ISRE derived luciferase activity in RAW Lucia cell, although we could detect a small difference in CD40 protein level only at the 1 μM GPI group (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005930.g007">Fig 7J</xref></bold>). The change in luciferase signal at the 0.1 μM GPI group was very small, and Western blot might not be sensitive enough to detect the small difference in protein band intensity. The luciferase signals could also be produced by pathways other than CD40/STING signaling. Our data also suggest that parasite nucleic acids can act as TLR3 ligands because TLR3 KO significantly affects CD40 and STING protein levels after parasite DNA/RNA stimulations.</p>
<p>Based on the observations in this study, we can construct some preliminary signaling pathways for the elevated IFN-I response mediated by the interaction of CD40 and STING (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005930.s008">S8 Fig</xref></bold>) during early malaria infection, at least for the N67/C57BL/6 model. First, phagocytosis of iRBCs releases parasite materials such as nucleic acids and possibly lipids/GPI that are recognized by TLRs (2, 3 and 4), which triggers signaling mostly through TRIF dependent pathways leading to increased CD40 protein level. The increased CD40 expression leads to reduced STING ubiquitination and enhanced-levels of STING through binding additional TRAFs, particularly TRAF3. Increased CD40 expression binds more TRAF2 and TRAF3 and diminishes the pools of ‘free’ TRAF2 and TRAF3, leading to reduction of STING ubiquitination and degradation. Increased STING level can then greatly facilitate IFN-I production leading to suppression of early parasitemia and better host survival. In addition to demonstrating the protective role of CD40 in malaria infection by increased IFN-I production, this study reveals an unknown function of CD40 and TRAF2/TRAF3 in regulating STING and IFN-I expression and connects several innate signaling pathways involving TLRs, CD40, STING and TRAFs. Of course, this CD40/STING/IFN-I signaling pathway is just one of many protective mechanisms the host mounts against the parasites, and a complete resolution of malaria infection will require a well-balanced response involving a large number of molecules. Our observations may also provide important information for better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying many autoimmune diseases such as SLE and AGS that have been associated with STING-mediated high IFN-I levels and/or CD40-CD40L meditated T- and B-cell activation and inflammation. Our data suggest an alternative mechanism that CD40 may contribute to autoimmune diseases through elevated activities of STING and IFN-I production.</p>

<p>Approximately 2×10<sup>6</sup> RAW Lucia cells were plated into wells and grown to 70–80% confluence before addition of 2×10<sup>7</sup> iRBCs or RBCs, respectively. The cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and samples were collected for the flow cytometry after 1 h or 8 h incubation. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a BD FACSCalibur equipped with a 488 nm laser and three detection channels (FL-1: 515–550 nm, FL-2: 575–620 nm, FL-3: &gt;630 nm). Data acquisition and analysis was done using FlowJo. RAW Lucia cells were gated and plotted based on the forward scatter (FSC) versus side scatter (SSC). For staining of RBCs, 5×10<sup>7</sup> RBCs in 1 ml PBS were incubated with 5 μM CFDA-SE (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at RT for 5 min before washes and flow cytometry counting. Counts from phagocytosis of uninfected RBCs were excluded by gating the same areas from RBC controls.</p>

<title>Ubiquitination assay</title>
<p>For analysis of STING ubiquitination, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing STING with C-terminal Myc tag and CD40 or empty vector as well as HA-tagged WT ubiquitin or ubiquitin mutants containing only one lysine at specific position (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, K63). The mutant ubiquitin plasmids were obtained from Addgene originally deposited by Sandra Weller as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005930.ref072">72</xref>]. Twenty hrs after transfection, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc beads, followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-HA to detect ubiquitinated STING.</p>

<title>Schematic of molecular signaling pathways leading to high level of type I interferon and better host survival.</title>
<p>First, parasite nucleic acids (or GPI/lipids) activate TLRs after phagocytosis of infected red blood cells (iRBCs), leading to activation of TRIF dependent signaling pathways. Second, TLR signaling stimulates and increases CD40 expression. Third, increased CD40 expression leads to higher STING protein level, possibly through changes on STING ubiquitination and degradation that is influenced by levels of TRAF2/3. Fourth, higher STING level greatly increases IFN-I production during early infection. Finally, higher levels of IFN-I suppresses day 4 parasitemia and enhances host survival. This CD40/STING mediated enhanced IFN-I response may also play a role in some autoimmune disorders. Note that the high level of IFN-I triggers many negative regulators that quickly suppress the production of IFN-I.</p>
