<abstract>
<p>The type I interferon (IFN) response is a crucial innate immune signalling pathway required for defense against viral infection. Accordingly, the great majority of mammalian viruses possess means to inhibit this important host immune response. Here we show that vaccinia virus (VACV) strain Western Reserve protein C6, is a dual function protein that inhibits the cellular response to type I IFNs in addition to its published function as an inhibitor of IRF-3 activation, thereby restricting type I IFN production from infected cells. Ectopic expression of C6 inhibits the induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in response to IFNα treatment at both the mRNA and protein level. C6 inhibits the IFNα-induced Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling pathway at a late stage, downstream of STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and binding of the interferon stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex to the interferon stimulated response element (ISRE). Mechanistically, C6 associates with the transactivation domain of STAT2 and this might explain how C6 inhibits the type I IFN signalling very late in the pathway. During virus infection C6 reduces ISRE-dependent gene expression despite the presence of the viral protein phosphatase VH1 that dephosphorylates STAT1 and STAT2. The ability of a cytoplasmic replicating virus to dampen the immune response within the nucleus, and the ability of viral immunomodulators such as C6 to inhibit multiple stages of the innate immune response by distinct mechanisms, emphasizes the intricacies of host-pathogen interactions and viral immune evasion.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In response to a viral infection, infected host cells mount an early, innate immune response to limit viral replication and spread. Type I interferons (IFNs) are produced by a cell when a viral infection is detected and are a crucial aspect of this early immune response. IFNs are released from the infected cell and can act on the infected cell itself or neighbouring cells to initiate a signalling pathway that results in the production of hundreds of anti-viral proteins. In this work we investigated a vaccinia virus protein called C6, a known inhibitor of type I IFN production. Here we show that C6 also inhibits signalling initiated in response to type I IFNs, therefore providing a dual defence against this essential immune response. The results show that, unlike the majority of viral inhibitors of IFN signalling, C6 inhibits the signalling pathway at a late stage once the proteins required for IFN-stimulated gene transcription have reached the nucleus and bound to the DNA. This work illustrates the complex relationship between infecting viruses and the host immune response and further investigation of the mechanism by which C6 inhibits this important immune pathway will likely increase our knowledge of the pathway itself.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The innate immune response is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Interferons (IFNs) are one of the key players in this early response to infection and are particularly important to protect against viruses, as can be seen by the increased susceptibility of IFNα/β receptor (IFNAR) knock out mice to viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref001">1</xref>]. There are two main branches to the IFN response; their production and the signalling initiated in response to the binding of secreted IFNs to their receptors at the cell surface.</p>
<p>Type I IFNs, which include IFNβ, several IFNα variants and other tissue or species-specific members, are produced directly in response to virus detection by cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Upon recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as viral DNA or RNA, PRRs activate several signalling pathways many of which converge on the kinases TANK-binding kinase (TBK1) and IκB kinase-ε (IKKε). These kinases, in complex with adaptor proteins such as TANK, NAK-associated protein 1 (NAP1) or similar to NAP1 TBK1 adaptor (SINTBAD), phosphorylate the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). Once phosphorylated, IRF-3 dimerises and translocates into the nucleus and, in combination with other transcription factors, drives transcription from promoters containing cognate binding sites, including the IFNβ promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Once produced and secreted from cells, type I IFNs can act in a paracrine or autocrine fashion by binding to the IFNAR, which is composed of the two subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. The binding of type I IFN to the receptor complex leads to the cross activation of the two Janus protein kinases, Tyk2 and Jak1 that are bound to the cytoplasmic domains of the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, respectively. Once activated these kinases phosphorylate the transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2. These phosphorylated proteins then heterodimerise and bind to IRF-9 to form the IFN stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) transcriptional activator complex. This tripartite complex translocates into the nucleus where it binds to IFN stimulated response elements (ISREs) found in the promoter of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) and induces their transcription. The type I IFN signalling pathway and its regulation is reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>The importance of the IFN response for protection against viral infections is illustrated by the array of mechanisms and proteins used by viruses to evade and inhibit these cellular pathways, reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref004">4</xref>]. Vaccinia virus (VACV) is a well-studied member of the <italic>Poxviridae</italic> and was the vaccine used in the eradication of smallpox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref005">5</xref>]. It is a large DNA virus, with approximately 200 genes, that replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref006">6</xref>]. Between one third and one half of these 200 genes have been shown to have immunomodulatory or immunoevasive roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Many of these immunomodulatory proteins are able to inhibit type I IFN production, either through inhibition of the NF-κB pathway, for example VACV proteins B14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref009">9</xref>] and A49 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref010">10</xref>], or through inhibition of the IRF-3 signalling pathway, as with VACV proteins A46 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref011">11</xref>] and K7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref012">12</xref>]. In contrast, very few inhibitors have been identified that act post-IFN production. To date two VACV proteins are known to inhibit IFN signalling after type I IFN has been secreted from cells. B18 is a secreted VACV protein that binds type I IFN in solution and on the surface of cells and prevents its interaction with the IFNAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref015">15</xref>] and VH1 is a virally-encoded phosphatase that is packaged within virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref016">16</xref>] and dephosphorylates both STAT1 and STAT2, therefore acting as an intracellular inhibitor of JAK/STAT signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>C6 is a predicted member of the VACV Bcl2-like protein family, a family of 10 proteins whose previously studied members have various innate immune inhibitory functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref025">25</xref>]. It is expressed early during infection and its deletion attenuates the virus in both intranasal and intradermal models of infection in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref026">26</xref>]. Despite being attenuated, VACV strains engineered to lack C6 showed enhanced immunogenicity in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref028">28</xref>]. Previously, C6 was shown to bind to the TBK1/IKKε adaptor proteins, SINTBAD, NAP1 and TANK, and prevents the TBK1/IKKε-dependent activation of IRF-3 and therefore inhibits the induction of type I IFNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref026">26</xref>]. Given many VACV proteins have been shown to have multiple functions, for example N1 that inhibits both NF-κB signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref029">29</xref>] and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref030">30</xref>], and the observation that the hitherto only known function of C6 occurs in the cytoplasm of infected cells despite C6 being present in the nucleus and cytoplasm, we investigated whether C6 may have additional immunomodulatory functions.</p>
<p>In this study, VACV protein C6 is shown to be a dual function protein that inhibits type I IFN signalling as well as type I IFN production. Data presented show that the inhibition of IFNα-induced JAK/STAT signalling occurs at a late stage in the pathway, downstream of STAT phosphorylation, heterodimerisation, and nuclear translocation and downstream of ISGF3 binding to the ISRE, thus indicating an inhibitory function of C6 at or after formation of the transcriptional complex. Furthermore, C6 is shown to associate with the transcriptional activating domain (TAD) of STAT2, providing a plausible mechanism by which this viral protein could disrupt transcriptional complex formation. Interestingly, C6 was able to inhibit the transcriptional induction of all but one of the IFNα-dependent genes tested. This indicates that the step(s) inhibited by C6 downstream of ISGF3-ISRE interaction is likely to be conserved for a large number of ISGs, rather than a gene-specific transcriptional requirement. To our knowledge, this additional function of C6 makes C6 the first nuclear inhibitor of the IFN response encoded by the cytoplasmic-replicating DNA virus, VACV. The ability of VACV, a virus whose replication cycle takes place entirely within the cytoplasm of infected cells, to extend its influence into the host cell nucleus to inhibit crucial innate immune signalling pathways, highlights the complexity of virus-host interactions.</p>

<title>C6 inhibits type I IFN signalling</title>
<p>Previously, C6 was characterised as an inhibitor of IFNβ production through inhibition of the IRF-3/7 signalling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref026">26</xref>]. However, many viral proteins are known to have multiple functions. To determine whether C6 was able to also inhibit signalling downstream of type I IFNs, its effect on the expression of an ISRE-dependent luciferase reporter gene (ISRE-luciferase) was assessed. HeLa and HEK293T cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for ISRE-luciferase and V5- or TAP- tagged C6 or control proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005955.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Cells were then stimulated with IFNα for 8 h and the expression of luciferase was measured by luminescence. Treatment of HEK293T and HeLa cells with IFNα led to an induction of luciferase expression and in both cell types this induction was significantly inhibited by the co-expression of either TAP-C6 (p&lt;0.0001 and p&lt;0.01 respectively) or C6-V5 (p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.001 respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). As expected the positive controls Nipah Virus V protein (NiV-V) and Parainfluenza virus 5 V protein (PiV5-V) that are known to inhibit IFN signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref032">32</xref>] also inhibited IFNα-induced luciferase expression, whilst expression of GFP or VACV protein B14 had no inhibitory effect.</p>

</fig>
<p>To confirm the ability of C6 to inhibit type I IFN signalling, the effect of C6 on the induced transcription of endogenous ISGs was assessed next. HeLa cells stably expressing GFP alone (EV) or GFP in combination with V5 tagged- C6, PiV5-V or B14 were stimulated with IFNα for 8 h. RNA was extracted from these cells and used for qPCR analysis of ISG mRNA expression. IFNα treatment of cells resulted in induction of the well-characterised ISGs tested, including interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1), IFIT3 and MxA. The presence of C6 significantly inhibited the induction of gene expression when compared to both the EV and B14 controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Once again PiV5-V expression also inhibited the induction of ISG expression as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, these stably transduced cells were used to confirm the ability of C6 to inhibit IFNα-induced gene expression at the protein level using flow cytometry analysis of IFIT1 expression. Cells were stimulated with IFNα for 8 h and then fixed, permeabilised and stained with an anti-IFIT1 antibody. Stained cells were analysed by flow cytometry to assess for IFIT1 protein expression. Once again treatment of EV transduced cells with IFNα resulted in an induction of IFIT1 expression, which was significantly inhibited by expression of C6 or the positive control, PiV5-V (p&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). In contrast, expression of B14 had no effect on IFIT1 expression. Together these data show that C6 inhibits IFNα mediated gene expression at both the mRNA and protein level.</p>

<title>The ability of C6 to inhibit signalling downstream of IFNα treatment, is not a result of its ability to inhibit TBK1/IKKε function</title>
<p>The IRF-3 signalling pathway is initiated in response to detection of viral RNA, DNA or proteins by PRRs in the cell and leads to the activation of the kinases TBK1 and IKKε. These kinases then phosphorylate IRF-3 causing its translocation into the nucleus from where it drives transcriptional activation of a number of target genes including IFNβ. C6 inhibits IRF-3 signalling at the level of TBK1 and IKKε, preventing the nuclear translocation of IRF-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref026">26</xref>]. Several studies have described potential crosstalk between the IRF-3 and JAK/STAT signalling pathways, which together constitute the type I IFN response. In addition, IRF-3 is known to cause the transcriptional activation of a subset of ISRE containing gene promoters directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref033">33</xref>] and an additional phosphorylation event on STAT1 by IKKε is required for the full induction of approximately 30% of IFNα-responsive ISGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>To rule out that the inhibitory effect of C6 on type I IFN signalling was an indirect consequence of its ability to interfere with TBK1 and IKKε function, and that this inhibitory activity was instead a novel function for C6, the effect of a TBK1/IKKε specific inhibitor, BX795, on the ISRE-dependent reporter gene assay was assessed. Cells transfected with the ISRE-luciferase reporter were treated for 3 h with BX795 before stimulation with IFNα for a further 6 h in the continued presence of BX795. BX795 treatment had no inhibitory effect on the IFNα-dependent induction of firefly luciferase in the cells tested, when compared to a carrier (dimethyl sulphoxide, DMSO)-treated control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005955.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). To confirm the effectiveness and specificity of BX795 in this assay, BX795 treatment was also used in conjunction with firefly luciferase under the control of promoters responsive to the IRF-3 and NF-κB signalling pathways. Cells transfected with these luciferase reporters were stimulated with polyI:C and IL-1β respectively. Whilst treatment with BX795 had no effect on IL-1β-induced activation of the NFκB reporter gene, the induction of the IRF-3-responsive promoter by poly I:C was significantly reduced (p&lt;0.001), indicating that the inhibitor was effective at the doses used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005955.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). These data indicate that inhibition of TBK1 and IKKε does not cause the inhibition of ISRE-dependent gene expression that is seen in the presence of C6, implying that this is instead a novel function of C6.</p>

<p>Following phosphorylation, STAT1 and STAT2 heterodimerise and bind to IRF9 to form the ISGF3 complex. This complex then translocates into the nucleus where it drives expression of genes with an ISRE in their promoter. To determine whether C6 prevents the dimerisation of STAT1 and STAT2, an immunoprecipitation of STAT1 from IFNα-stimulated cells was performed in cells transiently transfected with C6 or N1, a VACV Bcl-2-like protein that does not inhibit IFNα signalling. Immunoblot analysis showed that following IFNα stimulation an increased amount of STAT2 was found associated with STAT1. However, C6 did not alter the amount of STAT2 bound to STAT1 either before or after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p>

<title>C6 inhibits IFNα signalling at a step downstream of ISGF3 complex nuclear translocation</title>
<p>Following its formation, the ISGF3 complex translocates into the nucleus. To assess whether this nuclear translocation was inhibited by C6 the localization of STAT1 and STAT2 before and after IFNα stimulation was assessed by confocal microscopy. HeLa cells stably expressing GFP alone (EV) or in combination with V5-tagged C6 or PiV5-V were stimulated with 500 U/ml IFNα for 1 h. Cells were then fixed, permeabilised and stained for endogenous STAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) or STAT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

<p>To obtain additional evidence that the inhibitory effect of C6 on IFNα signalling is downstream of ISGF3 complex formation, a plasmid encoding IRF-9 fused to the C-terminal region (amino acids 747–851) of the transcriptional activation domain of STAT2 (referred to as IRF9-S2C) was utilised. Previously, this fusion protein, which overcomes the need for ISGF3 complex formation, has been shown to act as a constitutively active ISGF3-like transcriptional activator in the absence of IFN stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref035">35</xref>]. When a plasmid encoding IRF9-S2C was co-transfected into HEK293T cells along with the ISRE-luciferase reporter gene, a large increase in firefly luciferase expression was observed in cells expressing IRF9-S2C relative to those transfected with empty vector (EV) only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g006">Fig 6</xref>, columns 1 and 2). Interestingly, when co-transfected into cells, C6 inhibited IRF9-S2C-driven ISRE reporter activity significantly (p&lt;0.0001), whereas, neither PiV5-V protein nor NiV-V protein showed any inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g006">Fig 6</xref>).

This showed that the interaction between C6 and STAT2 did not require prior stimulation with IFN.</p>
<p>To confirm the interaction between C6 and STAT2 and to ascertain whether it occurs at endogenous protein levels and during viral infection, HEK293T cells were infected with VACVs expressing TAP-tagged C6 or N1 under the natural promoters for these genes.

Once again C6 associated with STAT2 and not STAT1, whilst N1 did not associate with either protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g008">Fig 8C</xref>), confirming the specific interaction between STAT2 and C6 at endogenous protein levels during viral infection.</p>
<p>As C6 inhibits IFNα signalling initiated by IRF9-S2C expression, its ability to interact with this fusion protein, which contains only the C-terminal 104 aa of the STAT2 transactivation domain, was assessed. To this end, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with either IRF9-S2C or HA-IRF-9 and C6-TAP or N1-TAP.

<title>C6 contributes to inhibition of ISRE-dependent gene expression during VACV infection</title>
<p>Finally, the biological importance of C6 for inhibition of the JAK-STAT pathway leading to activation of the ISRE promoter was assessed during VACV infection. The activity of C6 in blocking this pathway was likely to be masked to some degree during infection by the presence of the virus phosphatase VH1, which dephosphorylates STAT1 and STAT2 and is delivered into cells by the invading virion immediately after infection. Therefore, two methods were used to assess if C6 contributed to the inhibition of the JAK-STAT pathway during infection. One method was simply to transfect the ISRE-luciferase reporter plasmid into cells 16 h before the cells were infected with either wt VACV or the vΔC6 mutant and then measure ISRE-luciferase at different times p.i. Preliminary experiments established that infection of cells at 5 PFU/cell for 5 h was optimal before luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates. Under these conditions, infection by vΔC6 induced significantly greater luciferase activity than did wt VACV. Immunoblotting for VACV protein D8 showed that the virus infections were equivalent and immunoblotting for GAPDH showed equal loading of samples. This experiment was conducted using either crude or purified virus preparations (n = 4) and in each case a significant difference between the viruses was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g009">Fig 9A</xref>).</p>

<p>The second method exploited the ability of the IRF9-S2C protein to activate ISRE promoter within the nucleus and downstream of the position at which the VH1 phosphatase mediates inhibition of the JAK-STAT pathway. Optimisation experiments to determine the amount of the IRF9-S2C plasmid to transfect and the length of time after transfection prior to virus infection showed that this potent inducer of ISRE-dependent gene expression was best only transfected a few hours before infection because overnight transfection induced very high levels of luciferase activity. Transfection of the IRF9-S2C plasmid for 4 h induced a modest 2-fold induction in luciferase activity and this was increased further by virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). However, following virus infection for 5 h, wt VACV induced lower levels of luciferase than vΔC6, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g009">Fig 9A</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previously, C6 was identified as a VACV immunomodulator and virulence factor and was shown to inhibit the induction of type I IFNs through inhibition of the IRF-3/7 signalling pathway at the level of the TBK1/IKKε kinase complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref026">26</xref>]. This study identifies a second function for VACV protein C6 as an inhibitor of the cellular response to type I IFN. Data presented demonstrate that C6 inhibits IFNα-induced expression of ISGs at both the mRNA and protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The inability of a pharmacological inhibitor of TBK1/IKKε to reduce IFNα-induced reporter gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005955.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) indicates that inhibition of this kinase complex by C6 is unlikely to explain the ability of C6 to also inhibit the cellular response to IFNα. Therefore, to elucidate the mechanism by which C6 has its inhibitory effect on this second pathway, the IFNα-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2 were examined and C6 was found to have no effect on these early events of this signalling pathway (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g005">5</xref>). Furthermore, both endogenous STAT2 and a constitutively active ISGF3 mimic, IRF-9-S2C, were still able to bind to the ISRE in the presence of C6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g007">Fig 7</xref>), indicating C6 exerts its inhibitory effect after ISGF3 binding to the ISRE. Interestingly, C6 interacts with STAT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g008">Fig 8A–8C</xref>) and the transactivation domain (aa 747–851) of STAT2 fused to IRF-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g008">Fig 8D</xref>) but not with STAT1 or IRF-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). The STAT2 transactivation domain is known to be required for the recruitment of chromatin modifiers and transcriptional machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref037">37</xref>]. Therefore, the ability of C6 to interact specifically with this domain gives insight into how this viral protein may inhibit this crucial signalling pathway at such a late stage.</p>
<p>C6 is one of many VACV proteins that inhibit the IFN response, however, it is the first such protein known to inhibit both branches of the IFN response, inhibiting both IFNβ production and the cellular responses to type I IFN. C6 is also the first VACV protein identified to inhibit the response to type I IFN in the nucleus of infected cells; VACV inhibitors to date act early in the JAK/STAT signalling pathway, either extracellularly to prevent binding of secreted type I IFN to their receptor (B18) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref015">15</xref>], or in the cytoplasm of infected cells to dephosphorylate activated STAT1 and STAT2 (VH1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref018">18</xref>]. C6 instead acts at a very late stage in the pathway, after the ISGF3 complex has formed, translocated into the nucleus and bound to the ISRE. Despite this, its inhibitory action was evident on 6 out of 7 of the ISGs examined, suggesting that the protein or step it targets is required for the induction of many ISGs.</p>
<p>The requirement for many protein inhibitors of a single, albeit important, signalling pathway is not well understood. However, VACV shows a similar ‘belt and braces’ approach to other signalling pathways, for example the NF-κB pathway, for which it is currently known to possess 10 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref042">42</xref>]. These proteins are not completely redundant however, as they cause virus attenuation <italic>in vivo</italic> when deleted individually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref047">47</xref>]. Similarly, previous work has shown that deletion of C6 leads to an attenuated phenotype in both intradermal and intranasal models of VACV infection in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref026">26</xref>], despite the presence of other IFN-signalling inhibitors. The identification of a second function of C6 means that the observed attenuation of the C6 deletion virus cannot be attributed to a single function as yet, but highlights the importance of this immunomodulatory protein. Structure-based mutagenesis of C6 may enable the dissection of these different activities as was done for the related VACV protein N1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>The use of multiple proteins to inhibit a single pathway may be explained in many ways, such as the possibility of incomplete inhibition by any one protein, or the requirement for different immunomodulators in different cell types or infection stages. It could also be explained by possible crosstalk between innate immune signalling pathways meaning that inhibition of a pathway at a certain point could be overcome by activation of another communicating immune signalling pathway. However, the late stage at which C6 inhibits the type I IFN response would suggest that cross talk from other pathways would still be unable to activate ISGF3-driven ISG transcription in the presence of C6. The role of C6 in inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway during virus infection may be masked to some degree by the effect of VH1 that dephosphorylates STAT1 and STAT2 rapidly after infection. VH1 is an essential gene for VACV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref016">16</xref>], preventing its elimination by genetic manipulation. Nonetheless analysis of ISRE-driven gene expression early after infection with either wild type virus or a mutant virus lacking C6 showed a functional role for the C6 protein in diminishing ISRE-dependent gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005955.g009">Fig 9</xref>). The roles of VH1 and C6 are therefore complementary. VH1 is expressed late in infection and packaged into the virion, whereas C6 is an early VACV protein, expressed from approximately 2 h post infection. These differential expression patterns might explain the requirement of both inhibitors, perhaps with their relative importance differing over the life cycle of the virus.</p>
<p>The principal transcriptional activating complex responsible for type I IFN-induced gene expression, ISGF3, consists of three components, STAT1, STAT2 and IRF-9. In this complex, STAT2 provides a potent and essential transcriptional activation domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref048">48</xref>]. The mechanistic process by which ISGF3, likely through this C-terminal domain of STAT2, signals to and promotes transcription of ISGs by RNA polymerase II remains unclear. However, a number of cellular proteins known to have roles in transcription, such as components of the Mediator complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref049">49</xref>], or chromatin modification, including histone deacetylases (HDACs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref050">50</xref>], histone acetyltransferases (HATs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref051">51</xref>] and chromatin remodeling complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref055">55</xref>], have been identified as being essential for ISGF3-driven transcription. The precise mechanism by which C6 inhibits JAK/STAT signalling remains to be determined, however it is possible that the association of C6 with the STAT2-transactivation domain could prevent or alter the interactions of STAT2 with these or other cellular proteins required for ISG transcriptional induction. Indeed some such proteins have been shown to bind directly to the STAT2 transactivation domain, for example the HATs p300/CBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref051">51</xref>] and GCN5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref056">56</xref>]. In the future, further work is needed to assess the exact consequence of the C6-STAT2 TAD interaction.</p>
<p>The importance of the IFN-signalling pathway in preventing viral replication and spread dictates that the majority of mammalian viruses have one or multiple mechanisms of inhibiting the response of infected cells to type I IFN. There is an array of different mechanisms by which viral proteins inhibit JAK/STAT signalling, some of which are reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref004">4</xref>]. Many such mechanisms focus on inhibiting the early steps in the JAK/STAT signalling pathway, by degradation of either STAT1 or STAT2 as with PiV5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref032">32</xref>] and PiV2 V proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref057">57</xref>], respiratory syncytial virus NS1 and NS2 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref058">58</xref>] and dengue NS5 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref059">59</xref>], by inhibition of STAT phosphorylation as with Sendai virus C protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref060">60</xref>], or by cytoplasmic sequestration of the ISGF3 complex as with NiV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref031">31</xref>] and Hendra virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref061">61</xref>] V proteins.</p>
<p>Fewer viral proteins have been identified that inhibit the later stages of this signalling pathway, once the ISGF3 complex has reached the nucleus. The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IE1 protein interacts with STAT2 and inhibits the binding of STAT2 and promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), a protein that associates with STAT1, STAT2, and HDACs, to ISG promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref062">62</xref>]. Therefore, HCMV IE1 delivers its inhibitory action within the nucleus and via an interaction with STAT2, but again upstream of the inhibitory action of C6. Conversely, adenovirus E1A protein has its inhibitory effect, like C6, downstream of ISGF3- promoter binding but does so through interacting with and preventing the functioning of HATs and histone ubiquitylating complexes required for full ISG transcriptional activation and not through a direct interaction with STAT2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref063">63</xref>]. Similarly, influenza A virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) inhibits the cellular response to type I IFNs in the nucleus through interaction with a complex involved in transcriptional elongation, hPAF1C and once again not by a direct interaction with STAT2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref064">64</xref>]. Interestingly, NS1 inhibits type I IFN production through binding dsRNA produced by the virus and thus preventing its detection by PRRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref065">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005955.ref067">67</xref>]. NS1 and C6 have therefore both evolved to inhibit both type I IFN production and type I IFN-induced signalling but by distinct mechanisms in each pathway.</p>
<p>To our knowledge VACV protein C6 is the first viral protein shown to both associate with the STAT2 transactivation domain and inhibit IFNα-dependent ISG induction after ISGF3 binding to the ISRE. The sequence of events that occur following ISGF3 binding to the ISRE is poorly understood and further elucidating the mechanism by which C6 inhibits this signalling pathway in the nucleus may enhance our knowledge of the late stages of the type I IFN signalling pathway. Lastly, it is notable that although VACV is a cytoplasmic DNA virus, it has evolved mechanisms to inhibit IFN production or activity within both the cytoplasm and the nucleus and indeed outside the infected cell by the expression of soluble type I and type II IFN binding proteins.</p>
