<abstract>
<p>Hendra and Nipah viruses (family <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>, genus <italic>Henipavirus</italic>) are bat-borne viruses that cause fatal disease in humans and a range of other mammalian species. Gaining a deeper understanding of host pathways exploited by henipaviruses for infection may identify targets for new anti-viral therapies. Here we have performed genome-wide high-throughput agonist and antagonist screens at biosafety level 4 to identify host-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) impacting henipavirus infection in human cells. Members of the miR-181 and miR-17~93 families strongly promoted Hendra virus infection. miR-181 also promoted Nipah virus infection, but did not affect infection by paramyxoviruses from other genera, indicating specificity in the virus-host interaction. Infection promotion was primarily mediated via the ability of miR-181 to significantly enhance henipavirus-induced membrane fusion. Cell signalling receptors of ephrins, namely EphA5 and EphA7, were identified as novel negative regulators of henipavirus fusion. The expression of these receptors, as well as EphB4, were suppressed by miR-181 overexpression, suggesting that simultaneous inhibition of several Ephs by the miRNA contributes to enhanced infection and fusion. Immune-responsive miR-181 levels was also up-regulated in the biofluids of ferrets and horses infected with Hendra virus, suggesting that the host innate immune response may promote henipavirus spread and exacerbate disease severity. This study is the first genome-wide screen of miRNAs influencing infection by a clinically significant mononegavirus and nominates select miRNAs as targets for future anti-viral therapy development.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The henipaviruses Hendra and Nipah are bat-borne paramyxoviruses that are highly pathogenic in humans. Until recently the constraints of working at biosafety level 4 had hindered the large scale study of host factors associated with henipavirus infection. MicroRNAs are a class of single-stranded non-coding RNAs that regulate biological processes in eukaryotes. An emerging body of evidence suggests that host microRNAs may favour infection of vertebrate RNA viruses. We have performed high-throughput agonist and antagonist screens at biosafety level 4 to identify host-encoded microRNAs impacting henipavirus infection in human cells. Members of the miR-181 and miR-17~93 families strongly promoted Hendra virus infection and appear to suppress multiple antiviral host molecules. Infection promotion is primarily mediated via the ability of miR-181 to repress Eph receptors that negatively regulate henipavirus glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion. This study is the first large-scale screen of host-encoded microRNAs influencing infection by a clinically significant mononegavirus, and of a BSL-4 virus, and supports the emerging notion that host miRNAs can play a role in supporting infection of RNA viruses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are highly pathogenic zoonotic paramyxoviruses belonging to the genus <italic>Henipavirus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref001">1</xref>]. First isolated in Australia in 1994, HeV disease has caused seven clinically confirmed human cases with four fatalities. NiV initially appeared in Malaysia in 1998–1999, resulting in 105 human fatalities. Since 2001, recurring outbreaks of NiV have been reported in South Asia, resulting in more than 211 deaths and an average case-fatality rate of approximately 75% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref003">3</xref>]. Both bat-borne henipaviruses cause severe respiratory illness and encephalitis in humans, however there is a lack of therapies and vaccines. With high fatality rates emphasising the need for effective anti-viral strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref006">6</xref>], a better understanding of henipavirus biology is required.</p>
<p>Viruses may co-opt or alter a range of host cell processes that optimise replicative efficiency. One such process is the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref007">7</xref>]. Conventionally, in chordates RNAi involves the base-pairing of small non-coding microRNA (miRNA) molecules in a multi-protein complex to complementary mRNA sequences, often resulting in post-transcriptional silencing of host gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref008">8</xref>]. Some DNA viruses (i.e. herpesviruses) in particular, which also encode their own viral miRNAs, are known to subvert this fundamental host process to promote infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref007">7</xref>]. For RNA viruses however, the pro-viral roles of host miRNAs remain poorly characterized. Up until recently, the general thought was that the multifaceted dependence of hepatitis C virus infection on hepatocyte-specific miR-122 is the exception, not the rule, for RNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>More recently, a few high profile studies have highlighted that the usurping of host miRNAs by RNA viruses might previously have been underappreciated. Trobaugh et al. showed that the alphavirus Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) utilizes host-derived miR-142-3p to define cell tropism and to suppress innate immunity, indirectly promoting neuropathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref011">11</xref>]. A comprehensive survey of 15 RNA viruses from 7 families identified miR-17 and let-7 binding to pestivirus 3’ UTR as critical for enhanced viral translation, RNA stability and virus production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref012">12</xref>]. The Argonaute protein, a key component of functional miRNA complexes, was also found to be associated with viral RNA of virtually all of the viruses assessed, including paramyxoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref012">12</xref>]. These Argonaute-viral RNA interactions also often exhibit preferential clustering on the viral subgenomes, implying specificities in the miRNA targeting. Enterovirus infection induces host miR-141 expression, which is then co-opted by the virus to silence cellular translation initiation factor eIF4E, resulting in host translational shutoff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref013">13</xref>]. One emerging concept from such studies is the sequestration or “sponging” of anti-viral host miRNAs by genomes of some RNA viruses to derepress cellular transcripts that might enhance infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref012">12</xref>]. These reports suggest that RNA viruses can adopt host miRNAs for their own utility via a diversity of mechanisms, and that this aspect of virus-host interactions is currently understudied.</p>
<p>With technological advancements in high-throughput techniques making the comprehensive study of both physical and genetic virus-host interactions a possibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref005">5</xref>], we have started executing functional genomics screens using fully infectious biosafety level 4 agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref014">14</xref>]. Despite the power of functional genomics as a research tool, thus far only two comprehensive RNAi screens investigating the contributions of miRNAs to pathogenesis of RNA viruses have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref016">16</xref>]. No such study has been done for BSL-4 viruses and for any of the medically relevant mononegaviruses, such as paramyxoviruses or filoviruses. In light of recent studies underscoring the potential significance of miRNAs for RNA virus replication as well as the therapeutic promise of miRNA antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref017">17</xref>], we sought to address this gap in our knowledge of virus-host interplay.</p>
<p>Here we present findings from two high-throughput genome-wide screens, conducted at BSL-4, of host-encoded miRNAs associated with HeV infection. The screens, in addition to subsequent validation work, demonstrate a key role for miR-181 family members in regulating henipavirus syncytia formation and infection, and suggest several host miRNAs, including miR-17~93, as potential candidates for novel therapeutic targets.</p>

<title>High biocontainment genome-wide analysis of host-encoded miRNAs modulating henipavirus infection</title>
<p>To identify host-encoded miRNAs that regulate HeV infection, we performed two complementary high-throughput screens at BSL-4 that targeted 834 human host-encoded miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). This first involved the reverse transfection of HeLa cells with a library of 1,239 synthetic miRNA agonists (i.e. mimics), which are double-stranded RNA molecules that functionally imitate native miRNAs, to over-express each of 834 miRNAs in a 384-well plate format. In a concurrent screen silencing each of the 834 miRNAs, HeLa cells were transfected with a library consisting of 1,225 antagonists (i.e. inhibitors), which are single-stranded RNA molecules that bind and sequester native mature miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref018">18</xref>]. After library preparation and transfection were performed under BSL-2 conditions, one set of the daughter plates for each screen was moved to BSL-4 (red box, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). 72 h after transfection, these cells were infected with a recombinant HeV that expresses the firefly luciferase reporter gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref019">19</xref>]. After 24 h, a luminometer was used to measure luciferase expression of the infected cells for both screens at BSL-4. The impact that each miRNA agonist or antagonist had on reporter expression was normalized to values from mock-transfected cells, and then expressed in terms of a robust Z-score, which is a commonly used measure of hit identification for RNAi screens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref021">21</xref>]. Z-scores of 2 or greater indicate an increase in infection relative to control, whereas Z-scores of -2 or lower indicate a decrease in infection.</p>

<p>(A) Schematic of optimized protocol for performing functional RNAi screens with an infectious BSL-4 virus. Two sets of daughter plates were generated from library plates consisting of 1,239 miRNA agonists (grey plates) and 1,225 antagonists (black plates). HeLa cells were added to both plate sets for reverse transfection of the miRNA agonists and antagonists. 72 h post transfection, one set of plates were processed at BSL-2 for cell viability analysis by DAPI staining. The other set was then transferred into BSL-4 (red box), infected with luciferase-expressing HeV, and lysed for luminescence reading at 24 hours post-infection (h.p.i.) in BSL-4. (B and C) Results from the miRNA agonist (B) and antagonist (C) screens, with miRNAs ranked using a robust Z-score approach, from lowest (decreased virus infection) to highest (increased virus infection). Dotted horizontal lines represent the threshold of hit identification (Z ≥ 2 or ≤ -2). The number of miRNA hits above this threshold is shown.

Cells that were transfected with a siRNA targeting the PLK1 gene served as a positive control for cell death. 54 of the agonists and none of the antagonists caused significant cell death relative to mock-transfected cells (≥70% cut-off) and were thus subsequently eliminated from the robust Z-score analysis and final hit list generation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s001">S1 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s002">S2 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>The agonist and antagonist screens identified 35 and 61 miRNAs respectively that significantly promoted HeV infection, and 19 and 83 miRNAs respectively, that significantly inhibited virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s001">S1 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s002">S2 Table</xref>). Eight miRNAs exhibited pro-viral characteristics in both agonist and antagonist screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), including all four members of the miR-181 family. Conversely, both screens identified miR-532 as a miRNA that inhibits infection. In regards to miRNAs that promote virus infection, screen results from two miRNA families were notable. All four members of the miR-181 family significantly promoted HeV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). These miRNAs all share the same seed sequence (ACAUUC), implying significant congruency in function(s). The scale of the pro-viral impacts of miR-181 members is especially remarkable if we compare their effects to that of miR-146a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), which we previously validated as pro-viral for HeV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref022">22</xref>]. In addition to miR-181, most members of the miR-17~93 family were pro-viral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The seed sequence of the miRNAs in this family (AAAGUG) is distinct from that of miR-181.</p>

<title>Verified miR-181 and miR-17~93 target genes predominantly inhibit henipavirus infection</title>
<p>MiRNAs regulate gene expression by binding to complementary sequences typically located in the 3’ untranslated region (3’ UTR) of the mRNA target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref026">26</xref>]. Depending on the degree of complementarity, this generally results in the suppression or degradation of target mRNA, thereby preventing encoded proteins from being translated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref026">26</xref>]. As each miRNA can act as a suppressor of many target genes, we hypothesized that miR-181 and miR-17~93 families promoted henipavirus infection by suppressing multiple anti-viral host genes. To test this hypothesis, we firstly mined the miRTarbase database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref027">27</xref>] to identify all experimentally-validated target genes for miR-181 and miR17~93 families. Next, the effects of these genes on HeV infection, as represented in robust Z-scores, were cross-referenced from results of our published genome-wide siRNA screen that identified pro- and anti-viral host genes for henipaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref014">14</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s003">S3 Table</xref>). This analysis demonstrates that for both miRNA families these genes were more likely to be anti-viral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). For instance, the ratio of anti-viral to pro-viral hits for validated miR-181 targets was 2.2 to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In contrast, this ratio for all unbiased gene hits in the entire screen was 1 to 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref014">14</xref>]. Collectively, these data suggest that the net outcome of miR-181 or miR17~93 expression is a cellular microenvironment that is more conducive for henipavirus infection. The results also indicate a reasonable level of congruency between our miRNA and siRNA gene screen datasets.</p>
<p>We also sought to determine whether miR-181 preferentially regulates the expression of host proteins localized in a particular subcellular compartment. To this end, the list of experimentally-validated miR-181 targets (n = 78 genes) was obtained from miRTarBase was subjected to annotation enrichment analysis using the DAVID web service. Functional annotation clustering analysis was performed using default settings (Fisher’s exact test to calculate p-values, followed by multiple testing correction using the Benjamini method). This analysis demonstrated an enrichment of miR-181 target genes associated with the nucleoplasm (<italic>p</italic> = 4.6e-5), while proteins associated with plasma membrane localization were not significantly enriched (<italic>p</italic> = 0.7).</p>

<p>All four members of the miR-181 family exhibited consistent pro-viral phenotypes in both the agonist and antagonist screens (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g001">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g002">2A</xref>). We thus decided to investigate the role of this miRNA family in henipavirus infection further. Firstly, since the screens were performed using a recombinant reporter HeV, we validated the observations using a wild-type virus. Screen results suggested that miR-181d is one of the most pro-viral members of the family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s001">S1 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s002">S2 Table</xref>), hence miR-181d was chosen as a representative member of the miR-181 family in the majority of subsequent experiments.</p>
<p>HeLa cells were transfected with miR-181d-specific agonists to effectively over-express miR-181d. Non-targeting miRNA agonists (miNEG), or transfection reagent devoid of agonist (mock), were also included as negative controls. At 72 h post-transfection, cells were infected with wild-type HeV and incubated for 24 h. The cell supernatants were then collected and applied to a TCID<sub>50</sub> assay to quantify infectious virus titre. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, the results showed a 350% increase in HeV infectious titres in cells transfected with miR-181d agonists compared to control miRNA agonists.</p>

Transfected cells were infected with HeV for 24 h, before being fixed and stained with fluorescently labelled antibodies. The HeV phosphoprotein (P) was selected for analysis due to its high protein expression levels during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref029">29</xref>].

In support of the quantitative data, both an increase in HeV P protein concentration and also syncytia formation (characteristic of paramyxovirus infection) could be visually observed by fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).</p>

<title>Viral RNA synthesis is augmented by miR-181 over-expression</title>
<p>In order to narrow down the possible mechanisms by which miR-181 promotes henipavirus infection, we next sought to delineate the part of the virus life cycle at which miR-181 promotes infection. We first looked at whether viral RNA synthesis was induced by miR-181 during a single round of HeV infection. Cells were transfected with miR-181 agonists, and then infected with a high MOI (5) of HeV. At 0, 12 and 24 h post-infection (h.p.i.), cell lysates were harvested, and intracellular viral RNA levels were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. Our previous studies have shown that in HeLa cells the first cycle of HeV infection is completed by 24 h but not at 12 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref014">14</xref>]. Nonetheless, here cell supernatants were also collected and virus titres from all time-points were determined by TCID<sub>50</sub> assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s005">S1 Fig</xref>). Congruent to our previous observations, production of progeny virions was only detected at 24 h.p.i.</p>
<p>At 12 h.p.i., a four-log<sub>10</sub> increase in viral RNA above inocula levels was observed in cells transfected with either miNEG or siNEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). This increase could be suppressed by siRNA-mediated knockdown of the entry receptor for HeV, ephrin-B2. In contrast, pre-treatment of cells with miR-181d agonists increased the amount of HeV RNA by approximately 3-fold relative to cells treated with control agonist. Thus, miR-181 promotes henipavirus infection at, or prior to, the step of viral RNA synthesis. Similar trends in viral RNA levels amongst the treatment groups were also observed at 24 h.p.i.</p>

<title>miR-181 significantly enhances HeV F- and G-mediated cell-cell fusion</title>
<p>Changes in viral RNA synthesis as measured by qRT-PCR during a single cycle infection could be due to effects on viral entry, genome replication, viral transcription or translation. To address whether miR-181 promotes entry of henipaviruses, a cell-cell fusion assay was performed using 293T effector cells expressing HeV F and G-glycoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref014">14</xref>]. Target cells (HeLa) were pre-transfected with either miR-181d agonist or the control agonist (miNEG), stained with a live cell membrane dye, and co-cultured for 24 h with effector cells expressing both glycoproteins or HeV G alone. Syncytia formation was imaged after fixation of the co-cultures and immunofluorescent staining for surface G glycoproteins. As controls, target cells were pre-treated with either siRNA duplexes targeting ephrin-B2 (positive control for impaired cell entry) or siNEG.</p>
<p>As expected, cells transfected with either siNEG or miNEG formed many multinucleated cells with the effector cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). In contrast, cells with depleted ephrin-B2 either did not fuse with the effector cells, or fused into smaller syncytia with less nuclei. Additionally, effector cells expressing G singly did not develop syncytia with any of the target cells. Interestingly, miR-181-transfected cells induced substantially more, and larger, syncytia. Cell-cell fusion was so extensive, in a few instances polykaryons with at least 100 nuclei were observed. The extent of fusion for each treatment group was measured using automated image analysis. Results corroborate what was observed by visual inspection, indicating that miR-181 overexpression induced a drastic 9- to 10-fold increase in fusion events relative to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Conversely, ephrin-B2 knockdown caused about a 90% reduction in syncytia formation.</p>

<title>miR-17 promotes henipavirus infection but does not enhance HeV F- and G-mediated cell-cell fusion</title>
<p>Considering the striking pro-fusogenic activity of miR-181, we wondered whether this effect is unique to the miR-181 family of miRNAs. The miR-17~93 family was another high-ranking pro-viral hit from the dual miRNA screens (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g001">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g002">2B</xref>). We decided to test the impact of miRNAs from this family on henipavirus-induced cell-cell fusion.</p>
<p>We first sought to validate the pro-viral effects of the miR-17~93 family using wild-type HeV. Agonists for two representative members of the miR-17~93 family, miR-17 and miR-93, were transfected into HeLa cells, and the permissiveness of these cells to HeV infection was evaluated using quantitative immunofluorescent analysis. The proportion of infected cells was 2-fold higher in the cells treated with miR-17 agonists compared to cells treated with control agonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). This was commensurate with the uptick in infection ratio in the miR-93-treated cells (170% relative to control). Virus yields in the supernatants of miR-17 agonist-treated cells were also enhanced, as measured by TCID<sub>50</sub> assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). For comparison, the activity of these agonists on another paramyxovirus, RSV, was also analysed using quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Akin to the impact of miR-17~93 on HeV infection, we found that the ratios of infected cells were also significantly higher in the miR-17 and miR-93 agonist transfected cells (189% and 180% of control, respectively). These results further validate the datasets from the complementary screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g001">Fig 1</xref>), and indicate that members of the miR-17~93 family are indeed promotive for wild-type henipavirus infection. However, and rather intriguingly, unlike miR-181 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g004">Fig 4</xref>), members of the miR-17~93 family appear to also exhibit pro-viral effects on a paramyxovirus from a different subfamily than the henipaviruses.</p>

<p>Once the pro-viral ability of miR-17 was established, we then performed the cell-cell fusion assay to assess the fusogenic effects of miR-17 agonists. Consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), target cells depleted of ephrin-B2 exhibited muted fusion activity relative to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). In contrast, target cells treated with miR-181d agonists formed larger multinucleated cells. Interestingly, even though miR-17 enhanced HeV infection, cells loaded with miR-17 agonists did not fuse at significantly higher efficiencies than negative control cells. Of note, smaller syncytia were formed in this experiment as less target cells were added to the co-cultures. The extent of syncytia formation in the captured images of all microscopy fields were additionally quantified using automated image analysis software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g006">Fig 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, these results indicate that HeV-glycoprotein mediated cell-cell fusion is greatly stimulated by miR-181, but not by miR-17, suggesting that miR-181 specifically facilitates henipavirus infection by enhancing host entry and, quite possibly, by supporting cell-to-cell spread during late stages of infection via syncytia formation.</p>

<title>Expression of entry receptors ephrin-B2/B3 and viral fusion glycoproteins are not appreciably enhanced by miR-181</title>
<p>Since miR-181 specifically promotes infection of henipaviruses but not other paramyxoviruses, it is quite likely miR-181 increases membrane fusion by directly targeting viral and/or host molecules unique to the henipavirus fusion machinery. Although most miRNAs reduce expression of its target mRNA, there have been instances where miRNA binding improves stability and translation of the mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref031">31</xref>]. Thus, we next investigated if miR-181 overexpression would enhance expression of the virus entry receptors ephrin-B2 and -B3, as well as the viral fusion glycoproteins F and G. miR-181a agonists were included in this analysis, subsequent to the validation of their pro-fusion nature in infection and fusion assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s006">S2 Fig</xref>). Perhaps surprisingly, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s007">S3 Fig</xref> shows that expression levels of the host and viral molecules which are known to be directly involved in fusion were not appreciably boosted by miR-181d. Similar results were observed for miR-181a as well. In fact, miR-181 downregulated ephrin-B3 and and HeV F glycoprotein by about 30 to 40%.</p>

<title>A subset of class A Eph receptors contain putative miR-181 target sites</title>
<p>Given the substantial impact of miR-181 on cell-cell fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>), it was intriguing that the miRNA did not considerably enhance expression levels of host and viral molecules known to be involved in entry and fusion. This led us to hypothesize that miR-181 supported fusion by down-regulating the expression of one or more novel cellular factor(s) that antagonizes expression and/or activity of the henipavirus entry receptors, ephrin-B2 or–B3. In the host, ephrins serve as native ligands for cellular Eph receptors (Ephs), which are high-affinity cell surface receptors belonging to the receptor tyrosine kinase family. Ephs and ephrins are further subdivided into classes A and B. Co-crystal structures of ephrin-B2 in complex either with its natural Eph [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref033">33</xref>] or with the henipavirus G glycoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref034">34</xref>] have been solved. Intriguingly, these structures reveal the GH binding loop of ephrin-B2 to be the same dynamic region predominantly responsible for mediating the binding of ephrin-B2 to its natural Eph receptors as well as to the viral attachment proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s008">S4A Fig</xref>.)

Because the affinities of ephrin-B2-HeV-G and known ephrin-B2-Eph receptor interactions are within comparable nanomolar range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref037">37</xref>], it implies that the Ephs may compete with the viral glycoprotein for binding to ephrin-B2. If true, one would expect Ephs to exhibit anti-viral properties, and any miRNAs which target these receptors for knockdown would be pro-viral.</p>
<p>Indeed, Bossart et al. previously reported that soluble forms of Ephs (EphB3 and B4) can compete with henipavirus G proteins for binding to ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B3, and can also inhibit virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref038">38</xref>]. Additionally, analysis of data from our recently published genome-wide siRNA screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref014">14</xref>] reveal that Ephs are more likely to be inhibitors of HeV infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s008">S4B Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s004">S4 Table</xref>). That said, algorithmic analysis by TargetScan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref040">40</xref>] of all human Ephs does not predict miR-181 binding sites in the 3’ UTR of the mRNAs of EphB3 or EphB4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s004">S4 Table</xref>). Of the three Ephs which have putative binding sites, all belong to class A receptors. This includes the EphA5 receptor, which is the most anti-viral Eph receptor in our published RNAi screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s008">S4B Fig</xref>). Even though ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B3 tend to preferentially engage with class B Eph receptors (e.g. EphB3 and B4), there is some precedence for crosstalk interaction with class A Eph receptors as well, such as EphA4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref041">41</xref>] and EphA3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref042">42</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s008">S4A Fig</xref>). Thus, a potential model for the pro-viral mechanism of miR-181 posits that the miRNA down-regulates expression of Ephs, increasing the pool of unbound ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B3 for henipavirus G glycoproteins to attach and trigger entry/membrane fusion.</p>

<title>EphA5 and EphA7 are novel negative regulators of henipavirus fusion</title>
<p>To test this model, we began by assessing the impact of silencing select Ephs on HeV infection. We opted to assess all Ephs with putative miR-181 target sites as predicted by TargetScan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref040">40</xref>], namely EphA4, A5 and A7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s004">S4 Table</xref>). Even though it was not predicted to contain any miR-181 binding sites, EphB4 was the most anti-viral hit of the class B receptors in the RNAi screen and was previously shown to compete with HeV G glycoprotein for ephrin-B2 binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref038">38</xref>], so it was incorporated into our study as well.</p>
<p>We first validated the siRNAs used to silence expression of the particular Ephs. Transfecting HeLa cells with siRNAs targeting EphA4, A5, A7 or B4 resulted in a &gt;80% relative decrease in target mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Down-regulating EphA4, A5, A7 or B4 with these siRNA duplexes all caused significant increases in HeV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), with EphB4 exhibiting the greatest impact (~200% of siNEG). We next performed a cell-cell fusion assay to directly test the effects of silencing of these receptors on henipavirus fusion. Interestingly, even though EphA4 was inhibitory for virus infection, it did not seem to be repress syncytia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), suggesting that EphA4 blocks infection at a step post entry. On the other hand, EphA5, A7 and B4 all suppressed cell fusion, with relative trends comparable to that seen in the infection assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). We therefore demonstrate, for the first time, that in addition to class B receptors (i.e. EphB3 and B4), class A Eph receptors can also inhibit henipavirus cell-cell fusion.</p>

<title>miR-181 targets EphA5, EphA7 and EphB4, but not EphA4, for downregulation</title>
<p>To evaluate whether these anti-fusion Ephs are suppression targets of miR-181, the mRNA levels of the Ephs in agonist-transfected cells were measured by qRT-PCR. Over-expressing miR-181a and miR-181d caused a significant reduction in EphA5 and A7 mRNA levels, with the latter showing the greatest reduction in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). In contrast, EphA4 levels were not impacted by miR-181d, and were only modestly (11%) affected by miR-181a, demonstrating some level of specificity in the regulation of Eph receptor expression by miR-181. Interestingly, although it was not computationally predicted to have any target site in its mRNA 3’ UTR, EphB4 levels were reduced by both miRNAs by about 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). These data show that endogenous levels of the henipavirus fusion regulators EphA5, A7 and B4 can all be significantly suppressed by miR-181 expression. Simultaneous suppression of all three negative fusion regulators would conceivably result in a cellular state with abundant unbound ephrin molecules, strongly favoring efficient activation of the viral fusion machinery. This provides a coherent mechanistic model for how miR-181 may expedite host entry and virus spread during infection.</p>

<title>Expression of miR-181 is up-regulated in circulating biofluids derived from <italic>in vivo</italic> models of henipavirus disease</title>
<p>Previous studies have reported that members of the miR-181 family are involved in different aspects of immune regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref045">45</xref>]. In particular, miR-181a expression levels have been shown to correlate with pro-inflammatory signals (e.g. IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) in blood tissues of humans with chronic inflammation, as well as blood of LPS-treated mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref046">46</xref>]. Additionally, miR-181 expression in human kidney tissues were found to be associated with increased transcription of genes of inflammation pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref047">47</xref>]. As the biological relevance of miRNAs is linked to their prevalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref048">48</xref>], we considered examining changes in levels of miR-181 molecules in <italic>in vivo</italic> infection models for henipaviruses. We hypothesized that, in conjunction with the host pro-inflammatory response during early infection, miR-181 expression might be up-regulated in HeV-infected mammals, but perhaps the virus co-opts this up-regulation to support infection and viral spread in the host.</p>
<p>Ferrets have been established as an animal model for the study of several human respiratory viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref049">49</xref>], including Hendra and Nipah viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref051">51</xref>]. Accordingly, sixteen adult ferrets were exposed to HeV via the oronasal route, monitored for clinical signs and play activity, and two or four ferrets were euthanized at 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 day post-exposure (d.p.e.). After an incubation period of about five days, some ferrets started exhibiting weight loss, which correlated with an increase in rectal temperatures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s009">S5A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s009">S5B Fig</xref>). By seven d.p.e., visible clinical signs, including depression, lack of grooming, or a decrease in playfulness, were observed in three out of four remaining ferrets. Establishment of HeV infection was confirmed by performing qRT-PCR for HeV genomic RNA on ten different tissues from the ferrets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g008">Fig 8A</xref>) as well as by virus isolations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s009">S5C Fig</xref>). By one d.p.e., viral RNA was detected in the retropharyngeal lymph nodes and in lung tissues, and by three d.p.e., HeV RNA was also recovered from the spleen, thymus and brain, suggesting neurotrophic spread characteristic of henipavirus disease. The higher viral RNA loads observed in the lung, lymph nodes and spleen is congruent with previous HeV infection studies performed in ferrets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref050">50</xref>]. We next purified total small RNA from serum samples (from all days except for day six), and then performed qRT-PCR using a primer specific for miR-181a and miR-181d. We found that, as early as one d.p.e., miR-181a and miR-181d became elevated in the serum of these ferrets during the course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Reminiscent of what was observed in mice treated with LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref046">46</xref>], this early up-regulation appears to be transient, as by day three, levels of miR-181a and miR-181d began dropping to baseline levels.</p>

<p>Natural HeV outbreaks occur in horses, causing severe febrile illness associated with respiratory and neurologic signs. Accordingly, horses serve as another animal model for respiratory and neurologic HeV disease. A HeV infection study involving three experimental horses was previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref052">52</xref>]. Here, total small RNA was purified from the stored blood samples of these horses, and the relative expression of miR-181a and miR-181d on 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 d.p.e. were determined by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Similar to results observed in ferret, transient yet significant increases in circulating miR-181 molecules were observed during the early stages of infection. Collectively, these observations demonstrate in two different <italic>in vivo</italic> models that members of the miR-181 family are up-regulated early in the host during HeV infection, implicating a biological role for miR-181 in host immunity as well as in henipavirus pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The development of novel therapeutics for viruses of clinical significance relies on our knowledge of the dynamic interplay between the virus and the human host, and our ability to apply such knowledge to disrupt the viral dependence on host factors. However, progress in our understanding of virus-host interactions of many deadly viruses of significant public health importance (e.g. Ebola, MERS, Nipah virus) is hampered by the high-cost and technical challenges associated with studying these viruses under BSL-3 or BSL-4 conditions. To circumvent these issues, different strategies and approaches have been developed, such as the use of pseudotyped particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref053">53</xref>] or minigenome assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref054">54</xref>]. These approaches, though of much utility, have their shortcomings; in particular, they cannot fully reproduce the entire life cycle of the virus. Therefore, significant progress still needs to be made towards the development and validation of our capabilities to perform technically-challenging experiments in high biocontainment environments.</p>
<p>In recent years functional genomics has become a popular research approach for unbiased discoveries of novel genes and molecular pathways involved in a particular biological process. For infectious diseases, functional genomics has demonstrated much power in its ability to dissect the dynamic interplay between host and viral factors during a virus infection, paving the way for novel drug targets. For instance, a haploid genetic screen resulted in the discovery of the once elusive entry receptor for Ebola virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref055">55</xref>]. That said, methods used in functional genomics, such as high-throughput RNAi screens, are technically challenging and laborious, especially at BSL-4.</p>
<p>In this report, we screened 834 host miRNAs, using both engineered agonists and antagonists, for their ability to enhance or inhibit infection of HeV in human cells. As two complementary screens were performed, we exploited this duality and cross-referenced the two screens to increase our confidence in the top hits. Both complementary screens converged on members of four miRNA families (miR-181, miR-17~93, miR-520h, miR-548d) that strongly promoted henipavirus infection. Since all four members of the miR-181 family were pro-viral hits using this approach, we focused our validation efforts on miR-181. We show that miR-181 promoted infection of both wild-type HeV and NiV infections. Interestingly, this infection enhancement seems to be primarily mediated via the ability of miR-181 to significantly augment henipavirus glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion, implicating miR-181 in the enhancement of henipavirus entry. Congruent with this notion, viral RNA synthesis in a single round of infection is elevated in cells transfected with miR-181 agonists. This pro-fusion effect is specific to the miR-181 family, as transfection with agonists of another strongly pro-viral miRNA (miR-17), did not appreciably alter syncytia formation. Since henipavirus mediated cell-cell fusion is both a surrogate model for virus entry as well as a natural phenomenon during late stages of infection, it is likely that in addition to enhancing henipavirus entry, miR-181 also promotes more efficient cell-to-cell spread of this virus by merging the cytosols of neighbouring cells more rapidly. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of subversion of a host miRNA by a virus to promote entry and membrane fusion.</p>
<p>Investigation into the pro-fusion mechanism of miR-181 led us to hypothesize that Eph receptors, the cellular binding partners of the henipavirus entry mediators ephrin-B2 and -B3, may act as potent anti-fusion regulators. Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands are involved in intracellular signalling via direct cell-cell contact and receptor-ligand interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref056">56</xref>]. These molecules are divided into two different classes (A and B), and Ephs of a particular class tend to bind to ephrins of the corresponding class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref057">57</xref>]. Exceptions to the rule exist, such as the ability of EphB2 to bind to ephrin-A5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref058">58</xref>]. Initial <italic>in silico</italic> analysis revealed that EphA4, EphA5 and EphA7 possess putative miR-181 binding sites in the 3’ UTRs of their transcripts. Our experiments subsequently showed that EphA5 and EphA7, but not EphA4, are novel suppressors of the fusiogenic effects of henipavirus glycoproteins. Importantly, levels of EphA5 and EphA7, but not EphA4, are reduced by overexpression of both miR-181a and miR-181d, indicating that these class A Ephs are target genes for the miR-181 family, and that the pro-fusion phenotype of miR-181 are, at least in part, due to its downregulation of specific class A Ephs.</p>
<p>We also demonstrated, using an approach different from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref038">38</xref>], that EphB4, an Eph receptor from the same class as the henipavirus entry receptors, has potent anti-fusion characteristics. Indeed, at comparable knockdown levels, siRNAs to EphB4 increased syncytia formation significantly more than siRNAs to EphA5 or EphA7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g007">Fig 7A and 7C</xref>). This data also lends support to the notion originally proposed by Bossart et al. (2008) that class B Ephs can compete with henipavirus glycoproteins for binding to entry receptors to hamper virus entry. Intriguingly, even though the 3’UTR of EphB4 transcripts does not contain any sequence that is complementary to the seed region of miR-181, EphB4 levels were downregulated by miR-181 expression. Though less commonly reported, miRNAs can modulate gene expression by binding to the coding region of mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref059">59</xref>]. Accordingly, human EphB4 does contain a putative miR-181 binding site in its ORF, providing an avenue for miR-181 regulation of its expression.</p>
<p>Since EphA5 and EphA7 do not interact with class B ephrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref056">56</xref>], it is likely the effects of downregulated EphA5 and EphA7 on promoting henipavirus fusion is indirect. One possibility is that since some crosstalk already exists between the two classes of the Eph-ephrin interaction network (e.g. EphB2 with ephrin-A5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref058">58</xref>]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref057">57</xref>], downregulation of some molecules in the network may have broader, indirect effects on the availability of other molecules in the system, including the ephrins utilized by henipaviruses. For instance, repression of EphA5 and EphA7 expression will free up more ephrin-A molecules, including ephrin-A5. The increased level of unbound ephrin-A5 results in its sequestration of EphB2 and thereby make more ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 molecules available for binding by the henipavirus glycoproteins.</p>
<p>Alternatively, EphA5 and EphA7 may act directly on ephrin-B2 and B3 to regulate fusion, but via lateral <italic>cis</italic> interactions on the same cell. It was more recently shown that the canonical intra-class binding rule may only apply for <italic>trans</italic> interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref042">42</xref>]. For example, via lateral <italic>cis</italic> interactions, ephrin-B2 can attenuate the <italic>trans</italic> ligand-binding capacity of EphA3 and its activation, even though ephrin-B2 does not bind to EphA3 by canonical <italic>trans</italic> interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref042">42</xref>]. This <italic>cis</italic> inhibition of EphA3 by ephrin-B2 implies that <italic>cis</italic> interactions do not exhibit the same receptor-ligand selectivity as <italic>trans</italic> interactions, providing a possible non-canonical mechanism for EphA5 and EphA7 to modulate ephrin-B2 activity.</p>
<p>Collectively, our data supports a model where simultaneous inhibition of multiple anti-fusion Ephs from both receptor classes by miR-181 contributes to greatly enhanced membrane fusion and infection. Considering that EphB4 is most antagonistic towards fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1005974.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), it likely makes the most significant contribution to the pro-fusion phenotype of miR-181. Though this is the first report of a host miRNA that promotes virus fusion by suppressing anti-fusion receptors, there is some precedence for host receptor-ligand interactions that negatively regulate virus entry. Natural host ligands (i.e. BTLA and LTα) of the herpes simplex virus entry receptor, HVEM, can inhibit binding of the virus glycoprotein gD to HVEM and suppress infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref060">60</xref>]. Additionally, nectin members can compete with the measles virus hemagglutinin glycoprotein for binding to its exit receptor nectin-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref062">62</xref>].</p>
<p>Even though the role of miR-181 in inflammation and NKT-cell maturation has been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref046">46</xref>], little has been reported about its role in the infection of other viruses. In stark contrast to henipaviruses, miR-181 has been shown to be inhibit infection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref063">63</xref>]. Interestingly, this inhibition occurs at PRRSV host entry and is achieved by targeting the entry receptor CD163 for downregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref064">64</xref>].</p>
<p>We found that miR-181 did not affect infection by paramyxoviruses from other genera, indicating specificity in the henipavirus-miR181 virus-host interaction. This supports the model that miR-181 enhances syncytia formation by targeting Ephs that naturally associate with the henipavirus entry receptors ephrin-B2 and B3. On the other hand, miR-17 enhances the infection of HeV as well as RSV, suggesting that the pro-viral effects of miR-17 are broadly applied to the paramyxovirus family, and perhaps beyond this family. For instance, miR-17 has recently been shown to be critical for the replication of pestiviruses, primarily via enhancing viral translation and vRNA stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref012">12</xref>]. Cross-referencing of results from the siRNA screen of host genes associated with HeV infection suggests that miR-181 and miR-17~93 target multiple host genes which are anti-viral for HeV, and that the net outcome of cellular expression of miR-181 or miR-17~93 is likely a host microenvironment that is more conducive for henipavirus infection. These results indicate that, in addition to its role in regulating fusion, miR-181 might act via other anti-viral host mediators to induce a situation that is broadly supportive of henipavirus replication. Consistent with this, we observed that miR-181 is up-regulated in sera of ferrets and blood of horses as early as day 1 during a henipavirus infection. It is tempting to speculate that the host pro-inflammatory response (of which blood miR-181 is correlated with) promotes the early phase of virus spread in the host, thereby contributing to disease progression and pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref046">46</xref>]. Along similar lines, but in a chronic infection, serum miR-181b is positively correlated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels in human patients, and with disease progression of chronic HBV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref065">65</xref>]. The model of miR-181-mediated immune pathogenesis has potential implications for risk factors associated with susceptibility to henipavirus disease, as well as for the strategic design and development of novel immunotherapy for henipavirus infections.</p>
<p>Direct binding interactions between host miRNAs and viral genomes have been reported for certain RNA viruses like EEEV and pestivirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref012">12</xref>]. These interactions often have functional relevance in terms of supporting viral replication. It was recently first demonstrated that the functional RNAi protein Argonaute preferentially associates with certain subgenomic segments of paramyxoviruses as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref012">12</xref>]. In particular, a higher abundance of Argonaute association with M and N segments of the hMPV RNA was observed relative to the L segment. Due to limited resolution in the AGO-CLIP analysis in that study, whether these physical interactions involve specific host miRNAs remains to be addressed. Considering that our complementary screens identified multiple miRNAs that support henipavirus infection, an interesting subject for future studies would be to investigate whether the pro-viral miRNAs which we identified here bind to the genomes of paramyxoviruses, and whether such interactions have functional roles in supporting infection.</p>
<p>In summary, these dual screens further the understanding of the role of host-derived small noncoding RNAs in the infection cycle of henipaviruses, and provide a miRNA-based resource for the study of viruses from the order mononegavirales, including members of both the filovirus and paramyxovirus families, which presents significant threats to human and animal health. This study implicates miR-181 and certain class A Eph receptors as critical modulators of henipavirus membrane fusion, and highlights how the natural innate immune response of the host can be exploited by a RNA virus to promote cell-to-cell spread.</p>

<p>High throughput miRNA agonist and antagonist screens were performed largely as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1005974.ref014">14</xref>]. Briefly, HeLa cells were transfected in 384 well plates with miRIDIAN miRNA agonist and antagonist (final concentration 25 nM) libraries using DharmaFECT (DF) 1 lipid transfection reagent (Dharmacon RNAi Technologies, GE, Lafayette, Colorado, USA). Genome-wide miRNA libraries (catalog numbers in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s001">S1 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1005974.s002">S2 Table</xref>) were screened at the Victorian Centre for Functional Genomics (VCFG). At 72 h post transfection, in parallel with the point of HeV infection, cell viability for each well was assessed by fixing (4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min) and staining plates with the nuclear stain 4',6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole, Dihydrochloride (DAPI) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; 1 μg/ml for 20 min in phosphate buffered saline). HeV infection was quantitated in separate plates suitable for luminescence assays. 72 h post-transfection, cells were infected with recombinant HeV (MOI 0.1 using a BioTek 406 liquid handler housed in a class II biosafety cabinet at BSL-4.
