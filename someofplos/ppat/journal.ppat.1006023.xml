<abstract>
<p>The extracellular bloodstream form parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> is supremely adapted to escape the host innate and adaptive immune system. Evasion is mediated through an antigenically variable Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) coat, which is recycled at extraordinarily high rates. Blocking VSG synthesis triggers a precytokinesis arrest where stalled cells persist for days <italic>in vitro</italic> with superficially intact VSG coats, but are rapidly cleared within hours in mice. We therefore investigated the role of VSG synthesis in trypanosome phagocytosis by activated mouse macrophages. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> normally effectively evades macrophages, and induction of <italic>VSG</italic> RNAi resulted in little change in phagocytosis of the arrested cells. Halting VSG synthesis resulted in stalled cells which swam directionally rather than tumbling, with a significant increase in swim velocity. This is possibly a consequence of increased rigidity of the cells due to a restricted surface coat in the absence of VSG synthesis. However if <italic>VSG</italic> RNAi was induced in the presence of anti-VSG221 antibodies, phagocytosis increased significantly. Blocking VSG synthesis resulted in reduced clearance of anti-VSG antibodies from the trypanosome surface, possibly as a consequence of the changed motility. This was particularly marked in cells in the G2/ M cell cycle stage, where the half-life of anti-VSG antibody increased from 39.3 ± 4.2 seconds to 99.2 ± 15.9 seconds after induction of <italic>VSG</italic> RNAi. The rates of internalisation of bulk surface VSG, or endocytic markers like transferrin, tomato lectin or dextran were not significantly affected by the VSG synthesis block. Efficient elimination of anti-VSG-antibody complexes from the trypanosome cell surface is therefore essential for trypanosome evasion of macrophages. These experiments highlight the essentiality of high rates of VSG recycling for the rapid removal of host opsonins from the parasite surface, and identify this process as a key parasite virulence factor during a chronic infection.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Bloodstream form African trypanosomes infect the mammalian bloodstream as extracellular parasites, where they excel at escaping the immune system including elimination by macrophages. Key for survival is a dense Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) coat which is antigenically varied, and which is recycled from the cell surface at very high rates. VSG is essential, and blocking its synthesis produces cells which do not grow, but persist for days. Here, we investigated the role of the VSG coat in trypanosome escape from macrophages. Arresting VSG synthesis resulted in trypanosomes with changed motility, which were not phagocytosed at higher rates. However, phagocytosis was dramatically increased if a VSG synthesis block was induced before the trypanosomes were coated with anti-VSG antibodies. Pre-treatment with host complement had a more moderate effect on phagocytosis. We showed that the arrested cells had reduced rates of clearance of anti-VSG antibody from their surface, making them a target for recognition by macrophages. These experiments highlight the critical importance of high rates of VSG internalisation for the rapid removal of host immune molecules including antibodies and complement from the trypanosome cell surface. This allows trypanosomes to effectively evade macrophages during a chronic infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The African trypanosome <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> is a unicellular parasite uniquely adapted to parasitize the mammalian bloodstream after inoculation by tsetse flies. Here, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> establishes chronic infections leading to devastating diseases such as Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) or ‘nagana’ in livestock. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> can also infect a broad range of African mammals, which tolerate low grades of trypanosome infection and serve as reservoirs for disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref002">2</xref>]. Within the blood, as an extracellular pathogen <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> is confronted with continuous attack from the innate and adaptive arms of the host immune system. These include the complement system, antibodies and phagocytic cells such as macrophages. An essential trypanosome survival feature within this hostile environment, is a protective coat of Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>VSG is key for evasion of the adaptive immune response, and extraordinarily sophisticated antigenic variation of VSG allows the trypanosome to switch stochastically between different VSG variants during the course of a chronic infection. Individual trypanosomes express one VSG out of a vast repertoire of up to 2000 <italic>VSG</italic> genes and pseudogenes from one of about 15 telomeric <italic>VSG</italic> expression site (ES) transcription units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref006">6</xref>]. Switching the active <italic>VSG</italic> can involve transcriptional switching between different ESs, or DNA rearrangements slotting new <italic>VSG</italic>s (or <italic>VSG</italic> segments) into the active ES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref008">8</xref>]. In addition to its role in immune evasion through VSG switching, the very dense VSG surface presumably prevents the host complement system from rapidly forming lytic pores in the parasite in the form of membrane attack complexes (MAC).</p>
<p>VSG therefore forms a protective barrier with highly intriguing properties. VSG is the most abundant protein in bloodstream form <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> (~10<sup>7</sup> molecules) and the VSG coat is an extremely dense layer of tightly packed VSG molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref010">10</xref>]. The VSG coat has been modelled with VSG approaching maximal densities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref011">11</xref>]. However, it is still unclear whether VSG is indeed normally fully saturated at the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>VSG is essential even <italic>in vitro</italic>, and blocking its synthesis does not lead to a major reduction in VSG coat density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref013">13</xref>]. Instead, a unique cell cycle checkpoint is triggered, leading to trypanosomes which have stalled at a precise precytokinesis stage. Concurrently, a global translation arrest is induced, resulting in stalled cells which do not grow, again preventing catastrophic dilution of the protective VSG surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref014">14</xref>]. Despite its dense nature, the VSG layer forms a semi-permeable barrier blocking deposition of host complement proteins and antibodies on the trypanosome surface membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref017">17</xref>], yet allowing smaller nutrient molecules to reach surface receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref018">18</xref>]. As VSG proteins are attached to the cell surface through glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, VSG molecules can move freely on the cell surface forming an unusually fluid protective surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>This highly fluid nature of the VSG surface coat facilitates another unusual <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> feature, and that is extremely high rates of VSG recycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref020">20</xref>]. Trypanosomes compartmentalise endocytosis and exocytosis to a specialised invagination at the base of the flagellum known as the flagellar pocket [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref021">21</xref>]. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> has spectacularly high rates of recycling of VSG, and it is estimated that the entire surface complement of VSG is internalised once every 12 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref020">20</xref>]. Within the cell, a stringent quality control mechanism monitors which VSGs are returned back to the cell surface. Defective VSGs (and presumably VSGs with covalently bound complement proteins) are targeted for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref022">22</xref>]. Internalised VSG-antibody complexes are also prevented from returning back to the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>This high rate of VSG recycling in addition to quality control mechanisms, are key trypanosome virulence factors allowing trypanosomes to multiply unimpeded in increasing titres of anti-VSG antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref024">24</xref>]. It is only when anti-VSG titres rise above a critical level that recognised trypanosomes are overwhelmed, and parasites expressing the predominant VSG variant are exterminated. These extraordinarily high rates of VSG recycling therefore function as an unusual ‘coat-cleaning’ machine, resulting in the rapid removal of lethal immune complexes from the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref024">24</xref>]. Motility of the trypanosome appears to facilitate this removal. The swimming trypanosome is thought to generate hydrodynamic forces, which preferentially push VSG-antibody complexes back through the VSG layer towards the flagellar pocket where they are endocytosed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to evading complement and antibodies, bloodstream form African trypanosomes must evade phagocytes including macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref026">26</xref>]. Although some aspects surrounding the immunology of macrophage activation during a <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> infection have been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref030">30</xref>], little is known about how phagocytosis of trypanosomes by macrophages occurs mechanistically. We have shown earlier that blocking VSG synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic> leads to stalled trypanosomes which persist for days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref013">13</xref>]. However, if <italic>VSG</italic> RNAi is induced <italic>in vivo</italic> in infected mice, trypanosomes are very rapidly cleared within hours. We have no evidence that blocking VSG synthesis results in increased trypanosome sensitivity to the alternative pathway of complement mediated lysis.</p>
<p>In order to understand this rapid trypanosome clearance <italic>in vivo</italic>, we therefore investigated the effect of blocking VSG synthesis on trypanosome phagocytosis by macrophages. Macrophages can be co-cultured with trypanosomes <italic>in vitro</italic>, providing a powerful experimental system for investigating the role of phagocytes during a trypanosome infection. Here, we found that although blocking VSG synthesis resulted in altered motility of the stalled cells, there was no significant increase in phagocytosis by mouse macrophages. However phagocytosis of the arrested trypanosomes was significantly increased in the presence of anti-VSG antibodies. Concurrently, we observed a significant decrease in rates of clearance of anti-VSG complexes from the trypanosome surface when VSG synthesis was blocked. These experiments show that an experimental perturbation resulting in reduced clearance of anti-VSG antibodies directly inhibits the ability of the trypanosome to evade phagocytosis. These experiments highlight the importance of both high rates of VSG synthesis and clearance of anti-VSG antibodies for trypanosome evasion from the multiple arms of the host immune system including phagocytes.</p>

<p>The induction of a VSG synthesis block in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei in vitro</italic> leads to an abrupt inhibition of growth within one cell cycle (8 hours), and a precise pre-cytokinesis cell cycle arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref013">13</xref>]. VSG is highly essential for bloodstream form <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei in vivo</italic>, and blocking its synthesis results in rapid elimination of a trypanosome infection in mice within hours. In order to understand how this rapid clearance <italic>in vivo</italic> is mediated, we investigated the effect of inhibiting VSG synthesis on trypanosome phagocytosis by mouse macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic>. To study this, we co-cultivated <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> 221VG1.1 in the presence of activated mouse RAW264.7 macrophages for one hour at 37°C. In order to trigger classical activation, macrophages were first stimulated with mouse IFN-γ (interferon gamma) and LPS (Lipopolysaccharides from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>) for 24 hours prior to co-cultivation with trypanosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>The <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> 221VG1.1 trypanosome line contains <italic>eGFP</italic> and a puromycin resistance gene inserted in the active <italic>VSG221</italic> expression site, and a construct allowing tetracycline inducible expression of <italic>VSG221</italic> RNAi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref013">13</xref>]. VSG synthesis was blocked by the induction of <italic>VSG221</italic> RNAi with tetracycline for eight hours, which is the earliest time point that produces a full cell-cycle arrest. Trypanosome phagocytosis was analysed by immunofluorescence microscopy, allowing visualisation of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> flagella even after internalisation within the mouse macrophage using a monoclonal antibody (L8C4) against the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> paraflagellar rod protein 2 (PFR2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref033">33</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>As expected for a bloodstream pathogen, bloodstream form <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> normally escapes significant phagocytosis by macrophages. When macrophages were co-cultivated with bloodstream form <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, only 2.7 ± 2.3% of the macrophages showed evidence of internalised parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Host molecules including complement C3b or IgG or IgM antibodies adhere to microbial invaders, thereby facilitating phagocytosis of the opsonised pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref034">34</xref>]. Macrophages adhere to these host protein coated pathogens through specific surface receptors recognising these opsonins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref035">35</xref>]. We therefore investigated phagocytosis of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> after pre-incubation with either complement proteins or anti-VSG antibodies. The complement used in these experiments was present in normal mouse serum (NMS) from the CD-1 mouse strain. Unlike many laboratory mouse strains, CD-1 mice have functional complement proteins of the terminal complement pathway, and have been shown to have functional serum complement activity of the classical, lectin and alternative pathways at the level of C9 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref036">36</xref>]. To verify that the normal mouse serum from our CD-1 mice was indeed complement active, we showed activity of the classical pathway (requiring both antibodies and complement). After opsonisation for 90 minutes with both NMS and anti-VSG antibodies, there was moderate although statistically significant lysis of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> after the induction of <italic>VSG221</italic> RNAi for eight hours (*P&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006023.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The anti-VSG221 antibody used in our experiments was a rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution), which was not in excess in our assays, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006023.s002">S2 Fig</xref>.</p>
<p>In order to investigate the role of host opsonins on phagocytosis of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, we incubated <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> with NMS from CD1 mice, anti-VSG221 antibody, or both NMS and anti-VSG221 antibodies before co-culturing the trypanosomes with activated mouse RAW264.7 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Prior incubation of trypanosomes with NMS did not lead to a significant increase in macrophages with phagocytosed parasites (up to 5.2 ± 1.9%). A possible increase in phagocytosis was observed if trypanosomes were first incubated with anti-VSG221 antibodies (up to 9.8 ± 4.3%), however this increase (up 16.4 ± 6.0%) was only statistically significant (*P&lt;0.05) if normal mouse serum was added together with anti-VSG221 antibodies. This established the importance of host opsonins for phagocytosis of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>. In addition, these data indicate the importance of the classical pathway of complement activation, whereby dedicated host complement proteins adhere to host antibodies coating microorganisms.</p>
<p>We next investigated the role of the VSG coat in trypanosome recognition and phagocytosis by macrophages. The induction of a VSG synthesis block leads to an arrest in trypanosome growth, with the majority of the stalled population (&gt; 65%) consisting of bi-flagellated cells arrested precytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref013">13</xref>]. Surprisingly, we found that blocking VSG synthesis had a relatively minor effect on phagocytosis, and the percentage of macrophages with phagocytosed trypanosomes rose only marginally from 2.7 ± 2.3% to 3.9 ± 2.4%. Blocking VSG synthesis in the presence of NMS resulted in a further marginal increase from 5.2 ± 1.9% to 6.7 ± 3.1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the most striking effect on phagocytosis was seen when VSG221 synthesis was blocked in trypanosomes which were first opsonised with anti-VSG221 antibodies before the phagocytosis assay was performed. These treatments lead to 33.5 ± 6.7% of the macrophages containing internalised flagella, which was a 3.4-fold increase compared with non-induced cells (**P&lt;0.001). The addition of host complement to the anti-VSG antibodies in the face of a VSG synthesis block did not result in a significant additional increase in phagocytosis (34.8 ± 6.6% vs 33.5 ± 6.7%). This demonstrates that anti-VSG antibodies were the main factor in this facilitated trypanosome uptake after the induction of a VSG synthesis block. Not all macrophages phagocytosed trypanosomes. This variability could indicate that not all macrophages were equally competent for phagocytosis, possibly due to heterogeneity in their degree of activation, as has been found before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>As opsonisation with host proteins appeared to play a significant role in this observed increase in trypanosome recognition and phagocytosis by macrophages, we investigated the extent to which opsonised trypanosomes were actually phagocytosed, as opposed to just adhered to the macrophage surface. When <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> expressing eGFP is phagocytosed, eGFP fluorescence disappears rapidly. We therefore determined the number of trypanosomes internalised in each macrophage using immunofluorescence microscopy detecting the flagella. Trypanosome flagella remain relatively resistant to degradation in the macrophage phagolysosome, even after the ingested trypanosomes have lysed. A detailed analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows that trypanosomes that are pre-incubated in NMS do not adhere to macrophages to a significantly greater extent than untreated trypanosomes regardless of whether <italic>VSG</italic> RNAi is induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Pre-incubation of uninduced <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> with anti-VSG221 antibodies lead to a 4.5-fold increase in RAW264.7 macrophages showing adhered trypanosomes, and a 3.4-fold increase in macrophages with internalised flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>However, the most striking effect was seen when VSG221 synthesis was blocked in trypanosomes which had also been pre-incubated with anti-VSG221 antibodies before co-culturing with macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Here, the majority of the macrophages contained more than 1 flagellum, and between 5–10% of the macrophages each contained either 1, 2, 3, 4 or more than 4 flagella. Some macrophages efficiently phagocytosed multiple (up to more than four) trypanosomes in the presence of anti-VSG221 antibodies and a VSG synthesis block, with the additional inclusion of NMS resulting in some increased trypanosome adherence and phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Anti-VSG221 antibodies were therefore the most important opsonin facilitating efficient trypanosome uptake in our phagocytosis experiments.</p>

<title>Clearance of anti-VSG221 antibodies is impaired after the induction of a block in VSG221 synthesis</title>
<p>Bloodstream form <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> clears anti-VSG antibodies from its surface via unusually high rates of endocytosis, which can be blocked by decreasing the temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref024">24</xref>]. At 4°C molecules can enter the trypanosome flagellar pocket, but further entry into the endocytic system is halted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref024">24</xref>]. To investigate VSG antibody clearance in our stalled cells, we cooled trypanosomes to 4°C to block endocytosis, before allowing binding of anti-VSG221 antibody to the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref024">24</xref>]. The opsonised cells were subsequently transferred to 37°C to reinitiate endocytosis for varying lengths of time.

Bloodstream form <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> where <italic>VSG221</italic> RNAi was not induced removed anti-VSG221 antibodies from the cell surface within 8 minutes of reactivation of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g003">Fig 3</xref>). However, after VSG221 synthesis had been blocked for 8 hours, the rate of surface antibody clearance was greatly reduced. To confirm that we were not looking at a nonspecific consequence of the growth arrest, we also monitored clearance of anti-VSG221 antibodies after the RNAi mediated knock-down of the essential protein TDP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref037">37</xref>]. TDP is an architectural chromatin protein which has no direct role in VSG trafficking or cellular architecture. The induction of <italic>TDP1</italic> RNAi (although arresting cell growth) did not result in impaired clearance of anti-VSG221 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Within eight hours induction of <italic>VSG221</italic> RNAi <italic>in vitro</italic>, more than 65% of the population is stalled precytokinesis as 2N2K cells containing two nuclei (N) and two kinetoplasts (K), which do not reinitiate further rounds of DNA synthesis. We therefore investigated if the observed reduced clearance of anti-VSG221 antibodies was a consequence of the accumulation of 2N2K cells. Possibly the 2N2K cell-cycle stage naturally shows reduced rates of recycling. We therefore quantitated the clearance of anti-VSG221 antibodies at different cell cycle stages using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

<p>In untreated cells, we did not find that rates of clearance of anti-VSG221 antibody varied significantly at different stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). The half-life of the anti-VSG antibody in the whole population is 36.7 ± 3.7 seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), which is comparable to the value of 35.3 ± 4.6 seconds found by the Engstler laboratory using polyclonal anti-VSG IgG antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref024">24</xref>]. When the different cell cycle stages were investigated individually, the half-life of the anti-VSG antibody was comparable between the different cell cycle stages, and ranged from 34.3 ± 3.5 seconds for cells in G1, to 39.8 ± 4.7 seconds for cells in S-phase and 39.3 ± 4.2 seconds for cells at G2/M.</p>
<p>However, in cells that were stalled after blocking VSG synthesis, we found significantly reduced clearance of anti-VSG antibodies at all stages of the cell cycle, with an average for the whole population of 79.0 ± 12.8 seconds) (*P&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g004">Fig 4</xref>). If the different cell cycle stages were analysed individually, the half-life increased from 43.6 ± 4.4 seconds for cells in G1 to 75.1 ± 12.5 seconds for cells in S phase, and 99.2 ± 15.9 seconds for cells in G2/M. In the G2/M cell cycle stage anti-VSG antibody clearance was particularly decreased compared with uninduced cells at this cell cycle stage (*P&lt;0.05). Again, to ensure that we were monitoring a specific consequence of blocking VSG221 synthesis rather than lethality, we also determined the rate of internalisation of anti-VSG221 antibodies after knocking down the highly essential chromatin protein TDP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref037">37</xref>]. TDP1 knock-down results in rapid growth arrest, although not the highly specific precytokinesis cell cycle arrest observed after the induction of <italic>VSG</italic> RNAi, which is to the best of our knowledge unique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref037">37</xref>]. Despite the induction of a rapid growth arrest after TDP1 knock-down, there was no significant change in the rate of clearance of anti-VSG221 antibodies (41.1 ± 4.0 seconds) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006023.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>A phenomenon that we observed in these experiments, was that cells where <italic>VSG221</italic> RNAi had been induced, appeared to have increased binding of anti-VSG221 antibody compared with uninduced cells. We therefore quantitated the total amount of VSG221 on these stalled cells using LiCor imaging. We found that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> where <italic>VSG221</italic> RNAi had been induced for eight hours had a reduction in total VSG to 64 ± 12% normal levels (*P&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006023.s004">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>). We also quantitated surface VSG using biotinylation. These biotinylation experiments estimated that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> had a reduction in surface VSG221 to 67 ± 22% normal levels after the induction of <italic>VSG221</italic> RNAi for eight hours (*P&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006023.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). Equivalent values were obtained if the different cell cycle stages were analysed separately. However, if anti-VSG221 antibodies were quantitated, approximately twice as many bound to the surface of cells where <italic>VSG</italic> RNAi had been induced (*P&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006023.s004">S4D Fig</xref>). This was particularly apparent in the G2/ M cell cycle stage (213 ± 41%). As we had established that blocking VSG synthesis resulted in moderate reduction in VSG on the cell surface, this observed increase in antibody binding is presumably a consequence of reduced VSG coat density exposing previously inaccessible VSG epitopes to recognition by the polyclonal anti-VSG antibodies.</p>
<p>As we observed reduced clearance of anti-VSG antibodies after induction of a VSG synthesis block, we investigated if this effect was due to a reduction in the rate of internalisation of total surface VSG rather than specifically antibody bound VSG. Cells were cooled to 4°C to stop endocytosis, before surface VSG was biotinylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref020">20</xref>]. Cells were subsequently transferred to 37°C to reinitiate endocytosis for varying lengths of time. Endocytosis was then stopped, external biotin was stripped off, and fixed cells were permeabilised and incubated with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 to quantitate the amount of internalised biotinylated VSG by flow cytometry. However, even after blocking VSG synthesis for 8 hours, the amount of surface VSG that was internalised was not significantly decreased (half-life of 23.7 ± 6.1 vs 28.4 ± 7.5 seconds) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This demonstrates that in cells arrested by the induction of <italic>VSG221</italic> RNAi, there is specifically a reduction in the rate of internalisation of VSG-antibody complexes, rather than a general decrease in rates of internalisation of all surface VSG.</p>

<p>Although anti-VSG221 antibodies were clearly removed from the cell surface at a reduced rate after the induction of <italic>VSG221</italic> RNAi, it was not evident whether this impairment was a consequence of a restriction preventing anti-VSG antibody complexes from entering the flagellar pocket, or complications further downstream in the endocytic pathway. We therefore monitored if the VSG-antibody complexes were indeed internalised using immunofluorescence microscopy. Similar to previous experiments, cells were first cooled to 4°C to block endocytosis, before transferral to 37°C for varying lengths of time. Reactivation of endocytosis at 37°C results in VSG-antibody complexes progressing first through the early, and then subsequently the late endocytic system. In the lysosomal compartment anti-VSG antibodies are stripped off and degraded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref038">38</xref>]. In order to prevent degradation of the internalised VSG-antibody complexes in the lysosome and thereby facilitate their detection, FMK-024 inhibitor was included at an end concentration of 20 μM. FMK-024 is a lysosomal thiol protease inhibitor which blocks the cathepsin protease TbCat L, allowing the detection of accumulated anti-VSG antibodies in the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> lysosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>As expected, after transferring cells to 37°C anti-VSG antibodies (indicated in green) were rapidly removed from the cell surface within 2 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> lysosomal compartment was visualised with the lysosomal marker p67 (red) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref042">42</xref>]. In untreated cells, anti-VSG antibodies accumulated in the lysosome within 8 minutes of reactivation of endocytosis (co-localisation with p67 indicated in yellow). After blocking VSG synthesis, anti-VSG antibodies were still internalised but at a greatly reduced rate, and it took more than 16 minutes before significant accumulation of antibodies in the lysosome was observed.</p>

<p>Endocytosis in bloodstream form <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> is restricted to the flagellar pocket, and is involved in the removal of surface bound host antibodies, nutrient uptake and the maintenance of homeostasis of the cell surface proteome. In order to determine if the early endocytic pathway was affected in our stalled cells, we investigated rates of receptor mediated endocytosis by following the uptake of transferrin and tomato lectin, and fluid phase endocytosis by monitoring uptake of dextran. Using flow cytometry to monitor uptake of Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated human transferrin, we found that the half-life of transferrin increased from 1.1 ± 0.3 minutes to 3.3 ± 1.1 minutes, however this result was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Uptake of other endocytic makers was also not significantly affected by the induction of <italic>VSG</italic> RNAi. Receptor-mediated endocytosis was monitored with tomato-lectin coupled to Alexa Fluor 488, which showed an increase in half-life (3.5 ± 4.2 minutes versus 1.5 ± 1.3 minutes), but this was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Similarly, fluid phase endocytosis, as monitored by uptake of Dextran-Alexa Fluor 488 was also not significantly changed in the stalled cells (7.9 ± 6.3 minutes in cells where <italic>VSG</italic> RNAi had been induced compared with a half-life of 8.3 ± 5.0 minutes in untreated cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). These results therefore do not provide evidence for a clear impairment in the early endocytic pathway in cells stalled after the induction of a VSG synthesis block.</p>

<title>Blocking VSG synthesis results in increased directional cell motility and reduced tumbling</title>
<p>Motility is essential in bloodstream form <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> and plays a vital role in cell cycle progression, cytokinesis and virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref044">44</xref>]. Forward swimming motility is also thought to facilitate the removal of anti-VSG antibodies from the surface of the bloodstream form trypanosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref024">24</xref>]. In this model, antibodies bound to the VSG function as molecular sails. Hydrodynamic forces generated by forward swimming of the parasite contribute to the preferential backward movement of VSG-antibody complexes into the flagellar pocket [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref024">24</xref>]. As motility is thought to be key for efficient surface antibody clearance, we examined how this is affected after VSG synthesis is blocked.</p>
<p>We measured the motility of our cells by performing time-lapse live cell videomicroscopy, whereby cells were observed by bright-field light microscopy and images were captured every 200 milliseconds for 1.7 minutes (512 frames). Particles were identified, and tracks were built for each cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). VSG synthesis was blocked by the induction of <italic>VSG</italic> RNAi for 8 hours. Analysis of the whole population did not show a significant change in average trypanosome swim speed after the induction of <italic>VSG</italic> RNAi (1.6 ± 0.014 μm/ second vs 1.7 ± 0.019 μm/ second) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006023.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Arresting VSG synthesis resulted in a population of stalled trypanosomes that were predominantly (&gt;65%) composed of cells that had arrested precytokinesis with two full length flagella. We therefore next monitored the speed of bi-flagellated cells in the untreated population, or after VSG221 synthesis had been blocked for 8 hours. Here too, there was no significant change in swim speed after the induction of a VSG synthesis block (1.45 μm/ sec vs 1.58 μm/ sec) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006023.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>However, in the population of cells where VSG synthesis had been blocked, there was a clear difference in swimming behaviour as illustrated by the particle motion track plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> motility changes according to the viscosity of its environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref045">45</xref>]. Although tissue culture medium is not as viscous as blood, we still used this low viscosity medium in our motility experiments in order to replicate the conditions used in the trypanosome macrophage co-cultivation experiments. In the uninduced population, tumbling cells constituted the majority of the population, as has been observed earlier for bloodstream form <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> cultured under standard tissue culture conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref024">24</xref>]. However, after blocking VSG synthesis for 8 hours, the arrested trypanosomes clearly swam in a more persistently directional fashion.</p>
<p>We therefore measured average trypanosome velocity, which is defined as speed in a given direction, or total displacement over track length (and therefore including a directional component). In contrast, average speed is total distance travelled over track length without considering directionality. After blocking VSG synthesis for eight hours, the average trypanosome velocity significantly increased from 0.55 ± 0.01 μm/s to 0.90 ± 0.02 μm/s (***P = &lt;0.0001) reflecting the increased directionality of movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Again, we investigated if this was due to the accumulation of bi-flagellated cells in our arrested population, but found a similar increase in velocity (or directional swimming) after the induction of a VSG synthesis arrest in these bi-flagellated cells from 0.50 ± 0.06 μm/s to 0.84 ± 0.08 μm/s (***P = &lt;0.0001).</p>
<p>These results were confirmed by our measurements of average angular persistence. Angular persistence is a mathematical description for how the direction of motion of the cell changes over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref046">46</xref>]. A value ranging from -1 to 1 was assigned to each particle track corresponding to a swimming trypanosome. A value of 1 indicates directional swimming, whereby cells observed after a 2 second period swim in the same direction as in the previous 2 second period. A value of 0 represents random movement, whereby the movement of the cell observed after a 2 second period is completely random in direction compared with the previous 2 second period. A value of -1 indicates a reversal in swimming direction, whereby the cell observed after a 2 second period has moved in the reverse direction.</p>
<p>As seen in the particle tracks, bloodstream form <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> primarily tumbles under standard <italic>in vitro</italic> culturing conditions (with average angular persistence values of -0.07 ± 0.006) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). However, after VSG synthesis is blocked, the average angular persistence increased to 0.20 ± 0.008 units, reflecting the striking shift in the predominant mode of swimming from random to directional (***P&lt;0.0001). Again, this change in motility after the induction of a VSG synthesis arrest was observed in both the whole population as well as in bi-flagellated cells. In bi-flagellated cells the angular persistence increased after the induction of <italic>VSG</italic> RNAi (-0.18 ± 0.03 units to 0.10 ± 0.04) which is significantly higher than in bi-flagellated cells in the untreated population (***P&lt;0.0001).</p>
<p>At the population level, the heterogeneity of motility phenotypes was greater in cells where VSG synthesis was blocked compared with the non-induced population, possibly due to variance in penetrance of the <italic>VSG RNAi</italic> phenotype between cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006023.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). However, in general there was a clear increase in directional swimming in cells where VSG synthesis had been blocked. We have shown earlier that blocking VSG synthesis results in stalled cells which are shorter and broader than normal, although the cell volume remains unchanged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref013">13</xref>]. We postulated that this changed morphology could be a consequence of the cell attempting to minimise its surface area-to-volume ratio (i.e. become more spherical) in the face of restricted VSG. One would expect that cells with a restricted VSG coat would also be more rigid than normal. This could be expected to reduce their ability to flex, which could explain the reduced tumbling movement that we observe.</p>
<p>These motility changes were striking, and could possibly explain the observed reduction in clearance of anti-VSG antibodies. It is possible that cell surface flexing on the tumbling trypanosome generates localised hydrodynamic forces facilitating the movement of VSG-antibody complexes toward the flagellar pocket. These forces could be as significant for immune complex removal as those operating on a directionally swimming trypanosome. Therefore the motility changes that we observe in cells where VSG synthesis has been blocked, possibly play a direct role in the reduced selective clearance of anti-VSG complexes from the cell surface.</p>
<p>In summary, these results highlight the importance of efficient removal of anti-VSG antibodies from the trypanosome cell surface to allow <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> evasion from phagocytosis of host macrophages, and identify the rapid removal of host opsonins as being a key virulence factor in a trypanosome infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we investigate the role of the VSG coat and its recycling in the phagocytosis of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> by macrophages. We find that blocking VSG synthesis results in a significant increase in macrophage phagocytosis of trypanosomes, but only in the presence of anti-VSG antibodies. Blocking VSG synthesis for 8 hours resulted in reduced rates of clearance of anti-VSG antibodies. This was particularly pronounced in G2/ M stage cells, where the half-life of the anti-VSG antibody increased about two and a half fold from 39.3 ± 4.2 seconds to 99 ± 15.9 seconds. There was specifically a perturbation in the removal of VSG-antibody complexes, as rates of internalisation of total biotinylated surface VSG were not significantly changed after blocking VSG synthesis. There was no evidence for a restriction operating around the flagellar pocket of the stalled cells, as VSG antibody still reached the lysosomal compartment after a VSG synthesis block, although at slower rates than normal. Rates of endocytosis of various endocytic markers including tomato lectin, dextran or transferrin were not significantly reduced in the stalled cells. Motility was altered in the arrested cells, resulting in cells which swam persistently rather than tumbling. We postulate that these motility changes play a direct role in the reduced clearance of anti-VSG antibodies that we observe. These experiments shed light on <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> evasion of macrophages. In addition, they highlight the essentiality of high rates of VSG synthesis and internalisation coupled with VSG quality control in removing host cell opsonins, thereby enabling trypanosome escape from host phagocytes.</p>
<p>The experiments where trypanosomes were co-cultivated with macrophages demonstrated how effectively wild-type bloodstream form <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> normally evades ingestion by phagocytes. After macrophages had been co-cultivated with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> for 60 minutes, only a small percentage (2.7 ± 2.3%) had ingested trypanosomes. Phagocytosis was increased in the presence of host opsonins. The addition of anti-VSG antibody produced the most striking increase, with the addition of mouse complement having a relatively minor effect. However, the highest (and statistically significant) levels of phagocytosis were observed after pre-treatment of the trypanosomes with both anti-VSG antibodies as well as complement (with 16.4 ± 6.0% of the macrophages showing internalised flagella). These results therefore highlight the importance of host opsonins, and specifically the classical pathway of complement activation in the recognition and subsequent phagocytosis of trypanosomes by professional phagocytes including macrophages, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref047">47</xref>].</p>
<p>Our experimental approach investigates trypanosome removal of anti-VSG221 antibodies derived from hyperimmune polyclonal rabbit serum, which can be expected to be highly enriched for the IgG isotype. In contrast, the IgM isotype would be likely to be more abundant early during a trypanosome infection, although its relative importance for trypanosome clearance has been disputed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref048">48</xref>]. Both antibody isotypes can be efficiently removed by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> from the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref024">24</xref>], and we do not think that these differences significantly impact on our findings.</p>
<p>Macrophages have a variety of surface receptors for these host molecules, including different types of Fc receptors which bind the Fc regions of IgM or IgG antibodies coating microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref049">49</xref>]. Alternatively, macrophage binding can operate through complement proteins deposited through either the alternative or the classical pathway of complement activation. In the alternative pathway, complement C3 is cleaved, and the opsonin C3b plus its degradation products including iC3b are deposited directly on the microbial surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref035">35</xref>]. Monocytes and macrophages have different surface receptors for these host proteins. These include CR1, CR3 and CR4 which bind the C3b and iC3b coated microorganisms, thereby facilitating recognition and phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref034">34</xref>]. However, in the classical pathway, the complement protein C1q binds the Fc region of IgG or IgM antibodies coating microorganisms, which can then be recognised by macrophage receptors including CR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref050">50</xref>]. The synergistic effect of adding both anti-VSG antibodies and normal mouse serum on trypanosome phagocytosis that we observed, is presumably a consequence of improved macrophage recognition of parasites opsonised with antibodies as well as different types of complement proteins (including C3b, iC3b and C1q) indicating the importance of the classical pathway. These experiments emphasise the vital importance for <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> of rapidly removing host opsonins from its surface, before these can be recognised by macrophage cell surface receptors.</p>
<p>Blocking VSG synthesis for 8 hours did not result in a statistically significant increase in macrophage phagocytosis of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, despite this resulting in the preponderance of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> population (&gt;65%) arresting precytokinesis as stalled bi-flagellated cells. This was not significantly affected by the addition of normal mouse serum. However, in the presence of anti-VSG antibodies, there was a striking increase in macrophage phagocytosis of trypanosomes, with up to 34% of the macrophages containing internalised flagella. Activated macrophages were able to internalise multiple trypanosomes, with many phagocytes ingesting more than four parasites. Even under optimal conditions, not all macrophages phagocytosed trypanosomes. This was presumably a consequence of heterogeneity in macrophage activation state after treatment with LPS and interferon γ, as appears to have been observed earlier in the mouse RAW264.7 cell line used in these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>We show that the increased phagocytosis of trypanosomes in the presence of anti-VSG antibodies after the induction of a VSG synthesis block, appears to be a direct consequence of a reduction in rates of antibody clearance from the trypanosome cell surface. After the induction of <italic>VSG221</italic> RNAi, VSG antibody half-life on the cell surface increased significantly from 36.7 ± 3.7 seconds to 79.0 ± 12.8 seconds. This was most striking in G2/ M cells where the surface anti-VSG antibody half-life increased about two and a half fold from 39.3 ± 4.2 to 99.2 ± 15.9 seconds. Surprisingly, this reduced clearance of anti-VSG antibody in the arrested cells did not appear to be a consequence of reduced rates of internalisation of bulk surface VSG. Similarly, there did not appear to be a restriction operating on flagellar pocket access. After blocking VSG synthesis, surface anti-VSG antibody could still enter the pocket and progress through the endocytic system to the lysosome, although at slower rates than normal.</p>
<p>Endocytosis at the flagellar pocket in bloodstream form <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> involves clathrin coated pits which bud off the cellular membrane and shed their clathrin lattice, forming early endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref053">53</xref>]. Although we found that blocking VSG synthesis resulted in decreased clearance of anti-VSG antibodies from the cell surface, we did not find significant disruption in rates of endocytosis of either bulk VSG or various markers for either receptor mediated or fluid phase endocytosis. This would indicate that the reduced clearance of surface antibodies that we observed was not due to a clear endocytic defect.</p>
<p>However, the induction of a VSG synthesis block did result in significant changes in the motility of the stalled cells. Trypanosome swim speeds are thought to be instrumental for the efficient removal of anti-VSG antibodies from the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref024">24</xref>], which is favoured at swim speeds much higher than those observed under standard <italic>in vitro</italic> culturing conditions which are lower viscosity than blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref054">54</xref>]. The swim speed of bloodstream form <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> 427 grown at 37°C under standard tissue culture conditions varies between 1.5 to 5.7 μm/ sec [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref055">55</xref>]. Although our observed swim speed is low (1.5 μm/ sec), we did not repeat these experiments in high viscosity media, as we were interested in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> motility under the conditions used for the macrophage co-cultivation experiments.</p>
<p>Populations of bloodstream form <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> typically contain cells with a variety of different swimming behaviours varying from persistent directional swimming to tumbling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref057">57</xref>]. Cell microenvironment affects this motility, whereby trypanosomes cultured in the low viscosities of tissue culture media predominantly tumble [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref054">54</xref>]. In <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> swimming becomes faster and more directional as the viscosity of the culture medium is increased up to values found in blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref054">54</xref>]. In addition to the effect of the microenvironment, cellular features have been argued to affect trypanosome motility as straighter rigid cells would be expected to swim more directionally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref057">57</xref>].</p>
<p>Our bloodstream form <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> showed primarily tumbling behaviour <italic>in vitro</italic> as would be expected under low viscosity conditions, but the induction of a VSG synthesis block resulted in a significant increase in the number of cells which swam directionally. There was a significant increase in velocity (or directional swimming) of these stalled cells, although the mean swim speed did not significantly increase either in the whole population or in bi-flagellated cells which comprise the majority of the population (&gt;65%). Cells stalled after the induction of a VSG synthesis block arrest at a precise precytokinesis stage, although these stalled cells differ from wild type precytokinesis cells. The arrested cells are shorter and broader than normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref013">13</xref>], although the total cell volume is unchanged compared with normal precytokinesis cells. This change in morphology in the absence of sufficient VSG could be a consequence of a restriction operating on the VSG surface coat, resulting in increased cellular rigidity. As increased cellular rigidity (as well as an increase in cell width) would be expected to result in increased directional swimming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref057">57</xref>], this could explain why our stalled bi-flagellated cells swim more directionally than wild type bi-flagellated cells.</p>
<p>Selective clearance of VSG-antibody complexes is thought to be facilitated by hydrodynamic forces operating on the trypanosome cell surface generated by directional swimming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref024">24</xref>]. However, even in tumbling cells there is posterior accumulation of anti-VSG immune complexes at the flagellar pocket. Our uninduced cells predominantly tumble, yet clear anti-VSG antibodies, showing that directional swimming is not essential for all antibody clearance. The induction of a VSG synthesis block results in directionally swimming cells with reduced antibody clearance. It is therefore possible that the flexing activity on the cell surface of a tumbling trypanosome generates localised hydrodynamic forces which directly facilitate the selective movement of VSG-antibody complexes over the cell surface. These forces could be as important in removing surface VSG-antibody complexes as the forces generated through directional swimming through the “wind in the sail” model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref024">24</xref>]. Our observed changes in motility possibly directly explain why there is decreased removal of VSG-antibody complexes after the induction of VSG RNAi. This would argue that the exact characteristics of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> motility in the bloodstream could play an important role in removing immune complexes, and therefore in parasite virulence.</p>
<p>Our results therefore shed light on several issues. First of all, they highlight the importance of continued VSG synthesis for the bloodstream form parasite in immune evasion. Blocking VSG synthesis results in viable stalled cells with intact VSG coats which persist for days <italic>in vitro</italic>. This lead to the proposal that this cell cycle arrest could be a parasite safety mechanism preventing a trypanosome from dividing in the absence of enough VSG to coat the two daughter cells. This could potentially have a protective function <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, the protective nature of this cell-cycle checkpoint would only operate in the absence of significant anti-VSG antibody titres. The experiments that we show here, argue that in a host that has been infected long enough to develop a significant antibody response, these stalled cells would be preferentially removed by phagocytes as a consequence of reduced clearance of anti-VSG antibodies.</p>
<p>Secondly, our results directly demonstrate the essentiality of rapid removal of host opsonins from the trypanosome cell surface for effective escape from host macrophages. To the best of our knowledge, these experiments are the first to show that an experimental perturbation leading to reduced clearance of anti-VSG antibodies directly results in increased trypanosome phagocytosis by macrophages. Lastly, we hypothesise that the motility changes observed after induction of a VSG synthesis block play a direct role in VSG-immune complex removal. These experimental data therefore highlight the importance of high rates of VSG recycling in the removal of host cell opsonins from the trypanosome cell surface, thereby allowing the efficient evasion of professional phagocytes including macrophages during a chronic infection. We therefore show that the cellular processes of high rates of VSG internalisation coupled with VSG quality control are key virulence factors enabling <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> to be a highly successful extracellular pathogen.</p>

Macrophages were plated onto glass coverslips (22x 22 mm) in 6-well plates (1x 10<sup>6</sup> per well), and allowed to adhere for two hours at 37°C. In order to trigger classical macrophage activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref031">31</xref>], macrophages were primed with LPS (Lipopolysaccharides <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>) at 100 ng/ ml and mouse IFN-γ (interferon gamma) at 20 ng/ ml 24 hours prior to co-cultivation with trypanosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>For the macrophage phagocytosis experiments, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> 221VG1.1 (3 x 10<sup>6</sup>) was opsonised with 10% normal mouse serum (NMS) for 30 minutes at 37°C in HMI-9 medium supplemented with 15% FCS. Complement-rich NMS was obtained from CD-1 mice, and is a kind gift of Prof. Paul Morgan (University of Cardiff). CD-1 mice are wild type for complement C5 as well as other components of the terminal complement pathway, and have functional serum complement activity of the classical, lectin and alternative complement pathways at the level of C9 activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006023.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref063">63</xref>]. Alternatively, trypanosomes were incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-VSG221 antibody (gift of Jay Bangs, SUNY Buffalo) in the presence or absence of NMS for 30 minutes at 37°C.

<p>During the macrophage phagocytosis assay, trypanosomes were co-cultured with RAW264.7 macrophages for one hour at 37°C. Culture medium was removed from each well, and the cells were fixed immediately with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 minutes at room temperature.

Cells were observed by bright-field light videomicroscopy using a Leica DM5500B microscope with a 10X NA 0.40 objective lens on a focal point midway through the sample depth. Each image was captured every 200 millisecond (5 Hz) for 512 frames (1.7 minutes) with an exposure time of 1 millisecond. Analysis of the videomicrographs was performed using custom designed macros on ImageJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006023.ref064">64</xref>]. Particles were identified using an intensity maxima algorithm. Tracks were constructed for each cell by finding the nearest particle to the expected cell location based on its motion in the previous two frames.
