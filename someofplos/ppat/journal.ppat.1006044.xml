<article-title>A resource allocation trade-off between virulence and proliferation drives metabolic versatility in the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>Experimental evolution of the plant pathogen <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic>, where bacteria were maintained on plant lineages for more than 300 generations, revealed that several independent single mutations in the <italic>efpR</italic> gene from populations propagated on beans were associated with fitness gain on bean. In the present work, novel allelic <italic>efpR</italic> variants were isolated from populations propagated on other plant species, thus suggesting that mutations in <italic>efpR</italic> were not solely associated to a fitness gain on bean, but also on additional hosts. A transcriptomic profiling and phenotypic characterization of the <italic>efpR</italic> deleted mutant showed that EfpR acts as a global catabolic repressor, directly or indirectly down-regulating the expression of multiple metabolic pathways. EfpR also controls virulence traits such as exopolysaccharide production, swimming and twitching motilities and deletion of <italic>efpR</italic> leads to reduced virulence on tomato plants after soil drenching inoculation. We studied the impact of the single mutations that occurred in <italic>efpR</italic> during experimental evolution and found that these allelic mutants displayed phenotypic characteristics similar to the deletion mutant, although not behaving as complete loss-of-function mutants. These adaptive mutations therefore strongly affected the function of <italic>efpR</italic>, leading to an expanded metabolic versatility that should benefit to the evolved clones. Altogether, these results indicated that EfpR is a novel central player of the <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic> virulence regulatory network. Independent mutations therefore appeared during experimental evolution in the evolved clones, on a crucial node of this network, to favor adaptation to host vascular tissues through regulatory and metabolic rewiring.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Among plant pathogens of major economic and food crops, <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic>, the causal agent of bacterial wilt, is recognized as one of the most destructive plant bacterial diseases. In addition, the emergence of new pathotypes, more aggressive and adapted to new hosts, has been reported. During an evolution experiment of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic>, where bacteria were maintained on plant lineages for more than 300 generations, we demonstrated that several single mutations in the regulatory gene <italic>efpR</italic> were associated with fitness gain on plants. However, the function of the EfpR regulator was totally unknown. In this work, we provided evidence that EfpR controls several metabolic pathways and important virulence traits of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic>. We then demonstrated that the single mutations selected in the <italic>efpR</italic> gene during the evolution experiment strongly alter the <italic>efpR</italic> expression, and thus enlarge the metabolic capacities of the bacterial cell. Altogether, our study reveals that EfpR is a novel key component of the complex regulatory network of the <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic> cell, tightly linking the bacterial metabolism to virulence in response to multiple environmental signals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bacterial plant pathogens constitute a major threat to crop production. In addition, disease emergence can occur through rapid adaptation of many pathogens to new hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref002">2</xref>]. Understanding how pathogens are adapting to new hosts is crucial for unraveling the mechanisms that drive disease emergence. One way to study evolution of pathogen adaptation to new hosts is to conduct experimental evolution of the pathogen in a given host over hundreds of generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref006">6</xref>]. The combination of experimental evolution with whole-genome sequencing has enabled the characterization of the mutations underlying the within-host fitness gain in various host-pathogen systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>In a previous work, aiming at investigating the genetic bases of host adaptation in the bacterial plant pathogen <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic>, we performed an experimental evolution of strain GMI1000 in different host plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref006">6</xref>]. <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic> is the causal agent of bacterial wilt disease. It is recognized as one of the most destructive bacterial plant diseases affecting an unusually large host range of more than 250 plant species around the world, mainly in warm tropical climates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref008">8</xref>]. <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic> is a soilborne pathogen that infects the plants through the roots, invades the xylem vessels and spreads to aerial parts of the plant through the vascular system where it multiplies extensively and produces large amounts of exopolysaccharide (EPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref009">9</xref>]. To cope with these various soil and plant microenvironments, <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic> has evolved a complex regulatory network that senses key signals and triggers important physiological changes via global shifts in gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref010">10</xref>]. At the center of this virulence regulatory network is the global regulator PhcA, a LysR-type transcriptional regulator that controls expression of many genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Experimental evolution of the GMI1000 strain was conducted by serial passage experiments (SPE) from one plant individual to another in order to maintain the pathogen population in the same host for over 300 bacterial generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref006">6</xref>]. Five independent lineages of experimentally evolved clones were generated by conducting five parallel SPEs. Phenotypic analysis of the experimentally evolved clones demonstrated that almost 80% of them had an increased fitness in their experimental host compared to the ancestral GMI1000 clone. However, no increase in disease symptom rate was observed whether the experimental plant was a susceptible host or a tolerant host (on which <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic> grows asymptomatically). Interestingly, genomic sequence analysis of the evolved clones revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the <italic>efpR</italic> gene in three of the five lineages evolved on bean, a tolerant host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref006">6</xref>]. A reverse genetic approach in the GMI1000 strain confirmed that the SNPs detected in the <italic>efpR</italic> gene were associated with fitness gain on bean. This gene encodes a putative transcription regulator protein of 113 amino acids belonging to the HTH_XRE (Helix-Turn-Helix_Xenobiotic-Response-Element) superfamily. The <italic>efpR</italic> gene is highly conserved in all the 38 <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic> strains representative of the species complex diversity sequenced to date, with more than 90% protein identity between all strains. This gene is also present in other β-proteobacteria such as <italic>Burkholderia</italic>, <italic>Pandoraea</italic> and <italic>Bordetella</italic> species with more than 80% protein identity. However, the function of the EfpR protein remains unknown.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to determine the functional impact of the mutations in the <italic>efpR</italic> gene, in order to understand how these mutations promote bacterial fitness <italic>in planta</italic>. We performed a transcriptomic profiling of the <italic>efpR</italic>-deleted mutant to assess the impact of EfpR on gene expression and the nature of its targets. We used a system biology approach using the recently published model of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref012">12</xref>] to predict the putative phenotypes associated with the large set of genes differentially expressed. Model predicts were used to drive functional analyses which then revealed that EfpR affects several metabolic pathways and important virulence traits such as motility and EPS production. We demonstrated that the SNPs selected in the <italic>efpR</italic> gene during the evolution experiment significantly alter the <italic>efpR</italic> expression. This work highlights the importance of EfpR as a global regulator which coordinates the expression of virulence functions to the metabolic status of the bacterial cell.</p>

<title>Mutations in <italic>efpR</italic> provide a fitness advantage on different plant species</title>
<p>We previously identified three SNPs in the <italic>efpR</italic> gene from bacterial populations evolved on bean plants and these mutations were associated to the fitness gain on this host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref006">6</xref>]. We investigated whether mutations in <italic>efpR</italic> also occurred in populations evolved in plant species other than bean. In a previous work, mutations in <italic>efpR</italic> were not detected in three independent populations propagated on tomato (populations A, B and E) and in three independent populations propagated on cabbage (populations A, B and C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref006">6</xref>]. Here, we conducted further analyses in 14 additional independent populations (populations C and D propagated on tomato, populations D and E propagated on cabbage, five independent populations propagated on eggplant and five independent populations propagated on melon). This analysis was conducted using a similar PCR / sequencing approach on 96 clones randomly isolated from each population as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref006">6</xref>]. Three new SNPs in <italic>efpR</italic> resulting in non-synonymous mutations were detected: a R97Q mutation in tomato<sub>[population C]</sub>, a R98W mutation in eggplant<sub>[population A]</sub>, and a F44C mutation in melon<sub>[population B]</sub>. This observation suggested that mutations in <italic>efpR</italic> were not solely associated to a fitness gain on bean, but also on additional hosts.</p>
<p>We tested this hypothesis by determining if the <italic>efpR</italic> mutation D49N selected on bean also conferred a fitness gain when bacteria were inoculated on other hosts (tomato and cabbage), using the same conditions as previously reported for bean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref006">6</xref>]. Competition assays were performed using the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant (GRS704), the allelic mutant <italic>efpR</italic><sup>D49N</sup> (GRS886) and the complemented strain (GRS705) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006044.t001">Table 1</xref>). The competitive index (CI) was determined for each strain after two passages in plant stem (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Materials and Methods</xref>). The results showed that both the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant and the allelic mutant <italic>efpR</italic><sup>D49N</sup> had a mean CI significantly superior to the mean CI with the complemented strain in tomato (Wilcoxon test, <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.016 and 0.016, respectively) and in cabbage (Wilcoxon test, <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.028 and 0.016, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006044.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). These results demonstrated that both the deletion of <italic>efpR</italic> and the bean-<italic>efpR</italic> allele (<italic>efpR</italic><sup>D49N</sup>) also improve bacterial fitness on other plants in addition to bean.</p>

<title>EfpR is a global regulator affecting gene expression involved in metabolic processes</title>
<p>The global transcriptomes of the WT (wild-type strain GMI1000) and the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant were determined using an RNA-sequencing approach of strains grown in minimal media supplemented with 20 mM glutamate. All samples rendered between 10 and 15 million of <italic>Ralstonia</italic>-mapped reads, with the exception of one replicate for the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant (i.e. GRS704.R1), which rendered 37 million mapped-reads.</p>
<p>Comparative analysis of RNA-seq data was conducted by considering differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as those producing a Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.05 and presenting an absolute Fold Change (|FC|) between strains &gt;2. Using these cutoff values, we found that the total number of DEGs in the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant compared to the WT strain was 877 genes, including 522 up- and 355 down-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006044.s006">S1 Table</xref>). Those genes represent 17% of all GMI1000 predicted genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref013">13</xref>]. One third of the DEGs encoded hypothetical proteins, including 148 up- and 160 down-regulated genes, and 1/15 of the DEGs encoded predicted transcription factors, including 34 up- and 27 down-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006044.s006">S1 Table</xref>). However, these proportions were not significantly more than the random expectation based on the proportion of hypothetical proteins or transcription factors in the GMI000 genome. Among the predicted transcription factors that were differentially expressed in the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant, the RSc3149 gene, which was one of the highest up-regulated genes (Fold Change = 8.12), is an EfpR homolog with 79% protein identity with the EfpR protein sequence.</p>
<p>In order to get insights into the biological functions regulated by EfpR we performed a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on DEGs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Materials and Methods</xref>). Among the GO terms significantly enriched, metabolism-related terms were particularly abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006044.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006044.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Specifically, genes involved in several catabolic pathways, like amino acid and organic acid catabolism, were enriched in the EfpR-dependent up-regulated DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006044.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In addition, genes involved in secondary metabolism (siderophore and thiamine cofactor biosynthesis) and in plant associated functions were also enriched in the EfpR-dependent up-regulated DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006044.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In the EfpR-dependent down-regulated DEGs, genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and transporters were found to be enriched, as well as genes involved in cell cycle functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006044.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis of EfpR-DEGs using genome-scale metabolic models predicted a role of EfpR in virulence and catabolism repression</title>
<p>The GO enrichment analysis indicated that metabolic pathways are particularly enriched in the EfpR regulon. Thus, we took advantage of the recently reconstructed genome-scale metabolic model of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref012">12</xref>] to infer the causal relationship between the EfpR-dependent DEGs (EfpR-DEGs) and metabolic processes.</p>
<p>We first conducted phenotype simulations using flux balance analysis with the EfpR-DEGs as constraints (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Materials and Methods</xref>). A total of 16 phenotypes were tested in 7 different environments (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006044.s007">S2 Table</xref> for the list of phenotypes and environments tested). This analysis revealed that 13 out of the 16 phenotypes tested were affected by the EfpR-DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006044.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Among them are several virulence-related phenotypes like EPS production, swimming and twitching motility, and secretion of type III effectors, but also other biological functions like biomass production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006044.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Only 3 phenotypes were not found to be affected by the EfpR-DEGs: the production of specific secondary metabolites, the biosynthesis of storage macromolecules and energy production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006044.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>Since the GO analysis revealed enrichment in catabolic processes, we also tested the involvement of EfpR-DEGs in various catabolic capacities. We thus tested the catabolism of 58 substrates known to encompass around 90% of the substrates used by <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref012">12</xref>]. This analysis revealed that the EfpR-DEGs were involved in the catabolism of 19 compounds out of the 58 tested (31%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006044.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). These substrates were mainly amino acids and organic acids, in agreement with the GO enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006044.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Among the 19 compounds for which catabolism was affected by the EfpR-DEGs, 15 were gained in the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant due to up-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006044.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). These predictions further suggest a role of EfpR in catabolic repression.</p>

<title>Evidence that deletion of <italic>efpR</italic> enlarges the <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic> catabolic capacities</title>
<p>In order to validate the phenotypes predicted to be EfpR-dependent, we conducted an analysis of the catabolic capacities of the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant by using metabolic phenotype microarrays. This revealed that the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant possessed a wider substrate usage capacity than the WT strain. Indeed the mutant was able to significantly better catabolize 65 substrates, but could also use 12 substrates not catabolized by the WT strain in these conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006044.s003">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006044.s004">S4</xref> Figs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006044.s008">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006044.s009">S4</xref> Tables). The metabolic capacities of the complemented strain were similar to those of the WT strain.</p>
<p>Among the carbon and nitrogen sources that were poorly used by the WT strain, gamma-Amino-n-Butyric Acid (GABA) and L-Glutamate were significantly better used as carbon sources, likewise Sodium Nitrite, L-Serine and L-Pyroglutamic acid were significantly better used as nitrogen sources by the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006044.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Even among the carbon and nitrogen sources that were not used by the WT strain, this analysis revealed that the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant possessed a high efficiency to catabolize L-Alanine and L-Histidine as carbon sources, Adenine as nitrogen source and L-Proline both as carbon and nitrogen sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006044.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The ability to catabolize L-Glutamate, L-Proline, L-Histidine and GABA was confirmed by investigating bacterial growth of the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant and the complemented strain in comparison to the WT strain in minimal media supplemented with one of these four carbon sources. The results showed that the growth rate of the mutant on these four carbon sources was significantly increased compared to the WT (Welch t-test, <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;1.32e-3, 3.49e-4, 6.80e-6, and 1.06e-2, respectively) and the complemented strains (Welch t-test, <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;1.04e-4, 3.69e-4, 1.06e-6 and 1.07e-2, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006044.g004">Fig 4</xref>). All these data suggested that EfpR plays a major role in a catabolic repression operating in the bacterial cell.</p>

<title><italic>efpR</italic> loss of function enhances <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic> swimming and twitching motility</title>
<p>The EfpR-DEGs analysis predicted that motility is affected in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006044.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Motility is considered as one of the key factors determining the ability of the bacteria to colonize the roots of their host plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref016">16</xref>].

<p>Comparison of the swimming halo diameters after 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hours between the different strains showed that the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant had a significant wider mean diameter during the whole growth kinetic compared to the WT (Mann-Whitney test, <italic>p</italic>-value = 4.47e-8, 3.97e-8, 3.69e-8, 4.31e-8 and 4.84e-8, respectively) and compared to the complemented strain (Mann-Whitney test, <italic>p</italic>-value = 3.44e-8, 3.26e-8, 4.25e-8, 5.31e-8 and 5.32e-8, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006044.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). After 72 hours, the mean diameter of the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant was 44.55 ± 1.43 mm while the mean diameters of the WT and the complemented strains were 29.9 ± 1.86 mm and 26.85 ± 1.28 mm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006044.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). From these data, we could estimate a speed of movement by swimming motility for each strain. The mean speed for the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant was 0.81 ± 0.03 mm.h<sup>-1</sup>, significantly higher than the mean speed for the WT and the complemented strains (Welch t-test, <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;2.2e-16), which were 0.54 ± 0.04 mm.h<sup>-1</sup> and 0.49 ± 0.02 mm.h<sup>-1</sup>, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we investigated the role of the <italic>efpR</italic> gene, a gene involved in adaptation of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic> to various host plants, discovered during an experimental evolution where bacteria were maintained on plant lineages for more than 300 generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref006">6</xref>]. This former study showed that the fitness gain of the evolved bacteria was associated to SNPs within the <italic>efpR</italic> sequence. A similar fitness gain was obtained by deleting <italic>efpR</italic>. In the present study, we provide evidence that EfpR is mainly a repressor of gene expression (60% of the DEGs), suggesting that the mutations in <italic>efpR</italic> selected during the experimental evolution led to the de-repression of biological functions contributing to the observed fitness gain. Indeed, our data showed that EfpR regulates, directly or indirectly, a large number of genes (about 17% of the WT genes displayed a differential expression in the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant). As a consequence, EfpR controls many metabolic pathways and virulence-associated traits. Similar changes in global gene expression through mutations affecting regulatory network components have been observed in evolution experiments conducted with bacteria and appear to be a first and rapid adaptive response to novel environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Based on the transcriptomic profiling of the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant and flux balance analysis using the genome-scale model of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic>, we predicted several candidate functions to be controlled by EfpR. Phenotypic and functional characterization of the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant first confirmed that this mutant has an expanded metabolic versatility since it is able to catabolize 65 carbon and nitrogen substrates better than the WT strain, including 12 substrates that the WT strain is unable to use in our conditions. Interestingly, this increased substrate usage pattern matches well with the list of carbon sources identified in the xylem of tomato plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref019">19</xref>]. Indeed, many amino acid identified in tomato xylem fluids, including L-Glutamate, L-Proline, L-Histidine and GABA, are better catabolized by the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant. These results therefore establish that EfpR behaves as a global catabolic repressor in <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic>, directly or indirectly down-regulating multiple metabolic pathways. However, we show that EfpR also controls functions associated to bacterial pathogenesis beyond central metabolism. An <italic>efpR</italic> mutant produces much less EPS than the WT strain, and EPS has been reported to be required for full virulence on plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref009">9</xref>]. This could explain the reduced pathogenicity of the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant when inoculated on tomato plants. From the list of DEGs in the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant, it is probable also that additional factors directly or indirectly linked to virulence are under the control of EfpR. Twitching and swimming motility were also shown to be repressed by EfpR, thus raising the hypothesis that the <italic>efpR</italic> mutant may have an increased invasive capacity during plant infection.</p>
<p>In order to get a better understanding of the impact of the <italic>efpR</italic> mutations that occurred during the evolution experiment, the three different SNPs from the evolved clones in bean were re-created in the WT strain. Interestingly, whatever the position of the SNP in the <italic>efpR</italic> gene, the three allelic mutants all shared very similar phenotypic characteristics that were very close, even if not identical, to the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant. Similar enhanced growth rates were observed for the allelic and deleted mutants in presence of various carbon substrates and the allelic mutants were able to significantly catabolize a wider number of carbon and nitrogen substrates than the WT strain, even if this number was less than for the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant. As observed with the Δ<italic>efpR</italic> mutant, virulence of the three allelic mutants was decreased on tomato plants. These results indicate that the <italic>efpR</italic> allelic mutants almost behave as loss-of-function mutants, which was further confirmed by showing that the three different SNPs all lead to a strong decrease in the expression of <italic>efpR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006044.g009">Fig 9</xref>). The residual <italic>efpR</italic> expression detected in the allelic mutants could explain the minor difference observed between the catabolic capacities of the allelic and deleted mutants.</p>
<p>Bacterial adaptation to novel habitats through loss-of-function mutations has recently been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref020">20</xref>], with evidence that such mutations can favor adaptation to novel environments through regulatory and metabolic rewiring. Our findings support the view that the enlarged metabolic capacities of the <italic>efpR</italic> allelic mutants provide the fitness advantage occurring during growth in the plant xylem of different species and explains why such <italic>efpR</italic> mutations were rapidly fixed in the populations during the experimental evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref006">6</xref>]. In addition, the strong impairment of <italic>efpR</italic> mutants to produce EPS could also contribute to this fitness gain since EPS biosynthesis represents a significant metabolic cost for the bacterial cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref012">12</xref>]. It cannot be excluded that the increased motility of <italic>efpR</italic> mutants also provides a competitive advantage over the WT strain by enabling a faster colonization of the host vascular system.</p>
<p>Modeling of the predicted EfpR structure reveals that the mutations detected in bean, tomato, eggplant and melon during the evolution experiment occurred in two main domains of the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006044.s005">S5 Fig</xref>): two SNPs (F44C and D49N) lead to changes in positions in the HTH domain just adjacent to the DNA binding site whereas three other SNPs are located in the exterior domain, inducing changes in charged amino acids (R97Q, R98W) or on the probable folding of the domain (P93Q). This cluster of mutations in this protruding domain is suggestive of a role in interacting with another protein or co-factor and/or that it is critical for EfpR stability. A third SNP is a synonymous mutation occurring in the second codon, presumably altering the gene functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>The experimental evolution scheme developed by Guidot and collaborators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref006">6</xref>] was based on serial passages of bacterial populations which were collected from the xylem of infected stems at the onset of wilting symptoms and then stem-inoculated on the next plant. This experimental procedure therefore avoided the root infection step, which is the natural mode of entry of the soilborne <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic> in its hosts. Our results showed that the <italic>efpR</italic> mutants are significantly reduced in virulence when using ‘natural’ soil drenching infection assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006044.g008">Fig 8</xref>). This probably explains why <italic>efpR</italic> mutations which occurred several times during the experimental evolution might be counter-selected in nature. It is tempting to speculate that EfpR plays an important role during steps of the <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic> life cycle (such as in the soil or during root infection) which were not reproduced during the evolution experiment and which may be advantageous for the pathogen in its natural context.</p>
<p>Altogether the results presented in this study establish that EfpR is a novel player of the complex regulatory network controlling <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic> virulence in response to multiple environmental signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref011">11</xref>]. EfpR is presumably a key component of this network which tightly links the bacterial metabolism to virulence. Beyond EPS production and motility, the prediction of phenotypes affected by EfpR-DEGs suggests that additional functions such as biofilm formation, secondary metabolism and other virulence-associated proteins are also controlled by EfpR. The pleïotropic phenotype of the <italic>efpR</italic> mutant is reminiscent of the phenotype of another key <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic> virulence regulatory gene, <italic>phcA</italic>, identified more than 25 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref022">22</xref>]. As <italic>efpR</italic>, a <italic>phcA</italic> mutant is defective for EPS production and many other virulence factors, and displays an hypermotile phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref022">22</xref>]. More recently, a <italic>phcA</italic> mutant was also found to have an expanded metabolic versatility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref012">12</xref>], being able to metabolize an even wider repertoire of metabolic substrates than the <italic>efpR</italic> mutant. This phenotypic relatedness incited us to explore the existence of functional links between PhcA anf EfpR. Our results indicated that the expression of <italic>efpR</italic> is not significantly altered in a <italic>phcA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006044.g009">Fig 9</xref>) and that <italic>phcA</italic> does not appear to be differentially regulated in the <italic>efpR</italic> mutant background. This suggests that if there is interplay between these two central regulators, this should operate at a post-transcriptional level. Future works will aim at understanding how PhcA anf EfpR jointly orchestrate a tight coupling between catabolic pathways (supporting <italic>in planta</italic> growth) and virulence functions, in a mechanism which appears to be driven by a resource allocation trade-off. The discovery of the role played by EfpR in this process also highlights how the experimental evolution approach helps to uncover a key regulatory component of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic> pathogenicity and adaptation to hosts.</p>

<title>Mapping and analysis of RNAseq data</title>
<p>Read pairs were mapped using the glint software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lipm-bioinfo.toulouse.inra.fr/download/glint/" xlink:type="simple">http://lipm-bioinfo.toulouse.inra.fr/download/glint/</ext-link>) with parameters set as follows: matches ≥40 nucleotides, with ≤3 mismatches, only best-scoring hits taken into account. Ambiguous matches (same best score for several read-pairs) were removed. Finally, between 8.2 and 23.4M non ambiguous read-pairs were obtained. Mapped reads were imported into R environment. The package HTSFilter was used to eliminate very low-expressed genes from the analysis. A total of 5157 out the predicted 5307 genes were thus kept in. R package DESeq2 was used to normalize and complete the differential analysis by conducting the built-in Wald test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref028">28</xref>]. The <italic>p</italic>-values thus obtained were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref029">29</xref>].

<title>Prediction of EfpR phenotypes from DEGs</title>
<p>Predictions of bacterial phenotypes were performed by Flux Balance Analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref032">32</xref>] using the genome-scale metabolic network model of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>solanacearum</italic> GMI1000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref012">12</xref>]. Simulations were conducted using the software FlexFlux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref033">33</xref>]. Predictions of the phenotypes feasibility were done by optimizing the metabolic fluxes corresponding to each phenotype using the DEGs as constraint. Two sets of DEGs constraints were used corresponding to the up-regulated genes set and the down-regulated genes set. Indeed, the states of the genes in the DEGs sets were set to 0. This simulated the behavior of genes which are not expressed or deleted. Thus, by doing so, we assessed the essentiality of the DEGs sets for the various phenotypes. Predictions were conducted considering various environmental conditions as constraints. These environmental conditions correspond to different composition of the surrounding of the cells, <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in planta</italic>. Hence, uptake of a substrate was possible, i.e. exchange fluxes can be &gt;0, only if the compounds are present in the environment. A set of 7 environmental conditions were tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006044.s007">S2 Table</xref>). Then, the probability of the phenotypes to be affected by the EfpR-DEGs sets was assessed by calculating the number of environments in which the phenotype was affected on the number of environments tested.</p>

<title>Phenotype microarray</title>
<p>Phenotypic microarrays were performed using Biolog Phenotype Microarray plates PM01, PM02 and PM03 according to the constructor protocol with the following modifications. Before inoculation of Biolog fluid IF-0, the cells were collected from a static culture on plate containing agar BG medium and resuspended in 15 ml sterile H<sub>2</sub>O supplemented with D-glucose at 20 mM with an OD<sub>600nm</sub> between 0.3 and 0.5. The bacterial cells were then incubated during 6h at 28°C and 180 rpm agitation. This step, which starved the bacteria for nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfate, was found to reduce the background observed in PM03. D-glucose at 20 mM concentration was used as carbon source for the inoculation of the PM03 plate. The measurements were recorded on Omnilog reader (Biolog) during 82.5 hours.

<p>The structure of EfpR bounded to DNA was predicted using I-TASSER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006044.ref040">40</xref>] and the drawing was done using UCSF Chimera. Accuracy of the I-TASSER prediction corresponds to a C-score of -1.18, a TM-score of 0.57± 0.15, and a RMSD of 6.6±4 Å. The EfpR surface is drawn in white, the binding site in the Helix-Turn-Helix (HTH) domain is in dark blue, and the DNA is in light blue. The binding site corresponds to the NCBI Blast prediction: the sequence specific DNA binding site contains the residues 39, 40, 51, 54, 58, 59; the non-specific DNA binding site residues are 29, 33, 58 and the salt bridges involved residues 57, 32. The mutated (non-synonymous) residues are colored in green (P93Q and D49N) for mutations isolated from bean, in red (R97Q) for Tomato, purple (R98W) for Eggplant and orange (F44C) for Melon.</p>
