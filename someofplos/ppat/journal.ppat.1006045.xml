<abstract>
<p>Prion diseases are fatal, progressive, neurodegenerative diseases caused by prion accumulation in the brain and lymphoreticular system. Here we report that a single subcutaneous injection of cellulose ethers (CEs), which are commonly used as inactive ingredients in foods and pharmaceuticals, markedly prolonged the lives of mice and hamsters intracerebrally or intraperitoneally infected with the 263K hamster prion. CEs provided sustained protection even when a single injection was given as long as one year before infection. These effects were linked with persistent residues of CEs in various tissues. More effective CEs had less macrophage uptake ratios and hydrophobic modification of CEs abolished the effectiveness. CEs were significantly effective in other prion disease animal models; however, the effects were less remarkable than those observed in the 263K prion-infected animals. The genetic background of the animal model was suggested to influence the effects of CEs. CEs did not modify prion protein expression but inhibited abnormal prion protein formation in vitro and in prion-infected cells. Although the mechanism of CEs in vivo remains to be solved, these findings suggest that they aid in elucidating disease susceptibility and preventing prion diseases.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Prion diseases are progressive, fatal, neurodegenerative transmissible illnesses in humans and animals caused by prion accumulation in the brain and lymphoreticular system. Because they are prevalent in nature, with atypical forms continuing to emerge, prion diseases are potential threats to both public health and the economy. However, there are no effective methods to prevent these diseases. Here we report that cellulose ethers (CEs), which are non-digestible water-soluble polysaccharides that are commonly used as inactive ingredients in foods and pharmaceuticals, show prophylactic efficacy in prion-infected animals. CEs persist in various tissues and confer sustained preventive efficacy for years, suggesting that they help to prevent prion diseases. Although the enteral absorption of CEs is limited, we found that a portion of the absorbed CEs influences disease progression. Therefore, CEs may be useful to assess disease susceptibility and prevent disease occurrence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are fatal neurodegenerative conditions caused by prion accumulation in the brain and lymphoreticular system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref001">1</xref>]. Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease is the most common human prion disease that sporadically occurs mostly in the elderly. The number of cases of human prion disease is very small at a few cases per million persons, but the prevalence has been gradually increasing in accordance with the aging of society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref002">2</xref>]. Despite recent tremendous therapeutic developments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref006">6</xref>], remedies or preventive measures to inhibit disease progression or achieve significantly beneficial improvements have not yet been established.</p>
<p>In animal prion diseases such as scrapie in sheep and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, not only classical but also atypical, cases are known to sporadically occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref007">7</xref>]. In addition, cervine prion diseases such as chronic wasting disease are prevalent in domesticated as well as wild animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref008">8</xref>]. These animal prion diseases have become potential threats to public health and the economy. In particular, the issue of chronic wasting disease in wild animals is serious because affected animals or prion-carriers are difficult to eliminate, prions of chronic wasting disease are shed into excreta, and prions resist decomposition in soil and cadavers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref008">8</xref>]. No means for preventing these animal diseases have been established, and development of prophylactic measures such as vaccines has long been awaited. However, prions are not efficiently eliminated by the immune system, which has stalled efforts to develop safe effective vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>In our early study on the development of a certain anti-prion compound, we noticed that not only anti-prion compound-containing tablets but also placebo tablets prolonged the lifespan of peripherally prion-infected animals. Subsequent analysis of the tablet ingredients revealed that cellulose ethers (CEs) modified disease progression of the prion-infected animals. Here we report the anti-prion prophylactic efficacy of CEs, which have remarkable post- and pre-infection protective effects of a single injection into prion-infected animals. These compounds are non-digestible, non-ionic, water-soluble, polysaccharide derivatives commonly used as inactive ingredients in foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. We also examined the effectiveness of CEs when administered at various times post- or pre-infection in prion-infected animals. In addition, we examined the pharmacokinetics, biological features, structure-activity relationships, and effectiveness of CEs in other prion disease models, and mechanism of action. Finally the significance of the findings is discussed.</p>

<title>Post-infection prophylactic effects</title>
<p>Hydroxypropyl methylcelluloses (HPMCs) were mainly used in this study because these compounds are the most popularly utilized CEs. First, we analyzed the post-infection effectiveness of HPMCs, which had similar contents of methyl modification [<italic>ca</italic>. 1.91 mol/anhydrous glucose unit (AGU)] and hydroxypropyl modification (0.24 mol/AGU), but different viscosities. Chemical summaries and cumulative molar masses of molecular weight distribution of HPMCs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006045.g001">Fig 1a</xref>. It is obvious that depending on the viscosity, each HPMC had a distinct molecular weight distribution of polymers with certain ranges of molecular sizes.</p>

<p>Because it is expected that macromolecules are not delivered from the blood to the brain parenchyma through the blood–brain barrier, HPMCs were continuously infused into the cerebral ventricle to bypass the blood–brain barrier, as described in a previous study on pentosan polysulfate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref012">12</xref>]. A 4-week continuous intracerebroventricular infusion (150 μg/day) of HPMC samples when given 3 days post-infection (dpi) demonstrated remarkable extension of survival times in Tg7 mice expressing hamster prion protein (PrP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref015">15</xref>] intracerebrally infected with the hamster-adapted 263K prion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref016">16</xref>]. Although two of the most viscous HPMC samples could not be tested because of difficulty in handling the solution, the most effective was 60SH-50, which extended the median survival time by about 4-fold (62 days → 238 days), as compared to the vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006045.g001">Fig 1b</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, unlike the case of previously reported macromolecules, such as pentosan polysulfate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref012">12</xref>], it was interesting that a single subcutaneous injection (4 g/kg body weight) of HPMCs when given immediately after infection, demonstrated remarkable extension of survival times in Tg7 mice intracerebrally infected with the 263K prion. The most effective was also 60SH-50, which extended the median survival time by about 3-fold (48 days → 155.5 days), as compared to the vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006045.g001">Fig 1c</xref>).</p>
<p>When the median survival time (% of vehicle control) of HPMC-treated animals was plotted against HPMC viscosity, efficacy was obviously related to viscosity. The efficacy–viscosity relationships were bell-shaped, and an HPMC with a viscosity of approximately 100 mPa•s in a 2% solution at 20°C (equivalent to a 140-glucose-unit size) was most effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006045.g001">Fig 1d</xref>). Meanwhile, CEs as short as hexamers were still effective when administered into the cerebral ventricle, although the effectiveness was not as remarkable as with large-sized CEs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006045.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The relationship between dosage and effectiveness revealed that efficacy was dependent on dosage by either single subcutaneous injection or 4-week continuous intracerebroventricular infusion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006045.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Next, we determined whether variations in methyl or hydroxypropyl modification had any effect on the efficacy of CEs with similar viscosities and found that efficacy was not associated with the variations conferred by methyl or hydroxypropyl modifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006045.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In addition, we investigated whether contaminated materials had any effect on the efficacy of CEs and found that efficacy was not associated with contaminant removal by activated carbon treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006045.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Although age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref017">17</xref>] and sex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref019">19</xref>] are known to affect the incubation times of prion-infected rodents at some instances, but the observed CE efficacy was similar in animals irrespective of these variables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006045.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Post-infection prophylactic effects in peripheral infection</title>
<p>A single injection of a representative HPMC, TC-5RW, into either the peritoneal cavity or the tail vein demonstrated considerable efficacy in intracerebrally infected animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006045.s006">S6a Fig</xref>). However, daily oral administration of TC-5RW to intracerebrally infected animals was not effective, even if it was started before they contracted the infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006045.s006">S6b Fig</xref>). This result may be due to the poor intestinal absorption of CEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the case of peripheral infection such as intraperitoneal infection, CE efficacy was enhanced, as compared to that of intracerebral infection. For instance, daily oral administration of TC-5RW, which was ineffective against intracerebral infection, was remarkably effective, as continuous treatment with a diet containing 15% TC-5RW from 7 dpi extended the median survival times of animals by about 3-fold (98 days → 296 days) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006045.g002">Fig 2a</xref>). A single subcutaneous injection of TC-5RW (4 g/kg body weight) at 3 dpi extended the median survival times of animals by about 6.7-fold (97 days → 651.5 days) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006045.g002">Fig 2b</xref>). The results suggest that even a small amount of CE absorbed through the intestinal tract is effective over a long period of time in case of peripheral infection, although absorption of CEs in the intestinal tract is reportedly very limited when orally administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref020">20</xref>].</p>

<p>When the median survival time (% of vehicle control) of HPMC-treated animals was plotted against the administration timing, efficacy tended to gradually decrease according to the pre-infection interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006045.g004">Fig 4b</xref>). However, there was no significant difference in median survival times between the immediate post-infection intervention group and the 12-month pre-infection intervention group injected with 60SH-50 or 60SH-400. The most potent HPMC in the 12-month pre-infection intervention was slightly more viscous than the most potent HPMC in the post-infection intervention (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006045.g001">1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006045.g004">4c</xref>).</p>
<p>Pre-infection prophylactic effects of CEs were also observed in Syrian hamsters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006045.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). By intraperitoneal infection, 60SH-50 or 60SH-400 extended the survival times of animals treated at the 0-month pre-infection by about 3.8-fold (233 days → about 890 days) and that of animals treated at the 13-month pre-infection by about 2.0- to 2.3-fold (195 days → 398 ~ 449 days). Therefore, it is obvious that even a single administration of CEs not only around the time of infection, but also as long as one year prior to infection, effectively extended the survival times of prion-infected animals.</p>

<title>Pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously injected CE</title>
<p>To elucidate the mechanism of action of CEs, pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously injected radiolabeled TC-5RW were investigated in Tg7 mice. Immediately after injection, radiolabeled TC-5RW was taken up into the blood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006045.s008">S8a Fig</xref>) and excreted in the urine and feces at a rate of 70% of the initial dose within 3 days. Thereafter, it was excreted considerably more slowly, with 20% of the initial dose remaining in the body 2 weeks post-injection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006045.s008">S8b Fig</xref>). GPC analysis indicated that smaller-sized molecules of TC-5RW were preferentially excreted in the urine and feces, and larger-sized molecules remained in the plasma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006045.s008">S8c Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, long-term pharmacokinetics and distribution were investigated in Tg7 mice given a single subcutaneous dose of radiolabeled TC-5RW. Radiolabeled TC-5RW was distributed in various tissues for long periods, but a little was found in the brain parenchyma, where prions accumulate and cause neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006045.g005">Fig 5a and 5b</xref>). Even after 6 months, amounts up to a few percent of the injected dose per gram of tissue or fluid were observed in various body parts, such as the adrenal cortex, choroid plexus, mandibular gland, thyroid gland, lymph, spleen, and skin, whereas less than 0.02 percent of the injected dose per gram of tissue (equivalent to ~10 μg/g tissue) was observed in the brain parenchyma. The elimination half-life of TC-5RW in these tissues was 50–350 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006045.g005">Fig 5c</xref>) and longest elimination half-life periods were observed in the skeletal muscle, adrenal cortex, brain, and testis. GPC analysis revealed that larger portions of administered TC-5RW remained in tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006045.g005">Fig 5d</xref>).

When compared with the data of the median survival times (% of vehicle control) of Tg7 mice treated with a single subcutaneous dose of HPMCs, the macrophage uptake ratio was inversely correlated, particularly with the survival time of 12-month pre-infection intervention, rather than that of the immediate post-infection intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006045.g006">Fig 6b</xref>).

<title>CEs as new anti-prion compounds</title>
<p>The results of the present study revealed that CEs, as new types of anti-prion compounds, can effectively extend the life span of animals infected with prion not only peripherally but also intracerebrally, even though CEs are macromolecules that are hardly capable of reaching the brain parenchyma. CEs share no similarities in their structures or chemical properties with previously reported anti-prion polymers, such as sulfated glycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref026">26</xref>], polyamines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref031">31</xref>], and cationic dendrimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref035">35</xref>]. Unlike these anionic and cationic polymers, CEs are non-ionic but hydrophilic.</p>
<p>The long-lasting efficacy of CEs is an astonishing, distinct feature from any other compounds previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref038">38</xref>]; a single post-infection subcutaneous injection of CEs extended the life spans of peripherally infected mice nearly to natural life spans and extended the life spans of intracerebrally infected mice by 2–3 fold. More astonishing is the pre-exposure prophylactic effects of CEs, as no significant difference in efficacy was observed in the most effective CE administered at an immediate post-infection or at one year pre-infection. No other compounds or biological materials exogenously administered have been reported to achieve these levels of post-infection and pre-infection prophylactic effects in peripherally or intracerebrally prion-infected animals.</p>

<sec id="sec014">
<title>Biological and chemical properties of effective CEs</title>
<p>CE molecules were distributed throughout the body within days after a single subcutaneous injection, and larger-sized portions of the molecules were retained in the body for months. The ability of CE residues to remain in the body is associated with the long-lasting protective effects of CEs. Chemically, the long-lasting protective efficacies of CEs were associated with the molecular size, but not the degree of modification to the methyl or hydroxypropyl group. Biologically, long-lasting protective efficacies were significantly associated with macrophage uptake ratios: CEs less phagocytized by macrophages were more effective. These data appear to be consistent with the structure-activity data, which shown that the efficacies of CEs were abolished by hydrophobic, but not hydrophilic, modifications. This can be explained by the findings of Tabata and Ikada who reported that microspheres with hydrophobic surfaces are more readily phagocytized than those with hydrophilic surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref039">39</xref>]. Therefore, it is presumable that macrophages play a crucial role in the efficacies of CEs and that phagocytosis facilitates the decomposition or excretion of CEs.</p>

<title>Mechanism of action of CEs</title>
<p>CEs are unlikely to affect the metabolism or turnover of PrP<sup>C</sup> because the expression levels of PrP<sup>C</sup> were not modified in tissues of TC-5RW-treated mice or TC-5RW-treated culture cells. However, CEs might directly inhibit the conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (namely prion formation) in prion-infected animals because of the following findings: TC-5RW inhibited prion formation in the protein misfolding cyclic amplification reaction; CEs were remarkably effective when infused into the cerebroventricular system; and radioactivity of TC-5RW was observed in the brain parenchyma at an amount of less than 10 μg/g tissue equivalent and was eliminated very slowly in the brain parenchyma at a half-life of about one year.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there was a gap in the CE concentration required for inhibition of prion formation among the assay systems. CE concentration of less than 10 μg/g tissue equivalent was needed in the mouse brain, and this concentration appeared to be similar to that of the protein misfolding cyclic amplification reaction (~10 μg/mL), whereas it was different from that of the prion-infected cells (~1 mg/mL). Because the prion strain differed among these assay systems, the CE concentration gap might reflect the prion strain dependency of CE action: significantly effective against the 263K prion, but much less effective against the RML prion. However, it is possible that the mechanism of action of CEs differs among the assay systems, and the possibility cannot be ruled out that other factors, such as CE-metabolites or CE-induced host factors, are responsible for the anti-prion activities of CEs in animals.</p>

<title>CE efficacy is influenced by prion disease animal models</title>
<p>Although CE effects were significantly observed in all prion disease animal models tested in the present study (except for the ICR mouse model), CE effects in animals infected with mouse-adapted prions were not as remarkable as those of animals infected with the 263K hamster-adapted prion. In addition, CE effects were not necessarily remarkable in animal models with shorter incubation periods. Thus, these findings imply that CE effects may be influenced by the prion strain or animal genetic background.</p>
<p>Because no animals with an identical genetic background are available for comparison of CE efficacies against hamster-adapted prions <italic>vs</italic>. mouse-adapted prions, it is not possible at the present time to verify the influence associated with prion strains. Regarding the animal genetic background, Tg7 mice have a mixed background with 129/Ola and C57BL/10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref015">15</xref>]. Thus, the genetic background of Tg7 mice is very different from that of C57BL/6, whereas Tga20 mice have a genetic background close to C57BL/6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref022">22</xref>]. Accordingly, the animal genetic background might influence the effects of CEs. Although this inference remains to be elucidated, the data of the comparison between ddY and ICR mice are suggestive of inference.</p>

<sec id="sec017">
<title>CEs as a preventive drug model</title>
<p>Tremendous efforts have been made to conduct clinical trials or experimental treatments of several compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref045">45</xref>]. However, there have been no meaningful outcomes in regard to patient benefit. One of the reasons clinical trials commonly fail in terms of survival is supposed to be delayed intervention. In prion-infected animals, the larger delay in intervention, the less effective anti-prion compounds are at prolonging survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref021">21</xref>]. The most opportune time for therapeutic intervention of prion diseases is very early in the preclinical stage because exponentially accumulated amounts of the prion almost reach a plateau in the brain around the stage of symptomatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref047">47</xref>].</p>
<p>Because the effectiveness of CEs administered after disease onset were also very limited, despite being statistically significant, therapeutic effects are hardly expected for intervention after disease onset. However, significantly beneficial effectiveness of CEs might be expected by immediate post-infection or pre-exposure prophylactic intervention. Especially at peripheral infection, a few or several injections of CEs might be sufficiently preventive to keep infected individuals healthy for the expected lifetime. However, the safety properties of CEs remain to be evaluated and drug availability to target tissues must be improved before the dosing regimen can be optimized.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is not yet clear how polymers, such as CEs, peripherally administered suppress the disease process in the brain and extend survival. It is also unclear how CE efficacy is influenced by prion strains or host genetic factors. These enigmas await further elucidation. However, the findings of this study suggest that CEs may be something in daily life that modify disease onset and could be useful for the development of preventive measures against prion diseases.</p>

<title>Animal study</title>
<p>Tg7 mice, kindly provided by Dr. Bruce Chesebro of the Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases of NIAID’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories (Hamilton, MT, USA), were mainly used in the study because they have substantially shorter incubation times than Syrian hamsters when intracerebrally infected with the hamster-adapted 263K scrapie prion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref015">15</xref>]. Tg7 mice are derived from transgenic Tg10 mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref013">13</xref>] and are crossed onto a mouse PrP-null background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref048">48</xref>]. Thus, Tg7 mice lack endogenous mouse PrP<sup>C</sup> expression but express hamster PrP<sup>C</sup> at about 4 times the level of that expressed by wild-type mice in the brain and at a level similar to that expressed by wild-type mice in the spleen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006045.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). Six- to 10-week-old male mice were used for all experiments, unless otherwise stated. Intracerebral or intraperitoneal infection was performed by inoculation with 20 or 100 μL, respectively, of a 1% (w/v) brain homogenate obtained from a terminally ill 263K prion-infected hamster. In case of continuous intracerebroventricular infusion, continuous infusion into the cerebral third ventricle was performed using an osmotic minipump and brain infusion kit, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref049">49</xref>]. Mice were monitored every day until the time of terminal disease, at which time the mice were akinetic (with a lack of grooming behavior, coordination, and parachute reaction) or exhibited a rigid tail, an arched back, and weight loss of approximately 10% within one week. The mice were killed at this stage and disease was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analyses of abnormal PrP deposition in the brain, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006045.ref049">49</xref>]. Because it was difficult to determine the time of symptom onset in the animal model used in this study, survival time was defined as the time from prion infection to terminal disease.</p>
<p>Experiments with Syrian hamsters and other mice were performed in a similar manner, as described above. Syrian hamsters and C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Japan SLC, Inc. (Hamamatsu, Japan). In the case of post-infection CE administration into intraperitoneally prion-infected hamsters, hamsters in all experimental groups were given a single subcutaneous injection of CEs in such a manner that all intraperitoneal prion infections were performed with animals of the same age.</p>

<title>Pharmacokinetics of <sup>14</sup>C-TC-5RW</title>
<p><sup>14</sup>C-TC-5RW was synthesized by the condensation of NaOH-treated TC-5RW with <sup>14</sup>C-methyl iodide, and a pharmacokinetic study of <sup>14</sup>C-TC-5RW in Tg7 mice was performed at Sekisui Medical Co., Ltd. (Tsukuba, Japan) as follows. A designated amount of <sup>14</sup>C-TC-5RW in saline was subcutaneously injected into the backs of mice. After a designated interval, mice under deep anesthesia were frozen and embedded in 4% carboxymethyl cellulose-Na. Whole-body 30-μm-thick sections were cut with a cryomicrotome and dried. Sections accompanied by radioactive standards were exposed to imaging plates and radioluminograms were analyzed with a BAS2500 bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Considering both the standard calibration curve data and the <sup>14</sup>C-TC-5RW specific radioactivity, radioactivity levels in each tissue or fluid sample were calculated from the radioluminograms. Elimination half-life was calculated using the following formula: elimination half-life (days) = –ln<sub>2</sub>/β, where β is the slope obtained from the simple linear regression of the natural logarithm of radioactivity levels on post-injection days. To measure the molecular sizes of <sup>14</sup>C-TC-5RW residues in tissues, tissue samples were homogenized with five volumes of 0.1 N NaOH on ice, and the supernatants after centrifugation at 12,000×g were subjected to GPC analysis. Samples were separated on an OHpak SB-804 HQ column (Showa Denko, Tokyo, Japan) and eluted with 0.1 M NaCl at 1 mL/min and 35°C. Each 0.5-min fraction was mixed with the scintillation cocktail and radioactivity was assayed by liquid scintillation counting.</p>

A plot of relative signal intensities for Tg7 samples (% of B6) is shown against dilution ratios; the mean and standard deviation were obtained from technical triplicate analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 2 for each mouse strain). (c) PrP<sup>C</sup> levels in the spleen from Tg7 and B6 mice. Spleen homogenates containing 10 μg protein were analyzed by immunoblotting as described in (a) (<italic>n</italic> = 4 for each mouse strain). The mean and standard deviation of signal intensities are shown. NS not significant; t-test.</p>

<title>Other tested polysaccharide ethers.</title>
<p>Survival analyses were performed in 263K prion-infected Tg7 mice treated with a single dose of each sample at a designated timing, as described in the Materials and Methods section. Dextran and dextrin were provided by Meito Sangyo (Nagoya, Japan) and pullulan by Hayashibara (Okayama, Japan). Hydroxypropyl methyl ethers of these compounds were synthesized by Meito Sangyo. Other compounds were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo Chemical Industry, and Wako Pure Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan).</p>
