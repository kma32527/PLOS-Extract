<abstract>
<p><italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> is an enteric pathogen responsible for amoebic dysentery and liver abscess. It alternates between the host-restricted trophozoite form and the infective environmentally-stable cyst stage. Throughout its lifecycle <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> experiences stress, in part, from host immune pressure. Conversion to cysts is presumed to be a stress-response. In other systems, stress induces phosphorylation of a serine residue on eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2α (eIF2α). This inhibits eIF2α activity resulting in a general decline in protein synthesis. Genomic data reveal that <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> possesses eIF2α (<italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α) with a conserved phosphorylatable serine at position 59 (Ser<sup>59</sup>). Thus, this pathogen may have the machinery for stress-induced translational control. To test this, we exposed cells to different stress conditions and measured the level of total and phospho-<italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α. Long-term serum starvation, long-term heat shock, and oxidative stress induced an increase in the level of phospho-<italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α, while short-term serum starvation, short-term heat shock, or glucose deprivation did not. Long-term serum starvation also caused a decrease in polyribosome abundance, which is in accordance with the observation that this condition induces phosphorylation of <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α. We generated transgenic cells that overexpress wildtype <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α, a non-phosphorylatable variant of eIF2α in which Ser<sup>59</sup> was mutated to alanine (<italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α-S59A), or a phosphomimetic variant of eIF2α in which Ser<sup>59</sup> was mutated to aspartic acid (<italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α-S59D). Consistent with the known functions of eIF2α, cells expressing wildtype or <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α-S59D exhibited increased or decreased translation, respectively. Surprisingly, cells expressing <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α-S59A also exhibited reduced translation. Cells expressing <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α-S59D were more resistant to long-term serum starvation underscoring the significance of <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α phosphorylation in managing stress. Finally, phospho-eIF2α accumulated during encystation in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>invadens</italic>, a model encystation system. Together, these data demonstrate that the eIF2α-dependent stress response system is operational in <italic>Entamoeba</italic> species.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> is the causative agent of amoebic dysentery and liver abscess and is prevalent in underdeveloped countries that lack proper sanitation. Infection is acquired by ingestion of the cyst form in contaminated food or water. During infection, the parasite experiences stress including demanding growth conditions and host immune pressure. Conversion to the infective cyst may be induced by such stress. In other organisms, stress causes a decrease in protein biosynthesis by inducing phosphorylation of eIF2α, which participates in translation initiation. We exposed <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> to six different stress conditions and observed that some of these conditions (long-term serum starvation, long-term heat shock, and oxidative stress) induced an increase in the level of phospho-eIF2α. Long-term serum starvation was also accompanied by a decrease in mRNA translation. A cell line expressing a mutant version of eIF2α that behaves as a phosphomimetic exhibited decreased translation and increased survival during long-term serum starvation. Finally, phospho-eIF2α accumulated in cysts of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>invadens</italic>, a reptilian pathogen that readily encysts <italic>in vitro</italic>. Together, these data demonstrate that the eIF2α-dependent stress response system is operational in <italic>Entamoeba</italic> and may regulate encystation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> is an intestinal parasite that is the causative agent of amebic dysentery and amoebic liver abscesses. It is transmitted by the cyst form of the pathogen in fecally-contaminated food and water, making it prevalent in the developing world where sanitation practices are substandard. There are 173 million people that live in regions with untreated water sources and one billion people that carry out open defecation practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref001">1</xref>]. Thus, there is considerable risk for transmission of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> is passed from human to human without the utilization of an intermediate host. The parasite’s latent stage, a cyst, is able to withstand extreme conditions in the external environment as well as the acidic pH of the host stomach. The cyst exits the stomach and enters the small intestine, where unknown triggers cause excystation. The emerging active trophozoites continue down the digestive system until they reach the large intestine, where they establish infection, feed on bacteria and host cell material, and divide by binary fission. Trophozoites can also invade the colonic epithelial lining and cause extraintestinal complications of infection including liver abscess. During infection the parasite may experience stress, in part, due to immune pressure from the host. This stress can include heat shock, osmotic shock, nutrient deprivation, and/or exposure to reactive oxygen species, nitrogen species, or high oxygen. To survive, the parasite must elicit a cellular response to counter these stresses. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> does not readily encyst in axenic culture. Thus, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>invadens</italic>, a related reptilian intestinal parasite that can be induced to encyst <italic>in vitro</italic>, has been widely used as a model system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref006">6</xref>]. Conversion to latency in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>invadens</italic> is accompanied by increased expression of the heat shock protein, BiP/GRP78 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref003">3</xref>]. Thus, encystation is likely to be a stress response in <italic>Entamoeba</italic> species.</p>
<p>In many systems, stress is controlled, in part, by the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref007">7</xref>]. This factor is a heterotrimeric protein complex consisting of alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ) subunits. In normal growth conditions, eIF2 forms a ternary protein complex with GTP and Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>. The Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> is then delivered to the ribosome to initiate translation. Once Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> is delivered, the bound GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP. To become reactivated, eIF2-GDP binds to the guanine exchange factor, eIF2B, and the GDP is released, allowing for the binding of a new GTP. Nucleotide exchange is considered the rate-limiting step of translation initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref007">7</xref>]. During stress, eIF2 kinases become activated and phosphorylate a key serine residue on the alpha subunit (eIF2α) to generate a phosphorylated form of the protein (phospho-eIF2α). This phosphorylation induces a conformational change in eIF2, causing it to become a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B. This leads to a general decline in protein biosynthesis; however, paradoxically, the expression of a subset of genes is up-regulated. This subset of genes assists the cell in countering stress.</p>
<p>In other eukaryotic pathogens, stage conversion to a latent form is accompanied by phosphorylation of eIF2α. For example, stress induces the parasite, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, to convert from a replicating tachyzoite form to a latent bradyzoite form and phosphorylation of eIF2α occurs during this stage transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref008">8</xref>]. Phospho-eIF2α also regulates the formation of latent sporozoites in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref009">9</xref>] and the transition of promastigotes to amastigotes in <italic>Leishmania</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref010">10</xref>]. In non-parasitic organisms, such as yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref011">11</xref>] and <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref012">12</xref>], phosphorylation of eIF2α stimulates the formation of latent spores. Genomic data suggest that <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>invadens</italic> possess the components of this stress-response system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref013">13</xref>]. However, the role of eIF2α phosphorylation in the <italic>Entamoeba</italic> stress response has never been characterized.</p>
<p>In this study, we show that phosphorylation of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> eIF2α (<italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α) occurs in response to certain stress conditions, namely long-term serum starvation, long-term heat shock, and oxidative stress. Phosphorylation of <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α is accompanied by a reduction in global translation. We also show that expression of non-phosphorylatable or phosphomimetic forms of <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> influences translation and the ability to counter stress. Finally, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>invadens</italic> eIF2α (<italic>Ei</italic>eIF2α) accompanies encystation. Together, these data support the hypothesis that <italic>Entamoeba</italic> species possess an eIF2α-based stress response system that controls protein synthesis, and possibly encystation.</p>

<title>Stress elicits an increase in the level of phospho-<italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α</title>
<p>To determine if the level of phospho-eIF2α changes during stress, cells were exposed to a variety of stress conditions. Only previously-established stressors were chosen: short- and long-term serum starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref014">14</xref>], short- and long-term heat shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref015">15</xref>], glucose deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref016">16</xref>], and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref017">17</xref>]. To confirm that the applied stresses were not inducing significant cell death, which would confound our studies, viability was assessed. Only long-term serum starvation and oxidative stress resulted in statistically significant cell death, albeit the mortality was not complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006085.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

<p>To track the level of total and phospho-eIF2α during stress, antibodies that specifically recognize the phosphorylated form or total <italic>Entamoeba</italic> eIF2α were generated in rabbits and authenticated by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006085.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).

While all of the stress conditions induced an increase in the level of phospho-<italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α, only trophozoites that experienced long-term serum starvation, long-term heat shock, or oxidative stress exhibited a statistically significant increase in the level of phospho-<italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006085.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This was not simply due to cell death, since long-term heat shock, which caused minimal cell mortality, induced one of the most dramatic increases in the level of phosphorylated <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α.

Due to the lability of phospho-eIF2α, it was necessary to perform Western blots for the various conditions at different times.

<title>Reduced translation accompanies phosphorylation of <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α</title>
<p>In other systems, eIF2α-based control of stress is accompanied by a reduction in global translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref008">8</xref>]. Therefore, we examined global translation in control and stressed <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> cells by characterizing the abundance of high-density polyribosomes using sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. We chose two conditions of stress; one that induced phosphorylation of <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α (i.e., serum starvation), and one that did not induce phosphorylation of <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α (i.e., glucose deprivation). Consistent with the known function of phospho-eIF2α, serum starvation resulted in a significant reduction in dense polyribosomes and an increase in free ribosomes and monosomes when compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006085.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). As expected, glucose deprivation did not result in a decrease in dense polyribosome-bound transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006085.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).

<title>Expression of mutant <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α alters global translation</title>
<p>To further examine the function of phospho-<italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α, we generated <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> cell lines that conditionally overexpress mutant forms of <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α. The cDNA encoding <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α was mutagenized in two ways using PCR. The codon for serine (S) at position 59 was changed to that of alanine (A) or aspartic acid (D) to produce non-phosphorylatable (<italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α-S59A) or phosphomimetic (<italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α-S59D) forms of <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref018">18</xref>]. Wildtype (unaltered) cDNA was designated <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α-S59. To distinguish exogenous <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α from the endogenous form, the 5’ ends of wildtype and mutated cDNAs were also modified to include sequence encoding an N-terminal FLAG epitope peptide sequence (DYKDDDDK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref019">19</xref>] followed by a 5-glycine flexible region.</p>
<p>Modified PCR products were inserted into the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> expression vector pGIR209, which confers G418 (neomycin) resistance and allows for tetracycline-inducible expression of exogenous genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref020">20</xref>]. A standard electroporation protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref021">21</xref>] was utilized to introduce the expression vector into trophozoites that had been previously transfected with another plasmid, pGIR308. This partner plasmid encodes the tetracycline repressor protein, which is necessary for tetracycline inducibility. Authentic transfection was confirmed by purification and sequencing of the episomal expression plasmids from stably transfected cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref022">22</xref>]. A previously established cell line that conditionally expresses an irrelevant protein, luciferase, was used as a control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Expression of exogenous protein was induced by the addition of 5 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> tetracycline to the culture medium for a minimum of 24 h. Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG and anti-<italic>Entamoeba</italic> eIF2α showed successful induction of exogenous protein with little to no expression prior to the addition of tetracycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006085.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Interestingly, in the cell line over-expressing the wildtype version of eIF2α, FLAG-tagged <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α-S59 appeared to be itself heavily phosphorylated. It is not known why exogenously expressed eIF2α is so readily phosphorylated; but, the observation is in accordance with another study in which over-expression of wildtype eIF2α in human A375 melanoma cells resulted in an increase in the basal level of phosphorylated eIF2α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref023">23</xref>].

<p>To confirm that the exogenously expressed <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α variant proteins were functional, we monitored polyribosome abundance in the transgenic cell lines after 24 or 72 h of tetracycline induction. After 24 h of induction, there was no change in polyribosome abundance in any cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006085.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). After 72 h of induction, polyribosome abundance remained high in cells expressing luciferase (control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006085.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). This was expected given that expression of this irrelevant protein should not interfere with the translation machinery. Compared to control cells expressing luciferase, there was no statistically significant difference in the abundance of high-density polyribosomes in cells expressing wildtype <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α-S59 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006085.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). However, the polyribosome peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006085.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) in the <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α-S59-expressing cells were not as well defined as those in the luciferase-expressing control cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006085.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).

<p>Cells expressing the phosphomimetic variant, <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α-S59D, exhibited a statistically significant decrease in high-density polysomes after 72 h of tetracycline-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006085.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Given that the phosphorylation of eIF2α down-regulates translation, this result was expected. Surprisingly, cells expressing <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α-S59A also exhibited a decrease in high density polysomes after 72 h of tetracycline-induction, albeit not significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006085.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). The observation was unforeseen since the presence of unphosphorylated eIF2α is not normally correlated with a decrease in translation. Currently, these unique data cannot be explained, but suggests that the non-phosphorylatable variant of eIF2α is behaving in a dominant negative fashion in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> cells.</p>
<p>Since polyribosome profiling provides a snapshot of translation at the mRNA level, we wanted to confirm the alterations in biosynthesis in the mutants at the protein level. Therefore, we used a second method known as <underline>SU</underline>rface <underline>SE</underline>nsing of <underline>T</underline>ranslation (SUnSET). This non-isotopic technique uses anti-puromycin antibody for the immunological detection of puromycin-labelled proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref024">24</xref>]. When added to live cell cultures, puromycin, a tyrosoyl-tRNA analog, becomes incorporated into actively translating proteins. Subsequent Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates with anti-puromycin antibody reveals the extent of active protein production in the cell.</p>
<p>SunSET has been previously used to monitor protein biosynthesis in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref026">26</xref>]. To determine if SUnSET could be used to track protein synthesis in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> in our hands, wildtype cells were incubated with puromycin before or after incubation with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein biosynthesis. Western blotting using anti-puromycin antibody revealed that puromycin was readily incorporated into proteins in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006085.g007">Fig 7A</xref>; “Puro”). The incorporation was specific since there was minimal background staining of lysates from cells that were not treated with puromycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006085.g007">Fig 7A</xref>; “Control”), cells treated only with cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006085.g007">Fig 7A</xref>; “Cyclo”) or from cells first treated with cycloheximide followed by exposure to puromycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006085.g007">Fig 7A</xref>; “Cyclo + Puro”).</p>

Since detergent-resistance is a hallmark of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>invadens</italic> cysts, we also probed the 72 h population after treatment with sarkosyl.

In all cases, equal protein load was measured by Coomassie staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006085.g009">Fig 9A and 9B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is the first to demonstrate that stress and encystation can induce phosphorylation of eIF2α in the <italic>Entamoebae</italic>. Specifically, phospho-eIF2α was significantly increased in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> as a result of long-term serum starvation, long-term heat shock, or oxidative stress and in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>invadens</italic> after induction of encystation. During long-term serum starvation of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>, phosphorylation of eIF2α was accompanied by reduced translation. This suggests that a phospho-eIF2α-based stress response system exists in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>. In further support of this, a transgenic cell line expressing a phosphomimetic form of eIF2α exhibited higher viability during long-term serum starvation than cell lines expressing other versions of eIF2α or an irrelevant protein, luciferase. In other words, phosphorylation of eIF2α seems to promote <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> survival during stress.</p>
<p>Analysis of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> genome data suggests that this pathogen possess other components of this stress response system. There are putative homologs for eIF2β (EHI_153480) and eIF2γ (EHI_132880). Furthermore, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> possesses two presumptive eIF2α kinases (eIF2K) (EHI_109700, EHI_035950) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref013">13</xref>]. Currently, the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> eIF2α kinases have not been authenticated, nor have the conditions that lead to their activation been discerned. Nonetheless, the occurrence of each of the three subunits of eIF2, as well as kinases, in genome sequences indicates that this translation factor has a conserved role in this pathogen in delivering Met-tRNAis to the translation machinery. In support of this, cells expressing the phosphomimetic variant of <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α exhibited reduced polyribosme abundance. As expected, long-term serum starvation, a condition that induces phosphorylation of eIF2α, also exhibited reduced polyribosome abundance.</p>
<p>The ability of the parasite to respond to oxidative stress is critical for virulence functions [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref027">27</xref>] including the pathogen’s ability to survive in host liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref028">28</xref>]. The observation that eIF2α becomes phosphorylated during oxidative stress in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> is in accordance with other studies that demonstrate that phosphorylation of eIF2α protects mammalian cells during oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref030">30</xref>]. Our findings are also consistent with the observation that protein biosynthesis is inhibited during oxidative stress in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref025">25</xref>]. It has been suggested that oxidation of components of the parasite’s translation machinery (e.g., ribosomal proteins, elongation factors) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref025">25</xref>], and enzymatic down-regulation of almost all tRNA species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref031">31</xref>] are responsible for reduced protein biosynthesis during H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure. Our data show that phosphorylation of eIF2α may also contribute to changes in gene expression and protein biosynthesis during oxidative stress in the pathogen.</p>
<p>It has been reported that serum starvation induces expression of a long non-coding RNA, EhslncRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref032">32</xref>] and alters ribosome biogenesis by regulating the expression of rRNAs and ribosomal proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref033">33</xref>]. To date, there have been no genome-wide transcriptomic analyses of serum-starved <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> cells. Therefore, the identification of the entire set of genes that are down-regulated or up-regulated during this type of stress remains to be seen. However, transcriptomic analyses have been performed on <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> cells exposed to oxidative stress. Specifically, incubation with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced statistically significant down-regulation of 102 genes and up-regulation of 184 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref034">34</xref>]. More recently, it has been shown that this differential gene expression may be regulated by a novel transcription factor, which binds to a specific H(2)O(2)-regulatory motif (HRM) in the promoters of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref035">35</xref>]. Our data suggest that phosphorylation of eIF2α may halt global translation allowing time for the parasite to reconfigure gene expression during exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>The eIF2α response to stress appears to be specific to the condition applied since phospho-<italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α did not significantly increase in other presumptive states of stress including short-term serum starvation, short-term heat shock, or glucose deprivation. Interestingly, transcriptomic analyses of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> cells exposed to short-term heat shock results in a significant yet general decline in gene expression accompanied by differential expression of the alleles encoding the heavy subunit of the Gal/GalNAc lectin, a parasite surface protein responsible for interaction with host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref015">15</xref>]. The current study suggests that such short-term heat shock-induced changes in gene expression do not depend on phosphorylation of eIF2α.</p>
<p>Unlike in most glucose-starved mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref037">37</xref>], phospho-<italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α did not accumulate in glucose-starved <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> trophozoites. While it is accepted that glucose starvation is a “metabolic stressor” in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref016">16</xref>], it is a form of stress that apparently does not induce the expression of the conserved 70 kDa heat shock protein (hsp70) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref016">16</xref>]. Instead, glucose starvation in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> induces dramatic changes in the expression of other genes and an increase in virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref016">16</xref>]. Additionally, glucose starvation does not increase the ability of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> trophozoites to survive a subsequent challenge such as heat shock or oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref016">16</xref>]. It is intriguing that a form of stress (i.e., glucose starvation) that does not induce hsp70 expression nor protect cells from subsequent stressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref016">16</xref>] also does not induce phosphorylation of eIF2α (this study).</p>
<p>Given that standard <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> culture medium is poorly-defined, it is also possible that other carbohydrates serve as a nutrient source in the absence of glucose, which may minimize the stress. This would explain a lack of hsp70 accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref016">16</xref>], a lack of phospho-<italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α accumulation (this study), and maintenance of high-density polysomes (this study). <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> is likely well-adapted to handle a low glucose environment as this would be a common condition in the host large intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref038">38</xref>]. Our data suggest that the parasite’s response to a low glucose environment does not seem to rely on phosphorylation of eIF2α.</p>
<p>Cells that express the phosphomimetic version of eIF2α exhibited a statistically significant higher ability to survive at least one condition of stress, long-term serum starvation. In general, global translation is reduced by phosphorylation of eIF2α. However, it is known that certain mRNAs escape this inhibition and are selectively expressed even when phospho-eIF2α accumulates. For example, in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, 500 gene transcripts are preferentially associated with high-density translation-active polysomes during stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref018">18</xref>]. In mammalian cells, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref039">39</xref>], C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref039">39</xref>], and the α isoform of inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (IBTKα) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref040">40</xref>] are among those proteins preferentially expressed after phospho-eIF2α accumulates. Interestingly, depletion of IBTKα by short hairpin RNA technology reduces viability of cells during ER stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref040">40</xref>]. Thus, proteins that escape translational control by phospho-eIF2α may be among those key players that determine cell fate during stress. It is possible that in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>, expression of the phosphomimetic version of eIF2α, induced preferential expression of proteins, some of which may be protective during stress. This could explain increased viability of trophozoites during long-term serum starvation. Identification of those mRNAs associated with high-density polyribosomes during stress will provide further insight.</p>
<p>In the current study, the expression of wildtype and mutant forms of eIF2α was exogenous. Due to polyploidy, methods for homologous recombination and gene replacement are not yet available for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>. As such, in all of the transgenic cell lines, endogenous eIF2α was present. Despite this limitation, we observed phenotypes in the transgenic cell lines. As expected, cells over-expressing wildtype or phosphomimetic variants of eIF2α exhibited increased or decreased translation, respectively. Thus, these exogenous proteins were able to apparently compete with endogenous eIF2α in a predicted fashion.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, in cells expressing the non-phosphorylatable variant, <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α-S59A, polyribosome abundance and protein biosynthesis were decreased. This phenotype was unexpected because non-phosphorylated eIF2α is generally considered a driver of translation. However, in other systems, the phenotypic outcome of expression of S-to-A variants of eIF2α has not been uniform. For instance, exogenous expression of the non-phosphorylatable variant of eIF2α increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref035"><sup>35</sup></xref>S]-methionine incorporation into murine 3T3 L1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref019">19</xref>]. Overexpression of eIF2α-S51A can transform NIH 3T3 fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref041">41</xref>] but not 3T3 L1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref019">19</xref>]. In systems where gene replacement at both alleles can be achieved, expression of S-to-A variants causes dramatic outcomes including changes in morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref042">42</xref>], ER stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref042">42</xref>], increases in intracellular reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref029">29</xref>] and cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>Perhaps <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α has additional unidentified and non-canonical roles in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> and overexpression of the S59A variant leads to a unique phenotype. It might also be possible that the alanine-bearing mutant is behaving in a dominant-negative fashion by titrating other important components of the translation initiation system. Like several other ancient protozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref043">43</xref>] a canonical ER-based unfolded protein response (UPR) may be incomplete in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref044">44</xref>]. Therefore, the unusual phenotype of the <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α-S59A-expressing cell line is likely not the result of overexpression of an exogenous protein that leads to ER-stress. In support of this, overexpression of the control protein, luciferase, did not result in a similar decline in polysome abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006085.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). A thorough examination of the eIF2α binding partners in mutant and control cells will be necessary to fully understand the phenotype.</p>
<p>We demonstrate that the level of phospho-<italic>Ei</italic>eIF2α increases during encystation in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>invadens</italic>. It is well-known that eIF2-based systems are used in eukaryotes for the conversion to latent or dormant forms. Phosphorylation of eIF2α is responsible, in part, for stage conversion in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref008">8</xref>], <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref009">9</xref>] <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref045">45</xref>], yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref011">11</xref>], and <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref012">12</xref>]. The accumulation of phospho-<italic>Ei</italic>eIF2α during encystation of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>invadens</italic> (this study) is consistent with several previous studies that suggests translation declines during encystation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref047">47</xref>]. Specifically, the abundance of high-density polyribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref046">46</xref>] and the incorporation of exogenous amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref047">47</xref>] are decreased in encysting <italic>E</italic>. <italic>invadens</italic> cells. Furthermore, encystation is accompanied by the aggregation of ribosomes into structures known as a chromatoid bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref047">47</xref>]. Chromatoid bodies are RNA- and ribosomal-containing cytoplasmic granules that arise during stress. They are reminiscent of stress granules that accumulate in an eIF2-dependent manner in other systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref048">48</xref>]. Overall, our data, along with data that show that the levels of stress response proteins, such as hsp70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref003">3</xref>] and hsp90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref049">49</xref>], fluctuate during stage conversion in the <italic>Entamoebae</italic>, support the notion that encystation is a stress response.</p>
<p>Like <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>invadens</italic> possesses two presumptive eIF2α kinases (EIN_052050; EIN_096010). Expression of the former is developmentally-regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref005">5</xref>]. Specifically, there is a statistically significant increase in transcript of the former kinase at 24 h of encystation. Interestingly, this surge in transcript level corresponds with the appearance of phospho-eIF2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006085.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). Thus, EIN_052050 is a candidate for regulating the levels of phospho-eIF2α during stage conversion. It remains to be seen if phosphorylation of eIF2α is necessary and/or sufficient to induce stage conversion to the cyst form and further studies with the model organism will provide insight.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have shown that phospho-eIF2α accumulates in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> during a variety of stress conditions and in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>invadens</italic> during encystation. In <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>, the accumulation of the phosphorylated version correlated with a decrease in translation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of translational control in this pathogen.</p>

During PCR, nucleotides encoding a BglII restriction site, a FLAG tag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref019">19</xref>], and a 5-glycine flexible region were added to the 5’ end of the gene and nucleotides encoding SalI were added to the 3’ end of the gene.</p>
<p>Site-directed mutagenesis of the codon for serine (S) (TCA; amino acid position 59) to the codon for alanine (A) (GCA) or aspartic acid (D) (GAT) was carried out using a PCR-based protocol using the QuikChange Kit (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing. Wildtype and mutated <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α coding sequences were digested with BglII and SalI and ligated into the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> expression vector, pGIR209 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref020">20</xref>] (gift of Dr. W. A. Petri, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA), which had been digested with BglII and SalI. This vector allows for the inducible expression of exogenous proteins via the addition of tetracycline to the medium and is co-transfected with a second vector, pGIR308 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref020">20</xref>] (gift of Dr. W. A. Petri, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA), which encodes the tetracycline repressor.</p>
<p>Exponentially growing trophozoites of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>, harboring pGIR308, were transfected with the engineered pGIR209 vector as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref021">21</xref>]. As a control, amoebae were also transfected with pGIR209 containing the gene encoding luciferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref020">20</xref>]. Transfected amoebae were maintained by adding 6 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> G418 (pGIR209) and 15 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> hygromycin (pGIR308) selection agents to the medium.</p>
<p>Expression of exogenous proteins was induced by the addition of 5 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> tetracycline to the culture medium for 24 to 72 h prior to all studies and confirmed by Western blotting which was performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref052">52</xref>] with rabbit anti-luciferase (Invitrogen), anti-FLAG (Sigma), affinity purified anti-eIF2α or affinity purified anti-phospho-eIF2α at dilutions of 1:2500, 1:5000, 1:1000, or 1:1000, respectively. Viability of the mutants during stress and measurements of polyribosome abundance were carried out as described above after 24 h or 72 h post induction of exogenous protein biosynthesis.</p>

<title>SUrface SEnsing of Translation (SUnSET)</title>
<p>SUnSET analysis has been previously used to assess translational machinery in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006085.ref026">26</xref>]. To determine if SUnSET could be used to assess protein synthesis in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> in our hands, we assessed the incorporation of puromycin into wildtype trophozoites. Cells (2x10<sup>6</sup>) were incubated with 10 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min before or after incubation with 100 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> cycloheximide for 10 min. All incubations were held at 37°C. Cells were then pelleted and proteins were precipitated using 20% (v/v) TCA and incubating on ice for 10 min. Proteins were isolated via centrifugation at 2200 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 min and washed with 5% (v/v) TCA. The protein pellet was resuspended in 2X SDS running buffer and incubated in boiling water for 10 min. The lysate was frozen at -80°C until analyzed via Western blot as described above. Mouse anti-puromycin monoclonal antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) were used at a 1:2500 dilution. As a loading control, samples were stained with Bio-Safe Coomassie G-250 Stain. The protocol was repeated in the transgenic cell lines after a 72 h induction period.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All values are given as means ± standard error of at least 3 trials. To compare means, statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism v.6.05 software with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a Tukey-Kramer multiple-comparison test. In all cases, <italic>P</italic> values of less than 0.001 were considered highly statistically significant, while <italic>P</italic> values of less than 0.01 or 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

<p>Western blot analysis to demonstrate the specificity of anti-total eIF2α (A) and anti-phospho-eIF2α (B) antibodies. In both cases, lysates from 4 X 10<sup>4</sup> <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> (<italic>Eh</italic>) or <italic>E</italic>. <italic>invadens</italic> (<italic>Ei</italic>) cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and probed with rabbit preimmune serum (Day 0) at a dilution of 1:1000, serum collected 72 days after inoculation (Day 72) at a dilution of 1:1000, or affinity purified antibody (AP) at a dilution of 1:500. Consistent with the known molecular weight of eIF2α (~33.5 kDa), a protein band (red arrow) slightly below the 38 kDa molecular weight marker is visible when Day 72 or affinity purified serum is used as a probe but not when pre-immune serum is used as probe. This demonstrates the specificity of the reagents.</p>

<title>Polyribosome abundance in transgenic cell lines after 24 h of induction of protein synthesis.</title>
<p>RNA was isolated from the four transgenic cell line after incubation in 5 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> tetracycline for 24 h. The cell lines were the control cell line expressing luciferase, 209-Luc (A), the cell line overexpressing <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α (B), the cell expressing the non-phosphorylatable form of <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α (C), and the cell line expressing the phosphomimetic form of <italic>Eh</italic>eIF2α (D). The RNA was resolved by sucrose gradient (15–45%) ultracentrifugation, which separates free ribosomes and monosomes (light fractions) from polysomes (dense fractions). The gradients were fractionated and the fractions were analyzed by UV spectrometry (254 nm). Representative profiles of at least three separate trials are shown. After 24 h of induction, there was no change in polyribosome abundance in the transgenic cell lines.</p>
