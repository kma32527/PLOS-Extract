<abstract>
<p>During a tuberculosis infection and inside lipid-laden foamy macrophages, fatty acids (FAs) and sterols are the major energy and carbon source for <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. Mycobacteria can be found both inside a vacuole and the cytosol, but how this impacts their access to lipids is not well appreciated. Lipid droplets (LDs) store FAs in form of triacylglycerols (TAGs) and are energy reservoirs of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Using the <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>/<italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> infection model we showed that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> accesses host LDs to build up its own intracytosolic lipid inclusions (ILIs). Here, we show that host LDs aggregate at regions of the bacteria that become exposed to the cytosol, and appear to coalesce on their hydrophobic surface leading to a transfer of diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (Dgat2)-GFP onto the bacteria. <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> knockout mutants for both Dgat enzymes are unable to generate LDs. Instead, the excess of exogenous FAs is esterified predominantly into phospholipids, inducing uncontrolled proliferation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Strikingly, in absence of host LDs, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> alternatively exploits these phospholipids, resulting in rapid reversal of ER-proliferation. In addition, the bacteria are unable to restrict their acquisition of lipids from the <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> double knockout leading to vast accumulation of ILIs. Recent data indicate that the presence of ILIs is one of the characteristics of dormant mycobacteria. During <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> infection, ILI formation in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> is not accompanied by a significant change in intracellular growth and a reduction in metabolic activity, thus providing evidence that storage of neutral lipids does not necessarily induce dormancy.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) survives the human immune defence mechanisms leading to latent tuberculosis in one third of the world population. The ability to persist latently in human macrophages is due to a remarkable physiological change that is accompanied by a slowdown in replication, low metabolism, and phenotypic tolerance to antibiotics. It was proposed that fatty acids released from bacterial intracytosolic lipid inclusions (ILIs), a characteristic of dormant <italic>Mtb</italic>, serve as carbon source during reactivation from dormancy. We show here that bacteria accumulate ILIs even in a <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> mutant that is deficient in triacylglycerol synthesis and therefore incapable to build up lipid droplets. In addition, the accumulation of ILIs is not sufficient to induce a dormancy-like phenotype in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> inside its host <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. Moreover, we propose an alternative lipid transfer route from the host to the pathogen via degradation and recycling of host phospholipids.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tuberculosis (Tb) is caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) and remains one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the world. In immunocompetent people, <italic>Mtb</italic> is contained by host defence mechanisms, resulting in 2–3 billion people carrying latent Tb without clinical disease. During latency, the bacteria transition to dormancy, defined here as a slowly- or non-replicating state that is characterized by low metabolic activity and resistance to antibiotic treatment. However, when the immune system of the host is weakened, e.g. in diabetes or upon HIV infection, dormant bacteria can be reactivated leading to active infectious Tb (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref001">1</xref>]).</p>
<p>One of the hallmarks of Tb is the formation of granulomas, i.e. compact and organized structures comprised of immune cells, such as blood-derived macrophages, foamy macrophages, epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells surrounded by a ring of lymphocytes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref002">2</xref>]). Lipid droplet (LD) accumulation in macrophages, which leads to their “foamy” appearance, is another major characteristic of Tb, but also of other mycobacteria infections caused by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>avium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref003">3</xref>], <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref004">4</xref>] and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>leprae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref005">5</xref>], and was not observed upon infection with non-pathogenic species, such as <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref003">3</xref>]. Intracellular mycobacteria have been seen in the vicinity of LDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref006">6</xref>] and are able to access these lipid stores to acquire fatty acids (FAs; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref007">7</xref>]) to build up their own intracytosolic lipid inclusions (ILIs) for times of nutrient deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref006">6</xref>]. Interestingly, the formation of ILIs is a main characteristic of dormant bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref008">8</xref>] and with the help of an <italic>in vitro</italic> dormancy model it was proposed that FAs, released form bacterial TAGs, serve as carbon source to initiate replicative activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>We have established <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> (hereafter referred to as <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>) as a model for foamy macrophages in mycobacterial infections. Instead of <italic>Mtb</italic>, we infect <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> with <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic>, a natural pathogen of poikilotherms, and the closest relative to the <italic>Mtb</italic> complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref010">10</xref>]. Since virulence genes are highly conserved between both species and the infections share a high level of similarity at the cellular level, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> is a widely accepted model for Tb (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref011">11</xref>]). This is strengthened by the observation that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> also accesses host lipids, by re-directing LDs to the mycobacterium-containing vacuole (MCV), leading to an accumulation of neutral lipids inside the compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref012">12</xref>]. In addition, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> was recently shown to enter a dormant-like state in zebrafish with limited mortality rates and stable bacteria loads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref013">13</xref>]. Interestingly, mycobacteria growth was restored when the immune system of the fish was weakened by γ-irradiation. Whether lipid metabolism or LDs play a role during dormancy of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> is so far poorly understood.</p>
<p>LDs store energy in the form of neutral lipids, such as triacylglycerols (TAGs) and sterol esters (SEs), and are present in virtually every cell type ranging from simple organisms such as bacteria and amoebae to plants and mammals. TAGs are synthesised in at least two different ways, but commonly the last step, the acylation of diacylglycerol (DAG) that leads to the formation of TAG, is catalysed by diacylglycerol O-acyltransferases (Dgats; (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref014">14</xref>]).</p>
<p>Mammalian cells express two Dgat enzymes belonging to two proteins families with limited sequence similarity. Dgat1 is localized at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it mainly uses FAs released from nutrients or by lipolysis of LDs for TAG synthesis. Dgat2 is at the ER, mitochondria-associated membranes, and surface of LDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref015">15</xref>] and prefers newly synthesized FAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref016">16</xref>]. Dgat2 was shown to be the major Dgat enzyme in mammals, since mice lacking Dgat2 are not viable and die soon after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref017">17</xref>]. Interestingly, in adipocytes differentiated from murine embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> double knockout (DKO) animals, no LDs were formed at all. In contrast, in <italic>dgat1</italic> and <italic>dgat2</italic> single knockout (KO) MEFs lipid accumulation was observed, even in absence of exogenous FAs during differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref018">18</xref>]. In macrophages deficient for both Dgats, no LDs were observed after oleic acid addition, whereas LDs containing SEs accumulated after addition of acetylated low density lipoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref018">18</xref>]. In <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, two Dgat proteins were described recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref019">19</xref>]. As in mammalian cells, Dgat1 is located at the ER, while Dgat2 was observed exclusively on LDs. Interestingly, <italic>dgat2</italic>-deficient cells produce the same amount of TAGs as wild type cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref019">19</xref>]. Surprisingly, Dgat1 has more prominent activity in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, since <italic>dgat1</italic> KO and <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO cells were dramatically affected in their capacity to form TAGs after incubation with exogenous FAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>The role of host Dgat enzymes in bacterial or viral infections is poorly understood. Recently, Dgat1 activity was shown to be important for hepatitis C particle formation, but not relevant for viral replication and translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref020">20</xref>]. Dgat proteins also have a function in <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> infection. When MEFs derived from <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO animals were infected with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic>, less infectious progeny was generated than in wild type MEFs, leading the authors to conclude that host TAGs are required for chlamydial replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we first decipher the role of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> Dgat proteins during <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> infection and bring evidence that intracellular mycobacteria are not only able to acquire FAs from TAGs stored in host LDs, but also from host phospholipids. In addition, in host mutants unable to generate LDs, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> appears to accumulate ILIs in an unrestricted manner without significant impact on its proliferation.</p>

<title>Dgat2-GFP-labelled LDs aggregate around cytosolic bacteria</title>
<p>Previously, we have shown that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> uses host-derived lipids to build up more and larger ILIs during the infection of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref012">12</xref>]. Consequently, we wondered whether host proteins with a function in TAG synthesis, such as Dgat1 and Dgat2, were involved in that process. Importantly, the localization and the function of both Dgat proteins in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> was thoroughly assessed in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref019">19</xref>]. The authors showed that overexpression of Dgat2-GFP induces TAG production and LD generation in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> without FA supplementation, probably by rerouting metabolic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref019">19</xref>]. In addition, it was observed that Dgat2-GFP overexpression rescues the capacity of the <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO to synthesise TAGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref019">19</xref>], leading to the generation of LDs with an ultrastructural morphology indistinguishable from LDs induced by FA supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Since Plin, the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> homologue of Perilipin, is cytosolic in the absence of FAs and relocates to the LD surface when the medium is supplemented with FAs, its localization was monitored in a strain expressing Dgat2-GFP. Strikingly, Plin was cytosolic under standard conditions, even though LDs decorated with Dgat2-GFP were observed. Soon after FA addition, Plin then relocated to LDs, where both proteins co-localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g001">Fig 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006095.s007">S1 Movie</xref>). Together with the observation that Dgat2-GFP-labelled LDs are LD540 positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref019">19</xref>], this result suggests the presence of two different LD types in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> that are either artificially induced by overexpressing Dgat2-GFP, or are generated by the different functions of Dgat2 and Plin in TAG synthesis and lipolysis, respectively.</p>

<title>Localization of Dgat1- and Dgat2-GFP during infection of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic>.</title>
<p>A. LDs with their typical morphology are formed in cells overexpressing Dgat2-GFP even without FA supplementation. Cells that were treated with and without FAs were fixed and processed for EM. Arrowheads label LDs. Scale bar, 1 μm. B.Dynamics of RFP-Plin and Dgat2-GFP in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> treated with exogenous FAs. In axenic medium without FA supplementation, RFP-Plin is cytosolic whereas Dgat2-GFP is located on LDs. Upon treatment with exogenous FAs, RFP-Plin translocates to the surface of LDs where it co-localizes with Dgat2-GFP. <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> expressing both RFP-Plin and Dgat2-GFP was cultured in medium supplemented with FAs and a time-lapse movie was recorded with 5 min frame intervals. Shown is the maximum z-projection of 6 sections spaced 1.5 μm apart. Scale bars, 10 μm. C. Dgat2-GFP-positive LDs cluster at bacterial poles. <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> expressing Dgat2-GFP was infected with mCherry-expressing mycobacteria. Samples for live imaging were taken at 3, 24 and 45 hpi. <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> was fed with FA prior to infection. Arrows point to LD clusters. Scale bars, 10 μm. D. Quantification of C. The number of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells harbouring bacteria that co-localize with LDs aggregates was stable over the time course of infection. Bacteria surrounded by Dgat2-GFP were only observed at late stages, as judged by quantification using z-projections. The statistical significance was calculated with an unpaired t-test (* p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01). Bars represent the mean and SD of two independent experiments. E. Dgat1-GFP is enriched at the ER and at the perinuclear ER during infection of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> with mCherry-expressing <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic>. Samples for live imaging were taken at 3, 24 and 45 hpi. <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> was fed with FA prior to infection. Scale bars, 10 μm.</p>

<p>When the localization of both Dgat proteins was monitored during infection, we observed that many of the Dgat2-GFP-positive LDs clustered around the MCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). While this clustering of LDs was observed at all stages, labelling of the entire bacteria was rarely seen and occurred only at late infection stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>; black and red bars, respectively). The localization of Dgat1-GFP did not change during infection, remaining at the ER at all stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Addition of exogenous FAs, which leads to further induction of LDs did not influence the localization of Dgat1-GFP and Dgat2-GFP, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess whether the Dgat2-GFP-labelled bacteria were inside a vacuole or cytosolic, infected Dgat2-GFP-expressing cells were PFA-fixed at 3, 21 and 45 hpi and stained for the endosomal protein p80, a predicted copper transporter enriched at the MCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref022">22</xref>]. At 3 and 21 hpi, LDs converged to regions devoid of p80, and thus cytosolically exposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, asterisks). At late infection stages (45 hpi), Dgat2-GFP surrounded bacteria that had fully escaped from the MCV to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, yellow arrow). In contrast to the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> homologue of perilipin, which is attracted to all the bacteria as soon as their surface is exposed to the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref012">12</xref>] the homogenous labelling of Dgat2-GFP around cytosolic bacteria, was only observed late and for a small fraction of cytosolic bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). In addition, we observed by time-lapse microscopy that, as soon as <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> initiated its escape from the vacuole to the cytosol at around 24 hpi, the Dgat2-GFP-positive LDs clustered at the emerging bacterial poles, and appeared somehow attached to the bacterial surface, as judged by their coordinated movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, arrows; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006095.s008">S2 Movie</xref>).

<title>Dynamics of Dgat2-GFP-LDs during infection.</title>
<p>A. Dgat2-GFP-positive LDs attach to the bacteria when they are exposed to the cytosol (3 and 21 hpi). At a later infection stage, Dgat2-GFP completely surrounds a cytosolic bacterium (45 hpi). White arrows point to bacteria that are inside the p80-positive MCV. Asterisks label bacteria that are partially exposed to the cytosol. The yellow arrow points to a cytosolic bacterium that is completely surrounded by Dgat2-GFP. Scale bars, 10 μm; Zoom, 2 μm. B. Dgat2-GFP-labelled LDs stick to an intracellular mCherry-expressing mycobacterium. A time-lapse movie was recorded at 24 hpi with 5 sec frame intervals. Arrows point to LDs aggregated at the surface of the bacterium. Scale bar, 3 μm. C. Coalescence of a Dgat2-GFP-positive LD with an mCherry-expressing mycobacterium surrounded by Dgat2-GFP (arrows). A time-lapse movie was recorded at 42 hpi with 2 sec frame intervals. Arrows point to an LD that coalescences onto the bacterium. Asterisks label the same LD in the Zoom. Scale bar, 5 μm; Zoom, 2μm.

<p>In summary, we observed that Dgat2-GFP-positive LDs first cluster around bacterial poles that become exposed to the cytosol, and finally coalesce with the surface of cytosolic bacteria.</p>

<title>Perilipin restricts Dgat2 from the surface of cytosolic bacteria</title>
<p>Since Dgat2 and Plin have been both observed at the surface of cytosolic <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic>, the dynamics of both proteins during infection was monitored in infected <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> expressing RFP-Plin and Dgat2-GFP. At 45 hpi, a sample was transferred into a μ-dish, and the unlabelled bacteria were visualised by the DNA-dye Vybrant Ruby.

<title>Bacteria accumulate ILIs in the <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO</title>
<p>In wild type <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, LDs cluster around the MCV minutes after uptake, probably serving as a source of FAs for the invading bacteria to build up their ILIs. <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells lacking both Dgat enzymes synthesize extremely low levels of TAGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref019">19</xref>]. Accordingly, we wondered whether the intracellular bacteria are still able to produce ILIs in cells deficient for one or both Dgats. To monitor bacterial ILIs, wild type or <italic>dgat</italic> mutants were infected with mCherry-expressing <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> and fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 3 and 21 hpi, respectively. ILIs were stained and the MCVs labelled for p80. Importantly, cells were fed with exogenous FAs before infection. In both wild type and <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO cells, the bacteria harboured many more and larger ILIs at 21 hpi than at 3 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>), but, at both time points, most bacteria that accumulated ILIs were still inside their MCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g003">Fig 3A–3D</xref>). In addition, intracellular bacteria did also generate ILIs in the <italic>dgat1</italic> and <italic>dgat2</italic> KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). Of note, when <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells are fixed with PFA and permeabilised with the detergent TritonX-100, the LD-lipids are extracted, affecting the usual LD staining. Importantly, probably due to their waxy cell wall, lipids of the bacteria are not drastically affected by TritonX-100 and are stained by common LD dyes.</p>

<p>In <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, around 10–20% of infected bacteria are observed in the cytosol at any time between 1 and 25 hpi, whereas the major wave of escape from the compartment is observed between 24 and 50 hpi, as confirmed by Plin-labelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref012">12</xref>].

We expected that Topfluor-LysoPC becomes acylated, probably by the action of lysophospholipid acyltransferase at the ER, giving rise to Topfluor-PC that should be present in almost all cellular membranes in analogy to PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref030">30</xref>]. Moreover, the fluorescent label of Topfluor-LysoPC is linked to the acyl-chain and not the phosphate group, which should allow us to follow the localization of Topfluor-labelled FAs that are released from Topfluor-LysoPC by host and bacterial enzymes such as phospholipases C.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when non-infected wild type <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells were incubated with Topfluor-LysoPC, the label was enriched in the perinuclear ER (asterisks) and in vesicles reminiscent of endosomes in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006095.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). In the <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO, we observed the same staining of the perinuclear ER (asterisks), but also the proliferation of the ER-membrane (arrowheads) and to a minor extent vesicles were labelled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006095.s004">S4B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>When Topfluor-LysoPC-labelled cells were infected with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g007">Fig 7</xref>), the labelling became first visible at the membrane of the MCV (1–3 hpi), then accumulated inside the compartment (starting from 4 hpi) and finally was integrated into the bacteria themselves (21 hpi). Interestingly, these observations were made both in infected wild type and <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO cells, indicating that the same route of lipid transfer is active in both cell lines.</p>

<p>The situation was different when BodipyC12, an FA analogue, was used to specifically label host lipids as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref012">12</xref>].

<p>Another way to quantify various lipid species and to monitor a possible relocation of lipids from the host to the pathogen is via thin-layer chromatography (TLC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref007">7</xref>]. Again, we used Topfluor-LysoPC and BodipyC12 to follow lipid transfer from the host to the pathogen. Because of the Topfluor and Bodipy fluorophores, we expected a different migration behaviour of the tagged lipids compared to their unlabelled counterparts. Therefore, we assessed the migration of BodipyC12, Topfluor-FAs (C11), Topfluor-TAGs (18:1, 18:1, C11) and of the unlabelled lipid standards side-by-side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). In contrast to free FAs (FFAs, oleic acid vs. Topfluor-FAs and BodipyC12), for which no difference was observed, Topfluor-TAGs migrated less far on the TLC compared to unlabelled TAGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g009">Fig 9A</xref>).</p>

<p>To specifically label phospholipids from wild type and <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO cells, we incubated them with Topfluor-LysoPC before infection, as described above. At 1.5 and 8 hpi, samples were taken for lipid extraction. To separate the host from the pathogen, cells were gently lysed with 0.05% (v/v) TritonX-100 and centrifuged at 3,500g (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> lipids from the resulting supernatant were extracted directly with chloroform:methanol (1:2 v/v) whereas mycobacteria in the pellet were washed thrice with 0.05% (v/v) TritonX-100 before extraction in chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v) for 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). As expected, we observed that the Topfluor-LysoPC was converted to phospholipids in wild type and <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g009">Fig 9C1</xref>). Interestingly, the fluorescent label incorporated into phospholipids decreased during the first hours of infection and concomitantly appeared in fluorescently-labelled phospholipids and TAGs in the bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g009">Fig 9C2</xref>). When wild type and <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO cells were labelled with BodipyC12 prior to infection, we observed that the fluorescent FA analogue became mainly integrated into host phospholipids and TAGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g009">Fig 9D1</xref>). Fluorescently-labelled TAGs were mainly visible in the wild type, and to a smaller extent in the <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO cells. Inside the bacteria, the label was mainly incorporated into TAGs and to a smaller extent also into phospholipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g009">Fig 9D2</xref>). Strikingly, the bacteria were more efficient in BodipyC12 transfer and TAG synthesis in the <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO than in wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g009">Fig 9D2</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we demonstrate here for the first time, that mycobacteria are not only able to obtain FAs from host TAGs, but also from host phospholipids. The phospholipids are likely hydrolysed to FAs, which are transferred into the MCV and the bacteria, to be finally used to generate TAGs and ILIs.</p>

<p>Overexpressing Dgat2-GFP partially complements the <italic>dgat1</italic> phenotype in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, leading to an increase of TAGs even without FA supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref019">19</xref>]. In this context, it is interesting that the intracellular growth of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> as measured by bacterial luciferase activity was not different in wild type cells and Dgat1- or Dgat2-GFP overexpressors, even when fed with FA prior to infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006095.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Using luciferase as a reporter measures the metabolic activity of the bacteria as a proxy for growth but does not directly inform about the actual number of intracellular and extracellular bacteria during infection. Fluorescence reporters have been validated to monitor <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref033">33</xref>]. Consequently, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> expressing mCherry was used to follow the infection of wild type and <italic>dgat1&amp;</italic>2 DKO by high content microscopy (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g010">10B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006095.s006">S6</xref>).

Growth of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and the number of intracellular and extracellular bacteria was analysed by automatic image segmentation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g010">10B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006095.s006">S6B and S6C</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the number of intra- and extracellular bacteria in the <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO was comparable with the wild type (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g010">10B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006095.s006">S6B</xref>) confirming the results above. Since the automatic segmentation did not allow to distinguish between intracellular individual bacteria and microcolonies, infected cells from wild type and <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO were fixed at 24 hpi and processed for EM. Interestingly, using this approach a higher proportion of infected cells were observed in the <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g010">Fig 10C</xref>).

<p>In summary, we show here that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> is metabolically active in the <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO and bacteria growth is comparable in wild type and <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO cells.

Therefore, we fixed infected wild type and <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO cells at 24 hpi and performed AuramineO and ILI-staining in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g010">Fig 10D</xref>). When <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> was fed with FAs prior to infection, bacteria accumulated ILIs and at the same time stayed Auramine-O-positive in both wild type and <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO cells, confirming that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> does not become dormant during the infection of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>.</p>

<p>In mammalian cells Dgat2 localizes to LDs, similar to other TAG synthesising enzymes probably via hairpin structures that consists of two alpha-helices ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref015">15</xref>]; summarized in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref035">35</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref036">36</xref>]). Importantly, the hairpin loop does not completely span the membranes, but is embedded into the cytosolic ER leaflet and, after the re-location via ER-LD bridges, into the monolayer surrounding the LD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref036">36</xref>]. Therefore, we propose a mechanism in which Dgat2-GFP-labelled LDs first relocate to the parts of the bacteria that are exposed to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>; see model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g011">Fig 11A</xref>, step 1) and then sometime coalesce with the waxy bacterial cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref>; see model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g011">Fig 11A</xref>, step 2), thereby leading to the diffusion of Dgat2-GFP around the cytosolic bacteria.

Overview of <italic>de novo</italic> lipid synthesis in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> wild type and <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO and lipid transfer to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic>. TAGs in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> are mainly synthesised from glycerol-3-phosphate. The key enzymes (GPATs, AGPATs, Lipin and DGATs) are conserved between <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and mammalian cells. Under normal, wild type-like conditions, TAG-filled LDs first translocate to the MCV leading to the accumulation of neutral lipids inside the compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref012">12</xref>]. The delivered lipids are then used by the bacteria to build up their own TAGs and ILIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref012">12</xref>]. In the <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO the situation is different, since exogenous FAs are not utilized for LD biogenesis, but are shuttled into phospholipids. We propose that these phospholipids are cleaved at the membrane of the MCV by PLCs that are secreted by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic>. This results in the formation of DAG, which is finally hydrolysed by the secreted TAG-lipase of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> (LipY (MMAR_1547)) leading to free FAs. Finally, the released free FAs are re-esterfied to bacterial TAGs probably by the activity of various Fads and Tgs1 (MMAR_1519) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref013">13</xref>]).</p>

<p>In contrast to Dgat2, the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> homologue of Perilipin, Plin, interacts reversibly with the surface of LDs via amphipathic helices (summarized in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref036">36</xref>]). Plin is cytosolic when no exogenous FAs are present, i.e at later infection stages, and is therefore able to partition to the surface of the bacteria as soon as they reach the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref012">12</xref>]. Accordingly, Plin was seen more frequently and more extensively around cytosolic bacteria than Dgat2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006095.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). In conclusion, the presence of Plin might restrict Dgat2 from the surface of the bacteria.</p>
<p>Recently, we showed that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> is able to use host LDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref012">12</xref>], which leads to the accumulation of ILIs. Strikingly, in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> mutants deficient in one or both <italic>dgat</italic> genes, we observe that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> was still able to build up ILIs (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g004">4A–4D</xref>, see model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g011">Fig 11A</xref>, step 4). A block in TAG synthesis, as in the <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO, does not explicitly exclude the formation of LDs. Macrophages that are deficient in both <italic>dgat</italic> genes, shuttle the surplus of FAs into LDs containing SEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref018">18</xref>]. Furthermore, yeast cells disrupted in three out of four genes relevant for the acylation of DAGs, are still capable of generating a few LDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref037">37</xref>]. Consequently, we tested the ability of <italic>Dictyostelium dgat</italic> mutants to form LDs after feeding with exogenous FAs. Interestingly, the <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO does not accumulate LDs, but shuttles excessive FAs into phospholipids, leading to massive proliferation of the ER-membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006095.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, a similar observation was made in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref038">38</xref>]. In yeast cells lacking all four acyltransferases, the addition of exogenous FAs leads also to massive proliferation of the ER membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref038">38</xref>]. By labelling the ER-proliferations with GFP-HDEL and also by observing them by EM, we noticed that these proliferations were depleted from infected cells at very early infection stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g006">Fig 6</xref>) leading us to conclude that <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> is able to tap host phospholipids (see model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g011">Fig 11A</xref>, step 5). To monitor that the bacteria are able to access phospholipids from <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, host lipids were specifically labelled with Topfluor-LysoPC, which probably became acylated giving rise to phospholipids by side-chain remodelling or head-group exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g009">Fig 9C1</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref039">39</xref>]). When Topfluor-LysoPC-labelled wild type and <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO cells were monitored by live microscopy, various vesicles were stained in the wild type, while Topfluor became visible in the ER-proliferations of the <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006095.s004">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Upon infection, Topfluor-labelled lipids were first observed at the membrane of the MCV, then inside this compartment, and finally were incorporated into bacterial ILIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Interestingly, a similar observation was reported during infection of HeLa cells with <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref040">40</xref>]. The authors showed that Bodipy-PC is first enriched at the membrane of the inclusion and finally gets incorporated into the bacteria themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref040">40</xref>]. By TLC, we observed that the label of host phospholipids decreased during the first hours of infection, whereas fluorescently-labelled TAGs increased in the isolated lipid fraction from the bacteria, leading to the conclusion that host phospholipids of wild type and <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO cells were successfully used as FA source (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g009">9C</xref>).</p>
<p>When cells were stained with the fluorescently-labelled FA analogue BodipyC12, we observed that it was incorporated into LDs in wild type cells and accumulated mainly in the proliferations of the ER-membrane in the <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006095.s004">S4C and S4D Fig</xref>). Therefore, we propose that BodipyC12 reveals two different routes of lipid transfer. In wild type cells, BodipyC12 is incorporated into TAGs that are transferred to the MCV in the form of LDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref012">12</xref>], whereas in the <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO host BodipyC12-labelled phospholipids became accessible to the bacteria (see scheme <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g011">Fig 11B</xref>).</p>
<p>Most likely, along both routes, neither TAGs nor phospholipids are taken up by the bacteria, but both lipid species are hydrolysed to free FAs inside the MCV (see scheme <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g011">Fig 11B</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by the findings from a previous study in which the authors showed that FAs released from host LDs are incorporated mainly into <italic>Mtb</italic> membrane lipids, such as phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) and TAGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref041">41</xref>]. Host TAGs in the MCV are probably hydrolysed by host lysosomal lipases or secreted bacterial lipases such as LipY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref043">43</xref>], whereas phospholipids are cleaved by host or bacterial phospholipases (PLs). PLs are classified into four major groups depending on the cleavage site. PLCs for instant hydrolyse phospholipids to generate DAG. Especially PLCs have been shown to play an important role in pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref044">44</xref>]. Interestingly, <italic>Mtb</italic> possesses four genes encoding PLCs ((plcA-D); [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref045">45</xref>]). All of them are secreted by the twin-arginine transporter (Tat) system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref046">46</xref>] and are jointly required for virulence of <italic>Mtb</italic> in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref047">47</xref>]. A role of PLCs in bacterial escape into the cytosol has been already demonstrated for other bacterial pathogens such as <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref049">49</xref>] and <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref050">50</xref>]. In contrast, the ability of <italic>Mtb</italic> to break its compartment was not reduced in a quadruple <italic>plc</italic> KO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref051">51</xref>]. Interestingly, PLC activity seems to be restricted to slow-growing pathogenic mycobacterial species and has also been observed in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref052">52</xref>]. In contrast to <italic>Mtb</italic>, the genome of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> harbours six gene duplicates of <italic>plcB</italic> (<italic>plcB</italic>_1 to <italic>plcB</italic>_6, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mycobrowser.epfl.ch/ marinolist.html" xlink:type="simple">http://mycobrowser.epfl.ch/ marinolist.html</ext-link>), but no version of <italic>plcA</italic>, <italic>plcC</italic> and <italic>plcD</italic>. As proposed by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref053">53</xref>], we suggest that mycobacterial PLCs play a role in hydrolysing host phospholipids, giving rise to DAG, making it available to the bacteria (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g011">Fig 11B</xref>).</p>
<p>Because free FAs are toxic, they are either bound to proteins or are activated by coenzyme A (CoA) to yield fatty acyl-CoA. Interestingly, <italic>Mtb</italic> has 36 FadD genes (38 in the case of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic>) annotated as putative fatty acyl-CoA synthase genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref045">45</xref>]. Although some of them have been identified as fatty acyl-AMP ligases that are involved in lipid synthesis such as FAdD32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref054">54</xref>], others might catalyse the activation of FAs with Coenzyme A. In addition, FACL6 (Rv1206), another putative fatty acyl-CoA synthase that resembles FA transport proteins of mammalian cells, displays preference towards oleic acid, one of the predominant host FAs, and is upregulated during <italic>in vitro</italic> dormancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref055">55</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, we propose here a new mechanism by which mycobacteria exploit lipids from their host cell. In addition to host TAGs which are transferred to the MCV by LD relocation and translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref012">12</xref>], the bacteria are also able to manipulate and access host phospholipids that are cleaved and probably transported into the bacteria in the form of free FAs. FAs released from host TAGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref012">12</xref>] and phospholipids become integrated into bacterial ILIs in wild type hosts and to an even higher extent in the <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO. Since ILI formation is a major characteristic of dormant bacteria, we monitored mycobacteria growth by high content microscopy and metabolic activity using bacterial luciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g010">Fig 10A and 10B</xref>). Using these methods we did neither observe a reduction in metabolic activity nor in bacteria growth. Interestingly, more infected cells and an increase in the number of intracellular bacteria became visible in the <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO in EM-micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g010">Fig 10C</xref>). In addition, the bacteria remained acid-fast positive, leading us to the conclusion that a dormancy-like phenotype was not induced in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006095.g010">Fig 10D</xref>).</p>

<title>Infection of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> with <italic>M. marinum</italic></title>
<p>To monitor events that happen directly after phagocytosis of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic>, an early infection assay was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref058">58</xref>]. Briefly, 5 x 10<sup>8</sup> bacteria were centrifuged at 18,000 g for 4 min and washed twice with filtered Hl5c. Before the infection, the bacteria were passaged 10 times through a 25-gauge needle to remove clumps. Forty microliters of bacterial suspension (multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2) were used to infect <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells on a confluent μ-dish (ibidi) in low fluorescent medium (LoFlo, Foremedium) without antibiotics. To increase synchronous uptake of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic>, the μ-dish was cooled for 10 min on a cold metal plate. The bacteria were centrifuged on the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells for 2 min at 500 g and 4°C. Where indicated, the medium was exchanged to medium containing 10 μM Bodipy 493/503 (stock: 10 mM in DMSO) to stain neutral lipids. To improve imaging quality the infection was overlayed with a thin sheet of agarose as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref058">58</xref>]. Time-laps movies or stacked images were recorded at a spinning disc confocal microscope (Intelligent Imaging Innovations) mounted on an inverted microscope (Leica DMIRE2; Leica) using the 63x NA or 100x 1.4 NA oil objective and an Evolve EMCCD Camera (Photometrics). Images were processed afterwards by using FIJI.</p>
<p>To monitor the whole infection time course between 2 and 60 hpi, a long-term infection experiment, was performed as previously described ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref022">22</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref058">58</xref>]). 5 x 10<sup>8</sup> bacteria (for a final MOI of 10) were washed twice with filtered Hl5c and resuspended in 500 μl Hl5c. To remove clumps, bacteria were passaged 10 times though a 25-gauge needle and added to a confluent dish of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells in filtered Hl5c that have been incubated without antibiotics for 24 hrs. The bacteria were centrifuged onto the adherent <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells at 500 g and 25°C for 2 x 10 min to increase phagocytosis efficiency. After an additional 10 to 20 min incubation, the extracellular bacteria were removed by several washes in filtered Hl5c. Finally, the infection was taken up in 30 ml filtered Hl5c to have a density of 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml and supplemented with 5 μg/ml of streptomycin and 5 U/ml of penicillin to prevent growth of extracellular bacteria and incubated in shaking conditions at 25°C at 130 rpm. At the indicated time points, samples were taken for PFA/picric acid fixation or live imaging as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>To induce LDs in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> prior to infection, the axenic growth medium was supplemented with 200 μM palmitate. After 3 hrs of incubation and before the bacteria were added, exogenous FAs were removed by several washing steps. To prepare a 0.1 mM stock solution, sodium palmitate was dissolved in pre-warmed MeOH. Aliquots were stored at -20°C.</p>
<p>Bacterial growth was assessed by high content live microscopy (ImageXpress Micro XL, Molecular Devices). 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells that were infected either with GFP- or mCherry-expressing <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> were plated on a multi-well imaging plate (BD Falcon) and images were recorded every hour using a 40 x air objective.

<p><italic>Dictyostelium</italic> was incubated overnight with exogenous FAs and at the same time with Bodipy 558/568 C12 (final concentration: 5 μM, stock: 2.1 mM in DMSO) to induce LDs in the wild type or ER-membrane proliferations in the <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO cells. To remove non-metabolized dye, cells were washed three times and chased for 1 hour in sterile filtered Hl5c.</p>
<p>For live imaging, an early infection experiment was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006095.ref058">58</xref>]. Therefore, cells were allowed to adhere on a μ-dish (ibidi) and subsequently infected with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> expressing mCherry or GFP.

<p>To follow lipid transfer from the host to the pathogen by TLC, 4 confluent 10-cm dishes of Topfluor-LysoPC- or Bodipy558/568 C12-labelled wild type and <italic>dgat1&amp;2</italic> DKO cells were infected with unlabelled <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> wild type. At 1.5 and 8 hpi, two dishes of each strain (7x10<sup>7</sup> cells) were collected at 500 g for 5 min. After two washes with Soerensen buffer, cell pellets were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at– 20°C until lipids were extracted. Two confluent 10-cm dishes with non-infected cells served as a control and were treated like the infected cells.</p>
<p>First, <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells were lysed in water containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (v/v), sonicated and centrifuged at 3500g.
