<abstract>
<p><italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic> is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that infects alveolar macrophages and replicates within a unique lysosome-derived vacuole. When <italic>Coxiella</italic> is trafficked to a host cell lysosome the essential Dot/Icm type IV secretion system is activated allowing over 130 bacterial effector proteins to be translocated into the host cytosol. This cohort of effectors is believed to manipulate host cell functions to facilitate <italic>Coxiella</italic>-containing vacuole (CCV) biogenesis and bacterial replication. Transposon mutagenesis has demonstrated that the Dot/Icm effector Cig57 is required for CCV development and intracellular replication of <italic>Coxiella</italic>. Here, we demonstrate a role for Cig57 in subverting clathrin-mediated traffic through its interaction with FCHO2, an accessory protein of clathrin coated pits. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified FCHO2 as a binding partner of Cig57 and this interaction was confirmed during infection using immunoprecipitation experiments. The interaction between Cig57 and FCHO2 is dependent on one of three endocytic sorting motif encoded by Cig57. Importantly, complementation analysis demonstrated that this endocytic sorting motif is required for full function of Cig57. Consistent with the intracellular growth defect in <italic>cig57</italic>-disrupted <italic>Coxiella</italic>, siRNA gene silencing of <italic>FCHO2</italic> or clathrin (<italic>CLTC)</italic> inhibits <italic>Coxiella</italic> growth and CCV biogenesis. Clathrin is recruited to the replicative CCV in a manner that is dependent on the interaction between Cig57 and FCHO2. Creation of an FCHO2 knockout cell line confirmed the importance of this protein for CCV expansion, intracellular replication of <italic>Coxiella</italic> and clathrin recruitment to the CCV. Collectively, these results reveal Cig57 to be a significant virulence factor that co-opts clathrin-mediated trafficking, via interaction with FCHO2, to facilitate the biogenesis of the fusogenic <italic>Coxiella</italic> replicative vacuole and enable intracellular success of this human pathogen.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Human Q fever is caused by the intracellular bacterium <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic>. Successful infection of human cells relies on a Dot/Icm secretion system and the translocation of effector proteins into the host cell cytosol. The functions of many <italic>Coxiella</italic> effector proteins, and their contribution to bacterial growth and host manipulation, remain unknown. We show that a unique effector, Cig57, has an important role in manipulation of host cellular clathrin-mediated trafficking. In particular, Cig57 binds FCHO2, a protein involved in formation of clathrin-coated vesicles, in a manner that is dependent on a tyrosine-based endocytic sorting motif. Through engaging proteins in the clathrin pathway, Cig57 facilitates expansion of the <italic>Coxiella</italic> replicative vacuole and enables the pathogen to replicate to large numbers. Thus, we identify a relationship between a host process and a key virulence protein that are required for pathogen success.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The intracellular bacterial pathogen <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic> is the causative agent of human Q fever, a zoonotic disease with the potential to cause life-threatening complications. Transmission to humans occurs via inhalation of contaminated aerosols. Human infection can lead to an acute, pneumonia-like illness, or proceed to a chronic disease state in which endocarditis can manifest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref001">1</xref>]. During natural infection, <italic>Coxiella</italic> predominantly invades alveolar macrophages, and in order to replicate intracellularly, a spacious and fusogenic lysosome-derived vacuole, termed the <italic>Coxiella</italic>-containing vacuole (CCV), is established by the pathogen. After internalization, <italic>Coxiella</italic> passively traffics through the endolysosomal pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref003">3</xref>]. The developing vacuole obtains markers typical of early and late endosomes, such as EEA1 and Rab7, and finally matures to a lysosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref005">5</xref>]. Here, with an internal pH of approximately 4.8, and in the presence of proteolytic and degradative enzymes, <italic>Coxiella</italic> becomes metabolically active and will direct the expansion of the CCV before replicating to large numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref006">6</xref>]. The active form of <italic>Coxiella</italic> is the replicative large cell variant (LCV), distinct from the environmentally stable small cell variant (SCV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>The exact requirements that render the CCV permissive for replication are unknown, however recent mutagenesis studies have demonstrated that a Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system is essential for CCV biogenesis and intracellular replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref009">9</xref>]. This secretion system is activated by the lysosomal environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref010">10</xref>] and more than 130 <italic>Coxiella</italic> effector proteins are known to be translocated from the pathogen into the host cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref018">18</xref>]. Multiple mutagenesis studies have identified a small cohort of Dot/Icm effectors that play important roles in CCV biogenesis and intracellular replication of <italic>Coxiella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref020">20</xref>]. However, the function of most of these effectors and why they are required for intracellular success of <italic>Coxiella</italic> remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Using HeLa cells as an important model for infection, various host cell vesicular trafficking pathways have been shown to facilitate CCV development and contribute to the infection cycle of <italic>Coxiella</italic>. The retromer trafficking process, required for retrograde transport from endosomes to the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref021">21</xref>], has been shown to contribute to the maturation of the CCV with retromer subunits VPS35 and VPS29 and sorting nexins all required for expansion of the CCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref022">22</xref>]. In addition, v-SNAREs VAMP3, VAMP7 and VAMP8 are found on the CCV membrane and have been shown, via siRNA experiments, to aide fusion events with vesicles in the endolysosomal pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref023">23</xref>]. The autophagic SNARE, syntaxin-17, is required for the homotypic fusion of CCVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref023">23</xref>]. Indeed, perturbation of autophagy, through both enzymatic inhibition and siRNA treatment of key proteins required for autophagy, results in a multi-vacuole CCV phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref020">20</xref>]. <italic>Coxiella</italic>, does not appear to induce host cell autophagy but interaction of the CCV with autophagosomes is demonstrated by the accumulation of LC3 inside the CCV, and Rab27 on the vacuole membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref024">24</xref>]. This indicates that successful CCVs are most accurately described as autolysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref024">24</xref>]. Recently, host cell clathrin-mediated trafficking was also shown to be important for intracellular replication of <italic>Coxiella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref025">25</xref>]. Clathrin is important for endocytosis as well as trafficking events within cells. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the process by which host cells internalize material, termed cargo, into clathrin-coated pits, to then be sorted to their subcellular compartments (For a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref026">26</xref>]). Larson and colleagues showed that siRNA gene silencing of <italic>CLTC</italic> (clathrin) and <italic>AP2B1/AP2M1</italic> (AP-2), but not <italic>AP1</italic>, significantly impeded the intracellular replication of <italic>Coxiella</italic>. The adaptor complex AP-2 acts at the plasma membrane during clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and both AP-1 and AP-3 facilitate clathrin-mediated trafficking from the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref027">27</xref>]. These key proteins, required for endocytosis events at the plasma membrane, facilitate the normal growth of <italic>Coxiella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref025">25</xref>]. Thus, the CCV interacts with multiple host vesicular trafficking processes for successful CCV expansion and intracellular replication.</p>
<p>These host pathways are likely manipulated and controlled by complex interactions with <italic>Coxiella</italic> Dot/Icm effector proteins. For example, initial studies linked the multi-vacuolar CCV phenotype seen in <italic>cig2</italic>::Tn mutants with the multi-vacuolar phenotype seen when silencing host autophagy components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref020">20</xref>]. More recently, the effector Cig2 was found to bind phosphoinositide PI(3)P, and this was required for recruitment of autophagy machinery components to facilitate homotypic fusion of CCVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref028">28</xref>]. Additionally, the effector CvpA was found to modulate the association of <italic>Coxiella</italic> with the clathrin trafficking pathway through interaction with AP-2. CvpA is required for intracellular replication of <italic>Coxiella</italic> and this is believed to be linked to the acquisition of endolysosomal lipids and proteins through subversion of the clathrin transport pathway.</p>
<p>Cig57 (CBU1751, a 48.8 kDa protein, 420 amino acids), initially identified as an effector because the promoter region contains a PmrA binding region that indicates that the gene is <underline>c</underline>o-regulated with <underline><italic>i</italic></underline><italic>cm</italic> <underline>g</underline>enes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref029">29</xref>], is also required for intracellular replication of <italic>Coxiella</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref020">20</xref>]. A transposon-mutagenesis screen to identify novel factors that influence CCV morphology identified multiple transposon insertions, disrupting <italic>cig57</italic>, that caused a significant bacterial growth defect and small vacuole phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref020">20</xref>]. Hence this effector plays a vital role in establishing the <italic>Coxiella</italic> intracellular replicative niche. Similar to CvpA, Cig57 contains endocytic sorting motifs that mimic those recognised by adaptor protein complexes in the host cell. In Cig57 there are three endocytic sorting motifs, two dileucine motifs ([DERQ]xxxL[LI]), and one tyrosine motif (YxxΦ), where x represents any amino acid and Φ is a bulky hydrophobic residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref031">31</xref>]. Adaptor protein complexes bind to these motifs usually found on transmembrane proteins such as the transferrin receptor (TfR), to facilitate their selection and uptake into clathrin-coated vesicles (For a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref030">30</xref>]).</p>
<p>Herein, we examine the function of Cig57 by identifying and examining its interaction with the host protein FCHO2. FCHO2 (88.9 kDa, 810 amino acids) is part of the muniscin subfamily of the EFC domain (extended Fes-CIP4 homology) proteins. Muniscins act at the early stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and have been implicated in the initiation of clathrin-coated pits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref033">33</xref>]. Specifically, the N-terminal EFC domain of FCHO2 dimerizes and binds the inner plasma membrane, binding to PI(4,5)P2 enriched membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref034">34</xref>], to enable the curvature seen in the neck of clathrin-coated vesicles. We show FCHO2 is required for optimal CCV formation, and establish that Cig57, interacting with FCHO2 via a tyrosine-based endocytic sorting motif, subverts clathrin to the CCV to facilitate normal vacuole biogenesis and intracellular replication of <italic>Coxiella</italic>.</p>

<title>The effector Cig57 interacts with FCHO2</title>
<p>To identify potential host protein targets of Cig57, a yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) assay was performed using the full length Cig57 as bait and a HeLa cDNA library as prey. Cig57 alone did not activate reporter gene expression, as <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (Y2H Gold, Clontech) carrying pGBKT7-<italic>cig57</italic> could not grow on quadruple dropout (QDO) yeast minimal media (YMM) plates (-Trp, -Leu, -His, -Ade). After screening, only one positive prey clone was identified from the cDNA library, and the insertion was sequenced. This clone encoded amino acids 1 to 433 of the human protein FER/CIP 4 homology only protein 2 (FCHO2). The interaction between Cig57 and FCHO2 1–433 was confirmed by re-transformation of both pGBKT7-<italic>cig57</italic> and pGADT7-<italic>FCHO2</italic> (1–433) into a different <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> strain (AH109). <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> harbouring both pGBKT7-<italic>cig57</italic> and pGADT7-<italic>FCHO2</italic> grew on both double-dropout (DDO, -Trp, -Leu) and QDO YMM agar plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). No interaction was observed with either pGADT7 or pGBKT7 empty vectors. We next sought to confirm this interaction within mammalian cells using an immunoprecipitation method. Importantly, this was done in the context of infection to address whether the interaction between Cig57 and FCHO2 occurs during infection. HEK 293T cells were infected with <italic>Coxiella</italic> transposon mutant <italic>cig57</italic>::Tn expressing 3xFLAG-Cig57 from a plasmid or WT <italic>Coxiella</italic> as a negative control. These cells were then transfected to express either GFP or GFP-FCHO2. Lysates of infected and transfected cells were incubated with beads that bind GFP, and protein bound to the beads were probed with anti-GFP or anti-FLAG antibodies by Western blot. We detected FLAG-Cig57 in the immunoprecipitate of cells expressing GFP-FCHO2, but not in cells expressing GFP alone, validating the interaction between FCHO2 and Cig57 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We next sought to determine the intracellular localization of Cig57. In WT infected cells, we transfected mCherry or mCherry-Cig57, and observed that while mCherry had diffuse localization in cells, mCherry-Cig57 is enriched at the CCV and in punctate structures in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Because of the interaction with FCHO2, we wanted to determine the relative localization of Cig57 and FCHO2 during infection. We engineered a HeLa cell line that constitutively expresses GFP-FCHO2, and transfected these cells with mCherry-Cig57. FCHO2 was not observed to be enriched at the CCV membrane, however FCHO2 and Cig57 co-localize at punctate structures in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>The Cig57 tyrosine-based endocytic sorting motif is essential for interaction with FCHO2</title>
<p>Endocytic sorting motifs are typically present on transmembrane receptor proteins, and are recognised by adaptor proteins for selection and sorting of cargo molecules for clathrin-mediated endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref035">35</xref>]. Cig57 contains three predicted endocytic sorting motifs, two of a dileucine type, and one of the tyrosine type. To evaluate the importance of these motifs in Cig57, we created an endocytic sorting motif mutant (ΔESM) construct with mutations in key residues of the predicted Cig57 endocytic sorting motifs (LI82,83AA, LL275,276AA, Y365A), (Cig57<sub>ΔESM</sub>), and evaluated whether this form of Cig57 could bind FCHO2. To investigate whether FCHO2 can recognise these motifs, we transformed yeast with pGADT7-<italic>FCHO2</italic> (1–433) and pGBKT7-<italic>cig57</italic> containing individual mutations in the endocytic sorting motifs, or mutations in combination with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g002">Fig 2</xref>). We observed growth of all transformants on DDO plates, which indicates yeast viability and successful plasmid uptake, and found no growth on QDO where pGADT7-<italic>FCHO2</italic> (1–433) was transformed alongside pGBKT7-<italic>cig57</italic><sub>ΔESM</sub>, indicating that one or more of the endocytic sorting motifs are involved in the Cig57-FCHO2 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, segment 8). Individual mutations were also assessed for binding to FCHO2, and we showed that while the dileucine motifs were not important for binding FCHO2, the tyrosine residue Y365, part of the endocytic sorting motif YRKF, is essential for binding to FCHO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, segment 2). Hence, we have been able to identify a Cig57 residue essential for this interaction and that FCHO2 might have the capacity to recognise tyrosine-based endocytic sorting motifs. Inability of the proteins to bind to each other was not due to lack of protein expression in the yeast, as all proteins were expressed from the pGAD (anti-HA) and pGBKT (anti-c myc) plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>

<title>Endocytic sorting motifs encoded by Cig57 contribute to effector function</title>
<p>Given the importance of the endocytic sorting motifs, particularly Y365, for binding FCHO2, we examined whether this mutated form of Cig57 could complement the lack of growth seen for the <italic>cig57</italic>::Tn strain. An intracellular growth curve was performed over five days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) which demonstrated the inability of <italic>cig57</italic>::Tn <italic>Coxiella</italic> expressing pFLAG-Cig57<sub>ΔESM</sub> or pFLAG-Cig57<sub>Y365A</sub> to grow to similar levels as WT <italic>Coxiella</italic> or <italic>cig57</italic>::Tn pFLAG-Cig57. Interestingly, the ΔESM and Y365A versions of Cig57 are not completely inactive, as growth is not decreased to the same level as the <italic>cig57</italic>::Tn mutant. This phenotype was also observed visually by quantifying and comparing the CCV areas at 72h post-infection from three independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Using this measure, vacuole areas formed by the <italic>cig57</italic>::Tn pFLAG-Cig57<sub>ΔESM</sub> strain (28.5±4.6 μm<sup>2</sup>) are significantly smaller (P = 0.0001) than those produced by WT (146.8±6.7 μm<sup>2</sup>) and the complemented mutant (143.1±7.5 μm<sup>2</sup>) (P = 0.0002). Interestingly, the vacuole sizes of <italic>cig57</italic>::Tn pFLAG-Cig57<sub>Y365A</sub> (46.9±1.8 μm<sup>2</sup>) were significantly larger than <italic>cig57</italic>::Tn pFLAG-Cig57<sub>ΔESM</sub> (P = 0.020) which may suggest an additional role for the dileucine endocytic sorting motifs. Importantly, both Cig57<sub>Y365A</sub> and Cig57<sub>ΔESM</sub> shows significantly (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.02 respectively) larger vacuoles than <italic>cig57</italic>::Tn mutant (11.0±1.5 μm<sup>2</sup>), indicating that during expression of Cig57<sub>ΔESM</sub>, vacuoles are of an intermediate size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Analysis of a representative experiment allowed us to visualize that indeed the distribution of vacuole sizes differed between the different strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Thus Cig57, and the Cig57 endocytic sorting motifs, particularly the Y365 residue, are important for both intracellular replication of <italic>Coxiella</italic> and expansion of the CCV. To illustrate that all of our <italic>Coxiella</italic> strains were equally as infective, we plotted raw genome equivalent (GE) values for <italic>Coxiella</italic> recovered at timepoint 0h (4 hours post infection), and show that there is no significant difference between the values obtained for each of the strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>

<title>Clathrin localizes to the CCV in a manner dependent on Cig57</title>
<p>The distribution of clathrin normally includes plasma membrane and cytosolic puncta throughout the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref036">36</xref>]. During infection with <italic>Coxiella</italic>, clathrin has been observed around the CCV and this has been shown to require the AP-2 binding effector CvpA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref025">25</xref>]. Given that Cig57 interacts with the clathrin related protein FCHO2 we sought to assess the contribution of Cig57 to the accumulation of clathrin on the CCV. HeLa cells were infected and stained for clathrin heavy chain 72 h after infection. Confocal micrographs showed an increased density of clathrin surrounding the CCV in cells infected with WT <italic>Coxiella</italic> and the <italic>cig57</italic>::Tn pFLAG-Cig57 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Importantly, during infection with the <italic>cig57</italic>::Tn mutant strain, or the mutant strain complemented with either pFLAG-Cig57<sub>ΔESM</sub> or pFLAG-Cig57<sub>Y365A</sub> clathrin is no longer recruited to the CCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). When the clathrin signal was quantified, the ratio of signal on the CCV compared to cytoplasmic signal was approximately 2 in WT (2.1±0.1) and the <italic>cig57</italic>::Tn pFLAG-Cig57 strain (2.0±0.1), which was significantly higher than during infection with the mutant (1.1±0.1), the ΔESM complemented mutant (1.3±0.05), or the Y365A complemented mutant (1.2±0.04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Datapoints from a representative experiment demonstrate the range of clathrin intensity ratios in a representative infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). In order to establish whether clathrin recruitment to the CCV was linked to the size of the CCV we examined the relationship between the area of WT <italic>Coxiella</italic> CCVs and clathrin intensity around the CCV, and found no correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), with a R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.029 and a non-significant slope (P = 0.199) deviation from zero. These data implicate Cig57, and its activity mediated by the endocytic sorting motifs, as required for clathrin recruitment to the CCV.</p>

<p>To further validate that clathrin is recruited to CCV membranes, we co-stained infected HeLa cells with LAMP1 and clathrin, and show that when LAMP1 signal is high on the vacuole membrane, clathrin intensity likewise increases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006101.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).

<title>Localization of FCHO2 during infection</title>
<p>Given the CCV localization of clathrin, we next utilized our GFP-FCHO2 stable HeLa cell line to explore the localization of FCHO2. In uninfected cells, FCHO2 localized to the perinuclear region, and the plasma membrane. Likewise, in cells infected with WT <italic>Coxiella</italic>, FCHO2 localization did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Since clathrin was discovered to be on the CCV membrane, we asked whether FCHO2 is also recruited to the CCV. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, and as quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, we saw no significant increase in FCHO2 signal on the membrane of the WT CCV. This is despite there being an increased signal of FCHO2 within the region of the CCV, yet there was also an increased FCHO2 signal around the nucleus, thus implying that the FCHO2 signal is not specific to the CCV. To further illustrate that FCHO2 is not recruited to CCVs, we stained infected GFP-FCHO2 cells with clathrin or LAMP1, and note that while clathrin and LAMP1 intensity increases on the CCV membrane, FCHO2 signal does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>).</p>

<title>FCHO2 is important for intracellular replication of <italic>Coxiella</italic></title>
<p>FCHO2 and clathrin are important for normal clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Without clathrin, clathrin-mediated trafficking is blocked. In the absence of FCHO2, endocytosis still progresses, yet clathrin-coated pits are abnormally arranged, with AP-2-positive structures appearing enlarged and clustered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref037">37</xref>]. We assessed what the impact of disrupting these genes has on the intracellular replication and CCV formation of <italic>Coxiella</italic>. HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA against clathrin heavy chain (<italic>CLTC</italic>), <italic>FCHO2</italic>, or OnTarget Plus (OTP) non-targeting (OTP-NT). Cells were infected with <italic>Coxiella</italic> 2 days post-siRNA transfection (day 0 post-infection) and lysates were collected for immunoblotting to gauge the level of protein depletion at 0, 2, 4 and 6 days post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The level of knockdown achieved was quantified by measuring band intensities compared to that of the β-actin band intensity. <italic>Coxiella</italic> replication was measured by collecting cell lysates at days 2, 4 and 6 post-infection, and performing qPCR analysis against the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>burnetii ompA</italic> gene to calculate GE. As expected, and described previously, the depletion of cellular clathrin significantly inhibits <italic>Coxiella</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g006">Fig 6B</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref025">25</xref>]). We compared the level of bacterial growth during silencing of FCHO2 also, and though not statistically significant (P = 0.28), there is a trend towards less bacterial growth when the <italic>FCHO2</italic> gene is silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). At day 4 post-infection, samples were fixed for immunofluorescence analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g006">Fig 6C</xref>) to examine vacuole size during depletion of these key transcripts in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The area of individual CCVs was quantified and plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g006">Fig 6D</xref>, in which we show significantly smaller vacuoles when silencing either clathrin (43.4±3.9 μm<sup>2</sup><sub>,</sub> P = 0.0005) or FCHO2 (154.5±22.5 μm<sup>2</sup>, P = 0.012), compared to non-targeting conditions (303.4±25.5 μm<sup>2</sup>). Individual datapoints from one representative experiment are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g006">Fig 6E</xref>, and show that during silencing of clathrin, vacuoles are uniformly small, and that there is a shift towards smaller vacuoles in FCHO2 silenced cells as noted by the population of smaller CCV areas. These data indicate that FCHO2, as well as clathrin, is required for normal CCV biogenesis. While measuring vacuole sizes, we noted a multi-vacuolar phenotype during silencing of clathrin.

<p>Uptake of <italic>Coxiella</italic> is not affected by silencing the clathrin pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref025">25</xref>].

HeLa cells were treated with siRNA against <italic>CLTC</italic> or <italic>FCHO2</italic>, and infected for four hours, at which time the cells were fixed and differentially stained for intracellular and extracellular bacteria.

<p>Using siRNA, clathrin was efficiently depleted from the cells until Day 6 however silencing of <italic>FCHO2</italic> at days 4 and 6 post infection was of poor efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g006">Fig 6</xref>). This may contribute to the lack of a significant inhibition of <italic>Coxiella</italic> replication and a partial defect in CCV expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g006">Fig 6</xref>). To overcome the problem of inefficient removal of FCHO2, a HeLa cell line was created which is completely devoid of FCHO2. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system, HeLa cells were co-transfected with constructs targeting exon 1 and exon 5 of the <italic>FCHO2</italic> gene, resulting in stable loss of protein production and a FCHO2 knockout (KO) cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).

<title>Clathrin recruitment to the CCV is attenuated in the absence of FCHO2</title>
<p>We next asked the question whether clathrin recruitment to the CCV was still able to progress as previously observed in HeLa cells in our FCHO2 KO cells. Using WT <italic>Coxiella</italic>, we infected parental HeLa cells and our FCHO2 KO cell line for three days, and stained for clathrin. As expected, clathrin was found to surround WT vacuoles in HeLa cells, however we observed a lower proportion of FCHO2 KO cells harboured vacuoles that were positive for clathrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Again, we measured LAMP1 intensity at a cross section of the vacuole, and show that clathrin increases at the CCV membrane, corresponding to high LAMP1 signal, on HeLa parent CCVs, CCVs formed in FCHO2 KO cells no longer show an increased clathrin intensity at the CCV membrane, where LAMP1 signal is increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006101.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g003">Fig 3</xref>, clathrin intensity was approximately double the intensity at the CCV compared to the cytoplasm of wild-type HeLa cells (ratio of 2.2±0.1), however in FCHO2 KO cells, the ratio of clathrin intensity in the CCV compared to the cytoplasm was 1.3±0.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). It is to be noted that this phenotype is not as substantial a difference as observed for the CCV clathrin intensity during infection with the <italic>cig57</italic>::Tn mutant, in which the ratio was 1.1±0.1. Indeed, over one representative experiment, we observed a greater range of CCV/cytoplasm ratios during infection of the FCHO2 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g008">Fig 8C</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The identification and characterization of Dot/Icm effector proteins in <italic>Coxiella</italic> is an active field of research that has been significantly bolstered by the recent advances in axenic culture and genetic manipulation of <italic>Coxiella</italic>. However, ascribing functions to these unique effectors remains challenging. Here, we have identified a host factor and pathway, namely FCHO2 and clathrin-mediated endocytosis, that are targeted by the effector protein Cig57. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis plays an essential role in all nucleated cells. Uptake and recycling of a variety of molecules, from plasma membrane receptors to iron is dependent upon the clathrin pathway. Additionally, clathrin is responsible for the trafficking of early endosomal vesicles to and from the trans-Golgi network playing an important role in delivering cargo proteins to their destination organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>It is known that clathrin dependent trafficking is essential for the intracellular <italic>Coxiella</italic> lifecycle, as silencing of clathrin results in diminished intracellular <italic>Coxiella</italic> replication ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref025">25</xref>] and validated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g006">Fig 6</xref>). CvpA, an effector required for intracellular replication of <italic>Coxiella</italic>, was shown to bind AP-2, and now we have shown that another essential effector, Cig57 interacts with a different component of clathrin-coated vesicles, FCHO2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref025">25</xref>]. FCHO2 belongs to the muniscin family of proteins, which also includes FCHO1 and SGIP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref040">40</xref>]. FCHO1 and 2 are thought to be involved in initiating clathrin-mediated endocytosis, though this is debated in the field as clathrin-mediated endocytosis still occurs in the host in the absence of FCHO1/2 albeit with abnormal morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref041">41</xref>]. Nevertheless, FCHO2 arrives early to the site of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and aids in sculpting the plasma membrane to form the spherical clathrin-coated vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref034">34</xref>]. These proteins contain an N-terminal EFC domain responsible for membrane binding, dimerization and induction of membrane curvature, alongside a linker region, followed by a C-terminal μ-homology domain. The μ-homology domain is an interaction hub, facilitating binding to the clathrin accessory proteins EPS15 and intersectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref033">33</xref>]. The interaction we observed using the yeast two hybrid system with FCHO2 was restricted to the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–433), indicating that Cig57 must bind within the EFC domain or the linker region. Binding the EFC domain may mean Cig57 is altering the membrane-binding capacity of FCHO2, by either blocking its ability to dimerize or bend membranes, or possibly even post-translationally modifying the protein in this region.</p>
<p>We have shown that FCHO2 is required for normal CCV biogenesis during infection with <italic>Coxiella</italic>. CCVs are significantly smaller in FCHO2 KO HeLa cells and there is a trend towards reduced replication of <italic>Coxiella</italic> in these cells. Additionally, the <italic>Coxiella</italic> growth defect in the absence of FCHO2 is not as severe as the growth defect in the absence of clathrin. Taken together, this indicates a level of dependence on the clathrin-mediated pathway for growth of <italic>Coxiella</italic>, where the extent of intracellular bacterial growth may be proportional to the amount of endocytosis exhibited.</p>
<p>FCHO1 is a close homologue of FCHO2. They share approximately 50% homology overall at the protein level. However, the amount of FCHO1 present in HeLa cells is very low, such that endogenous FCHO1 is undetectable by Western Blot analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref041">41</xref>]. This study has not determined whether Cig57 has the same affinity for FCHO1 as it does FCHO2, but if it does, there is a potential for there to be a greater growth defect in the absence of both FCHO1 and FCHO2. We did not pursue this in our study as it has been previously shown that a FCHO1/2 double knockout is indistinguishable from a FCHO2 knockout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref037">37</xref>]. The formation of clustered and abnormal clathrin-coated vesicles is equivalent in both cases.</p>
<p>Interaction with FCHO2 occurs through the Cig57 tyrosine-based endocytic sorting motif. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the ability of FCHO2 to recognise such motifs, as they are normally recognised by adaptor protein complexes such as AP-2. Indeed, CvpA also contains endocytic sorting motifs and these mediate interaction with AP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref025">25</xref>]. Whether Cig57 is also able to simultaneously bind AP-2 will be an interesting line of further research. Complementation of <italic>cig57</italic>::Tn with <italic>cig57</italic> encoding mutated endocytic sorting motifs leads to CCVs that phenocopy the small vacuole phenotype observed in FCHO2 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Hence, the inability of the Cig57<sub>ΔESM</sub> and Cig57<sub>Y365A</sub> to complement the <italic>cig57</italic>::Tn mutant is likely due to the inability of this modified effector to bind FCHO2. Importantly, these strains were not attenuated to the same levels as the <italic>cig57</italic>::Tn mutant which may indicate that Cig57 possesses other activity and perhaps the interaction between Cig57 and FCHO2 acts to facilitate Cig57 activity on other components of the clathrin machinery. Interestingly, our results show that the Y365A mutation of Cig57 is not as attenuating as the ΔESM combined mutations, particular in relation to the expansion of the CCV. This may suggest a further role for the dileucine endocytic sorting motifs in full Cig57 function.</p>
<p>Clathrin-coats are formed at the plasma membrane, at the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network or on endosomes, and associate with adaptor protein complexes for selection of protein or lipid cargo and specificity of the final destination. Vesicle budding and receptor sorting are facilitated by the formation of a clathrin coat at a membrane. During infection with <italic>Coxiella</italic> the final destination of some of the clathrin-coated vesicles appears to be the CCV, as evidenced by the accumulation of clathrin on the CCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006101.g005">Fig 5</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref025">25</xref>]). This would offer advantages to <italic>Coxiella</italic> to sequester extra membrane from the clathrin-coated vesicles, and to enable the delivery of nutrients in the form of cargo proteins and lipids from the vesicles to the CCV. The recruitment of clathrin-coated vesicles is dependent on the interaction between Cig57 and FCHO2. <italic>Coxiella</italic> lacking Cig57 cannot recruit clathrin to the CCV and similarly, clathrin recruitment is diminished in the absence of FCHO2. Overall this leads to biogenesis of a CCV that has reduced ability to expand and support <italic>Coxiella</italic> replication.</p>
<p>Despite the requirement for FCHO2 to promote the recruitment of clathrin on CCV membranes, we did not observe recruitment or enrichment of FCHO2 on the CCV. This does not rule out the possibility that this host protein is dynamically cycling on and off the CCV membrane. Importantly, FCHO2 is also not observed on mature clathrin-coated vesicles as it acts early to in the initiation of endocytosis. Thus, the Cig57-FCHO2 interaction may occur at the plasma membrane or other compartments in the cell where FCHO2 has been observed, likely due to the affinity of FCHO2 to particular phospholipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006101.ref032">32</xref>]. We therefore cannot discount that Cig57 is taking advantage of an as yet undiscovered role that FCHO2 has in the host. Further investigation of the biochemical function of Cig57 and investigating the functional outcome of the Cig57-FCHO2 interaction will be an exciting area of future study. This line of research will likely reveal the complex mechanisms employed by <italic>Coxiella</italic> to establish a unique intracellular niche to support replication and virulence within the human host.</p>
