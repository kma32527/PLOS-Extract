<abstract>
<p>Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), considered critical for immunity against viruses, were recently associated with defense mechanisms against fungal infections. However, the immunomodulatory function of pDCs in pulmonary paracoccidiodomycosis (PCM), an endemic fungal infection of Latin America, has been poorly defined. Here, we investigated the role of pDCs in the pathogenesis of PCM caused by the infection of 129Sv mice with 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis-</italic>yeasts. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments showed that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> infection induces the maturation of pDCs and elevated synthesis of TNF-α and IFN-β. The <italic>in vivo</italic> infection caused a significant influx of pDCs to the lungs and increased levels of pulmonary type I IFN. Depletion of pDCs by a specific monoclonal antibody resulted in a less severe infection, reduced tissue pathology and increased survival time of infected mice. An increased influx of macrophages and neutrophils and elevated presence of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes expressing IFN-γ and IL-17 in the lungs of pDC-depleted mice were also observed. These findings were concomitant with decreased frequency of Treg cells and reduced levels of immunoregulatory cytokines such as IL-10, TGF-β, IL-27 and IL-35. Importantly, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasilienis</italic> infection increased the numbers of pulmonary pDCs expressing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO), an enzyme with immunoregulatory properties, that were reduced following pDC depletion. In agreement, an increased immunogenic activity of infected pDCs was observed when IDO-deficient or IDO-inhibited pDCs were employed in co-cultures with lymphocytes Altogether, our results suggest that in pulmonary PCM pDCs exert a tolerogenic function by an IDO-mediated mechanism that increases Treg activity.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The fungus <italic>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</italic> causes paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), the most relevant deep mycosis in Latin America. The plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are important immune cells involved in protection against viral infections, but their role in fungal infections remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of pDCs in the pathogenesis of pulmonary PCM using a monoclonal antibody to deplete this DC subset. pDCs depletion leads to a less severe PCM associated with increased T cell response mainly mediated by Th1 and Th17 cells. The lung homogenates of depleted mice showed diminished levels of type I IFN and anti-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, a reduced number of regulatory T cells (Treg) paralleled a diminished number pDCs expressing IDO, a potent immunoregulatory enzyme. In agreement, pDCs of IDO<sup>-/-</sup> mice or IDO-inhibited pDCs stimulated by <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> yeasts expanded elevated numbers of T cells concomitant with a reduced expansion of Treg cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate a tolerogenic activity of pDCs that enhances the severity of a pulmonary mycosis mediated by the concerted action of IDO and Treg cells. These results reveal a new function for pDCs in primary fungal infections and open new perspectives for immunotherapeutic procedures of PCM involving the control of IDO and Treg activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Paracoccidioides brasiliensis</italic>, a thermally dimorphic fungus, is the causative agent of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), the most prevalent deep mycosis in Latin America. In humans and murine models of PCM, resistance to disease is associated with the secretion of IFN-γ and other Th1 cytokines, whereas impaired Th1 immunity and the prevalent secretion of Th2 cytokines correlate with systemic and progressive disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref003">3</xref>]. The importance of Th17 immunity is not well defined. However, IL-17-expressing cells have been observed in cutaneous and mucosal lesions of PCM patients and have been associated with the organization of granulomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref004">4</xref>]. It was also recently reported that the diverse patterns of T cell responses of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic>-infected individuals lead to different clinical manifestations. The resistance to infection observed in asymptomatic individuals was shown to be mediated by a predominant Th1 response, which is responsible for macrophage activation. The most severe form of the disease, the juvenile form, presents a prevalent Th2/Th9 response and an enhanced antibody response. In the chronic inflammatory response characteristic of the adult form of the disease, a prominent Th17 immunity with important participation of Th1 cells was described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref005">5</xref>]. Additional studies with mouse Pattern Recognition Receptors-deficient (PRR-deficient) cells allowed us to demonstrate that dectin-1, mannose receptor (MR), TLR-2, and TLR-4 control lymphocyte proliferation and IL-17 production induced by <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic>-stimulated dendritic cells (DCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref006">6</xref>]. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have also demonstrated that TLR2 deficiency enhanced Th17 immunity, which was associated with diminished expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and increased lung pathology due to unrestrained inflammatory reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref007">7</xref>]. Furthermore, studies with TLR4, dectin-1 and MyD88 deficient mice led us to demonstrate the essential influence of these receptors and adaptor molecule expression in the control of lung pathology and dissemination of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> yeasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>DCs are bone marrow derived cells that continuously survey their environment for invading microorganisms and are considered professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) due to their unique ability to activate T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref011">11</xref>]. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are a subset of DCs that produce large amounts of type I interferon and are largely involved in the immunity against viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref012">12</xref>]. However, pDCs can also exert a tolerogenic function suppressing T cell immunity and expanding regulatory T cells (Treg) in infectious processes and neoplasms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref016">16</xref>]. Upon viral exposure, pDCs initiate protective antiviral responses by secreting up to 1000-fold more type I IFNs than other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref016">16</xref>]. Following TLR stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref018">18</xref>] pDCs become potent APCs that secrete high levels of cytokines such as IFN-α and TNF-α and differentiate into mature pDCs upregulating MHC and costimulatory molecules and priming naive T cells to Th1 or Th17 differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Beyond the universe of viral infections, an important role of pDCs was demonstrated in the immune response against <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>, an intracellular bacterium. These studies showed that pDCs were quickly recruited to the lungs of infected mice, and their depletion led to increased bacterial load in a mechanism independent of type I IFNs production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref021">21</xref>]. Furthermore, in some fungal infections an important involvement of pDCs was also described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref024">24</xref>]. Ramirez-Ortiz showed that pDCs bind to and inhibit the growth of <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> hyphae and depletion of these cells renders mice hyper-susceptible to experimental aspergillosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref023">23</xref>]. Moreover, our group showed that dectin-2, a C-type lectin receptor (CLR) expressed by human pDCs, acts in cooperation with the FcRγ chain to recognize <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> hyphae, activate signaling responses, synthesize TNF-α and IFN-α, and exert antifungal activity. Furthermore, hyphal stimulation of human pDCs triggers a distinct pattern of pDC gene expression and leads to formation of extracellular traps (pETs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref024">24</xref>]. In a previous study, we verified that <italic>in vitro P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> infection induced in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) of susceptible mice a prevalent inflammatory myeloid phenotype that secreted high levels of IL-12, TNF-α, and IL-β, whereas in resistant mice, a mixed population of myeloid and pDCs secreting inflammatory cytokines and expressing elevated levels of secreted and membrane-bound TGF- β was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, we investigated the contribution of pDCs to host defenses against murine PCM. Depletion of pDCs results in a less severe disease, a high frequency of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes, concomitant with elevated numbers of macrophages and neutrophils that migrate to the lungs of depleted mice. The analysis of lung homogenates showed diminished levels of type I IFN as well as reduced levels of immunoregulatory cytokines. Furthermore, a reduced number of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells and a decreased presence of pDCs expressing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme with potent immunoregulatory properties, were found in the lungs of pDC-depleted mice. Finally, pDCs of IDO deficient mice and 1MT-treated pDCs stimulated by <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> yeasts were more efficient in the induction and activation of T cells in parallel with reduced expansion of Treg cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate a tolerogenic activity of pDCs associated with increased expansion of Treg cells possibly by an IDO-mediated mechanism.</p>

<p>Initial experiments were focused on determining the pDCs response following <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasilienis</italic> infection. pDCs were isolated from the lungs of uninfected and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasilienis</italic> infected mice at weeks 2 and 8 post-infection. The maturation of pDCs was assessed by flow cytometric evaluation of activation markers as well a the presence of type I IFNs and TNF-α in the supernatant of cell cultures. A gating strategy to the pDC analysys is represented in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006115.g001">Fig 1A</xref>. A mature phenotype of pDCs was induced by <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasilienis</italic> infection. A higher frequency of cells expressing CD40, CD80, CD86 and MHC-II was observed in pulmonary pDCs isolated from infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006115.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>) when compared with cells from uninfected mice. The number of pDCs that migrate to the lungs was also determined. We observed an increased number of pDCs following <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasilienis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006115.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).

<p>By two weeks after infection, lungs of pDC-depleted mice showed diminished levels of regulatory cytokines (TGF-β and IL-10), associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-12 and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006115.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). This behavior suggested that the pDCs were preferably priming regulatory or suppressive T cells and their reduction led to preferential inflammatory responses. By eight weeks after infection, this anti-inflammatory response became more evident: IL-35, IL-27, and TGF-β appeared in reduced levels in contrast to the elevated concentrations of Th1 and Th17 cytokines in the lungs of pDC-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006115.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Since IL-27 was previously shown to play important immunoreregulatory functions in the liver, the hepatic synthesis of this cytokine was assessed at weeks 2 and 8 after <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> infection, and reduced levels were found in pDC-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006115.g003">Fig 3G</xref>).

<title>Absence of type I IFN signaling increases fungal loads and tissue pathology resulting in increased mortality rates of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> infected mice</title>
<p>Because pDCs are the major producers of type I IFNs and reduced levels of IFN-β were found in the lung supernatants of pDC-depleted mice, we next examined the susceptibility of IFNα/βR<sup>−/−</sup> mice, which do not respond to type I IFNs, to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> infection. To have o more complete view on the effects of IFNs signaling during PCM infection, we also evaluated the course of the disease in the IFNγR<sup>−/−</sup> and IRF1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. It is known that IFNs signaling is initiated by two distinct cell-surface receptors, type I IFN receptor (IFNα/βR) and type II IFN receptor (IFNγR). Signaling through IFNαR/STAT1 leads to the formation IFNα-activated factor that mediates the activation of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) gene by binding to IFNγ-activated sequence (GAS) in IRF-1 promoter. Likewise, type II IFN signaling through IFNγR/STAT1 also results in STAT1 homodimers binding to GAS and IRF-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref027">27</xref>]. Notably, IRF-1 was the first described member of the family of transcription factors known as Interferon Responsive Factors, which have essential roles in responses against intracellular pathogens, including generation of iNOS and subsequent NO production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>The severity of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> infection was assessed in IFNα/βR<sup>−/−</sup>, IFNγR<sup>−/−</sup> and IRF-1<sup>-/-</sup> mice at early and late periods of the disease. Pulmonary, liver and splenic fungal burdens were increased at weeks 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006115.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006115.g008">8</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006115.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) after infection compared to those observed in WT mice. In addition, an increased number of nonorganized lesions containing high numbers of fungal cells and intense tissue destruction were observed in IFNα/βR<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Pulmonary lesions in IFNα/βR<sup>−/−</sup> mice replaced large part of normal tissue and were composed of confluent necrotic lesions containing many budding yeasts. The lesions in the lungs of WT mice occupied a small area and were composed of organized granulomas of small sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006115.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). The lesions and severity of the disease in the IFNα/βR<sup>−/−</sup> mice was similar to those found in IFNγR<sup>−/−</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006115.g004">Fig 4E</xref>) and IRF-1<sup>-/-</sup>mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006115.g004">Fig 4F</xref>) as indicated by the area of pulmonary of lesions detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006115.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). Survival of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic>-infected mice was registered daily over a 110-day period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006115.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). All deficient strains showed increased mortality rates in comparison with WT mice. The mean survival time of IRF-1<sup>-/-</sup> mice was 35 days, of IFNα/βR<sup>−/−</sup> and IFNγR<sup>−/−</sup> mice was 40 days, while the WT mice presented a mean survival time of 80 days. Altogether these data indicate that type I and type II IFNs are protective to pulmonary PCM, and the less severe disease caused by depletion of pDCs cannot be attributed to the reduced levels of type I IFNs observed during depletion experiments.</p>

<p>Our recent study showed that indolemine 2,3 dioxygenase control fungal burdens, and inflammatory reactions in pulmonary PCM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref030">30</xref>]. In addition, the production of IDO by pDCs has been linked to the proliferation and activation of resting Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref031">31</xref>]. Our findings demonstrating a reduced frequency of Treg cells in pDC-depleted mice, led us to further investigate the participation of IDO in the tolerance mechanisms promoted by pDCs. First, we evaluated the production of IDO by pDCs isolated from uninfected and infected mice (2 and 8 weeks after <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> infection). A gating strategy to the pDC analysis is represented in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006115.g009">Fig 9A</xref>. As can be seen, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasileinsis</italic> infection induced an increased frequency and number of pDCs expressing IDO in comparison with uninfected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006115.g009">Fig 9B and 9C</xref>). Consistent with the IDO production, the levels of kynurenines were also found in increased levels in the supernatants of pDCs isolated from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006115.g009">Fig 9D</xref>).</p>

<p>Further studies demonstrated a reduced expression of IDO mRNA in the lungs of pDC-depleted mice at all post-infection periods assayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006115.g009">Fig 9E</xref>). In addition, the levels of kynurenines were also found in reduced levels in the lung homogenates of pDC-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006115.g009">Fig 9F</xref>).

These pDCS were then co-cultured with normal splenic lymphocytes from 129Sv mice.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several studies have demonstrated the important regulatory function of pDCs in immunity against viral infections, autoimmune diseases and in the maintenance of self-tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref033">33</xref>]. Although a prominent function of pDCs has been particularly associated with viral infections, recent investigations have expanded this concept to other types of pathogens. Under the universe of microbial infections new data have been added demonstrating an important role of these cells in bacterial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref036">36</xref>] and fungal infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, we investigated the contribution of pDCs to host defenses against pulmonary PCM. Following pulmonary <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiensis</italic> infection of 129Sv WT mice, a considerable recruitment of pDCs to the lungs was observed. These recruited pDCs are able to present antigen to T cells and secrete cytokines as evidenced by the hight expression of coestimulatory molecules, MHC-II, TNF-α and IFN-β production. The influx of pDCs to the site of infection was also reported during <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref023">23</xref>], but here we were able to demonstrate the mature phenotype of these cells and their ability to secrete cytokines, including type I IFN.</p>
<p>The depletion of pDCs led to a less severe infection, with decreased fungal burdens in the lungs, resulting in increased survival times. This better disease outcome was concomitant with a reduced number of organized lesions containing small numbers of fungal cells and diminished damaged tissue. These findings were opposed to those described previously where pDC-depleted mice were dramatically more susceptible to both pulmonary and systemic infection with <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref023">23</xref>]. Therefore, pDCs can be viewed as protective or detrimental cells during fungal infections, depending on the fungal species that is causing the infection, and further studies with diverse fungal pathogens and morphotypes should be done to better understand the role of pDCs in fungal infections.</p>
<p>pDCs secrete large amounts of type I IFN in response to several viruses and to a large variety of DNA and RNA sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref037">37</xref>], but their role during fungal infections remains unclear. The role for type I IFNs in invasive aspergillosis was investigated by comparing wild-type mice and IFNα/βR<sup>−/−</sup> mice. The deficient mice had accelerated mortality after intravenous challenge with <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref023">23</xref>]. In accordance, IFNα/βR<sup>−/−</sup> mice were susceptible to <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> and failed to produce protective Th1 cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref038">38</xref>], but studies with murine models of candidiasis have implicated type I IFN receptor-deficient mice with decreased survival rates after <italic>Candida albicans</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref039">39</xref>]. Here we showed that pDC respond to <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> infection producing mRNA to IFN-α and IFN-β, secrete IFN-β at the site of infection but behave as tolerogenic cells that increase disease severity. In agreement, tolerogenic pDCs induced by TGF-β signaling and phosphorylated IDO produce high levels of IDO and TGF-β besides IFN-α/IFN-β in response to the noncanonical NF-;AB pathway of cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>During pDC depletion reduced levels of type I IFNs were found in lung homogenates, leading us to hypothesize that the protective mechanism mediated by pDCs depletion could be due to the inhibition of type I IFNs production. To analyze this possibility we have further studied the course of the disease in IFNαβR <sup>-/-</sup> mice. A protective effect of type I IFN signaling was detected as demonstrated by the increased fungal loads, tissue pathology and mortality rates developed by deficient mice. It is important to highlight that in depletion experiments only reduced levels of type I IFN were seen whereas total abrogation of type I IFN signaling characterizes the response of type I IFNαβR <sup>-/-</sup> mice. Therefore, it is possible that total absence versus partial reduction of type I IFN could explain the apparent discrepancy observed in depletion studies versus experiments using genetically deficient mice. Furthermore, type I IFN signaling is important to nitric oxide (NO) production induced by type 2 nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref041">41</xref>] and NO has been described as one of the most important mediator involved in the fungicidal mechanisms and immunoprotection against <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref043">43</xref>]. Thus, the total absence of type I IFN signaling could have exacerbated more drastic effects in NO production than its partial reduction. It is also relevant to point out that pDC is described as the major source of type I IFNs, but these cytokines can be produced by almost any cell type in the body in response to stimulation of an array of transmembrane and cytosolic receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref026">26</xref>], but during pDC depletion only one source was withdrawal. Altogether, our data demonstrated that the immunoprotection induced by pDC depletion was not mediated by the inhibition of type I IFN production. Surprisingly, the severity of the disease caused by absence of type I IFN signaling was equivalent to that observed in IFNγR<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Indeed, IFNγ is a major cytokine associated with PCM resistance due to its macrophage activating activity, induction of NO and inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα resulting in inhibition of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref046">46</xref>].</p>
<p>Because pDCs express MHC class II molecules as well as costimulatory molecules such as CD40, CD80 and CD86, they can present antigens to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref048">48</xref>]. The pDCs have also been shown to be particularly involved in the differentiation of Th17 cells, an emergent T cell subtype that appears to have an important role in the immunity against fungal infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref050">50</xref>]. In addition, IFN-α produced by pDCs modulated the Th17 differentiation during the early infection of mice by <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref036">36</xref>]. In contrast, in our study pDC depletion increased the differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells indicating a tolerogenic function of these antigen-presenting cells. This activity, as demonstrated by enhanced expression of mRNA of transcription factors Tbet and RORc for Th1 and Th17 differentiation and production of elevated levels of type-1 and type-17 cytokines by pDC depleted mice, indicates the suppressive activity of this DC subset in the immunity against <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> infection.</p>
<p>The outcome of antigen presentation can be tolerogenic, leading to the differentiation of regulatory or suppressor T cells, T cell anergy and impaired T cell proliferation, depending on the signals developed at the time of antigen recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref051">51</xref>]. Some reports showed that pDCs resident in human thymus drive natural Treg cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref052">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref053">53</xref>]. Besides, the high expression of some cell markers like ICOS-L provides the maturation of human pDCs and the ability of inducing the differentiation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to Treg IL-10-producing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref014">14</xref>]. Treg cells can also be induced by PD-L1 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref054">54</xref>], and pDCs expressing high levels of this cell component were able to expand an elevated frequency of Treg cells in tolerized recipients. Moreover, splenic pDCs from PD-L1-deficient mice induce greater levels of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation than pDCs from WT mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref056">56</xref>]. In our model, the depletion of pDC affected the expression of Foxp3, the major transcription factor of Treg cells. Accordingly, pDC-depleted mice showed lower frequency Treg cells in comparison with IgG-treated mice, besides a decreased expression of most of cell markers associated with the suppressive activity of Treg cells (CTLA-4, GITR, and ICOS).</p>
<p>In a previous study, we showed that early depletion of Treg cells by anti-CD25 antibodies culminates with a less severe disease in susceptible and resistant mice infected with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic>. Importantly, anti-CD25 treatment led to increased fungicidal mechanisms and increased secretion of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines without enhanced tissue pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref057">57</xref>]. Another study using gain and loss approaches demonstrated the dual role of Tregs that are involved in the control of tissue pathology and in the differentiation of Th17 cells but also in the suppression of protective T cell immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref058">58</xref>]. The findings here reported are in agreement with our previous studies because we could verify that the impaired Treg response resulted in effective Th1 and Th17 immune response that increased the influx of inflammatory cells to the site of infection without enhanced tissue pathology. This behavior suggests that in pulmonary PCM, pDCs prime and expand regulatory T cells and its deficiency contributes to more efficient Th1 and Th17 immune responses. The measurement of lung cytokines has also demonstrated the importance of pDCs in the production of regulatory cytokines. Indeed, TGF-β, IL-10, IL-35 and IL-27 were found in reduced levels in the lungs of pDC-depleted mice. IL-35 is a recently described Treg cytokine required for maximal regulatory activity of murine and human Treg cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref059">59</xref>]. IL-27 has also broad inhibitory effects on Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells as well as on the expansion of inducible Treg cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref060">60</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that IL-27 produced by mouse hepatic pDCs has an important contribution to immunoregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref061">61</xref>]. In agreement, our studies demonstrated a significant augment of IL-27 levels in lungs and liver homogenates after <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> infection as well as a reduction of pulmonary and hepatic IL-27 in pDC-depleted mice. In addition, <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments confirmed that hepatic pDCs are a source of IL-27. Unfortunately, we did not detect IL-27 in the lung pDCs isolated from uninfected and infected mice. An explanation for this negative finding is the different yield of pDCs recovered from lungs and liver. The <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture of lung pDCs was performed with 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells while 3 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells were used in the liver pDC cultures. As a whole, the findings here reported confirmed the important tolerogenic role of pDCs in pulmonary PCM. These cells are involved in the expansion of Treg cells, inhibition of Th1 and Th17 immunity but their deficiency do not exert a deleterious effect because the increase inflammatory immunity was accompanied by significant reduction on fungal loads with consequent reduction in fungal-induced pathology.</p>
<p>IDO is a rate-limiting enzyme that converts tryptophan to its metabolic products, collectively known as kynurenines. The expression of IDO by macrophages and DCs subsets allows them to inhibit T cell priming and proliferation associated with enhanced Treg cells differentiation, highlighting the importance of IDO expression in the prevention of hyper inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref062">62</xref>]. Besides its enzymatic activity, IDO was also shown to be involved in intracellular signaling events responsible for the amplification and maintenance of a regulatory phenotype in pDCs that promotes tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref064">64</xref>]. Our data are in agreement with the axis IDO-Treg in promoting immune tolerance because an increased frequency and number of pDCs expressing IDO during <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasilensis</italic> infection were found. In addition, a reduced expression of IDO mRNA in the lungs of pDC-depleted mice was detected at all post-infection periods. It was previously described that the IDO activity and sustained production of kynurenines promote the expansion of Treg cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref065">65</xref>]. In accordance, culture supernatants of pDCs isolated from infected mice showed higher levels of kynurenines than those obtained from uninfected mice. In addition, the <italic>in vivo</italic> depletion of pDCs reduces the levels of kynurenines produced indicating a close correlation between IDO expression, kynurenines production and increased expansion of Treg cells.</p>
<p>Our data have also further elucidate the role of IDO in the tolerogenic activity of pDCs. The pDC treatement with 1MT and co-cultured with normal splenic lymphocytes from 129Sv mice led to reduced expansion of Treg cells associated with increased proliferation and activation of T cells. This finding was further confirmed using pDC from IDO<sup>-/-</sup> mice. In accordance, the frequency of Treg cells was significantly diminished when the pDCs were isolated from IDO-deficient mice than obtained from WT mice. Previous studies highlighted the involvement of a fungal infection in the IDO-dependent promotion of tolerogenic DCs. Candida-hyphae activate the tolerogenic program in some DC subsets and this behavior controls the balance between inflammation and tolerance. This balance is fundamental to the coevolution of host immunity and commensal fungal infections that occur without excessive detrimental effects to both organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref066">66</xref>]. It is important to note that the main effect of IDO inhibition in the immunity of resistant and susceptible mice previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref030">30</xref>] is different from that here reported. In B10.A mice, the IDO activity is mainly mediated by IFN-γ, whereas in the resistant A/J mice IDO is mainly induced by TGF-β signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref030">30</xref>]. In addition, the early tolerogenic response developed by A/J mice is transitory and later counter balanced by a pro-inflammatory activity and prevalent NLRP3 activation resulting in a late Th1/Th17 immunity tightly regulated by Treg cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006115.ref067">67</xref>]. In the 129Sv background, we believe that the tolerogenic role of pDCs appears to be maintained in the course of infection, resulting in more severe infection that can be modulated by pDCs depletion. The disease severity developed by 129Sv mice is more close to that developed by the susceptible mouse strain. However, in contrast to B10.A mice where suppression of T cell response is mediated by excessive pro-inflammatory innate immunity, the deficient T cell immunity here observed was mainly mediated by the sustained expansion of tolerogenic pDCs.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results clearly demonstrated the tolerogenic function of pDCs during pulmonary PCM. These cells are involved in the differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells possibly by an IDO-mediated mechanism that impairs the development of protective Th1 and Th17 cells. Finally, we believe that these results contribute to a better understanding of immunoregulation during <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasileinsis</italic> infection, and open perspectives of novel immunotherapeutic procedures based on the control of IDO production and Treg expansion.</p>

<title>Assessment of leukocyte subpopulations and flow cytometric analysis</title>
<p>Lungs and liver from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>brasilienis</italic>-infected 129Sv mice were collected after 2 and 8 weeks of infection. Both organs from uninfected 129Sv mice were also collected. To asses the leukocyte subpopulations after depletion of pDCs, the lungs from 129Sv pDC-depleted and control mice were removed after 96h, 2 and 8 weeks post infection and digested enzymatically for 40 minutes with collagenase (2 mg/mL) in RPMI culture medium (Sigma). Total lung leukocyte numbers were assessed with trypan blue, and viability was always &gt;95%. For cell-surface staining, leukocytes and purified pDCs were washed and suspended at 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in staining buffer (PBS, 2% fetal calf serum and 0.1% NaN<sub>3</sub>). Fc receptors were blocked by the addition of unlabeled anti-CD16/32 (eBioscience). Leukocytes were then stained in the dark for 20 min at 4°C with the optimal dilution of each monoclonal antibody. To pDC: anti-CD11c, B220, PDCA, CD40, CD80, CD86 and MHC-II; lymphocytes: CD4, CD8, CD25, CD69, CTLA-4, PD-1, ICOS, GITR; macrophages and neutrophils: F4/80, CD11b, Ly6G (eBiosciences or BioLegend). Cells were washed twice with staining buffer, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma). For intracellular detection of cytokines, leukocytes obtained from lungs were stimulated for 6 hours in complete RPMI medium containing 50 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 500 ng/mL ionomycin (Sigma), and 3 mM monensin (eBioscience). Next, cells were labeled for surface molecules and then treated according to the manufacturer’s protocol for intracellular staining using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) and specifics antibodies anti-17, IL-4, IFN-γ, FoxP3 and IDO. Cells were washed twice with staining buffer, suspended in 100 μl, and an equal volume of PFA was added to fix the cells. A minimum of 50,000 events was acquired on FACScanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using the FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). Lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils were gated as judged from forward and side light scatter. For Treg cell characterization, FACS plots or histograms were gated on live CD45<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cells and the expression of FoxP3<sup>+</sup> were determined. The cell surface expression of leukocyte markers as well as intracellular cytokine expression was analyzed using the FlowJo software (Tree Star).</p>
