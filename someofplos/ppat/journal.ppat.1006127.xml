<abstract>
<p>Scavenger receptors are an important class of pattern recognition receptors that play several important roles in host defense against pathogens. The class C scavenger receptors (SRCs) have only been identified in a few invertebrates, and their role in the immune response against viruses is seldom studied. In this study, we firstly identified an SRC from kuruma shrimp, <italic>Marsupenaeus japonicus</italic>, designated <italic>Mj</italic>SRC, which was significantly upregulated after white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) challenge at the mRNA and protein levels in hemocytes. The quantity of WSSV increased in shrimp after knockdown of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC, compared with the controls. Furthermore, overexpression of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC led to enhanced WSSV elimination via phagocytosis by hemocytes. Pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated the interaction between <italic>Mj</italic>SRC and the WSSV envelope protein. Electron microscopy observation indicated that the colloidal gold-labeled extracellular domain of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC was located on the outer surface of WSSV. <italic>Mj</italic>SRC formed a trimer and was internalized into the cytoplasm after WSSV challenge, and the internalization was strongly inhibited after knockdown of <italic>Mj</italic>β-arrestin2. Further studies found that <italic>Mj</italic>β-arrestin2 interacted with the intracellular domain of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC and induced the internalization of WSSV in a clathrin-dependent manner. WSSV were co-localized with lysosomes in hemocytes and the WSSV quantity in shrimp increased after injection of lysosome inhibitor, chloroquine. Collectively, this study demonstrated that <italic>Mj</italic>SRC recognized WSSV via its extracellular domain and invoked hemocyte phagocytosis to restrict WSSV systemic infection. This is the first study to report an SRC as a pattern recognition receptor promoting phagocytosis of a virus.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Shrimp aquaculture is a major industry in many coastal countries, where it contributes significantly to socio-economic development. However, during the rapid expansion of shrimp industry, a succession of previously unknown diseases, especially viral diseases, have emerged in farmed shrimp and spread rapidly across international boundaries, which have significant effects on shrimp production. Since 1994, it has been estimated that annual losses globally caused by viral diseases have been as high as $US3 billion. White spot syndrome, caused by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), is the most serious disease in shrimp aquaculture. Here, we reveal that a scavenger receptor in kuruma shrimp, <italic>Marsupenaeus japonicus</italic> (<italic>Mj</italic>SRC) functions as the pattern recognition receptor for WSSV. <italic>Mj</italic>SRC binds to WSSV and initiates phagocytosis of the virus, ultimately leading to degradation of WSSV in the lysosomes of hemocytes. This is the first report of the <italic>Mj</italic>SRC antiviral mechanism, which may be used as a control strategy to prevent WSSV infection in shrimp.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>White spot syndrome virus (WSSV), which is a serious pathogen that threatens the aquaculture of shrimp, has led to huge economic losses in the shrimp industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref001">1</xref>]. Although great advances have been made in both pathogen study, including mechanisms and strategies used by the virus to infect and replicate in host cells, such as the findings of envelope proteins, VP19, 24, 26 and 28 interacting with each other and playing an important role in virus assembly and infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref002">2</xref>]; and host immune responses against the virus, including humoral and cellular immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref003">3</xref>]. However, there is no existing treatment to restrict the uncontrolled occurrence and rapid spread of the disease in the field. Understanding the mechanisms of the host-virus interaction might help to find new strategies and methods for WSSV control.</p>
<p>Host innate immunity plays an important role in protecting the organism from pathogen invasion, particularly in invertebrates, which lack the typical adaptive immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref004">4</xref>]. Pattern recognition is the first step in the innate immune response, initiated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense the presence of microorganic structural components, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref002">2</xref>], such as lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycan from bacteria or some proteins from viruses. Eleven types of PRRs, such as Toll like receptors, C-type lectins, thioester-containing protein and scavenger receptors, have been identified in shrimp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref005">5</xref>]. Some receptors have been studied in depth; however, there are relatively few reports about the immunological roles of scavenger receptors (SRs) in invertebrates.</p>
<p>SRs comprise nine heterogeneous classes (A–I), classified in accordance with their multidomain structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref006">6</xref>]. Brown and Goldstein initially put forward the concept of SRs based on their ability to bind modified low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), such as acetylated or oxidized LDLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref007">7</xref>]. Now, SRs have been demonstrated to be members of PRRs, and play important roles in innate immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref008">8</xref>]. The most studied SRs are SRA and B. SRA recognizes Gram-positive bacteria via binding to Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref009">9</xref>]. Studies also showed that SRA could restrict hepatitis C virus replication by interacting with TLR3 in human hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref010">10</xref>]. CD36, which is the first cloned class B SR, is a sensor for LTA and diacylated lipopeptide, as well as a co-receptor for TLR2 in responses to microbial diacylglycerides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>SRC is a type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein comprising several distinct domains and is located on the external surface of the cytoplasmic membrane, with the C-terminal region in the cytoplasm. SRC has been identified in several invertebrates, such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>; however SRC has not been discovered in mammals. Previous studies showed that an SRC from <italic>Drosophila</italic> acted as a pattern recognition receptor to recognize and phagocytose both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref012">12</xref>]. However, the mechanism of viral phagocytosis is unclear, and whether SRC participates in viral phagocytosis remains largely unknown.</p>
<p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is probably the most common mechanism for endocytosis of small and medium size viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref016">16</xref>]. Recent studies showed that WSSV entered hematopoietic tissue (HPT) cells or stomach epithelium via clathrin-mediated endocytosis or cholesterol (lipid raft) -dependent endocytosis mediated by C-type lectin-calreticulin interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref018">18</xref>]. Further studies indicated that WSSV could enter both hemocytes and HPT cells through endocytosis, but they could not replicate in hemocytes for some unknown reason [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref019">19</xref>]. Hemocytes are the major immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref019">19</xref>], especially in invertebrates. β-Arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 were originally discovered to internalize G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as the adrenergic receptor and μ-opioid receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref020">20</xref>], into endosomes. β-Arrestins also participated in the internalization of many non-GPCR receptors or plasma membrane proteins, such as the type III transforming growth factor-β receptor and the insulin-like growth factor I receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref021">21</xref>]. It was also identified as the adaptor protein for clathrin-mediated endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref023">23</xref>]. β-Arrestin1 and 2 were involved in the regulation of shrimp Toll pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref024">24</xref>]. However, whether β-arrestins participate in the internalization of SRs has not been reported.</p>
<p>In this study, we obtained an SRC cDNA from the kuruma shrimp <italic>M</italic>. <italic>japonicus</italic>, and designated it as <italic>Mj</italic>SRC. Knockdown and overexpression analysis revealed that <italic>Mj</italic>SRC possessed antiviral function in shrimp. Further study found that <italic>Mj</italic>SRC appeared to oligomerize after WSSV challenge. We also discovered that hemocytes used clathrin-mediated endocytosis to engulf WSSV and that <italic>Mj</italic>β-arrestin2 was used as an adaptor protein to mediate the endocytotic process.</p>

<title><italic>Mj</italic>SRC is upregulated in shrimp challenged by WSSV</title>
<p>The open reading frame (ORF) region of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC encoded a protein of 692 amino acids, with a theoretical molecular mass of 73.84 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.50 (GenBank accession number: KU213605). Two CCP (complement control protein) domains, one MAM (domain in meprin, A5, receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase mu) domain and one transmembrane region were identified in the protein. <italic>Mj</italic>SRC lacks the somatomedin B domain compared with insect SRCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006127.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The results of alignment and phylogenetic analysis of SRC from kuruma shrimp and other species showed that SRCs were not conserved, and that <italic>Mj</italic>SRC was relatively close to SRC from <italic>Riptortus pedestris</italic> in the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006127.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The distribution of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC transcripts was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), which revealed that <italic>Mj</italic>SRC was expressed in hemocytes, heart, hepatopancreas, gills, stomach and intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, upper panel). Anti-<italic>Mj</italic>SRC sera were prepared using the purified extracellular region, including CCP domains and MAM domain of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC (<italic>Mj</italic>SRC-EX) expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Similarly, western blotting analysis showed that <italic>Mj</italic>SRC was distributed in hemocytes and other five tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, lower panel).</p>

<p>Temporal and spatial expression patterns of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC after WSSV challenge were analyzed using qRT-PCR and western blotting. The results of qRT-PCR showed that <italic>Mj</italic>SRC was significantly upregulated (from 7 to 13 folds) in hemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, upper panel), but slightly increased in gills and intestine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006127.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>), post WSSV injection. Western blotting analysis revealed that the protein expression levels of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC were also raised in hemocytes after WSSV challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g001">Fig 1C</xref> lower panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006127.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). The VP28 protein was increased gradually from 36 to 72 h in gills after WSSV challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Although VP28 was also increased in hemocytes after WSSV challenge, it was not much obvious comparing with that in gill (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006127.s003">S3D Fig</xref>). Thus the VP28 level in gills was used to determine the viral replication in following studies. Ultraviolet inactivated WSSV (UV-WSSV) was also used to challenge shrimp. The mRNA expression levels of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC were detected by qRT-PCR and the results showed <italic>Mj</italic>SRC was upregulated significantly post UV-WSSV challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Comparing with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, the increasing folds (from 2 to 7 folds) of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC in UV-irradiated WSSV challenged shrimp was less than that in alive WSSV challenged shrimp. These results suggested that <italic>Mj</italic>SRC was involved in anti-WSSV infection, and the upregulation of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC was related with WSSV infection and replication in shrimp.</p>

<p>To investigate the function of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC in WSSV infection of shrimp, RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC were conducted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and WSSV replication in gills of <italic>MjSRC</italic> RNAi-shrimp and <italic>MjSRC</italic> overexpression-shrimp was detected via qRT-PCR and western blotting using VP28 as a marker.

The result of western blotting indicated that <italic>Mj</italic>SRC was overexpressed successfully in hemocytes of shrimp after injection of the <italic>MjSRC</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g002">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006127.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). WSSV was injected into shrimp after knockdown or overexpression of <italic>MjSRC</italic>. The results showed that the VP28 protein decreased markedly in the overexpression group at 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g002">Fig 2D</xref>) and 60 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006127.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). Meanwhile, the VP28 expression in the <italic>MjSRC</italic>-RNAi group was distinctly higher than that in the <italic>GFP</italic>-RNAi group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Furthermore, after rescuing the expression of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC in the RNAi group by <italic>MjSRC</italic> mRNA injection, the WSSV levels declined compared with the RNAi group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), indicating that the impaired antiviral effect in shrimp after RNAi of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC could be rescued by <italic>Mj</italic>SRC overexpression. To confirm the above results, the virus titers in gills of the five groups of shrimp were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g002">Fig 2F</xref>), and the same results were obtained. Moreover, the survival rate of <italic>MjSRC</italic>-RNAi shrimp infected with WSSV decreased significantly compared with the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g002">Fig 2G</xref>).

<title><italic>Mj</italic>SRC functions in phagocytosis of WSSV in shrimp</title>
<p>To investigate how <italic>Mj</italic>SRC reduced the amount of WSSV in shrimp, we analyzed the phagocytic rate after knockdown or overexpression of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC. The results of microscopic counting revealed that knockdown of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC decreased the phagocytic rate about 46% in hemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>), whereas the phagocytic rate was enhanced about 39% after <italic>Mj</italic>SRC overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). Moreover, the phagocytic index of hemocytes after <italic>Mj</italic>SRC overexpression also increased significantly compared with the control group (Fig C and F).

<title><italic>Mj</italic>SRC recognizes the envelope protein of WSSV</title>
<p>To explore the mechanism of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC’s promotion of phagocytosis of WSSV, the interactions between <italic>Mj</italic>SRC and viral envelope proteins (VP19, VP24, VP26 and VP28) were investigated by pull-down assays <italic>in vitro</italic>. The recombinant proteins were expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The results of the GST-pull-down showed that the extracellular domains of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC (<italic>Mj</italic>SRC-EX) possessed binding activity with VP19, but not with the other three VP proteins of WSSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Further study indicated that the <italic>Mj</italic>SRC-MAM domain was responsible for this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy showed that colloidal gold-labeled <italic>Mj</italic>SRC-EX could bind to the viral envelope but not the nucleocapsid of WSSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g004">Fig 4D</xref>); the Trx-His tag protein was used as the negative control.

<title><italic>Mj</italic>SRC oligomerizes to a trimer and is internalized from the membrane into the cytoplasm after WSSV infection</title>
<p>The oligomerization and subcellular location of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC were analyzed to observe its rapid response to WSSV infection. The oligomerization of r<italic>Mj</italic>SRC-EX was first analyzed using native PAGE, and the result showed that r<italic>Mj</italic>SRC-EX formed different oligomers <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

<p>To explore the mechanism of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC’s internalization, adaptor proteins were searched. We knew that β-arrestins participated in internalization of many non-GPCR receptors or plasma membrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref021">21</xref>]. Two β-arrestins, <italic>Mj</italic>β-arrestin 1 and 2, were identified in shrimp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006127.s009">S9A and S9B Fig</xref>). Temporal and spatial expression of <italic>Mj</italic>β-arrestins in hemocytes were analyzed using qRT-PCR, which showed that <italic>Mj</italic>β-arrestin2 was upregulated significantly post WSSV challenge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006127.s009">S9C and S9D Fig</xref>). Pull-down assays were performed to analyze the interaction between <italic>Mj</italic>SRC and <italic>Mj</italic>β-arrestins, using the recombinant intracellular region of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC (<italic>Mj</italic>SRC-IN), <italic>Mj</italic>β-arrestin1, <italic>Mj</italic>β-arrestin2, and N-terminal and C-terminal domains of <italic>Mj</italic>β-arrestin2. The results showed that <italic>Mj</italic>β-arrestin2, rather than <italic>Mj</italic>β-arrestin1, interacted with <italic>Mj</italic>SRC-IN, and there was no interaction with <italic>Mj</italic>SRC-EX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Further study showed that the N-terminal domain of <italic>Mj</italic>β-arrestin2 interacted with <italic>Mj</italic>SRC-IN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g006">Fig 6C</xref>).

<title><italic>Mj</italic>SRC-arrestin2-mediated hemocyte phagocytosis of WSSV is clathrin-dependent</title>
<p>To explore whether the <italic>MjSRC</italic>-arrestin2-mediated phagocytosis of WSSV was clathrin-dependent, a chemical agent, chlorpromazine (CPZ), an effective inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, was used to inhibit clathrin-mediated phagocytosis in shrimp. The toxic effect of CPZ in shrimp was firstly determined by calculating the survival rate of shrimp after CPZ injection. The results showed that low doses of CPZ (&lt; 200 μg per shrimp) did not reduce the viability of shrimp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). After injection of CPZ into the WSSV-infected shrimp, VP28 expression at the mRNA, protein and genome level increased obviously compared with the control shrimp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g007">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>), suggesting that hemocytes utilized clathrin-mediated endocytosis to engulf the invading WSSV. A clathrin heavy chain from kuruma shrimp was firstly identified and designated <italic>Mj</italic>clathrin (GenBank accession number: KU984437) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006127.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). <italic>Mj</italic>clathrin was widely distributed in several tissues of shrimp, and its mRNA levels were upregulated significantly after WSSV challenge in the hemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g007">Fig 7D</xref>), which suggesting <italic>Mj</italic>clathrin was involved in WSSV infection in shrimp. After knockdown of the expression of <italic>Mj</italic>clathrin in WSSV-infected shrimp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g007">Fig 7E</xref>), the VP28 protein level increased compared with the control shrimp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g007">Fig 7F</xref>), and the virus titers also increased significantly in <italic>Mjclathrin</italic>-RNAi shrimp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g007">Fig 7G</xref>).

<title>Lysosomes were related to the clearance of WSSV in shrimp</title>
<p>To invesgate whether lysosomes was involved in inhibition of WSSV, the colocalization of WSSV and Lysosome was analyzed. Immunocytochemical analysis was performed using hemocytes collected from shrimp injected with FITC-labeled WSSV. The result showed that the labeled WSSV virions were co-localized with lysosomes which stained with LysoBrite Red in hemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g008">Fig 8D</xref>, upper panel).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we firstly identified a class C scavenger receptor (<italic>Mj</italic>SRC) from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>japonicus</italic>, which worked as a phagocytotic receptor of WSSV on shrimp hemocytes. <italic>Mj</italic>SRC interacts with the VP19 WSSV envelope protein and <italic>Mj</italic>β-arrestin2 to promote hemocyte phagocytosis in a clathrin-dependent manner and inhibits WSSV replication and propagation in shrimp.</p>
<p>Scavenger receptors (SRs) represent a superfamily of structurally unrelated, distinct gene products, which are subdivided into different classes, mostly by their shared functional properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref006">6</xref>]. Eight members of SRs in mammals, including SRA-SRI, but not SRC, which only exists in invertebrates, have been reported in recent years, and their properties have been gradually discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref029">29</xref>]. SRs function to recognize modified self molecules (such as Ox-LDL and Ac-LDL) and several non-self components, e.g. bacterial LPS and LTA, and contribute to a range of physiological or pathological processes, including promotion of the internalization of their ligands and activation of downstream signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref008">8</xref>]. <italic>Mj</italic>Croquemort and <italic>Mj</italic>SR-B1, the only two SR family members identified and characterized in shrimp to date, play a specific role in the phagocytosis of bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref031">31</xref>]. SRC proteins have been identified in several species, such as <italic>Anopheles darlingi</italic>, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> and <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref034">34</xref>]. However, there have been few reports concerning their biological roles. Four isoforms of SRC in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> have been identified, one of which (dSR-CI) mediates phagocytosis of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref012">12</xref>]. A Recent study showed that an SRC from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> (AaSRC) could recognize dengue virus and regulate the expression of antimicrobial peptides to eliminate the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref035">35</xref>]. In this study, we identified an SRC from kuruma shrimp (<italic>Mj</italic>SRC), which contained two CCP domains, a MAM domain, a transmembrane region and an intracellular region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006127.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). <italic>Mj</italic>SRC played an effectively antiviral role by enhancing hemocytes phagocytosis of WSSV in shrimp.</p>
<p>Several phagocytic receptors have been shown to be involved in bacterial recognition and uptake. There are several microbial ligands for phagocytic receptors, include various proteins, and complex lipids, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipoteichoic acids, and mycobacterial lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref036">36</xref>]. For example, SR-A mediates non-opsonic phagocytosis of several bacterial pathogens, including <italic>Neisseria meningitides</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref037">37</xref>], by recognizing LPS. dSR-CI is a macrophage-specific PRR that recognizes Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by binding to a broad range of polyanionic ligands. The CCP domains, together with the MAM domain, of dSR-CI are sufficient to bind bacteria <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref012">12</xref>]. <italic>Mj</italic>SR-B1 serves as a phagocytosis receptor, recognizing Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by binding different polysaccharides in kuruma shrimp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref031">31</xref>]. In this study, we identified that <italic>Mj</italic>SRC is the receptor of virus WSSV. The colloidal gold-labeled <italic>Mj</italic>SRC were coated on the outer surface by WSSV under transmission electron microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g004">Fig 4</xref>), indicating that <italic>Mj</italic>SRC bound to WSSV directly. Pull-down assays showed that the MAM domain of the receptor interacted with VP19. Co-IP assays confirmed the interaction between <italic>Mj</italic>SRC with VP19 <italic>in vivo</italic>. The co-localization detection of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC and FITC labeled-WSSV in shrimp hemocytes was also confirmed the result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). VP19, VP24, VP26 and VP28 are the four major envelope proteins of WSSV and function in virus entry and systemic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref040">40</xref>]. VP24, VP26 and VP28 share high sequence homology with each other; however, VP19 has a unique structure and biological character [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref042">42</xref>]. The CCP domain exists mainly in complement system proteins and promotes the formation of oligomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref043">43</xref>]. MAM is an extracellular domain and exists in many kinds of proteins, such as meprin, neuropilins and zonadhesins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref044">44</xref>]. In addition, MAM domain mediates protein-protein interactions and is involved in homo-oligomerization for neuropilin-1/-2 and meprin A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref046">46</xref>]. In this study, we found that after WSSV infection, <italic>Mj</italic>SRC was upregulated and oligomerized to a trimer that recognized WSSV via binding to VP19 to initiate antiviral responses in shrimp. We also discovered that UV-inactivated WSSV could upregulated <italic>Mj</italic>SRC expression level in hemocytes, but the increasing folds were lower compared to that the virus was not irradiated for shrimp challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). This suggested that the upregulation of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC in hemocytes was related with WSSV infection and replication in shrimp.</p>
<p>Uptake of a microbial particle usually occurs via phagocytosis induced by the pathogen-receptor interaction. Phagocytosis, defined as the cellular uptake of particles within a plasma-membrane envelope, is closely related to the endocytosis of ligands by macropinocytic and receptor pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref047">47</xref>]. Viruses can enter host cells by endocytosis, macropinocytosis or fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref048">48</xref>]. SRs are involved in phagocytosis of microbes, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. In our study, we found that <italic>Mj</italic>SRC could form homo-trimers via its CCP and MAM domains after WSSV challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g005">Fig 5</xref>), just like a number of other PRRs, which form oligomers after recognizing pathogens, such as SRA, NOD-like receptor, Toll receptor, acetylcholine receptor and GPCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref052">52</xref>]. Moreover, <italic>Mj</italic>SRC was subsequently internalized from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm after WSSV challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g005">Fig 5</xref>). As essential scaffolding proteins, β-arrestins are involved in multiple signaling pathways activated in host cells by pathogens, participating in innate immunity and the inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref053">53</xref>]. β-Arrestins regulate G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling as G-protein-independent signal transducers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref054">54</xref>]. They can scaffold various components of the ERK cascade, bringing them into close proximity to promote ERK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref055">55</xref>]. β-arrestins were found to promote clathrin-mediated internalization of GPCRs by interacting with, and scaffolding various components of, the clathrin-mediated endocytosis machinery. In particular, β-arrestin2 promotes the activation of ARF6 and endocytosis in the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref056">56</xref>]. After overexpression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, β-arrestin2 also enhanced low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) endocytosis (by 65%), through the interaction between β-arrestin2 with LDLR cytoplasmic tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref057">57</xref>]. The C-terminus of β-arrestin2 is reported as the binding domain of clathrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref058">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref059">59</xref>]. In this study, we found that <italic>Mj</italic>β-arrestin2 was upregulated by WSSV challenge, and the intracellular region of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC (<italic>Mj</italic>SRC-IN) interacted with N-terminus of <italic>Mj</italic>β-arrestin2. <italic>Mj</italic>SRC internalization decreased significantly after RNAi of <italic>Mjβ-arrestin2</italic>, whilst the amount of WSSV increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Our study suggested that β-arrestin2 was an adaptor protein for the <italic>Mj</italic>SRC receptor and was responsible for receptor internalization.</p>
<p>Virus endocytic entry occurs in a stepwise manner, including attachment to the cell surface, clustering of receptors, activation of signaling pathways, formation of endocytic vesicles and vacuoles, delivery of viral cargo to endosomal compartments and escape into the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref060">60</xref>]. Clathrin-coated vesicles are responsible for an important form of endocytosis for many kinds of virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref060">60</xref>], including WSSV in crayfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref017">17</xref>]. Usually this kind of endocytosis is beneficial for virus infection. Studies showed that WSSV virions could enter hemocytes; however, their genome replication and structural protein expression were unsuccessful in crayfish hemocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref019">19</xref>]. The VP28 protein expression level was upregulated in the gills after WSSV challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), hematopoietic tissue cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref019">19</xref>] and stomach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref018">18</xref>], but not in hemocytes after WSSV challenge in shrimp. All the results suggested that hemocytes had a mechanism to restrict WSSV replication. A recent study showed that hemocytes’ phagocytosis contributed to the virus-specific immune response in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>, especially to cricket paralysis virus, Flock House Virus and vesicular stomatitis virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref061">61</xref>]. We discovered that <italic>Mj</italic>clathrin was upregulated in hemocytes after WSSV challenge. The viral titer increased in <italic>Mjclathrin</italic>-RNAi shrimp that were infected with WSSV 24 h before <italic>dsRNA</italic> injection. CPZ injection also resulted in upregulation of the VP28 expression level. Further study showed that phagocytosis of WSSV by hemocytes was inhibited after <italic>dsMjclathrin</italic> or CPZ injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Therefore, the <italic>Mj</italic>SRC-arrestin-clathrin pathway is involved in the phagocytosis of WSSV to restrict viral infection in shrimp. After internalization of viruses, phagosomes subsequently fuse with intracellular granules to form the phagolysosome, within which microbial killing is achieved by a combination of non-oxidative and oxidative mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref062">62</xref>]. In this study, the co-localization of ingested virions and lysosomes was observed in hemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g008">Fig 8</xref>). In addition, the amount of WSSV increased significantly in shrimp after inhibition of lysosome by CLQ compared with control, indicating that lysosome in hemocytes is probably involved in the clearance of WSSV.</p>
<p>In our study, we found that there were 50–60% hemocytes showing <italic>Mj</italic>SRC internalization after WSSV challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). However, the phagocytic rate was lower than internalization rate in the shrimp. We think that there are several reasons for the differences: Usually virions could not be observed under the microcope and only the block of the virions could be observed under the microscope. The WSSV is an envelope virus and the envenlope can be easily destroyed in the purification. Therefore the injected FITC labeled WSSV contains some debris with envelope proteins and these proteins can interact with <italic>Mj</italic>SRC and induce its internalization, but the debris could not be observed in hemocytes under the microscope. Another reason is the FITC is easily quenching under the fluorescence microscope. Therefore, phagocytic rate of hemocytes is lower than that of internalization.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <italic>Mj</italic>SRC was identified to serve as a WSSV phagocytotic receptor in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>japonicus</italic>. <italic>Mj</italic>SRC recognizes WSSV by the interaction of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC-MAM with VP19. After <italic>Mj</italic>SRC oligomerization, the intracellular domain of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC recruits and binds to <italic>Mj</italic>β-arrestin2, which initiates the phagocytosis of WSSV by hemocytes in a clathrin-dependent manner. WSSV are finally degraded in hemocyte phagolysosomes, which effectively restricts viral infection in shrimp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006127.g009">Fig 9</xref>). This is the first report of an <italic>Mj</italic>SRC-mediated antiviral mechanism in shrimp.</p>

After WSSV infection, <italic>Mj</italic>SRC oligomerized to a trimer via its CCP and MAM domains. Subsequently, the intracellular region of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC recruits and interacts with an adaptor protein, <italic>Mj</italic>β-arrestin2, and the latter interacts with <italic>Mj</italic>clathrin to induce internalization of <italic>Mj</italic>SRC with WSSV via a clathrin-coated vesicle. This vesicle that holds the foreign pathogens (WSSV) is called a phagosome, which becomes a phagolysosome after fusing with a lysosome. Ultimately, WSSV is eliminated by various enzymes.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Healthy kuruma shrimp, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>japonicus</italic>, about 8–10 g each, were obtained from an aquatic product market in Jinan, Shandong province, China. Shrimp were cultured in aerated artificial seawater with a salinity of about 22% (w/v), and fed with a commercial diet daily. Animals were kept for 2 days at 22°C before use and were selected randomly in each experiment.</p>

<title>Preparation of WSSV inoculums and challenge of shrimp</title>
<p>The WSSV inoculum was acquired according to previous publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref063">63</xref>]. Briefly, all tissues (except the hepatopancreas) of WSSV-infected shrimp were homogenized in sterile PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 2mM KH2PO4, 10 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) at a ratio of 10% (w/v). After centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min at 4°C, the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-nm filter. The virus titer was determined by quantitative real-time PCR, on the basis of a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref018">18</xref>]. Each shrimp was injected a 30 μL of WSSV inoculum (1×10<sup>5</sup> virions) in the subsequent challenge experiments. Ultraviolet inactivated WSSV (UV-WSSV) was also used to challenge shrimp. WSSV inoculums were irradiated with ultraviolet for 20 min and then 30 μL inoculums (about 1×10<sup>5</sup> virions) were injected into each shrimp.</p>

<title>Quantification of WSSV copies</title>
<p>The quantification of WSSV copy numbers was performed using a previously reported method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref064">64</xref>]. Briefly, a WSSV VP28 fragment was amplified and inserted into the plasmid (pBlueScript II SK+). The recombinant plasmid was quantified using a spectrophotometer (GeneQuant, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Using the known molecular weight of the plasmid, its copy number could be calculated. Subsequently, the plasmid was diluted gradually (10<sup>9</sup>, 10<sup>8</sup>, 10<sup>7</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup>, 10<sup>5</sup>, 10<sup>4</sup>), and the diluted samples were used as templates for qRT-PCR with primers VP28-RT-F and VP28-RT-R (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006127.t001">Table 1</xref>). The cycle threshold (CT) and the quantity of the template were used to make a standard curve for WSSV quantification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006127.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). The genomic DNA extracted from the viral inoculum or WSSV-infected tissue, together with the gradient diluted plasmid samples, were analyzed by qRT-PCR to obtain the absolute copies of WSSV from the inoculums or infected tissue.</p>

The PCR procedure was as follows: one cycle at 95°C for 3 min; 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 53°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 45 s; and one cycle at 72°C for 10 min. Afterwards, the purified PCR product was digested with restriction enzymes <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Not</italic>I and then ligated into the pET-32a(+) vector (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The recombinant plasmid was transformed into <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> Rosseta (DE3) cells. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The proteins were expressed as inclusion bodies, denatured in 8 M urea and purified using Ni-NTA beads. The proteins were then refolded in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1% glycine, and 10% glycerol at pH 7.9 and dialyzed in PBS overnight.

The qRT-PCR was carried out using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara), following the manufacturer’s instructions, and conducted in a real-time thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The total volume was 10 μL, including 5 μL of Premix Ex Taq, 2 μL of each primer (1 mM) and 1 μL of cDNA (1:50 diluted). β-Actin-RT-F and β-actin-RT-R primers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006127.t001">Table 1</xref>) were used to amplify <italic>β-actin</italic>, which served as the internal control.

The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected. After separation by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with 5% nonfat milk diluted in TBS (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) for 1 h with gentle shaking. The membrane was then incubated with primary antiserum against <italic>Mj</italic>SRC (diluted 1:200 in the blocking milk solution) overnight at 4°C. After three washes with TBST (TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20), the membrane was incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (ZSGB Bio, Beijing, China, 1:10,000 dilution in blocking reagent) for 3 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. The membrane was then washed with TBST three times for 10 min each, and the target bands were visualized by a solution of 1 mL 4-chloro-1-naphthol and 6 μL H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in 10 mL TBS in the dark.

<p>To investigate whether <italic>Mj</italic>SRC could bind to WSSV, immunoelectron microscopy was performed following the procedure detailed in our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref041">41</xref>]. Briefly, r<italic>Mj</italic>SRC-EX was labeled with gold nanoparticles (diameter of 10 nm, Sigma, USA). The pH of the colloidal gold was adjusted to be 0.5 higher than the isoelectric point (pI) of the r<italic>Mj</italic>SRC-EX protein solution. Approximately 0.2 mL of colloidal gold was added into 0.2 mL of the protein solution (1 mg/mL), and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 4°C with gentle shaking. After adding 1% polyethylene glycol (PEG) to a final concentration of 0.04%, the mixture was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 45 min. The precipitate was resuspended with 0.2 mL PBS containing 0.04% PEG and then stored at 4°C. The tag protein Trx-His tag was used as a control, and was also labeled with gold nanoparticles. The virions of WSSV were purified by a previously reported method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref070">70</xref>], and the purified virions were absorbed onto carbon-coated nickel grids, and incubated with labeled r<italic>Mj</italic>SRC-EX (or Trx-His tag) for 10 min at RT. After washing with distilled water three times, the samples were counterstained with 2% sodium phosphotungstate (Zhongjingkeyi Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) for 30 seconds and finally observed under a transmission electron microscope (EM-100CXII).</p>

<title>Crosslinking assay</title>
<p>Suberic acid bis (3-sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) sodium salt (BS3; Sigma-Aldrich) possesses a charged group and is useful for cell-surface protein crosslinking. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, hemocytes from shrimp were collected and washed three times with ice-cold PBS (pH 8.0). BS3 was added to the resuspended hemocytes to a final concentration of 5 mM and the reaction mixture was incubated at 4°C for 1 h. Quenching buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) was then added into the mixture with a final concentration of 20 mM to quench the crosslinking reaction. The crosslinking-treated hemocytes were homogenized and subjected to western blotting.</p>

<title>Clathrin inhibitor assay</title>
<p>Chlorpromazine (CPZ, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China,) was used to inhibit the phagocytosis of WSSV in shrimp. CPZ prevents recycling of clathrin to the plasma membrane thereby inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref071">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref072">72</xref>]. CPZ was diluted in sterile water at 10 μg/μL, and different amounts of CPZ solution were injected into shrimp. In our experiment, WSSV inoculums were injected into shrimp 24 h before CPZ injection. The amount of WSSV in the shrimp was detected via RT-PCR and western blotting using VP28 as a marker. Furthermore, the effect of CPZ on phagocytosis of hemocytes was also detected. After 1 h of CPZ injection, FITC-labeled WSSV was injected into the shrimp and 1 h later, hemocytes were collected and the phagocytic rate was calculated. Sterile water injection was used as the control.</p>

<title>Lysosome staining and lysosome inhibitor injection</title>
<p>Lysosome staining kit (Bio Basic Inc., Markham, Ontario, Canada) was used to stain lysosomes in hemocytes following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, hemocytes were collected from three shrimp and spread onto slides. After washed with PBS, the hemocytes were stained with LysoBrite Red (1:500 diluted in live cell staining buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Then washed three times with PBS, hemocytes were stained with DAPI to label cell nuclei. The slides were observed under the fluorescence microscope.</p>
<p>Chloroquine (CLQ, Sangon Biotech, China), a lysosome inhibitor, was used to inhibit the lysosome function. CLQ was used at 10 mg/kg to inhibit the function of lysosome in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006127.ref073">73</xref>]. In this study, CLQ was diluted in PBS at 10 μg/μL, and different volume of CLQ solution (0, 2.5, 7.5 and 10 μL) was injected into shrimp. The amount of WSSV in the shrimp was detected via RT-PCR and western blotting using VP28 as a marker.</p>
