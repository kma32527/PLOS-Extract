<abstract>
<p>Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of Ebola virus (EBOV) infection has been demonstrated in vitro, raising concerns about the detrimental potential of some anti-EBOV antibodies. ADE has been described for many viruses and mostly depends on the cross-linking of virus-antibody complexes to cell surface Fc receptors, leading to enhanced infection. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. Here we show that Fcγ-receptor IIa (FcγRIIa)-mediated intracellular signaling through Src family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) is required for ADE of EBOV infection. We found that deletion of the FcγRIIa cytoplasmic tail abolished EBOV ADE due to decreased virus uptake into cellular endosomes. Furthermore, EBOV ADE, but not non-ADE infection, was significantly reduced by inhibition of the Src family protein PTK pathway, which was also found to be important to promote phagocytosis/macropinocytosis for viral uptake into endosomes. We further confirmed a significant increase of the Src phosphorylation mediated by ADE. These data suggest that antibody-EBOV complexes bound to the cell surface FcγRIIa activate the Src signaling pathway that leads to enhanced viral entry into cells, providing a novel perspective for the general understanding of ADE of virus infection.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a phenomenon in which viral infectivity is increased by virus-specific antibodies, is observed in vitro for a large number of viruses. For some of these viruses, ADE often become an issue for disease control by vaccination. It has also been shown that some human sera convalescent from Ebola virus disease contain ADE antibodies. ADE has been shown mostly to depend on the cross-linking of virus-antibody complexes to cell surface Fc receptor, which activate various signaling pathways involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane remodeling. In this study, we demonstrate that Fc receptor-mediated intracellular signaling is a key factor for ADE of Ebola virus infection. We found that the antibody-virus complexes bound to the cell surface Fc receptors triggered the phosphorylation of particular protein-tyrosine kinases that activated signaling pathways leading to enhanced viral uptake into cells through phagocytosis and/or macropinocytosis. Our study provides new insights into mechanisms of ADE and also offer a potential new cellular target to develop treatments for ADE-associated diseases such as dengue hemorrhagic fever and possibly Zika virus infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ebola virus (EBOV), a member of the family <italic>Filoviridae</italic>, causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates, with human case fatality rates of up to 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref001">1</xref>]. EBOV expresses a glycoprotein (GP) that is the only viral surface protein and important for both receptor binding and membrane fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref003">3</xref>]. EBOV entry is initiated by viral attachment to cell surface molecules such as T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) and C-type lectins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref005">5</xref>], followed by internalization of the virus particle into cells via macropinocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref008">8</xref>]. In the late endosome, EBOV GP is cleaved by host proteases such as cathepsins L and B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref009">9</xref>], exposing the GP receptor binding site that then binds to the receptor, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), followed by membrane fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to the direct interaction between GP and host cell receptors, it has been demonstrated that EBOV exploits some GP-specific antibodies for its entry into cells, leading to increased infectivity <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref013">13</xref>]. This phenomenon has been described for a number of viruses and is known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref017">17</xref>]. For some of these viruses, ADE has become a great concern to disease control by vaccination. Particularly, convalescent human sera have been shown to contain ADE antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref013">13</xref>], raising concerns about potential detrimental effects of passive immunization with convalescent human sera, which is currently under consideration for treatment of Ebola virus disease. Importantly, it was recently demonstrated that therapeutic treatment with convalescent sera having in vitro neutralizing activities was not sufficient for protection against EBOV infection in nonhuman primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref018">18</xref>]. Although ADE was not evaluated in vitro and any enhanced pathogenicity in the treated animals was not observed, it might be possible that ADE antibodies counterbalanced the neutralizing activity as suggested previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref017">17</xref>]. Two distinct pathways of EBOV ADE, one mediated by Fc receptors and the other by complement component C1q and its ligands, are known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref017">17</xref>]. In particular, the Fcγ receptor (FcγR) is commonly involved in ADE of virus infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref020">20</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ADE-mediated virus entry through FcγR are not fully understood.</p>
<p>Three classes of FcγR, FcγRI (CD64), FcγRII (CD32), and FcγRIII (CD16), are expressed in various human immune cells such as dendritic cells, monocytes, and B lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref021">21</xref>]. Among these FcγRs, FcγRII is a key molecule for EBOV ADE of infection in human leukemia K562 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref017">17</xref>]. Human FcγRII exists in two isoforms, FcγRIIa and FcγRIIb, which differ in their signal peptides and cytoplasmic tails. FcγRIIa is the active form of FcγRII and contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref021">21</xref>]. The cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIa is known to contribute to the activitation of two structurally and functionally distinct protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) classes, the sarcoma (Src) family PTKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref023">23</xref>] and spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref024">24</xref>]. In addition, Syk is reported to participate in activation of enzymes such as rat sarcoma (Ras), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref025">25</xref>]. These signaling pathways are known to be important for the induction of phagocytic and endocytic processes to internalize immune complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we focused on the role of FcγRIIa and investigated the contribution of FcγRIIa-mediated signaling to the ADE of EBOV infection. We show that Src family PTKs are essential for EBOV ADE-mediated entry. Our data indicate that binding of antibody-virus complexes to the cell surface FcγRIIa triggers phosphorylation of Src family PTKs and activates subsequent signaling pathways, leading to enhanced viral uptake through phagocytosis and/or macropinocytosis.</p>

<title>Cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIa is required for ADE of EBOV infection</title>
<p>To investigate the role of FcγRIIa and, in particular, the importance of its cytoplasmic tail in EBOV ADE, we compared the functions of wild-type FcγRIIa and a deletion mutant of FcγRIIa lacking its cytoplasmic tail (FcγRIIaΔCT). Both molecules were expressed on Jurkat T cells, which are known to be poorly permissive for EBOV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref027">27</xref>] and lack this Fc receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref028">28</xref>]. Jurkat T cells were transduced with full-length FcγRIIa or FcγRIIaΔCT genes using a retrovirus vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>) and subsequently infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped with EBOV GP (VSV-EBOV GP) and infectious EBOV in the presence or absence of the GP-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) ZGP12/1.1, which is known to induce EBOV ADE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref012">12</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). We found that viral infectivity was almost undetectable in naive and control vector-transduced Jurkat T cells but the expression of wild-type FcγRIIa significantly enhanced the infectivity of VSV-EBOV GP and EBOV in the presence of ZGP12/1.1, though not control IgG (CTR IgG). Interestingly, the infection rate of FcγRIIaΔCT-expressing cells was significantly lower than that of cells expressing wild-type FcγRIIa. These results indicated that the FcγRIIa-MAb complex functioned as a receptor-like molecule on this poorly permissive cell line and efficiently promoted infection through the ADE of EBOV entry. More importantly, the results suggested that signaling pathways via the FcγRIIa cytoplasmic tail were likely involved in the ADE of EBOV entry into cells.</p>

<title>Cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIa is important for enhanced viral uptake</title>
<p>FcγRIIa is known to modulate phagocytosis/macropinocytosis through signaling pathways via its cytoplasmic tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref030">30</xref>]. Therefore, to analyze viral binding and intracellular uptake in more detail, we produced lipophilic tracer (DiI)-labeled virus-like particles (VLPs) consisting of the major EBOV structural proteins, GP, matrix protein (VP40), and nucleoprotein (NP), and monitored the localization of VLPs in each transduced Jurkat T cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The number of VLPs attached to the surface of naive and empty vector-transduced Jurkat T cells was not significantly different irrespective of the presence of CTR IgG and ZGP12/1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g002">Fig 2A and 2C</xref>). In contrast, the attachment of VLPs was significantly enhanced to similar extents in Jurkat T cells expressing FcγRIIa and FcγRIIaΔCT in the presence of ZGP12/1.1 but not CTR IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g002">Fig 2A and 2C</xref>), suggesting that the FcγRIIa ectodomain expressed on Jurkat T cells had the ability to increase the VLP attachment mediated by ZGP12/1.1. Next, we assessed the number of VLPs incorporated into intracellular vesicles along with Alexa Fluor 647 (Alexa647)-labeled dextran Mw 10,000 (Dx10), a specific probe for visualizing phagocytotic and macropinocytotic vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref031">31</xref>]. After incubation for 2 h, ZGP12/1.1-treated VLPs efficiently colocalized with Dx10 in Jurkat T cells expressing wild-type FcγRIIa, but not in cells expressing FcγRIIaΔCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g002">Fig 2B and 2D</xref>). Viral uptake was not observed drastically in the absence of FcγRIIa and ZGP12/1.1. Furthermore, the number and size of Dx10-positive vesicles incorporated into Jurkat T cells expressing FcγRIIaΔCT were significantly smaller than those in cells expressing FcγRIIa, indicating the importance of the FcγRIIa cytoplasmic tail in activating the phagocytosis/macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g002">Fig 2B and 2E</xref>). These data suggested that the ADE infection of FcγRIIa-expressing Jurkat T cells was associated with enhanced viral uptake into cellular vesicles, most likely due to the activation of FcγRIIa-mediated signaling via its cytoplasmic tail.</p>

<title>Intracellular signaling via Src family PTKs contributes to ADE of EBOV infection</title>
<p>To identify the intracellular signaling pathway involved in the ADE of EBOV entry, we analyzed the effects of different inhibitors of signaling pathways in K562 cells, which naturally express FcγRIIa. Consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref032">32</xref>], K562 cells were permissive to VSV-EBOV GP and EBOV infections, and viral infection rates were significantly enhanced in the presence of ZGP12/1.1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006139.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). We then tested inhibitors of Syk and Src family PTKs (R788 and PP2, respectively) as these PTKs are known to be principally involved in signaling pathways downstream of FcγRIIa, and in particular to play important roles in inducing FcγR-mediated phagocytosis/macropinocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref033">33</xref>]. We found that the ADE of VSV-EBOV GP infection was significantly reduced in K562 cells treated with these inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, only a limited reduction was seen in non-ADE infection at the highest concentrations of the inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The ADE-specific inhibitory effect was more prominent in cells treated with PP2 than in those treated with R788.</p>

<p>Since Syk is reported to participate in the activation of signaling through PI3K, Btk, and Ras, we further examined which pathways downstream of Syk contributed to the ADE of VSV-EBOV GP infection using specific inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002), Btk (LFM-A13), and Ras (Manumycin A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g003">Fig 3</xref>). However, both ADE and non-ADE infections by VSV-EBOV GP were dose-dependently reduced by LY294002 and Manumycin A, respectively. LFM-A13 showed little effect on the infectivity of VSV-EBOV GP. Subsequently, we confirmed the effects of these inhibitors using infectious EBOV. Consistent with the data for VSV-EBOV GP, PP2 selectively reduced the ADE, but not the non-ADE infection. Interestingly, R788 showed no effects on the ADE of EBOV infection and rather enhanced the non-ADE infection. LFM-A13 slightly reduced both the ADE and the non-ADE infections, whereas LY294002 and Manumycin A did not inhibit the ADE infection, though Manumycin A slightly inhibited the non-ADE infection.</p>
<p>To further investigate the role of Src- and Syk-mediated signaling in EBOV ADE, we generated Src and Syk knockdown K562 cells. K562 cells were transduced with retroviral vectors expressing small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) for silencing Src or Syk genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>) and infected with VSV-EBOV GP in the presence or absence of ZGP12/1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). We found that transduced cells stably expressing Src shRNAs (shSrc3 and shSrc4) showed approximately 50% reduction in protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) and ZGP12/1.1-mediated ADE was significantly decreased in these cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). In contrast, no significant difference was seen between ADE (ZGP12/1.1) and non-ADE (CTR IgG) infections in Syk knockdown cells although 2 of the Syk shRNAs (shSyk3 and shSyk4) significantly reduced the expression of the Syk protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>).</p>

<title>The ADE of EBOV entry depends on phagocytosis and/or macropinocytosis mediated by Src family PTKs</title>
<p>To further characterize the role of the Src family PTK-dependent signaling in the ADE of EBOV infection, we analyzed the effect of PP2 on the attachment and uptake of DiI-labeled VLPs using K562 cells. We first compared the number of VLPs attached to the cell surface among untreated, CTR IgG-, and ZGP12/1.1-treated VLPs. Since the overexpression of FcγRIIa in Jurkat T cells increased the attachment of VLPs to the cell surface in the presence of ZGP12/1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g002">Fig 2</xref>), we hypothesized that ZGP12/1.1 would enhance the VLP attachment to K562 cells. However, the number of VLPs attached to the cell surface was not significantly different in the presence or absence of ZGP12/1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g006">Fig 6A</xref> left and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g006">6C</xref>), and was not affected by the PP2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g006">Fig 6A</xref> right and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g006">6C</xref>), indicating that EBOV ADE in K562 cells did not result from increased viral attachment to the cell surface. For the visualization of the VLP uptake into endosomes, K562 cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein fused to Rab7 (eGFP-Rab7), a late endosome marker, were used to analyze colocalization of eGFP-Rab7 and internalized VLPs. We found that ZGP12/1.1-treated VLPs were efficiently colocalized with eGFP-Rab7 in K562 cells, whereas only 10–20% colocalization was seen in the cells inoculated with untreated or CTR IgG-treated VLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g006">Fig 6B</xref> left, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006139.g006">6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006139.s003">S3A Fig</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is well established that after the attachment of virus particles to cell surface receptors a variety of signaling pathways are activated through tyrosine and phosphoinositol kinases, and the subsequent cellular events such as endocytosis, including macropinocytosis and phagocytosis, are important for the entry of viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref036">36</xref>]. Likewise, it has been suggested that signaling pathways via FcγR are involved in ADE of virus infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref020">20</xref>]. However, there is limited information on the detailed molecular mechanisms of intracellular signaling pathways required for ADE of virus infection. It has been shown that the non-ADE entry of EBOV requires host factors such as PI3K, the Rho family, and protein kinase C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref037">37</xref>], although the virus-specific receptor molecules involved in these signaling pathways are not yet identified. In the present study, we focused on the ADE of EBOV entry and found that the FcγRIIa-mediated signaling pathway was essential for this process, which is distinct from those required for the non-ADE entry.</p>
<p>The FcγRIIa cytoplasmic tail has been shown to be essential for ADE of dengue virus entry and the involvement of Syk cascade in ADE entry has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref040">40</xref>]. Our data indicate that the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIa is crucial for the ADE of EBOV infection and that Src family PTK-dependent signaling is important to enhance viral uptake into cellular vesicles during ADE-mediated entry of EBOV. Src family PTKs are non-receptor tyrosine kinases involved in the regulation of diverse cellular functions like proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref042">42</xref>]. Importantly, this signaling pathway is known to regulate endocytic machinery by triggering the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref026">26</xref>]. Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated that Src family PTK-dependent signaling is required for the non-ADE entry of some viruses into host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref044">44</xref>]. Our data indicate that this signaling is also used to promote viral particle uptake during the FcγRIIa-mediated ADE of EBOV entry.</p>
<p>It was noted that there was a significant increase (approximately 400%) in infectivity of VSV-EBOV GP when FcγRIIaΔCT is expressed on Jurkat T cells, although it was not as high as wildtype FcγRIIa. This observation suggest that the binding provided by the external portion of FcγRIIa may also have some importance and that the signaling function provided by the cytoplasmic portion of FcγRIIa further enhances the ADE effect. It might also be possible that the FcγRIIa associated with lipid rafts activates some FcγRIIa-mediated signals through its transmembrane domain as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref045">45</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found that the Syk inhibitor R788 reduced the ADE efficiency of VSV-EBOV GP but not EBOV. While the VSV pseudotype system is widely used to study EBOV GP functions, it has been suggested that pseudotyped VSV and authentic EBOV can utilize different entry pathways since the particle size and structure of pseudotyped VSV do not accurately recapitulate those of EBOV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref046">46</xref>]. Thus, it may be possible that the EBOV entry primarily relies on macropinocytosis as shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref008">8</xref>], whereas VSV-EBOV GP can also be incorporated into smaller vesicles. We assume that this difference could influence the effect of the inhibitor since Syk-dependent signaling might be associated with caveolin-mediated endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref048">48</xref>]. Another difference found between VSV-EBOV GP and authentic EBOV was that while the Syk inhibitor did not affect EBOV ADE, non-ADE infection was significantly enhanced in the presence of this inhibitor, an effect not observed for VSV-EBOV GP. This might be due to the effect on post-entry mechanisms such as antiviral cellular responses, as proposed by a recent study demonstrating that dengue virus-antibody complexes decreased type-I interferon-stimulated gene expression triggered by the FcγR-mediated signaling pathway through Syk, leading to enhanced replication of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref040">40</xref>]. Since such an antiviral response could be different between VSV- and EBOV-infected cells, it is possible that the Syk inhibitor specifically affected the replication of EBOV, but not VSV, RNA genomes.</p>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that cellular C-type lectins such as DC-SIGN and hMGL serve as attachment receptors and promote the entry of EBOV into cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref034">34</xref>]. These C-type lectins, as well as Fc receptors, are thought to initiate phagocytic pathways for uptake of microorganisms, cell debris, and apoptotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref050">50</xref>]. Interestingly, both C-type lectins and ADE-antibodies, including ZGP12/1.1, mainly bind to the mucin-like region of EBOV GP, which has a number of N- and O-linked glycosylation sites in the middle portion of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref034">34</xref>], suggesting a similarity in the mechanism of the virus entry mediated by C-type lectins and ADE. However, the Src family PTK inhibitor PP2 showed limited effects on the infectivity of VSV-EBOV GP in the cell lines expressing DC-SIGN or hMGL. Taken together, our data suggest that the FcγRIIa-mediated EBOV ADE principally depends on signaling pathways distinct from those for C-type lectin-mediated entry, while both C-type lectins and ADE-antibody-FcγRIIa complexes are assumed to serve as attachment receptors and subsequent processes for membrane fusion (i.e., cathepsin cleavage and NPC1 binding) appear also to be similar.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data indicate that EBOV ADE is not simply dependent on increased viral attachment through interaction between FcγRIIa and virus-antibody complexes, and that the induction of FcγRIIa-mediated signaling associated with the activation of Src family PTKs is essential for EBOV ADE. This signaling pathway most likely promotes macropinocytosis, the major entry pathway of EBOV, and leads to enhanced viral uptake into cells. The contribution of Src family PTKs to FcγRIIa-mediated ADE of virus entry has not been demonstrated previously. Discovery of this ADE mechanism provides a novel perspective for the general understanding of ADE of virus infection. Although the impact of ADE on disease progression remains unclear for many viruses, our findings may offer a potential new target to develop treatments for ADE-associated diseases such as dengue hemorrhagic fever and possibly Zika virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref053">53</xref>] since signaling pathways are known to be essential for virus entry into cells and some signaling inhibitors have been considered to be potential treatment options for virus infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref054">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006139.ref056">56</xref>]. However, since non-ADE entry mechanisms of these viruses are different from EBOV, it is required to investigate whether the Src family PTK-mediated ADE mechanism can be generally applied for other viruses known to utilize ADE entry into cells.</p>

<title>Generation of FcγRIIa- or FcγRIIaΔCT-expressing Jurkat T cells</title>
<p>The FcγRIIa gene was PCR-amplified from a full-length cDNA library prepared from K562 cells using the primers, EcoRI-FcγRIIa (5’-GGGAATTCGGATGACTATGGAGACCCAA-3’) and FcγRIIa-XhoI (5’-ATTTCTCGAGTTTGTCATCCACTCAGCAAG-3’). Mutant FcγRIIa lacking its cytoplasmic tail (amino acid positions 241–317) was generated using a PrimeSTAR Mutagenesis Basal Kit (Takara). After sequence confirmation, these PCR products were cloned into a murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vector, pMXs-Puro Retroviral Vector (Cell Biolabs). To generate the retrovirus, 293T-derived Platinum-GP (Plat-GP) cells (Cell Biolabs) were cotransfected with pMXs-puro encoding FcγRIIa or FcγRIIaΔCT and the expression plasmid pCAGGS encoding the VSV G protein using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Forty-eight h later, the culture supernatants containing retroviruses were collected, clarified through 0.45-μm filters, and then used to infect Jurkat T cells. Jurkat T cell lines stably expressing FcγRIIa or FcγRIIaΔCT were selected with RPMI medium containing 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich). For some experiments, each Jurkat T cell line was cloned by limiting dilution to enrich the population of FcγRIIa-expressing cells. To check the expression levels of FcγRIIa and FcγRIIaΔCT, these cells were incubated with a mouse anti-CD32 monoclonal antibody (GeneTex) for 1 h at room temperature.

<title>Attachment, uptake, and localization of DiI-labeled SUDV VLPs.</title>
<p>Untreated (Control), CTR IgG-, and ZGP12/1.1-treated DiI-labeled SUDV VLPs were inoculated into K562 cell lines and SUDV VLPs (red) on the cell surface at 0 h (A, D) and VLPs (red) and eGFP-Rab7 (B, E) (green) or Dx10 (C, F) (green) in the cytoplasm at 2 h after adsorption were monitored by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Scale bars represent 10 μm. Nuclei of cells are visualized with DAPI (blue). The number of SUDV VLPs on the cell surface (D) and the colocalization of SUDV VLPs (DiI) and eGFP-Rab7 (E) or Dx10 (F) signals were quantified. The mean and standard deviation of three independent experiments are shown. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test (*<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05).</p>
