<abstract>
<p>Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes several tumors and hyperproliferative disorders. Hypoxia and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) activate latent and lytic KSHV genes, and several KSHV proteins increase the cellular levels of HIF. Here, we used RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, Taqman assays, and pathway analysis to explore the miRNA and mRNA response of uninfected and KSHV-infected cells to hypoxia, to compare this with the genetic changes seen in chronic latent KSHV infection, and to explore the degree to which hypoxia and KSHV infection interact in modulating mRNA and miRNA expression. We found that the gene expression signatures for KSHV infection and hypoxia have a 34% overlap. Moreover, there were considerable similarities between the genes up-regulated by hypoxia in uninfected (SLK) and in KSHV-infected (SLKK) cells. hsa-miR-210, a HIF-target known to have pro-angiogenic and anti-apoptotic properties, was significantly up-regulated by both KSHV infection and hypoxia using Taqman assays. Interestingly, expression of KSHV-encoded miRNAs was not affected by hypoxia. These results demonstrate that KSHV harnesses a part of the hypoxic cellular response and that a substantial portion of hypoxia-induced changes in cellular gene expression are induced by KSHV infection. Therefore, targeting hypoxic pathways may be a useful way to develop therapeutic strategies for KSHV-related diseases.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic herpesvirus known to cause several tumors and hyperproliferative disorders. While there has been reports of KSHV activating and increasing hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), this is the first report investigating and establishing the extent to which KSHV has evolved to reproduce the effects of hypoxia. We demonstrate that the cellular changes in gene expression induced by KSHV infection include many of the changes induced by hypoxia. This has substantial implications for the biology of KSHV and the pathogenesis of KSHV-associated cancers. To achieve this, we used mRNA-sequencing and small RNA-sequencing in combination with bioinformatics analysis, and orthogonal assays such as qRT-PCR and Taqman assays to determine the effects of hypoxia on miRNA and mRNA expression. We showed that not only was there a 34% overlap between the hypoxic response and KSHV infection, but also that miRNA miR-210, a HIF-target known to have anti-apoptotic, angiogenic, and oncogenic properties, was independently and additively increased by KSHV infection and hypoxia. Furthermore, we explored the effects of hypoxia on KSHV miRNAs and consistently observed that none of the KSHV miRNAs are affected by oxygen deprivation. These studies suggest that KSHV harnesses a part of the hypoxic cellular response and that a substantial portion of hypoxia-induced changes in cellular gene expression are induced by KSHV infection. Previous studies have shown that hypoxia and HIFs activate KSHV-encoded genes, including several involved in tumor formation. These findings suggest that targeting HIFs or hypoxia pathways could block this positive feedback loop between KSHV and hypoxia and thus might be a useful strategy to treat KSHV-related tumors or other diseases. We believe these are important findings with broad implication for the understanding of the biology of KSHV and other oncoviruses and the pathogenesis of KSHV-induced tumors. As such, it should be of interest to the broad community of investigators and clinicians interested in the biology of oncoviruses, virus-induced cellular changes, and the pathogenesis and therapy of virus-induced tumors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent for several hyperproliferative disorders and tumors, including Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and a form of multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref004">4</xref>]. Like other herpesviruses, KSHV has two patterns of gene expression: latent, in which only a small subset of genes are expressed; and lytic, in which the full repertoire of genes are expressed and viral progeny are produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref005">5</xref>]. A number of recent studies have shown that hypoxia and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are important in the KSHV life cycle and the pathogenesis of KSHV-induced diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref008">8</xref>]. Two of the tumors caused by KSHV, KS and PEL, preferentially arise in relatively hypoxic environments: the extremities and pleural effusions, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref010">10</xref>]. Cells respond to hypoxic environments by a rapid up-regulation in their levels of two main HIFs, HIF-1 and HIF-2, which in turn enter the nucleus and activate HIF-responsive genes by binding to hypoxia response elements (HRE) in their promoter regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref012">12</xref>]. Hypoxia and HIFs can also up-regulate levels of the cellular microRNA (miRNA), miR-210, which in turn affects a number of target genes to promote adaptation to hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, exposure of KSHV-infected PEL cells to hypoxia or to HIFs has been shown to induce lytic KSHV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref007">7</xref>] and also to directly up-regulate certain KSHV genes, including the lytic switch gene replication transcription activator (RTA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref006">6</xref>], the open reading frame (ORF) 34 to 37 cluster of lytic genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref015">15</xref>], and latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>KSHV infection can induce a number of changes in the gene expression pattern of target cells that facilitate viral infection, persistence, avoidance of host antiviral strategies, and when appropriate, viral replication. Some of these changes are induced by KSHV proteins, which can modulate a number of intracellular signaling pathways and the production of growth factors and cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref018">18</xref>]. Other changes are caused by KSHV-encoded miRNAs, which are generated from a dozen precursor miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref021">21</xref>]. It has been shown that among the changes mediated by KSHV are the induction of a hypoxic phenotype and the increase in the levels of and activation of HIFs under certain conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref023">23</xref>]. These changes are mediated by several KSHV-encoded proteins, including latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref016">16</xref>], viral interferon regulatory factor 3 (v-IRF3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref024">24</xref>], and viral G protein-coupled receptor (v-GPCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref022">22</xref>]. However, whether or not these three KSHV proteins are necessary to activate HIF is unknown.</p>
<p>Our group recently used next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis to explore the changes in cellular mRNA and miRNA expression profiles induced by latent KSHV infection using the SLK tumor line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref025">25</xref>]. Under normoxic conditions, KSHV infection modulated many mRNAs including a number that had been previously reported to be affected by hypoxia. Also, expression of a number of human miRNAs was different in KSHV-infected SLKK cells as compared to uninfected SLK cells, including a small but statistically significant up-regulation of miR-210 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref025">25</xref>]. In the current study, we extended these findings by using NGS to assess the changes in mRNA and miRNA expression profiles induced in this same SLK line by exposure to hypoxia, and we compared the findings to those induced by chronic KSHV infection. In addition, we studied the changes in mRNA and miRNA expression profiles after exposure to hypoxia in SLKK cells to those in KSHV-uninfected SLK cells in order to understand how hypoxia and KSHV may interact to modulate cellular gene expression.</p>

<title>Cellular mRNA response to hypoxia in uninfected SLK cells</title>
<p>To assess the changes in mRNA gene expression induced by hypoxia in KSHV-uninfected SLK cells, next-generation sequencing was performed on mRNA libraries from hypoxic and normoxic uninfected SLK samples in triplicate. Out of a total of 30,808 mRNAs analyzed, 519 annotated genes were significantly differentially expressed (<italic>P</italic> ≤0.05, fold change ≤-2 or ≥2) in hypoxic vs. normoxic SLK cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). The most abundant genes (average read count &gt; 100) that were differentially expressed are depicted in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>. Importantly, among the 210 up-regulated genes were a number that have been described previously to be increased in hypoxia, such as BNIP3, BNIP3L, DDIT4, LDHA, SLC2A1 (GLUT1) and STC2 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref></bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref031">31</xref>]. As a confirmation that expected cellular mRNAs were responding to hypoxia, we assessed the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a well-described hypoxia-responsive gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref032">32</xref>], in normoxic and hypoxic SLK cells. By RNA-seq, VEGF expression was up-regulated 2.1 fold but that change was not considered significant as <italic>P</italic> = 0.06, which is above our threshold of <italic>P</italic>≤0.05. However, we separately confirmed by RT-qPCR that VEGF was significantly up-regulated ~2.5 fold by hypoxia (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.005, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g001">Fig 1C</xref></bold>). Taken together, these results provide confidence that changes seen in the SLK cells under hypoxic treatment were in fact due to hypoxia.</p>

<title>Cellular miRNA response to hypoxia in uninfected SLK cells</title>
<p>The same SLK hypoxic samples that were analyzed for mRNA-Seq were also sequenced for small RNA-Seq to assess differential miRNA expression. A total of 112 out of 1,378 miRNAs were found significantly deregulated in hypoxia compared to normoxia (<italic>P</italic> ≤0.05, FC ≤-2 or ≥2; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g001">Fig 1D</xref></bold>, top left and right sectors). Perhaps the most striking observation was that of the 112 miRNAs deregulated in response to hypoxia, a large majority (99 miRNAs, or 88%) were down-regulated. Of the 112 hypoxia-regulated miRNAs, also known as hypoxamiRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref033">33</xref>], 47 were expressed with an average miR read count greater than 1, illustrated by our heat map analysis; this showed a clear distinction between the triplicate hypoxic and normoxic samples (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006143.s001">S1A Fig</xref></bold>). Ten (21%) of the 47 hypoxamiRs with a read count greater than 1 were up-regulated, while 37 (79%) were down-regulated by hypoxia.</p>
<p>After a ranking based on read abundance, we determined the top 5 most abundant up- and down-regulated hypoxamiR in SLK cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g001">Fig 1E</xref></bold>). As previously described for other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref036">36</xref>], of the most abundantly expressed miRNAs, miR-210 was the most significantly up-regulated by hypoxia in SLK cells with a nearly 13-fold increase (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g001">Fig 1E</xref></bold>). Interestingly, we also observed an 8-fold increase of miR-210 host gene (MIR210HG), the precursor to miR-210, by RNA-Seq. This is consistent with previous findings showing that at least one functional HIF-1 binding site (hypoxia-response element, HRE) is located in the promoter region of miR-210 host gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref037">37</xref>]. A previously described hypoxamiR, miR-146a-5p, was also induced by hypoxia in SLK cells (2-fold), and has been shown to be a NF-κB-dependent gene which leads to the down-regulation of the inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref038">38</xref>]. MiRNAs miR-1185-5p, miR-668, and miR-5001-3p were all up-regulated (2 to 4 fold). On the other hand, miR-6723-5p, miR-222-5p, miR-4484, miR-2682-3p, and miR-1257 were the most down-regulated miRNAs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g001">Fig 1E</xref></bold>). Our small RNA-Seq study of uninfected SLK cells exposed to hypoxia confirmed previously published findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref038">38</xref>] and allowed for a global view of hypoxia-regulated miRNAs that will be compared to the effects of KSHV infection.</p>

<title>Analysis of miRNA and mRNA target expression in hypoxic SLK cells</title>
<p>Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to analyze the large number of deregulated genes in hypoxic SLK cells, in order to identify the principal pathways altered by hypoxia (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006143.s002">S2A Fig</xref></bold>). Among the top 15 pathways most significantly modulated by hypoxia were the Wnt/β-catenin signaling, the neuregulin signaling, prostanoid biosynthesis, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway, and a number of cancer signaling pathways. Also, an integrated approach was used to correlate miRNA and mRNA differential profiles of the RNA-Seq data (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006143.s003">S3A Fig</xref></bold>). In hypoxic SLK cells, 426 differentially expressed mRNAs were predicted targets of the 52 modulated miRNAs. The IPA microRNA Filter analysis further revealed that 65% (278 out of 426 mRNAs) of these predicted targets inversely correlated with the changes in miRNA expression (up-regulated miRNA and down-regulated target mRNA, or down-regulated miRNA and up-regulated target mRNA). Thus, substantially more than half of the changes occurring in the mRNA targets under hypoxic stress were consistent with predicted changes in the levels of various miRNAs, suggesting that at least some of these mRNA changes were a result of the changes in miRNA expression. This percentage is similar to that (73%) which was obtained when miRNAs and mRNA targets were similarly analyzed in KSHV-infected SLKK cells as compared with uninfected SLK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref025">25</xref>]. When we restricted the IPA analysis to targets with a high confidence prediction or experimentally observed responses, 35 miRNAs were identified that were paired to 108 mRNA targets (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006143.s003">S3A Fig</xref></bold>). Specifically, eight miRNAs that were up-regulated by hypoxia were predicted to target 43 mRNAs that were down-regulated, and 27 miRNAs that were down-regulated by hypoxia were predicted to target 65 mRNAs that were up-regulated. These miRNA-mRNA pairs are listed in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006143.s003">S3B Fig</xref></bold>. Notably, changes in miR-210 were correlated with changes in homeobox A1 (HOXA1), a well-described target of miR-210 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref037">37</xref>], and CLUH, a regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref039">39</xref>], among others.</p>

<title>Relationship between the cellular response to hypoxia and KSHV infection</title>
<p>KSHV infection and KSHV-encoded proteins have previously been shown to increase HIF transcription and its responsiveness to hypoxia mimics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref041">41</xref>]. With this background, we wanted to explore the relationship between the genes affected by hypoxia and those affected by KSHV infection in SLK cells.

<p>mRNA and miRNA differential expression in hypoxic vs. normoxic SLK cells was compared with publicly available data from KSHV-infected SLKK vs. uninfected SLK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref025">25</xref>]. (<bold>A</bold>) Genes that are up-regulated or down-regulated by hypoxia (P≤0.05, FC ≤-2 and ≥2) are similarly regulated (P≤0.05, FC ≤-2 and ≥2) due to KSHV infection.

Out of 309 hypoxia-repressed genes, ~41% (128) were also down-regulated by KSHV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref025">25</xref>].

<p>The genes up-regulated by both hypoxia and KSHV infection are listed in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006143.s006">S1 Table</xref></bold> and include genes that are known to play roles in hypoxia and viral pathogenesis; i.e. nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref044">44</xref>], integrin alpha 5 (ITGAV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref046">46</xref>] and baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 3 (BIRC3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref048">48</xref>]. While there was considerable overlap, of the 210 genes that were up-regulated by hypoxia (<italic>P</italic> ≤0.05 and FC≥2), a substantial number (155) remained unchanged with KSHV infection and 6 were down-regulated by KSHV (<italic>P</italic> ≤0.05 and FC ≤-2) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>). To get a better sense of how these hypoxia-responsive genes were affected by KSHV infection, we plotted the KSHV-induced changes in the genes that met our cut-off criteria for up-regulation by hypoxia (<italic>P</italic> ≤0.05 and FC ≥2) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). As can be seen, while a number of genes were significantly up-regulated under both conditions (49 red dots in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>), a substantial number of genes up-regulated by hypoxia were also up-regulated with KSHV infection but just not to the level sufficient to meet the cut-off criteria (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05) (grey dots to the right of the y-axis in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). Only 6 genes were up-regulated by hypoxia but significantly down-regulated by KSHV infection (black dots in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>); interestingly, these included the high-affinity glucose transporter GLUT1, a HIF-1α-target gene also known as SLC2A1 that plays a role in glycolysis and the Warburg effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref049">49</xref>]. Consistent with this finding, it has recently been reported that GLUT1 is down-regulated by KSHV in rat mesenchymal cells and that this down-regulation promotes cell survival and oncogenic transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref050">50</xref>].</p>
<p>Looking at the genes affected by KSHV, a relatively smaller proportion were similarly affected by hypoxia; 177 out of 1,559 (11%) of the genes deregulated by KSHV were similarly changed by hypoxia (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006143.s004">S4 Fig</xref></bold>). Overall, these results suggest that KSHV similarly affects many of the genes affected by hypoxia, although the extent of the change with KSHV infection is often less. In addition, the results demonstrate that while the hypoxic response comprises a substantial portion of the changes in cellular gene expression induced by KSHV, KSHV induces a number of other changes in gene expression unrelated to hypoxia.</p>
<p>A similar comparison was carried out on the data obtained from the small RNA-Seq differential analysis (and Taqman analysis in regard to miR-210). There were only ten deregulated miRNAs that overlapped between hypoxia and KSHV infection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g002">Fig 2C</xref></bold>). Of these ten miRNAs, two (miR-4671-3p and miR-210) were up-regulated, while the other eight were down-regulated; the most abundant down-regulated miRNAs were miR-548b-3p and miR-1270.</p>

<title>Similarities between KSHV infection and hypoxia in endothelial cells and AIDS-KS</title>
<p>In order to further explore the relationship between the cellular genes affected by KSHV infection and those affected by hypoxia, we analyzed the reported results of two studies of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref052">52</xref>]. KS spindle cells are thought to be derived from endothelial cells, and HUVECs can thus potentially provide more insight into the pathogenesis of KS than SLK cells. One study used microarray to analyze the genes whose expression was modulated by <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection of HUVECs (48 hrs post-infection) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref051">51</xref>], while the other used RNA sequencing to analyze HUVECs exposed to hypoxia (1% O<sub>2</sub>) for 48 hrs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref052">52</xref>]. Overall, there were 8,863 genes that were analyzed in both studies, of which 350 were dysregulated by <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection and 1,137 were dysregulated by hypoxia (using a 1.5 fold cut-off for both parameters). Of the 350 genes that were dysregulated by <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection in HUVECs, 49 (14%, including 40 up-regulated and 9 down-regulated) were similarly dysregulated by hypoxia (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006143.s007">S2 Table</xref></bold>). It is worth pointing out that unlike the SLKK cells, in which KSHV infection was almost completely latent, KSHV <italic>de novo</italic> infection of HUVECs involves expression of both latent and certain lytic KSHV genes and in addition involves a cellular response to acute viral infection. Even so, the genes affected by the response to hypoxia comprised a considerable proportion of the genes modulated by <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection. Furthermore, we compared the reported expression profile of KS lesions with known hypoxic gene signatures. Cornelissen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref053">53</xref>] identified 76 key host genes that are dysregulated in AIDS-KS lesions as compared to normal tissue. Comparing these results to studies of hypoxia, 22 (29%) of these genes are either known HIF-1 targets, have been reported to be similarly dysregulated by hypoxia, or were similarly dysregulated in the SLK/SLKK cell model (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006143.s008">S3 Table</xref></bold>). Of note, one of the genes up-regulated in hypoxia and AIDS-KS, PKM2, has been separately shown to regulate the KS angiogenic phenotype by acting as a coactivator of HIF-1 and increasing the levels of HIF-1 angiogenic factors, including VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref054">54</xref>]. Overall, there was a consistent pattern of substantial overlap between KSHV infection and hypoxia.</p>

<title>Changes in mRNA expression profiles in hypoxic SLKK cells</title>
<p>We were further interested in studying how hypoxia affected mRNA and miRNA expression in KSHV-infected cells. To this end, KSHV-infected SLKK cells were exposed to 1% O<sub>2</sub> for 24hrs, and deep sequencing of mRNA libraries of these hypoxic and control normoxic SLKK cells was performed (each n = 3). Differential analysis using Cufflinks showed that 268 annotated genes were differentially expressed; 215 genes were up-regulated and 53 were down-regulated (<italic>P</italic>≤0.05, FC ≤-2 and ≥2; in blue in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g003">Fig 3A</xref></bold>). In order to confirm that hypoxic induction occurred in the SLKK cells, quantitative real time PCR was again undertaken to determine the expression of VEGF in hypoxia. In the SLKK RNA sequencing, VEGF was up-regulated 3 fold but did not make our significance threshold of <italic>P</italic>≤0.05 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.07). However, as seen in the quantitative real time PCR data in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold>, there was a ~5.5 fold induction of VEGF upon exposure to hypoxia (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001), confirming that the cells were in fact under hypoxic stress. Of interest, N-Myc downstream regulated 1 (NDRG1) was the most significantly up-regulated gene in hypoxic SLKK cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g003">Fig 3A</xref></bold>), with a 4.7 log<sub>2</sub> fold change increase. These results differed from those found in both normoxic and hypoxic SLK cells, in which NDRG1 was poorly expressed and was thus not significantly changed. NDRG1 expression has been shown to be increased by a variety of environmental stresses, including hypoxia, in either normal or tumor cells, and is involved in caspase activation and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref055">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref057">57</xref>].

Another gene of interest in SLK and SLKK cells was stanniocalcin-2 (STC2). This was one of the mRNA most significantly up-regulated by hypoxia in both SLKK cells and SLK cells, with a 3.8 and 3.9 log<sub>2</sub> fold change increase, respectively (<bold>Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g001">1A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g003">3A</xref></bold>). STC2 promotes cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasiveness in hypoxia; traits that likely promote viral persistence and malignant progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref058">58</xref>].

Of these mRNAs, DDIT4, IGFBP3, BNIP3, PGK1 and LGALS1 were up-regulated, while VCAM1, CCND1, PLAU, CXCL1 and GDF15 were down-regulated.

<p>It was previously shown that KSHV infection leads to enhanced transcription of HIF and increases the induction of HIF-1 and HIF-2 by a hypoxic mimic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref023">23</xref>]. Therefore, we wanted to assess the levels of HIFs across all four conditions (i.e. normoxic-uninfected, normoxic-infected, hypoxic-uninfected, and hypoxia-infected samples) in order to determine the degree to which HIF levels might play a role in the observed changes. We were not able to detect HIF-1α in normoxic SLK or SLKK cells, and we could not reliably detect HIF-2α under any conditions. However, consistent with the results of Carroll et al. in endothelial cells infected with KSHV <italic>de novo</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref023">23</xref>], HIF-1α was substantially more up-regulated by hypoxia in SLKK cells than SLK cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006143.s005">S5 Fig</xref></bold>), consistent with a relative increase in HIF activity in SLKK cells.</p>

<title>Hypoxic miRNA response in KSHV-infected SLKK cells</title>
<p>Looking at hypoxia-induced changes in miRNA expression profiles in SLKK cells using the same cutoffs (<italic>P</italic>≤0.05, FC ≤-2 and ≥2), 79 miRNAs were significantly deregulated by hypoxia (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g003">Fig 3D</xref></bold>). Of these, miR-210 was again the most significantly up-regulated miRNA (<italic>P</italic> = 2.0x10<sup>-4</sup> and log<sub>2</sub> fold change = 3.7; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref></bold>), similar to uninfected SLK cells. Of these 79 hypoxamiRs (miRNAs regulated by hypoxia), 72 made the abundance cut-off (average miR count ≥1), which allowed for an unbiased, unsupervised clustering of hypoxic vs. normoxic SLKK samples (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006143.s001">S1B Fig</xref></bold>). Of these 72 miRNAs, 51 were down-regulated, while 21 were up-regulated, including miR-210. We selected the 10 most abundant hypoxamiRs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g003">Fig 3E</xref></bold>). Of these, miR-210, miR-4320, miR-193a-5p, miR-139-5p and miR-3126-5p were up-regulated while miR-222-5p was the most down-regulated miRNA.</p>
<p>We also looked at the effects of hypoxia on KSHV-encoded miRNAs in SLKK cells. Hypoxia was previously shown to affect the expression of LANA mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref059">59</xref>], and since at least some KSHV miRNAs share the promoter region with LANA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref060">60</xref>], it was possible that their expression might also be affected. However, as seen in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g003">Fig 3F</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006143.s009">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006143.s010">S5</xref> Tables</bold>, hypoxia did not change the expression of any KSHV miRNAs as assessed by deep sequencing. Also, comparing hypoxic and normoxic SLKK cells, hypoxia did not affect the overall fraction of viral miRNA (~9%) as compared to the total miRNA read count (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006143.s009">S4 Table</xref></bold>). In order to validate these findings, Taqman assays were undertaken to assess the expression of the four most abundant miRNAs in SLKK cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g003">Fig 3G</xref></bold>). These included miR-K12-3-5p, miR-K12-4-3p, and miR-K12-8-3p, that are expressed during latency, as well as miR-K12-10a-3p, a KSHV miRNA under the Kaposin promoter that is expressed both during the latent and lytic phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref061">61</xref>]. In addition, we utilized Taqman assays to quantify the expression of four additional KSHV miRNAs that are less abundant in SLKK cells (miR-K12-1-5p, miR-K12-2-5p, miR-K12-6-3p, and miR-K12-11-3p). None of these eight KSHV miRNAs showed a significant change in expression between normoxia and hypoxia in SLKK cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g003">Fig 3G</xref></bold>). These results suggest that while certain cellular miRNAs such as miR-210 are dramatically affected by hypoxia and many are down-regulated by hypoxia, none of the KSHV viral miRNAs are affected.</p>

<title>miR-210 regulation by hypoxia and KSHV</title>
<p>Because miR-210 was consistently increased in response to hypoxia and also increased in response to KSHV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref025">25</xref>], a more detailed investigation of its regulation was undertaken. The relative expression of miR-210 was evaluated by Taqman assay under four different conditions: normoxic SLK cells, normoxic SLKK cells, hypoxic SLK cells and hypoxic SLKK cells (each n = 3). As previously shown by Taqman assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref025">25</xref>], KSHV infection alone increases miR-210 levels (~2.5 fold increase) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). In addition, there was a strong induction of miR-210 in hypoxic SLK cells (15–20 fold increase), and levels were highest of all in hypoxic SLKK cells. Based on this observation and miR-210’s role in other cancers, we hypothesize that an increase in miR-210 in KSHV-infected cells, either in normoxia or in hypoxia, may help promote cellular changes that favor infected cells and the development of KSHV-induced cancers.</p>

<p>ISCU, a mitochondrial iron sulfur scaffold protein, is a miR-210 target that is important in cellular metabolism. In MCF7 cells, it has been shown that miR-210-mediated down-regulation of ISCU contributes to a shift to glycolysis, enhanced cell survival, and an increase in iron uptake required for cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref062">62</xref>]. To investigate whether ISCU is in fact down-regulated by miR-210 in our cell model, transfection of miR-210 miRNA mimics and miR-210 miRNA inhibitors was performed in SLKK cells, either in normoxia or in hypoxia. These miRNA inhibitors are small single-stranded RNA molecules that bind to and inhibit specific endogenous miRNA molecules in order to down-regulate miRNA activity. As seen in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g004">Fig 4B</xref>,</bold> hypoxia significantly increased miR-210 expression by ~6–8 fold in SLKK cells. As expected, the transfection of miR-210 mimics or inhibitors substantially increased or decreased miR-210 relative expression, respectively (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g004">Fig 4B</xref></bold>). Note that after transient transfection with miRNA mimics or antisense inhibitors, the majority of transfected RNA is vesicular and is therefore not accessible for loading into Argonaute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref063">63</xref>]. However, the levels of RISC-associated miRNA mimics are close to those of endogenous miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref063">63</xref>]. This data allowed for a further analysis of the effects of miR-210 on expression of its putative target, ISCU. To this end, we evaluated the levels of ISCU by qRT-PCR in SLKK cells under these same conditions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g004">Fig 4C</xref></bold>). ISCU was found significantly down-regulated after transfection of miR-210 mimics and after exposure to hypoxia (NT control, mimic-ctrl, and anti-ctrl). Finally, ISCU was significantly up-regulated as compared to hypoxic anti-ctrl when miR-210 inhibitors were transfected, as had been described in other cell systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref062">62</xref>]. ISCU protein expression was similar but not completely identical to that of ISCU mRNA (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g004">Fig 4D</xref></bold>). In particular, ISCU protein was significantly reduced when miR-210 mimics were transfected, and significantly increased when miR-210 inhibitors where transfected, demonstrating that it is modulated by miR-210 in SLKK cells. However, ISCU protein expression in hypoxia did not decrease as much as its mRNA counterpart. These results provide evidence that ISCU is a target of miR-210 in KSHV-positive SLKK cells and that miR-210-mediated repression of ISCU could function to mediate cell survival.</p>

<title>Comparison of the hypoxic response between KSHV infected and uninfected cells</title>
<p>We next compared the cellular response to hypoxia in KSHV-infected versus KSHV-uninfected cells, to explore the effects of latent KSHV infection on the response to hypoxia. When looking at mRNA expression changes due to hypoxia in SLKK and SLK cells, we found that a total of 65 mRNAs, including key hypoxic genes such as BNIP3, LOX, VCAM-1, IGFBP3, PLOD2, and miR-210 host gene (MIR210HG), responded in a similar manner; either induced (51 genes) or repressed (14 genes) by hypoxia in both cell lines (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref></bold>). However, a majority of genes whose expression was significantly modified by hypoxia in SLK cells did not meet the cut-off for change in hypoxia-exposed SLKK cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g005">Fig 5A</xref></bold>). To explore this further, we assessed the effects of hypoxia in SLKK cells of genes that were significantly up-regulated by hypoxia in SLK cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g005">Fig 5B</xref></bold>). As seen in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g005">Fig 5B</xref></bold> (red dots), a significant portion (24%) of the genes that were significantly up-regulated in SLK cells were also up-regulated in SLKK cells. Most of the other genes (grey dots in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g005">Fig 5B</xref></bold>) that were up-regulated by hypoxia in SLK cells trended towards up-regulation in SLKK cells, but just did not make our cut-off values (<italic>P</italic>≤0.05, FC ≤-2 or ≥2). Interestingly, there were no genes induced by hypoxia in SLK cells but significantly repressed in SLKK cells. This was in contrast to the previous comparison between the effects of hypoxia and KSHV infection in SLK cells, in which some genes up-regulated by hypoxia were significantly down-regulated by KSHV infection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). Also, there was a strong positive correlation between the hypoxia-induced mRNA changes in SLK and SLKK cells (Pearson correlation coefficient of r = 0.72). Among the 51 mRNAs up-regulated in both SLK and SLKK cells, BNIP3, a pro-apoptotic gene known for being one of the most hypoxia-responsive genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref064">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref065">65</xref>], had its mRNA levels increased 4 fold due to hypoxia in both infected and uninfected cell lines. MIR210HG, the host gene for miR-210, was also one of the responders in common between the two cell lines. There were 14 genes that met our cut-off values for down-regulation in both SLK and SLKK cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g005">Fig 5A</xref></bold>). VCAM-1 was one of the significantly down-regulated mRNAs in both cell lines, with -1.4 and -2.8 log<sub>2</sub> FC in SLK and SLKK cells respectively. This is consistent with the fact that hypoxia has been reported to reduce VCAM-1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref067">67</xref>].</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Viruses, and especially those that cause chronic infections, are attuned to and respond to changes in their target cells. At the same time, viral infection leads to a number of changes in these target cells, some mediated by the virus and others as part of the host response to infection. Previous studies have shown that hypoxia and HIFs can affect KSHV biology and KSHV-induced tumor formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref059">59</xref>]. Moreover, KSHV infection and LANA, a KSHV-encoded latent gene, have been shown to induce the up-regulation of HIF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref016">16</xref>] and at least one HIF-responsive gene (VEGFR1) in newly infected endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref023">23</xref>]. Also, several HIF-responsive genes related to angiogenesis or metabolism have been shown to be elevated in immortalized HUVECs chronically infected with KSHV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref070">70</xref>]. However, these data do not provide a complete picture of the cellular response to KSHV infection and the role that hypoxia plays. To further investigate these relationships, we used RNA-Seq analysis to assess the changes induced by hypoxia in SLK cells and compare them with the changes we had previously found in chronically KSHV-infected SLK cells (the SLKK line) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref025">25</xref>]; this paper represents the first global survey of these effects. We found that there was a substantial overlap in the alteration in gene expression induced by KSHV infection and hypoxia. In particular, more than a third (34%) of the genes seen differentially expressed under hypoxia were similarly up- or down-regulated by KSHV latent infection. Also, a majority of the 155 genes that made our cut-off for up-regulation by hypoxia but not for KSHV (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>) demonstrated a trend towards up-regulation in KSHV infection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). By contrast, only 5 genes up-regulated by hypoxia showed a down-regulation in KSHV-infected cells. Looking at this from the perspective of KSHV-modulated genes, 11% of these genes are genes modulated in the same way by hypoxia. Overall, these results provide evidence that KSHV commandeers the cell response to hypoxia and that hypoxia-related changes in gene expression comprise a substantial portion of the response to KSHV infection. While levels of HIF-1 were greater in hypoxia-exposed SLKK cells than hypoxia-exposed SLK cells, it was noteworthy that a hypoxic signature was observed in normoxic SLK cells in spite of the fact that we could not detect elevated levels of HIF-1 protein. Further studies would be required to determine to which degree the overlap between the hypoxic response and the KSHV infection is due to KSHV-induced up-regulation of HIF, especially under normoxic conditions.</p>
<p>Cells respond to hypoxia through a number of changes, primarily mediated by HIFs. The systems and pathways that are induced by hypoxia include glycolysis and glucose uptake, growth factor signaling, immortalization, resistance to apoptosis, angiogenesis, and genetic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref072">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref073">73</xref>]. It is notable that KSHV has such an effect on hypoxia-related genes, and raises the question as to what evolutionary advantage it provides the virus. Looking at specific genes that are up-regulated by both hypoxia and KSHV infection in our study, a number have activities that can facilitate chronic viral infection or thwart innate anti-viral mechanisms. For instance, baculoviral IAP repeat containing 3 (BIRC3), also known as cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (cIAP-2), is a hypoxia-responsive gene that can confer resistance to apoptosis by interfering with caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref048">48</xref>]. Here, BIRC3 was induced in SLK cells by both hypoxia (log<sub>2</sub> fold change of 1.7 or 3.2 fold) and by KSHV infection (14.9 fold change) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006143.s006">S1 Table</xref></bold>). Interestingly, KSHV protein K15 also up-regulates BIRC3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref047">47</xref>], which suggest that the up-regulation in KSHV infection can occur through both HIF-dependent and independent mechanisms. By interfering with apoptosis, BIRC3 can inhibit the ability of KSHV-infected cells to destroy themselves (and the infecting virus) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref074">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref076">76</xref>]. Another gene that is up-regulated by both hypoxia and KSHV infection is NEAT1, a host long non-coding RNA involved in nuclear paraspeckle formation. There is evidence that NEAT1 plays an important role in regulating gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref077">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref078">78</xref>]. NEAT1 has also been found to increase the survival of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref043">43</xref>], and may thus benefit KSHV infection by preventing the death of KSHV-infected cells.</p>
<p>Up-regulation of genes such as BIRC3 or NEAT1 would presumably be beneficial for most viruses, and in fact several other chronic viruses, including hepatitis B virus, human papillomavirus, Epstein Barr virus, and human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) have also been reported to activate HIF and certain HIF-responsive genes. At the same time, the modulation of HIF-responsive genes by KSHV is particularly robust. Endothelial cells are important target cells for KSHV infection, and it is possible that the virus evolved to up-regulate hypoxia-responsive genes in part because several of these genes, including STC2 and IGFBP3 (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006143.s006">S1 Table</xref></bold>), promote angiogenesis and the growth of endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref079">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref080">80</xref>]. An unintended consequence of the activation of these and other HIF-responsive genes may be tumorigenesis leading to the development of Kaposi sarcoma and other KSHV-induced tumors.</p>
<p>As described in our previous paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref025">25</xref>], we used SLK and SLKK cells in this study because of the extremely tight control of KSHV latency in these cells and because they provide the ability to compare the effects of hypoxia and KSHV infection on KSHV infected and uninfected cells. SLK cells were originally thought to be derived from a KS biopsy and have a number of endothelial-like features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref081">81</xref>]; however, this line was subsequently found to be indistinguishable from Caki-1, a clear-cell renal carcinoma line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref081">81</xref>]. Nonetheless, this line remains a valuable tool to study the effects of latent KSHV infection. To further explore whether there was substantial overlap in the cellular response to KSHV infection and to hypoxia in systems that were biologically more similar to KS, we used published datasets to analyze gene changes in HUVECs and in KS lesions, and found evidence in these systems as well. In the <italic>de novo</italic> infected HUVECs system, it is noteworthy that a strong hypoxic signature was seen in the cellular response in spite of the fact that lytic KSHV genes and an acute cellular response to viral infection are present. However, there may be limitations to that system in that HUVECs were infected <italic>de novo</italic> for 48hrs, which corresponds to an early lytic activation. In that phase, KSHV is establishing initial infection and cells are reacting to this infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref082">82</xref>]. Therefore, it is not surprising that cellular genes expressed during this short-lived and transient phase might be different from those that will be differentially expressed during latency and that hypoxia-related genes comprise a smaller percentage of the genes that are differentially expressed. Additionally, compiled results from a number of studies show that a substantial proportion of genes whose expression is modulated in KS lesions are genes that are responsive to hypoxia. Taken together, the prominence of a hypoxic gene activation in KSHV infection and the potential of HIFs to activate KSHV genes may provide a rationale for targeting hypoxic pathways as a potential therapeutic strategy for KSHV-related diseases. Indeed, HIF-1 dysregulation is known to fuel both angiogenesis and tumor metabolism in KS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref054">54</xref>]. Furthermore, HIF-1 suppression has been found to lower viral interleukin-6 levels, lytic replication of KSHV, and proliferation of PELs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref083">83</xref>], supporting that HIF-1 is indeed an important factor in the maintenance of KSHV infection and the survival of PELs.</p>
<p>A somewhat different picture emerged when we examined the miRNA changes induced by KSHV infection and hypoxia. The majority of the deregulated miRNAs in either hypoxia or in KSHV infection were repressed (88% by hypoxia and 73% by KSHV infection) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref025">25</xref>]. However, there was relatively little overlap in the miRNA expression profiles affected by hypoxia and those affected by KSHV infection. A notable exception to this was miR-210, which was significantly up-regulated by both hypoxia and KSHV latent infection; this was confirmed using independent Taqman validation assays. miR-210 is directly up-regulated by the binding of HIF-1α to an HRE in its promoter region and has previously been shown to be the main miRNA induced by hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref035">35</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref084">84</xref>]. While miR-210’s effects on KSHV were not investigated here, miR-210 has been extensively studied and is known to be an important factor in regulating the immune response, glycolysis, and tumorigenesis, all areas which may impact the biology of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref085">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref086">86</xref>]. Additionally, miR-210 has been shown to be up-regulated by EBV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref087">87</xref>] and HIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref088">88</xref>], and miR-210 helps maintain virion production in HBV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref089">89</xref>]. An important target of miR-210 is ISCU, a mitochondrial iron sulfur scaffold protein involved in cellular metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref062">62</xref>], and as seen here, changes in ISCU are consistent with its regulation by miR-210 in KSHV-infected cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g004">Fig 4C</xref></bold>). Of note, inhibition of ISCU by miR-210 in MCF7 cells has previously been shown to lead to a shift to increased glycolysis, an enhanced cell survival rate, and an increased iron uptake required for cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref062">62</xref>]. Such changes could help promote the Warburg effect that has been described in KSHV-infected cells and favors their cell growth and survival. The exact role of miR-210 in KSHV infection and disease pathogenesis remain to be established in future studies.</p>
<p>By contrast to miR-210, the majority of miRNAs affected by hypoxia or by latent KSHV infection were down-regulated. The mechanism leading to these changes is not clear, but could be related to changes in post-translational miRNA biogenesis. In this regard, it has been reported that the key proteins of the miRNA biogenesis, Dicer and Drosha, can be down-regulated in hypoxia, hence reducing miRNA processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref090">90</xref>]. However in the present experiments, neither Dicer nor Drosha mRNAs were found significantly down-regulated by hypoxia in the RNA-Seq data; nevertheless, the levels of these miRNA processing proteins might still be affected by post-transcriptional alterations. Additional studies will be needed to understand this general miRNA down-regulation by hypoxia.</p>
<p>Certain cells newly infected by KSHV, such as endothelial cells, have been reported to increase glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect, and a number of genes involved in glycolysis are up-regulated by HIF-1 (but not HIF-2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref091">91</xref>]. While the increase in miR-210 levels could contribute to the Warburg effect, it was noteworthy that a number of genes involved in glycolysis were up-regulated by hypoxia (including GLUT1, hexokinase 2, phosphoglycerate kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1, and lactate dehydrogenase-5), but were not by KSHV infection. In fact, GLUT1, which transports glucose into the cell, was one of the 5 down-regulated genes in SLKK cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). Interestingly, while GLUT1 is up-regulated in endothelial cells acutely infected by KSHV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref054">54</xref>], it has recently been reported to be down-regulated in acutely infected rat mesenchymal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref050">50</xref>]. It should be noted that SLKK cells are chronically infected and that KSHV is tightly latent in these cells; additional studies will be needed to clarify the effects of KSHV infection on genes involved in glycolysis.</p>
<p>KS preferentially arises in the feet, which have relatively low oxygen tension, and PEL usually arises in pleural spaces, which have no blood vessels and are also hypoxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref010">10</xref>]. Previous studies by our group and others have shown that hypoxia and HIFs can activate a number of KSHV genes, including RTA, LANA, and ORFS 34–37. Thus, the combination of KSHV infection and hypoxia appears to be important in the pathogenesis of KSHV-associated tumors. To explore these relationships further, we analyzed the effects of hypoxia on KSHV-infected cells. There was substantial overlap in the affected mRNAs in SLK and SLKK cells exposed to hypoxia, especially considering the genes that were up-regulated. However, in many cases, genes that were moderately up-regulated by hypoxia in SLK cells fell below our significance threshold for up-regulation in hypoxia-exposed SLKK cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g005">Fig 5B</xref></bold>), and none of the genes that were up-regulated by hypoxia in SLK cells were down-regulated by hypoxia in SLKK cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g005">Fig 5A</xref></bold>). In our RNA-Seq analysis. we did not directly compare the overall changes in mRNA and miRNA in uninfected SLK cells in normoxia to SLKK cells in hypoxia. Such a comparison was made for miR-210 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>) and revealed that the effects were cumulative. Also, this analysis showed that the induction of miR-210 by hypoxia in SLKK cells was less than that in SLK cells, largely because of the baseline elevation in the SLKK cells. This suggests that the reason that less genes overall were deregulated by hypoxia in SLKK cells than in SLK cells (519 vs. 268) may be because of a similar shift in baseline gene levels by KSHV.</p>
<p>KSHV encodes its own miRNAs, which are formed from 12 precursor miRNAs. These precursor miRNAs are on mRNA transcripts downstream of LANA, and share promoter regions with Kaposin. LANA, Kaposin, and most of the KSHV miRNAs are produced during latency, and some of the miRNAs (e.g. miR-K12-10 and -12) are up-regulated during chemical induction of KSHV lytic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref092">92</xref>]. Since LANA and the lytic switch gene RTA can be up-regulated by hypoxia and HIF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref059">59</xref>], we thought it plausible that expression of at least some of the KSHV-encoded miRNAs might be similarly induced by exposure to a low-oxygen environment. However, the levels of these mature miRNAs were remarkably unchanged by hypoxia (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g003">Fig 3F and 3G</xref></bold>). Some of the KSHV miRNAs are extremely abundant and the combination of a longer half-life of miRNAs compared to the mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref093">93</xref>] might explain this observation. Another factor might be the length of hypoxia, which might be much longer in the context of KSHV infection in humans, compared to the experimental hypoxia treatment in our assays (24hrs). We did not specifically analyze the levels of the miRNA precursors, and it is possible that an increase in these precursors was counterbalanced by a suppression of miRNA maturation, which also contributed to the overall decrease in cellular miRNAs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006143.g003">Fig 3D</xref></bold>). Additional studies will be needed to clarify this; however, the results indicate that a modulation of KSHV-encoded miRNAs does not have a substantial effect on the response of KSHV-infected cells to hypoxia.</p>
<p>In summary, this global gene survey demonstrates that there is a substantial overlap between the genes affected by hypoxia and by KSHV infection, and shows that induction of a hypoxic gene response is a substantial component of the modulation of cellular genes by KSHV infection. However, by contrast to mRNA expression, there was relatively little overlap in the modulation of miRNAs by KSHV infection and hypoxia, a notable exception being an up-regulation of HIF target miR-210, which has been previously shown to be important in the angiogenic response and in tumor formation. This study provides a more thorough understanding of the role of hypoxia and the interplay between KSHV infection and HIF/hypoxia, and lays the groundwork for further analyses of these interactions.</p>

We parsed the data based on expression fold change (FC&gt;1.5), and an additional <italic>P</italic>-value cut-off of 5x10<sup>-5</sup> was used on the RNA-seq study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref052">52</xref>] Overall, there were 8,863 genes that were detected in both studies, of which 350 and 1,137 were dysregulated by <italic>de novo</italic> KSHV infection and hypoxia, respectively. Additionally, we compared 76 genes known to be dysregulated in AIDS-KS lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref053">53</xref>] with our results in the SLK/SLKK model and other published hypoxia studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref102">102</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006143.ref117">117</xref>].
