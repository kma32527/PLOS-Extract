<abstract>
<p>The host factor and interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) product, zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP), inhibits a number of diverse viruses by usurping and intersecting with multiple cellular pathways. To elucidate its antiviral mechanism, we perform a loss-of-function genome-wide RNAi screen to identify cellular cofactors required for ZAP antiviral activity against the prototype alphavirus, Sindbis virus (SINV). In order to exclude off-target effects, we carry out stringent confirmatory assays to verify the top hits. Important ZAP-liaising partners identified include proteins involved in membrane ion permeability, type I IFN signaling, and post-translational protein modification. The factor contributing most to the antiviral function of ZAP is TRIM25, an E3 ubiquitin and ISG15 ligase. We demonstrate here that TRIM25 interacts with ZAP through the SPRY domain, and TRIM25 mutants lacking the RING or coiled coil domain fail to stimulate ZAPâs antiviral activity, suggesting that both TRIM25 ligase activity and its ability to form oligomers are critical for its cofactor function. TRIM25 increases the modification of both the short and long ZAP isoforms by K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin, although ubiquitination of ZAP does not directly affect its antiviral activity. However, TRIM25 is critical for ZAPâs ability to inhibit translation of the incoming SINV genome. Taken together, these data uncover TRIM25 as a bona fide ZAP cofactor that leads to increased ZAP modification enhancing its translational inhibition activity.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Organisms have evolved various innate strategies to defend against pathogens. During virus infection, the cell senses the viral nucleic acid and produces type I interferon, which alerts the neighboring cells. Signaling of type I interferon triggers expression of a wide array of genes, some of which encode proteins that inhibit the replication of diverse virus families. It is not clear what determines the broad yet specific activity of these interferon-induced gene products. Identification of cellular cofactors and pathways required for the function of these broadly antiviral proteins would help elucidate their mechanisms. Here, we perform a genome wide knockdown screen to identify host factors important for the antiviral action of zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP), a broad-spectrum inhibitory protein induced by interferon. We find that ZAP synergizes with host proteins with divergent functions and identify TRIM25 as a bona fide ZAP cofactor. TRIM25 binds to both splice isoforms of ZAP, and stimulates their ubiquitination and function by facilitating the ability of ZAP to block viral translation. Our data sheds light on the antiviral mechanism of ZAP and advances our understanding of host factor contributions to innate immune responses against viral infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The recent re-emergence and spread of viruses beyond their normal geographic distribution have affected countries worldwide. Understanding the biology of host factors with broad antiviral activity is crucial to vaccine and drug development efforts to counteract existing and emerging viral infections.</p>
<p>As a first line of defense against viruses, the host produces type I interferons (IFNs), which signal through the JAK/STAT pathway to induce hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that block various steps of the viral life cycle (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref001">1</xref>]). Among the ISGs, zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP), encoded by the <italic>ZC3HAV1</italic> gene, inhibits alphaviruses, filoviruses, hepatitis B virus, retroviruses, and the LINE-1 and Alu retroelements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref002">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref008">8</xref>]. However, ZAP does not inhibit yellow fever virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref003">3</xref>]. It is not well understood what determines the broad yet specific antiviral activity of ZAP.</p>
<p>ZAP, also called PARP13, is a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family and is alternatively spliced. The long isoform of ZAP (ZAPL) contains a PARP-like domain on the C-terminus that is missing in the short isoform (ZAPS). This PARP-like domain is not enzymatically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref009">9</xref>], although exchange of the inactive catalytic triad in ZAPL to that of the active PARPs completely abolishes its antiviral activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref010">10</xref>], suggesting an important yet unknown role of the PARP-like domain in the antiviral function of ZAP. Several studies have demonstrated distinct activities for the two isoforms. ZAPL is more active against alphaviruses, such as SINV and Semliki Forest virus, than ZAPS, and carries signatures of positive selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref012">12</xref>]. While both isoforms are induced by IFN, ZAPS is upregulated more than ZAPL by virus infection and type I IFN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Diverse cellular pathways have been implicated in ZAPâs function (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref015">15</xref>]), but its precise mechanism is unknown. It is possible that ZAP interacts with multiple host factors, and the involvement of those factors in the viral life cycle is what provides the specificity. For example, ZAP binds RNA and recruits the exosome complex to target viral RNAs for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref005">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref016">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref018">18</xref>]. ZAP also directly inhibits translation of the incoming alphaviral genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref003">3</xref>], with interference in the interaction between eIF4A and eIF4G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref019">19</xref>] implicated as one mechanism. In addition, ZAP synergizes with other ISGs for its maximal activity and upregulates RIG-I-mediated IFN-Î² production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref020">20</xref>]. These studies support a model in which ZAP interacts with various host factors and cellular complexes to achieve an optimal antiviral state against diverse viruses.</p>
<p>In an attempt to unify the divergent pathways in which ZAP is involved and to uncover novel cofactors that are important for ZAPâs inhibitory activity, we performed a genome-wide siRNA screen in a cell line inducible for ZAP expression. Large-scale RNAi screens allow us to take an unbiased approach to interrogate every gene in the genome. However, off-target effects lead to false positive hits and severely limit the value of genome-wide screens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref022">22</xref>]. To address this we performed a rigorous set of confirmatory assays to verify the top hits and exclude off-target effects. We identified several genes that synergize with ZAP to target SINV or inhibit SINV independently of ZAP. Among the hits, TRIM25 was validated to be a cofactor of ZAP. TRIM25 is an E3 ubiquitin and ISG15 ligase, and is responsible for the polyubiquitination and activation of RIG-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref023">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref025">25</xref>]. We generated CRISPR clones in <italic>ZC3HAV1</italic>-knockout 293T cells where TRIM25 expression is significantly reduced and further confirmed that TRIM25 synergizes with both ZAPS and ZAPL to block SINV replication. Our data demonstrates that TRIM25 triggers ubiquitination of ZAP and enhances its antiviral activity through inhibition of viral translation, highlighting the importance of cofactors in the mechanisms of broadly antiviral proteins.</p>

<title>A genome-wide siRNA screen reveals novel host factors that synergize with ZAP or exhibit ZAP-independent antiviral activity</title>
<p>We performed a genome-wide screen with pooled siRNAs from Dharmacon to identify genes that are required for ZAPâs antiviral activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g001">Fig 1A</xref> for screen workflow). Viral replication is low in T-REx-hZAP cells when ZAP expression is induced, and silencing of <italic>ZC3HAV1</italic> increases replication of a luciferase-encoding SINV, Toto1101/Luc, by 2 logs. The premise of the screen is as follows: should knockdown of an essential cofactor render ZAP nonfunctional, viral replication will be restored, resulting in increased luciferase activity (refer to âZAP cofactor siRNAâ column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The screen was performed in triplicate to improve robustness, and we identified 480 genes, whose silencing significantly elevated SINV Toto1101/Luc replication with an average robust Z score of &gt;3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). As expected, <italic>ZC3HAV1</italic> was the top hit with an average robust Z score of 582.65; this was followed by <italic>BAI3</italic> (165.56), <italic>TRIM25</italic> (116.52) and <italic>RICS</italic> (100.42) (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006145.s006">S1 Table</xref> for the entire results).</p>

T-REx-hZAP cells transfected with control or gene-specific siRNA were treated with doxycycline to induce ZAPS overexpression one day post-transfection and infected with SINV Toto1101/Luc two days post-transfection. Cell lysates were harvested for measurement of luciferase activity at 24 h post-infection (p.i.). Relative luciferase units represent the level of SINV replication. Cells treated with the control non-targeting (NT) pooled siRNA have low SINV replication while ZAP knockdown by <italic>ZC3HAV1</italic>-specific pooled siRNA rescues viral replication by 2 logs. The large dynamic range in which hypothetical hits (ZAP cofactors) were identified is plotted on the right side of the graph. <bold>(B)</bold> Pooled siRNAs targeting the entire human genome (Dharmacon) were tested in triplicate and genes with an average robust Z score of greater than 3 are plotted. <italic>ZC3HAV1</italic> is highlighted in red while the top hits immediately following <italic>ZC3HAV1</italic> are highlighted in blue.</p>

<p>Normalized percent activation (NPA) and robust Z score were utilized for hit selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref026">26</xref>]. The genes with the highest NPA and robust Z score &gt;3 in all three replicate wells were chosen for validation in a secondary screen (91 genes). Since siRNAs can act as microRNAs and target genes non-specifically through their seed sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref027">27</xref>], we included 4 genes that were potential off-target candidates from Haystack analysis (<italic>PDIK1L</italic>, <italic>SNAP25</italic>, <italic>FOXK1</italic>, <italic>DGAT2L3</italic>). In addition, we included 1 gene based on overlap with ISGs that we previously found as synergistic with ZAP in an overexpression screen (<italic>MAP3K14</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref020">20</xref>]), and 6 genes from pathways that were significantly enriched but were not on the top 91 list (<italic>APC</italic>, <italic>FZD2</italic>, <italic>GFRA1</italic>, <italic>JAK1</italic>, <italic>SP1</italic>, and <italic>WNT8B</italic>).</p>
<p>We re-screened the candidate genes with a library of single siRNAs obtained from a different company (Ambion) to exclude hits that are mediated by off-target effects from further characterization. Knockdown of 5 genes by 6.25 nM siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and knockdown of 13 genes by 25 nM siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) significantly increased SINV Toto1101/Luc replication (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006145.s007">S2 Table</xref> for the entire results).

<title>TRIM25 is a bona fide cofactor of ZAP</title>
<p>Next, we validated the candidate ZAP cofactors in a lower throughput assay.

Since <italic>TRIM25</italic>-targeting siRNA #3 was most efficient at rescuing SINV Toto1101/Luc replication, we designed and tested an additional C911 control. The 9<sup>th</sup> to 11<sup>th</sup> nucleotides of the siRNA were mutated to their complementary sequence, hence the designation C911, to rule out the possibility that the knockdown phenotype was due to the off-target effects of the siRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref030">30</xref>]. The C911 control should lose its siRNA activity but still maintain its off-target effects as a microRNA. While <italic>TRIM25</italic>-targeting siRNA #3 rescued SINV Toto1101/Luc replication by about 1 log compared to the NT control, #3-C911 did not lead to increased viral replication and did not reduce the protein level of TRIM25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), suggesting that the phenotype of siRNA #3 is due to specific silencing of <italic>TRIM25</italic> and not inhibition of an off-target gene.

<title>TRIM25 interacts with ZAP through its SPRY domain</title>
<p>Next, we asked whether TRIM25 physically interacts with ZAP. We infected 293T with endogenous TRIM25 and ZAP expression with SINV, and immunoprecipitated TRIM25 to look for ZAP association at various time points following infection. We found that endogenous ZAP co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous TRIM25 over the course of SINV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). There were less TRIM25 and ZAP proteins present at 24 h p.i., which is consistent with the cytopathic effects observed at that time point, leading to less TRIM25 and ZAP pulldown. Previously, TRIM25 was found to interact with ZAP in the presence of RNA although only ZAPL was investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref008">8</xref>]. To determine the interaction of TRIM25 and different ZAP isoforms, ZAPS or ZAPL, and/or TRIM25 were co-expressed in <italic>ZC3HAV1</italic>-knockout 293T cells, which were harvested for co-immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation of both ZAPS and ZAPL by a monoclonal antibody recognizing the N-terminal portion of human ZAP (NZAP) pulled down TRIM25, although more TRIM25 is associated with ZAPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). TRIM25 was dramatically modified in the presence of ZAPS, evident by the presence in the whole cell lysates (WCL) of a ladder of bands larger than the molecular weight of TRIM25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g004">Fig 4B</xref>; WCL). TRIM25 consists of a RING domain, two B box domains, a coiled coil (CCD) domain, and a SPRY domain. The RING domain encodes the ubiquitin ligase activity while the CCD domain is required for oligomerization of TRIM proteins and the SPRY domain is important for mediating protein interactions and substrate specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref031">31</xref>]. Next, we asked which domain in TRIM25 was responsible for interaction with ZAP. Since more ZAPL associates with TRIM25, we co-expressed similar levels of individual TRIM25 domains with ZAPL and immunoprecipitated ZAPL. We found that the SPRY domain of TRIM25 but not its RING and B box/CCD domains co-immunoprecipitated with ZAPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). These data suggest that both ZAP isoforms form a complex with TRIM25, likely through interaction with the SPRY domain of TRIM25.</p>

<title>Both the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and oligomerization of TRIM25 are required for its functional interaction with ZAP</title>
<p>Since TRIM25 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and has been shown to be important for ubiquitinating RIG-I and upregulating RIG-I-mediated IFN-Î² production, we hypothesized that TRIM25 also ubiquitinates ZAP and/or other proteins that complex with ZAP in order to stimulate ZAPâs antiviral activity. To test this, we targeted <italic>TRIM25</italic> by CRISPR in <italic>ZC3HAV1</italic>-knockout 293T cells to interrogate the functional interaction between ZAP isoforms and TRIM25. CRISPR targeting led to either in-frame deletions in all three chromosomal copies of <italic>TRIM25</italic> (clone D) or frameshift insertions in two chromosomal copies and an in-frame deletion in one (clone F), consistent with the almost undetectable protein expression of TRIM25 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006145.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Clones D and F are designated TRIM25<sup>lo</sup>. Clone E is wild type and has similar TRIM25 protein expression as the parental <italic>ZC3HAV1</italic>-knockout 293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006145.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Both TRIM25<sup>lo</sup> clones (D and F) were tested in the subsequent experiments and showed similar results. We transfected TRIM25<sup>lo</sup> cells with ZAP-expressing constructs and infected them with SINV Toto1101/Luc. TRIM25 knockdown significantly enhanced SINV Toto1101/Luc replication in the presence of ZAPS and ZAPL overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Furthermore, we co-transfected TRIM25<sup>lo</sup> cells with TRIM25- and ZAP-expressing constructs to determine the antiviral effect of the different TRIM25 and ZAP combinations. FL TRIM25 alone inhibited SINV replication, likely due to overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). We found that FL TRIM25 enhanced the activity of ZAPS more than the RING- and CCD-deficient TRIM25 mutants at both high MOI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) and low MOI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006145.s003">S3A Fig</xref>), in the context of similar expression levels of FL and mutant TRIM25 proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006145.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). This data suggests that both the E3 ligase activity and oligomerization of TRIM25 are important for the activation of ZAP. However, FL TRIM25 does not significantly enhance SINV inhibition by ZAPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g005">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006145.s003">S3A Fig</xref>), which hints at potential isoform-specific differences in the ZAP-TRIM25 synergy.</p>

<title>TRIM25 mediates ubiquitination of ZAPS and ZAPL</title>
<p>Since the E3 ligase-defective TRIM25 (ÎRING) failed to stimulate the activity of ZAPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), we hypothesized that TRIM25 might act by ubiquitinating ZAP and/or other host proteins. First, we asked whether ZAP is ubiquitinated. 293T cells transfected with a construct expressing HA-tagged ubiquitin were lysed under denaturing conditions to disrupt protein-protein interactions, and endogenous ZAP was immunoprecipitated with an anti-ZAP polyclonal antibody and probed with an anti-HA antibody. A control anti-GFP antibody of the same species as the anti-ZAP antibody was used to check for non-specific pulldown. We found that ZAP was modified by ubiquitination at baseline and upon SINV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). When ZAPS and ZAPL were overexpressed in the <italic>ZC3HAV1</italic>-knockout 293T cells in the presence of HA-tagged ubiquitin and subject to immunoprecipitation, both ZAP isoforms were found to be modified by ubiquitin, suggesting that the modified lysine(s) are likely shared by both isoforms and located in ZAPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). However, ZAPL is more polyubiquitinated than ZAPS, which hints to additional ubiquitination sites in the PARP-like domain. In addition, we asked whether TRIM25 is implicated in the ubiquitination of ZAP and determined the effect of both endogenous and overexpressed TRIM25 on ZAP ubiquitination level. Both ZAPS and ZAPL ubiquitination in the TRIM25<sup>lo</sup> cells was reduced compared to that in the parental TRIM25 sufficient <italic>ZC3HAV1</italic>-knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Consistent with that, overexpressed TRIM25 dramatically increased the level of modification of ZAP isoforms by both endogenous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g006">Fig 6D</xref>) and overexpressed ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Furthermore, we determined which linkage type of polyubiquitin TRIM25 induces on ZAP by overexpressing ubiquitin mutants, in which all the lysine residues are mutated except for K48 or K63. We immunoprecipitated ZAP isoforms that were co-expressed with TRIM25, and HA-tagged wild type or mutant (K48, K63) ubiquitin, and found that both ZAPS and ZAPL were ubiquitinated by both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). Together, these data suggest that TRIM25 is responsible for ZAP modification.</p>

<p>Next, the lysine residues in ZAPS that were predicted to be ubiquitinated with medium to high confidence by UbPred and CKSAAP_UbSite were changed to arginine residues individually (K226R, K296R, K314R, K401R, K416R, K448R, and K629R) or in combination (K296R/K448R, 7UbÎ) to determine whether potential ubiquitination at any of these sites affects ZAPâs antiviral activity. Moreover, a previous study, in which a global approach was taken to identify all the ubiquitinated proteins in the cell, reported a tryptic peptide with a ubiquitinated lysine in ZAPL (EEGK<sub>783</sub>(glygly)LLFYATSR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref032">32</xref>]. We confirmed that this residue is ubiquitinated using a targeted mass spectrometry approach and the lysine was mutated to arginine in ZAPL (K783R). When we co-expressed the panel of ZAP ubiquitination site mutants with TRIM25 and immunoprecipitated ZAP to determine the level of modification, we found that the mutations diminished the level of ZAP ubiquitination to various degrees (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006145.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). Most importantly, introduction of all 7 mutations at the same time almost completely abrogated ZAP ubiquitination (refer to âS 7UbÎâ in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006145.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). However, the ZAPS 7UbÎ mutant was still capable of inhibiting SINV replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006145.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Our data suggests that TRIM25 upregulates ZAPâs antiviral function not by modifying ZAP, but potentially other host factors.</p>
<p>It is possible that ZAP changes the interactome of TRIM25, which ubiquitinates and functionally modulates these interacting partners resulting in an antiviral state. To test this hypothesis, we co-immunoprecipitated TRIM25 in the absence or presence of ZAPS, of which the antiviral activity was more affected by the E3 ligase function of TRIM25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), and identified by mass spectrometry proteins that interacted significantly more or less with TRIM25 upon ZAPS expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006145.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). We found that most of these ZAP-mediated TRIM25 interacting partners are involved in mRNA metabolism and translation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006145.s008">S3 Table</xref>), which are cellular processes known to be affected by ZAP. However, the change in abundance of most of these proteins is not dramatic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006145.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), suggesting that the ZAP-mediated effects on TRIM25 targets might lie in their ubiquitination status. Taken together, we have shown that TRIM25 ubiquitinates ZAP, and that ZAP changes the interactions of TRIM25 with other host proteins that might contribute to the antiviral effects of the ZAP-TRIM25 synergy. Further work is required to determine whether these TRIM25 interacting partners are ubiquitinated and the functional consequences of their modification by TRIM25.</p>

<title>TRIM25 plays a critical role in ZAP inhibition of viral translation</title>
<p>In order to further elucidate the mechanism by which TRIM25 synergizes with ZAP, we investigated the effects of TRIM25 on different ZAP activities that were previously reported (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref015">15</xref>]).

Since the antiviral mechanisms of ZAP include targeting of viral RNAs for degradation by the exosome complex and translational inhibition, we measured the level of SINV RNA and translation of the incoming viral genome over the course of infection. We found that the kinetics of viral RNA degradation was similar in the presence or absence of TRIM25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). However, ZAPâs ability to block SINV translation was significantly reduced by about 1 log in the absence of TRIM25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g007">Fig 7B</xref>; two-way ANOVA: p&lt;0.0001), mirroring the magnitude of SINV inhibition upon TRIM25 knockdown in the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). This data suggests that the mechanism by which TRIM25 enhances ZAP activity is through viral translational inhibition.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We reported in this study that ZAP requires multiple host factors for its maximal antiviral activity. We identified novel partners of ZAP that are normally important for a range of cellular processes, such as membrane ion permeability, innate immune signaling, and post-translational protein modification. Among the hits, JAK1 is a kinase important for signaling of the type I IFN receptor and can potentially act by augmenting the stimulatory effects of ZAP on the RIG-I pathway. On the other hand, KCNH5 is an outward rectifying potassium channel and it is not clear how it can stimulate ZAPâs function. It has been shown that reduction of the intracellular K+ concentration can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, linking ion efflux to innate immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref033">33</xref>]. It is interesting to note that known interacting partners of ZAP, such as RIG-I or components of the exosome complex, were not hits in the screen, although that is likely largely dependent on the type of assay used and the basal expression levels of genes that are knocked down. Moreover, although MAP3K14 was previously found to be synergistic with ZAP in an ISG overexpression screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref020">20</xref>], it was not a hit in our confirmatory screen. It is likely that synergistic effects are less pronounced in our screen where endogenous levels of proteins are being interrogated and the effect from silencing of one gene might be compensated by a homologous gene or another ZAP partner.</p>
<p>Our study shows for the first time that both ZAP isoforms are ubiquitinated, adding to the existing body of work on post-translational modifications of ZAP. Previous studies have shown that in addition to being post-translationally modified itself, ZAP is implicated in the modifications of other cellular and viral proteins. In some of these cases the modification regulates the function of ZAP or other proteins. For example, the C-terminal end of ZAPL is prenylated, and mutation of this prenylation site reduces the anti-SINV activity of ZAPL to a level similar to that of ZAPS, which is normally not prenylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref012">12</xref>]. It is possible that prenylation positions ZAPL in membrane compartments, allowing it to target viruses with an endocytic life cycle step. In addition, phosphorylation of ZAP by glycogen synthase kinase 3Î² positively modulates ZAP activity potentially by enhancing its ability to inhibit mRNA translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref034">34</xref>]. Moreover, when cells are stressed, ZAP localizes to cytoplasmic stress granules and is modified by poly-ADP-ribosylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref035">35</xref>]. Modified ZAP is implicated in the poly-ADP-ribosylation of Ago2, which correlates with derepression of miRNA-mediated translational silencing of cellular transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref035">35</xref>]. In particular, derepression of ISG transcripts results in viral inhibition, as demonstrated for HSV-1 and influenza A virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref013">13</xref>]. ZAP, specifically the long isoform, is also implicated in the poly-ADP-ribosylation and ubiquitination of influenza viral PB2 and PA polymerase proteins and their subsequent degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref036">36</xref>]. Interestingly, another study reports that ZAPS inhibits influenza protein expression and is antagonized by the viral NS1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref037">37</xref>]. A NS1 mutant that lacks the ability to suppress the E3 ligase activity of TRIM25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref038">38</xref>] also loses the ability to antagonize ZAPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref037">37</xref>], suggesting that ZAPS could inhibit influenza virus through a mechanism that requires TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination, which is antagonized by NS1.</p>
<p>Although we clearly demonstrate here that TRIM25 is implicated in ZAP modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g006">Fig 6Câ6F</xref>), mutagenesis of ZAP ubiquitination sites does not impact its antiviral function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006145.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). One plausible explanation is that the E3 ligase activity of TRIM25 enhances ZAP function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) by ubiquitinating other host factors. It is likely that ZAP affects the interactions of TRIM25 with other proteins, resulting in changes of their modification and function and hence remodeling of the antiviral proteome in the cell. Since ZAP and TRIM25 synergize to block viral translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), it is intriguing yet not unexpected to find that most of the TRIM25 interacting partners affected by ZAP are involved in mRNA metabolism and translation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006145.s008">S3 Table</xref>). Future work determining the ubiquitination status of these proteins will shed light on the impact of TRIM25 E3 ligase activity on the antiviral effects of ZAP.</p>
<p>Alternatively, TRIM25 and ZAPS can synergize to positively modulate the activity of RIG-I, leading to heightened innate immune signaling. About half of the TRIM family members have been shown to enhance innate immune responses and both ZAPS and TRIM25 physically interact with RIG-I to stimulate type I IFN response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref039">39</xref>]. However, whether there is a requirement for RIG-I in ZAP function and vice versa are not settled. Inhibition of the RIG-I pathway and knockdown of RIG-I fail to abrogate ZAP-mediated HBV and XMRV inhibition, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref007">7</xref>]. Furthermore, RIG-I-dependent production of type I IFN and cytokines are not reduced in ZAP-deficient primary mouse cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref040">40</xref>]. Hence, the contribution of TRIM25 and ZAP synergy to innate immunity warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>Our data also suggest differences in the interaction between TRIM25 and ZAPS and ZAPL, consistent with previous studies demonstrating distinct activities for the ZAP isoforms. TRIM25 was dramatically modified in the presence of ZAPS, although these modified forms were not associated with ZAPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). On the other hand, ZAPL expression did not result in extensive modification of TRIM25 and more TRIM25 was found to associate with ZAPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). This suggests that in addition to the shared domains in ZAPS and ZAPL, ZAPL might interact with TRIM25 through its PARP-like domain. These observations argue that ZAP interacts primarily with unmodified TRIM25, although the expression of the ZAP isoforms differentially regulates TRIM25 post-translational modification. Based on these observations, we postulate that ZAP might affect the ubiquitination status of TRIM25 and as a result modulate the innate immune response. It has been shown that ubiquitin-specific peptidase 15 deubiquitinates TRIM25, leading to its stabilization and sustained RIG-I signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref041">41</xref>]. However, when we performed mass spectrometry on the immunoprecipitates of TRIM25, we did not see a significant increase in ubiquitinated TRIM25 peptides in the presence of overexpressed ZAPS. It is possible that the increased modification of TRIM25 is due to something other than ubiquitin. Future studies are needed to determine the impact of ZAP isoforms on post-translational modification of TRIM25. In addition, even though endogenous TRIM25 is required for the function of both ZAPS and ZAPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), overexpressed TRIM25 stimulates the antiviral activity of ZAPS to a greater extent than that of ZAPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006145.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), which is likely due to ZAPLâs greater baseline inhibitory effect compared to ZAPS in the absence of TRIM25.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study has uncovered a novel requirement for TRIM25 in ZAP function and elucidated the mechanism of this synergy. Recent outbreaks, such as chikungunya virus (Alphavirus) in the Caribbean and U.S., Ebola virus (Filovirus) in West Africa, and Zika virus (Flavivirus) in South and Central America, prompts the development of therapeutic strategies for disruption of crucial virus-host interactions. Given that the replication of these viruses greatly depend on the host factor repertoire of the target cells, our study is highly relevant and advances our understanding of host factor contributions to innate immune responses.</p>

To generate the T-REx-hZAP cell line, the short isoform of human <italic>ZC3HAV1</italic> was amplified from the ATCC clone 7521231 (deposited by The I.M.A.G.E. Consortium) and restriction sites HindIII and SacII were added using primers (5â-GGGAAGCTTGCCACCATGGCGGACCCGGAGGTGTGCTGCTTC-3â and 5â-GCGGATCCGCGGCTCTGGCCCTCTCTTCATCTGCTGCAC-3â). The HindIII/SacII digested PCR product was then cloned into pcDNA4/TO/myc-hisB to generate pcDNA4/TO/hZAP-myc-hisB. We stably transfected T-REx-293 cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with pcDNA4/TO/hZAP-myc-hisB and selected for Zeocin resistance. A single clone with good induction of hZAP expression (6C5) was selected and expanded. T-REx-rZAPC88R and T-REx-hZAP were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Mediumâ (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5 Î¼g/ml blasticidin, and 200 Î¼g/ml Zeocin. <italic>ZC3HAV1</italic>-knockout 293T (clone 89) was obtained from Dr. Akinori Takaoka at Hokkaido University [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref014">14</xref>].

<title>Genome-wide siRNA screen</title>
<p>For the primary ZAP cofactor screen, siRNAs from the siGENOME library targeting the whole human genome (Dharmacon; pools of 4 siRNAs per gene) were pre-arrayed in fifty-eight 384-well plates, mixed with DharmaFECT 1 Transfection Reagent (diluted 1:100), and transferred to 384-well assay plates (5 Î¼l/well; 25 nM final) with a Janus automated workstation (PerkinElmer). The entire screen was carried out in triplicate by reverse transfection. siGENOME NT and <italic>ZC3HAV1</italic>-targeting siRNA smartpools were used as negative and positive controls (5 wells per control per plate; see the position of the controls in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006145.s006">S1 Table</xref>). A total of 7500 T-REx-hZAP cells were seeded in DMEM with 3% FBS, 5 Î¼g/ml blasticidin, and 200 Î¼g/ml Zeocin (25 Î¼l/well) with a MultiDrop Combi liquid dispenser (Thermo Fisher Scientific). One day post-plating, ZAP expression was induced by addition of 1 Î¼g/ml doxycycline (5 Î¼l/well). Since removing the media from 384-well plates and adding virus inoculum in a minimal volume to allow adsorption was not feasible, cells were infected with a highly concentrated PEG-precipitated SINV stock at a MOI of ~200 (5 Î¼l/well) two days following siRNA treatment. The MOI was calculated based on titration of the viral stock under standard infection conditions, and due to dilution was likely much lower under the conditions used in the screen. Twenty-four hours p.i., cells were lysed with Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay Substrate (Promega; 20 Î¼l/well) and luminescence measured on an EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer). For each well, the raw luciferase value reflects the level of SINV infection. The raw luciferase values and the plate median from each of the 384-well plates were used to calculate the median absolute deviation (MAD): 1.4826 x MEDIAN (each raw value â plate median). The robust Z score was then calculated by dividing the difference between each raw luciferase value and the plate median by MAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref026">26</xref>]. Normalized percent activation (NPA) was also calculated for each well as follows: 100*(X<sub>i</sub>âÎ¼<sub>c-</sub>)/(Î¼<sub>c+</sub>âÎ¼<sub>c-</sub>), where X<sub>i</sub> = raw luciferase value, Î¼<sub>c+</sub> = mean positive controls and Î¼<sub>c-</sub> = mean negative controls. The entire screen was performed in triplicate and the Z' and strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) were calculated for every plate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref026">26</xref>]. A Z' factor of &gt;0.5 and a SSMD of &gt;3 were used as cutoffs for assay validation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref049">49</xref>]. Those wells with the highest NPA and robust Z score &gt;3 in all three replicates were considered âhitsâ.</p>
<p>For the secondary screen, Silencer siRNAs (Ambion; 3 individual siRNAs per gene) were tested in 384-well plates in triplicate at two different concentrations: 6.25 nM (the concentration of each single siRNAs in the original Dharmacon pools) and 25 nM (the concentration of the original Dharmacon pools used in the primary screen). In order to rule out ZAP-independent effects of the top hits, the secondary screen was carried out in two different cells lines: T-REx-hZAP and T-REx-rZAPC88R. Genes with an average Z score of &gt;3 for at least two out of the three siRNA sequences were considered âhitsâ.</p>

<p>Total RNA was isolated from siRNA-treated cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). 1 Î¼g of input RNA was used as a template for reverse transcription using SuperScript III (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and random hexamers. RT-qPCR was performed using 5 Î¼l of 10-fold-diluted cDNA and primers targeting JAK1 (5â-CCACTACCGGATGAGGTTCTA-3â and 5â-GGGTCTCGAATAGGAGCCAG-3â), KCNH5 (5â-CCGTGTGGCTAGGAAACTGG-3â and 5â-CAATGACCTCGTAGTCTCCGA-3â), and RPS11 (5â-GCCGAGACTATCTGCACTAC-3â and 5â-ATGTCCAGCCTCAGAACTTC-3â [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref053">53</xref>]) in a SYBR Green qPCR assay on the LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN). qPCR conditions were as follows; initial denaturation step at 50Â°C for 2 min and 95Â°C for 10 min, then 45 cycles of 95Â°C for 15 sec, 56Â°C for 15 sec, and 72Â°C for 20 sec, and followed by a melting step of 95Â°C for 10s, 65Â°C for 10s and a 0.07Â°C/s decrease from 95Â°C, and a cooling step of 50Â°C for 5s. Transcript levels of JAK1 and KCNH5 were determined by normalizing the target transcript CT value to the CT value of the endogenous housekeeping RPS11 transcript. This normalized value was used to calculate the fold change relative to the average of cells treated with the NT siRNA control (CT method).</p>
<p>To determine SINV RNA levels in <italic>TRIM25</italic>-targeting or NT siRNA treated T-REx-hZAP cells over the course of infection with Toto1101/Luc:ts6, 1 Î¼g of total cellular RNA was used in a one-step quantitative real-time PCR assay using primers and a Taqman probe targeting the nsP2 region of SINV. Primer pairs for SINV Taqman RT-qPCR are as follows: SINV nsP2 (forward): 5â-GGTAGCTCATTGGGACAACA-3â; SINV nsP2 (reverse): 5â-GCTGGAACACCGGAAATCTA-3â; SINV nsP2 Taqman probe (reverse): 5â-TGGCGTGATCGTACCCATACTTGC-3â. RNA was amplified using Lightcycler 480 RNA Master Hydrolysis Probes (Roche) under the following thermal conditions: RT at 63Â°C for 3 min; denaturation at 95Â°C for 30 s; 45 cycles of amplification at 95Â°C for 15 s, 60Â°C for 30 s, and 72Â°C for 1 s; and a final cooling step at 40Â°C for 10 s. Viral RNA copy number at each time point p.i. was then determined by comparing the threshold cycle (CT) value to a standard curve of serial 10-fold dilutions of purified <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed SINV RNA.

Cells were harvested at 6â8 h p.i. and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for flow cytometry analysis. Data was acquired using a BD LSRII and FACS Diva software (version 8.0) and analyzed using FlowJo 8.8.7 (TreeStar Inc.). Percent infected (GFP+) cells in the transduced (RFP+ or RFP-tagged ZAP+) population was calculated for ZAPS, ZAPL and their mutants.</p>

<title>Mass spectrometry (MS)</title>
<p>For the ZAP ubiquitination experiment, based on alignment of the ZAP IP Western Blot, SDS-PAGE gel bands corresponding to ZAP were excised and trypsinized as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref054">54</xref>]. For the co-immunoprecipitation experiment, TRIM25 and associated proteins were co-immunoprecipitated and eluted from anti-V5 antibody-crosslinked M-270 Epoxy Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using 8M Urea (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), reduced, alkylated and digested with Endopeptidase Lys-C (&gt;4M Urea) for 6 hours followed by overnight trypsinization (&gt;2M Urea).</p>
<p>Peptides were analyzed by reversed phase nano LC-MS/MS (Ultimate 3000 nano-HPLC system coupled to a Q-Exactive Plusor a Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer, operated in high/low mode, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Known (EEGK<sub>783</sub>(glygly)LLFYATSR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref032">32</xref>]) and predicted ubiquitinated ZAP peptides were analyzed by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref055">55</xref>] while data dependent acquisition (DDA) was used for unknown ZAP ubiquitination sites. Peptides generated from the co-immunoprecipitation experiment were analyzed in DDA mode. All peptides were separated on a C18 column (12 cm / 75 Î¼m, 3 Î¼m beads, Nikkyo Tecnologies) at 300 nl/min with a gradient increasing from 2% Buffer B/98% buffer A to 40% buffer B/60% Buffer A in 37 min or 80 min (buffer A: 0.1% formic acid, buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile).</p>
<p>For data analysis, ubiquitination focused DDA data was extracted and queried against UniProts complete human proteome database (March 2016) concatenated with common contaminants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref056">56</xref>] using Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific)/MASCOT 2.5.1 (Matrix Science). Protein N-terminal acetylation, oxidation of methionine, and di-glycine modification of lysine were allowed as variable modifications. In cases where proteins were reduced (DTT) and alkylated (iodoacetaminde), carbamidomethylation was included as a variable modification of cysteines and lysines. 10 ppm and 20 mDa were used as mass accuracy for precursors and fragment ions, respectively. Matched peptides were filtered using 1% False Discovery Rate calculated by Percolator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006145.ref057">57</xref>] and in addition requiring that a peptide was matched as rank 1 and that precursor mass accuracy was better than 5 ppm. Data from the co-immunoprecipitation experiment, in biological triplicates, was analyzed by MaxQuant v.1.5.3.28 using match between runs. Search criteria similar to above were used. Fold differences were calculated based on label-free quantification (LFQ) values (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24942700" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24942700</ext-link>) while intensity-based absolute quantitation (iBAQ) values (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21593866" xlink:type="simple">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21593866</ext-link>) were used to estimate abundance of different proteins.
