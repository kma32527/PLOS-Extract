<abstract>
<p>Mucorales are an emerging group of human pathogens that are responsible for the lethal disease mucormycosis. Unfortunately, functional studies on the genetic factors behind the virulence of these organisms are hampered by their limited genetic tractability, since they are reluctant to classical genetic tools like transposable elements or gene mapping. Here, we describe an RNAi-based functional genomic platform that allows the identification of new virulence factors through a forward genetic approach firstly described in Mucorales. This platform contains a whole-genome collection of <italic>Mucor circinelloides</italic> silenced transformants that presented a broad assortment of phenotypes related to the main physiological processes in fungi, including virulence, hyphae morphology, mycelial and yeast growth, carotenogenesis and asexual sporulation. Selection of transformants with reduced virulence allowed the identification of <italic>mcplD</italic>, which encodes a Phospholipase D, and <italic>mcmyo5</italic>, encoding a probably essential cargo transporter of the Myosin V family, as required for a fully virulent phenotype of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic>. Knock-out mutants for those genes showed reduced virulence in both <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic> models, probably due to a delayed germination and polarized growth within macrophages. This study provides a robust approach to study virulence in Mucorales and as a proof of concept identified new virulence determinants in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> that could represent promising targets for future antifungal therapies.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Mucormycosis is an infectious disease caused by organisms of the order Mucorales. It is a lethal infection that is raising the alarm in the medical and scientific community due to its high mortality rates, unusual antifungal drug resistance and its emerging character. Among the reasons explaining the nescience about this disease is the lack of knowledge on the biology of the organisms that cause mucormycosis, which is encouraged by the reluctance of these species to genetic studies. In this work, we have developed an RNAi-based functional genomic platform to study virulence in Mucorales. It is a powerful tool available for the scientific community that will contribute to solve the reluctance of Mucorales to genetic studies and will help to understand the genetic basis of virulence in these organisms. Secondly, and as a proof of concept, we have used this genetic tool to identify two new virulence determinants in <italic>Mucor circinelloides</italic>. Lack of function of these determinants delays germination and growth of spores, conceding time to macrophages for the inactivation of the pathogen. The two genes identified, <italic>mcplD</italic> and <italic>mcmyo5</italic>, represent promising targets for future development of new antifungal therapies against mucormycosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mucormycosis is a fungal infection caused by species of the order Mucorales that represents the third most common angio-invasive fungal infection after candidiasis and aspergillosis. Due to the unusual antifungal drug resistance of Mucorales, mucormycosis is considered one of the most important medical complications in immunocompromised patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref001">1</xref>]. Among current antifungal drugs, fluconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole and itraconazole are potent agents of choice used in aspergillosis and candidiasis that, unfortunately, present poor activity against mucormycosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref002">2</xref>]. More specifically, amphotericin B, an old-known macrolide antifungal compound with severe adverse effects, and more recently isavuconazole are used against mucormycosis although they only achieve partial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref005">5</xref>]. As a consequence of this lack of efficient antifungal drugs, mortality rates of mucormycosis remain higher than 50% and reach up to 90% in disseminated infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref007">7</xref>]. Another negative aspect of mucormycosis is its emerging condition. Only a few years ago, mucormycosis was considered a rare infection limited to immunocompromised patients suffering diabetes, organ transplant or other diseases associated with immunosuppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref008">8</xref>]. However, the current improvement in the diagnostic techniques has revealed an alarming number of mucormycosis cases in immunocompetent patients that have severe trauma (e.g. burn patients, traumatic injuries), since it is now rarely misdiagnosed as aspergillosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref009">9</xref>]. Thus, the isolation of new strains that are capable of infecting healthy individuals and the increasing number of reported cases have raised the alarm on this emerging disease. Together, the lack of effective treatments and the emerging character of this devastating disease are urgently demanding new strategies to prevent and/or treat mucormycosis.</p>
<p>The development of therapies to treat mucormycosis is restricted by the lack of knowledge about the disease and the organisms that cause the infection. One of the main reason explaining the scarce information about mucormycosis is the high reluctance of Mucorales to modern molecular genetics techniques. Among Mucorales, <italic>Rhizopus oryzae</italic> and <italic>Mucor circinelloides</italic> are two study models in which genetic transformation is available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref011">11</xref>]. Study of pathogenesis in these two models has revealed iron uptake, spore size, spore coat proteins and dimorphism as virulence determinants in mucormycosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref018">18</xref>]. In <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic>, along with genetic transformation, the application of molecular tools has allowed the dissection of its RNAi mechanism, which has become a useful tool for functional genetics in this fungus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref022">22</xref>]. Besides its applications as a genetic tool, the RNAi mechanism of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> has a regulatory role that controls complex physiological processes such as growth, sexual and asexual sporulation and death by autolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref027">27</xref>]. Moreover, the extensive study of the RNAi mechanism in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> led to the discovery of the first link between this endogenous regulatory mechanism and the unusual antifungal drug resistance of Mucorales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref028">28</xref>]. This novel mechanism generates spontaneous resistance to the antifungal drug FK506 by epigenetic RNAi-mediated post-transcriptional silencing of the <italic>fkbA</italic> gene encoding the protein FKBP12, which is the natural target of FK506. As a result, the lack of target blocks the action of FK506 and the fungus becomes resistant to this drug, suggesting that similar mechanisms could be behind of the exacerbated resistance to antifungal drugs in Mucorales.</p>
<p>The limited knowledge about Mucorales, mainly due to the phylogenetic distance and genetic differences of these basal fungi with other well-known fungi like Ascomycota and Basidiomycota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref029">29</xref>], together with the low efficiency of the current antifungal drugs, makes it urgent the development of novel strategies to study this group of organisms and, more specifically, the finding of new virulence determinants that could become future antifungal drug targets in Mucorales. Consequently, the main purpose of this work has been the establishment of a functional genomic approach based on the RNAi mechanism of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> to select phenotypes relevant for the biology of Mucorales and related to virulence, and subsequently to identify the genes responsible for these phenotypes. RNAi has been used as a powerful reverse genetic tool to develop functional whole-genome studies in many organisms, including worms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref030">30</xref>], flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref031">31</xref>] and mammal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref032">32</xref>]. In these reverse genetic approaches, a defined library is laboriously constructed by designing a silencing vector for each annotated gene of the studied organism. In these studies, the model organism requires an easy transformation method ready to be arrayed in large-scale assays in which each silencing vector/molecule is individually delivered. Unfortunately, this is not the case of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> or any other emerging Mucoral. These inconveniences have led us to design a different approach that uses RNAi as a forward genetic tool in which a library representing <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> whole genome was constructed in a vector that silenced the cloned inserts. Transformation with this silencing library generated a collection of silenced transformants ready for phenotype screenings in a similar way as in classic chemical or insertional mutagenesis approaches. This transformant collection and the silencing library represent a new genetic tool in Mucorales for forward genetics and functional analysis at whole genome level. Using this approach we have isolated phenotypes related to virulence leading to the identification of two new virulence determinants in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic>, the enzyme Phospholipase D (PLD) and a Myosin 5 (Myo5) motor protein, which are required for full virulence in <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic> host models. Overall, this work illustrates a new approach to study virulence in Mucorales at the whole genome level.</p>

<p>A vector capable of inducing RNAi from any random DNA fragment was designed previously to the construction of the gDNA library for phenotypic screening based on RNAi. RNAi can be triggered in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> by using self-replicative plasmids containing either complete or fragmented genes with their own promoters, obtaining silencing frequencies ranging between 3% and 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref021">21</xref>]. However, highest silencing frequencies (nearly 95%) can be achieved when the plasmid contains a strong promoter and hairpin structures that directly transcribe dsRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref022">22</xref>]. To circumvent the limitations of constructing a hairpin producing vector for each gene of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> genome, we designed a high-throughput silencing vector (pMAT1700) with two convergent promoters and no terminator sequences that are flanking a multiple cloning site (MCS) in which random gDNA fragments can be cloned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In addition, a sequence of 0.5 kb of <italic>carB</italic> gene was cloned next to the MCS to be used as a reporter of silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). This gene encodes a phytoene dehydrogenase involved in the production of β-carotene, a pigment responsible for the typical yellow color of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref033">33</xref>]. Triggering of RNAi after transformation by plasmids containing this reporter produces albino transformants that are easily detectable and also signalize silencing of any other sequence cloned next to it. Fragments of 0.5–4 kb were isolated from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> gDNA partially digested with <italic>Sau3A</italic> and filled in with dGTP-dATP to avoid self-ligation. The genomic fragments thus obtained were ligated with vector pMAT1700 digested with <italic>XhoI</italic> and filled in with dCTP-dTTP to make their ends compatible with <italic>Sau3</italic>A filled fragments and avoid self-ligation, thus favoring the frequency of recombinant clones in the library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref034">34</xref>]. Ligation mixtures were introduced into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells to generate the genome-wide RNAi library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) consisting in roughly 83,000 clones, which determined a confidence level higher than 99%. Pooled plasmids were directly purified from the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> colonies and used to transform <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> MU402 (<italic>pyrG</italic><sup>-</sup> and <italic>leuA</italic><sup>-</sup>) strain. The empty vector pMAT1700 and a version of this vector lacking the <italic>carB</italic> fragment (pMAT1701) were used as controls to monitor silencing efficiency. Up to sixty transformations following this approach were required to obtain a collection of 51,657 silenced transformants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s008">S1 Table</xref>), which ensured a 95% confidence level. Comparison of silencing frequencies obtained with the empty vector and the high-throughput silencing library showed a pronounced increase of <italic>carB</italic> silenced transformants among those obtained with the library (87%) relative to the empty plasmid pMAT1700 (43%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s008">S1 Table</xref>). As expected, the plasmid pMAT1701 did not trigger silencing in any of the transformants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s008">S1 Table</xref>). The increase in silencing frequency among transformants obtained with the library could be explained if the 0.5 kb fragment of <italic>carB</italic> gene that is cloned between the two promoters was not long enough in the empty plasmid to allow efficient convergent transcription from both promoters. Nevertheless, once the convergent cassette assimilates new fragments in the library, the silencing efficiency increases close to the maximum previously observed with hairpin triggering molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref022">22</xref>]. These results demonstrated a high silencing efficiency of our high-throughput library in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic>.</p>

<title>Selection of avirulent phenotypes</title>
<p>The main purpose of generating a high-throughput functional genomic tool in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> was to use it as a new approach to find unknown virulence determinants in Mucorales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In order to find candidate genes involved in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> pathogenesis, we focused the screening of silenced strains on abnormal growth and morphology, since those aspects of fungal physiology have been related to pathogenesis in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> and other fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref035">35</xref>]. Special attention was paid to transformants growing as yeast-like colonies and showing altered dimorphism and strong reduction of the growth rate, as it is one of the few processes previously associated with virulence in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref013">13</xref>]. Plates from the transformations with the silencing library were directly screened for abnormal phenotypes (51,657 silenced transformants), resulting in the selection of fifteen transformants with different abnormalities. Later, the transformation plates were further incubated and vegetative spores were pooled together to obtain the collection of silenced spores harboring the high-throughput silencing library described in the previous section. A total of 1x10<sup>4</sup> viable spores from this collection were grown in new plates for a second screening, resulting in the selection of eleven abnormal candidates. In addition, the second screening confirmed that silencing is maintained in the collection of silenced spores, since the frequency of silenced colonies (79±4% of albino colonies) was similar to the previously described in the original transformants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s008">S1 Table</xref>). Growth rate and sporulation efficiency of the twenty six isolated candidates from the two screenings were quantified and classified into five categories based on the different morphological abnormalities that they presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006150.t001">Table 1</xref>). The first category, the most abundant with 16 isolates, presented a <underline>r</underline>educed <underline>g</underline>rowth (RG1-16) compared with control transformants, but wild-type sporulation. Two transformants presenting a <underline>h</underline>ighly <underline>r</underline>educed <underline>g</underline>rowth (HRG1 and HRG2) were included in the second category, as they showed clear differences with the first category, including a reduced vegetative sporulation. The third category comprised five transformants that showed a strong <underline>l</underline>ack of <underline>v</underline>egetative <underline>s</underline>porulation (LVS1-5). In addition to the lack of sporulation, some of these five transformants also presented a reduced growth similar to the first category (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006150.t001">Table 1</xref>). The fourth category contained only one transformant that showed a <underline>y</underline>east-<underline>l</underline>ike <underline>g</underline>rowth (YLG1). This transformant presented the slowest growth, forming small colonies similar to yeasts rather than mycelial colonies. The morphology of YLG1 under the optical microscope also showed strongly deformed cell walls incapable of forming regular filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g002">Fig 2</xref>). These filaments appeared to be septated, although one of the main characteristics of Mucorales is their coenocytic mycelium. This contradictory observation could be explained if this transformant is immersed in a hyphae-yeast transition state in which the tip of the hyphae produces yeast cells that resemble a septated structure before the yeast cells are liberated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g002">Fig 2</xref>, yeast-like growth). The last category included two transformants showing a <underline>s</underline>atellite <underline>g</underline>rowth phenotype (SG1 and SG2). These two transformants grew slower than control transformants, producing long sporangia that bent to the media to form new colonies, acquiring this unusual satellite phenotype in transformation plates at pH 3.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g002">Fig 2</xref>). When SG1 and SG2 were grown in MMC medium at pH 4.5 (a rich medium but selective for uracil auxotrophy, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref036">36</xref>]), they showed reduced growth and sporulation, but not the satellite phenotype. HRG and SG transformants also presented abnormal mycelia under the optical microscope, showing swollen hyphae with abnormal branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Accordingly with the mechanism of silencing previously described in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref021">21</xref>], the twenty six transformants showed a reversible phenotype and they lost the abnormalities when they were grown in a non-selective medium for several vegetative cycles, confirming that the phenotypes were caused by the silencing of some genes harbored in the plasmids.</p>

<title>Candidate gene identification and validation of the silencing phenotypes</title>
<p>The self-replicative nature of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> plasmids used to construct the RNAi libraries facilitates the identification of the silencing sequences responsible for the phenotypes in the selected transformants, since library plasmids are maintained as episomes. Thus, the gDNA sequence present in the silencing plasmids can be identified by PCR amplification and sequenced using oligonucleotides flanking the cloning site. Alternatively, silencing plasmid can be re-cloned in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and sequenced. In order to validate this hypothetical forward genetic approach in Mucorales, five independent transformants (HGR1, HGR2, YLG1, SG1 and SG2) were selected for gene identification and validation of the silencing phenotype. Three transformants (HGR1, HGR2 and YLG1) were selected due to their avirulent phenotype, whereas the transformants presenting the satellite growing phenotype (SG1 and SG2) were selected to demonstrate that genes involved in other physiological processes can also be identified following this approach. Amplifications from gDNA of these five transformants generated PCR products only in YLG1, SG1 and SG2. After purification and sequencing of these PCR products, the DNA sequences were analyzed and compared to the genome database of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> v1.0 and v2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Mucci1/Mucci1.home.html" xlink:type="simple">http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Mucci1/Mucci1.home.html</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Mucci2/Mucci2.home.html" xlink:type="simple">http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Mucci2/Mucci2.home.html</ext-link>, respectively). The two strains sharing the satellite growth phenotype, SG1 and SG2, exhibited both equal size PCR products and DNA sequences, indicating that these two transformants harbored the same plasmid. The analysis of the sequence amplified from this plasmid revealed the presence of three different ORFs: ID 84675 (CLIP-associated proteins (CLASPs), v1.0), ID 156742 (intracellular protein transport, v2.0) and ID 145873 (DNA repair protein RAD51/RHP55, v2.0) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006150.t002">Table 2</xref>). The analysis of the sequence obtained from transformant YLG1 also unveiled a DNA insert containing two different ORFs: ID 51513 (myosin class V heavy chain, v1.0) and ID 166338 (no description in either v1.0 or v2.0). For the analysis of transformants HGR1 and HGR2, plasmid re-cloning in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> was required, revealing that both transformants shared a plasmid with the same insert sequence (pMAT1726). In this case, the sequence of the plasmid insert harbored only one ORF, ID 134906, which encoded a Phospholipase D like protein (v2.0). The analysis of the sequences found in the plasmids of the five selected transformants has been summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006150.t002">Table 2</xref>, which shows that six different candidate genes could be responsible for three selected phenotypes. In order to identify which genes are behind the phenotypes, a silencing validation experiment was performed for each of the six candidate genes. Five new silencing validation plasmids were engineered by cloning a 1 kb fragment of each candidate gene in the MCS of pMAT1700 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006150.t002">Table 2</xref>). After transformation of the recipient wild type strain with these five plasmids and pMAT1726, only three plasmids reproduced the three phenotypes previously observed in the original transformants obtained with the high-throughput silencing libraries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006150.t002">Table 2</xref>). Silencing of gene ID 84678 resulted in the satellite growing phenotype previously observed in the transformants SG1 and SG2, whereas the yeast like growth phenotype of YLG1 was reproduced only by silencing of gene ID 51513. As expected, silencing of the only gene (ID 134906) found in the transformants HRG1 and HRG2 resulted in the highly reduced growth phenotype.</p>

<p>To confirm that the phenotypes obtained after the introduction of plasmids harboring sequences of genes IDs 84675, 51513 and 134906 are due to the lack of function of these genes through a canonical RNAi mechanism, we checked the mRNA levels and the production of siRNAs for the three candidate genes in both the original transformants containing the plasmids from the high-throughput RNAi libraries and the transformants obtained with the validation plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g004">Fig 4</xref>). All transformants for the three genes showed a reduction of mRNA levels and a production of siRNA for the corresponding gene, confirming the expected mechanism of action of the RNAi high-throughput library. These results demonstrated that the RNAi high-throughput library can be used as a new means to perform forward genetics and functional genomics in the study of virulence of Mucorales.</p>

<title>Disruption of genes <italic>mcmyo5</italic> and <italic>mcplD</italic> induces morphological abnormalities and avirulent phenotypes in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic></title>
<p>The approach of RNAi-based functional genomics in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> resulted in the identification of two genes that could be new virulence determinants in Mucorales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The role of these two genes was confirmed through the generation of the corresponding knockout strains and the study of their phenotype and virulence in a heterologous host model. The gene ID 51513 (v2.0) encodes a Myosin class V protein that contains the three characteristic domains of this protein family: a motor domain, the IQ motifs and the cargo-binding globular tail. Thus, the gene encoding <underline><italic>M</italic>. <italic>c</italic></underline><italic>ircinelloides</italic> <underline>Myo</underline>sin <underline>5</underline> was denominated <italic>mcmyo5</italic>. In order of adding more evidence to the identity of <italic>mcmyo5</italic> gene, we performed a detailed phylogenetic analysis that included myosin proteins identified in other fungi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s010">S3 Table</xref>). This analysis revealed that gene <italic>mcmyo5</italic> encodes a myosin protein that is perfectly clustered among other fungal myosin 5 proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). The second gene, ID 134906 (v2.0), encodes a Phospholipase D like protein (accordingly denominated <italic>mcplD</italic>), that contains the characteristic domains (C2, PX, PH), the active site and other functionally important parts of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref037">37</xref>]. Similarly to <italic>mcmyo5</italic>, we performed a detailed phylogenetic analysis that included phospholipase proteins identified in other fungi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s011">S4 Table</xref>). This analysis revealed that gene <italic>mcplD</italic> encodes a phospholipase protein that is perfectly clustered among other fungal phospholipases type D (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). In addition, the gene ID 84675 (v1.0) was also mutated, as mentioned above, to prove that the strategy presented in this work is also valid to study other fungal processes different than virulence, and also as a control to prove that not all growth defects are related to reduced virulence. This gene, named as <italic>mcclasp</italic>, encodes a CLIP-associated protein like (CLASPs), as the CLASP N-terminal domain is the main conserved region, which shares an 87% identity with a hypothetical CLASP protein of <italic>Mucor</italic> <italic>ambiguous</italic>. The disruptions of these three genes were carried out through the construction of knockout vectors designed to replace each candidate gene with <italic>pyrG</italic> gene, which was used as a selective marker (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). These knockout vectors contained an engineered cassette with adjacent regions of the target genes flanking the <italic>pyrG</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s003">S3A Fig</xref>) and were used to transform MU402 strain (<italic>pyrG</italic><sup>-</sup>, <italic>leuA</italic><sup>-</sup>). After transformations, candidates presenting the phenotype previously associated with silencing of each gene were isolated and the disruptions analyzed by Southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). The two transformants selected from <italic>mcplD</italic> disruption (MU466 and MU467) and the transformant selected from <italic>mcclasp</italic> disruption (MU464) only showed the DNA fragments corresponding to the correct integration of the disruption fragment at the corresponding loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s003">S3B Fig</xref>), indicating that they were homokaryons for the mutant allele. In order to confirm the identity of the product encoded by the gene <italic>mcplD</italic>, activity of the enzyme PLD was measured in the mutant <italic>ΔmcplD</italic> and compared to the wild type strain (“Phospholipase D Assay Kit”, from Sigma-Aldrich). This assay showed a significant reduction (p = 0.0017) of PLD activity of almost 30% in the mutant strain, but not a total lack of PLD activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). These results could be explained if there are other proteins with similar activity in the crude extracts of this mutant. Regarding the deletion of <italic>mcmyo5</italic> gene, two transformants showing the yeast-like growth phenotype were selected after transformation with a replacement cassette for the gene <italic>mcmyo5</italic>. One of these transformants, MU468, probably harbored a chromosomal rearrangement at the <italic>mcmyo5</italic> locus, whereas the second one, MU465, showed the correct <italic>pyrG</italic> insertion of 4.1 kb replacing <italic>mcmyo5</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). However, it was impossible to obtain a homokaryotic knockout strain for the gene <italic>mcmyo5</italic>, as the transformant containing the mutant allele maintained some wild type nuclei even after ten vegetative cycles on selective media (3.4 kb fragment in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). These results suggested that <italic>mcmyo5</italic> gene may play an essential role in the viability of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> and a homokaryotic state of the mutant nuclei might be lethal. The heterokaryotic strain containing <italic>mcmyo5</italic> mutant nuclei was named <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup>.</p>
<p>The phenotype of each knockout strain was equivalent to those observed in the silencing transformants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The three mutants showed a reduction of growth and sporulation rates, as well as an increase in the production of β-carotene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g005">Fig 5C, 5D and 5E</xref>, respectively). The accumulation of β-carotene in the three mutants might be due to the growth stress present in these strains, since diverse stress factors have been previously linked to the production of β-carotene in other organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref038">38</xref>]. Regarding virulence, infection assays in <italic>G</italic>. <italic>mellonella</italic> larvae with sporangiospores from mutants <italic>ΔmcplD</italic> and <italic>Δmcclasp</italic>, and yeast cells from mutant <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup>, revealed a significant reduction in virulence of mutants <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup> and <italic>ΔmcplD</italic> but not in <italic>Δmcclasp</italic> (p = 0.0007, p = 0.0002 and p = 0.4420, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), as expected from the results previously obtained with the strains containing silencing vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The moth <italic>G</italic>. <italic>mellonella</italic> is a convenient model to study virulence when numerous candidates have to be tested. However, the immune system of this invertebrate model presents several differences compared to vertebrates, especially with warm blooded animals like mammals. Thus, the avirulent phenotype of mutants <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup> and <italic>ΔmcplD</italic> was tested in a mouse model, where temperature and immune system components and action mechanisms are similar to humans. Yeast cells and spores of mutants <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup> and <italic>ΔmcplD</italic> (respectively) were injected in immunodepressed mice and survival was daily monitored during twenty days after the infection with inocula of both 1x10<sup>5</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) and 1x10<sup>6</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Both inocula generated similar results, confirming the avirulent phenotype of mutant <italic>ΔmcplD</italic> in the murine model with a strong statistical significance (p = 0.0081 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s005">S5A Fig</xref> and p = 0.0065 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). However, although a reduced virulence was also observed for the heterokaryotic strain <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup> compared to the wild type R7B strain, difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.1595 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s005">S5B Fig</xref> and p = 0.0526 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). This was probably due to the long time-course of the virulence assay in mice, since heterokaryotic <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup> cells might segregate to a wild type phenotype by losing mutant nuclei when grown under non-selective conditions. In fact, growing of mutant <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup> in non-selective culture medium gave rise to patches of wild-type phenotypes after few days of incubation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). To test this hypothesis, retrieved CFUs from infected organs of both agonizing mice that showed signs of an imminent death and apparently healthy mice were analyzed in a Southern blot assay that distinguishes between the mutant and wild type genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). Quantification of the proportion of wild type and mutant nuclei in these retrieved CFUs showed correlation between the segregation to wild type genotype and the restitutions of virulence, which supported the role of the gene <italic>mcmyo5</italic> in the pathogenesis of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s006">S6C Fig</xref>). In order of acquiring more insights about the virulence of the strains <italic>ΔmcplD</italic> and <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic>, the fungal burden was quantified in the relevant organs of mice infected with wild type R7B and both mutant strains. Quantification of fungal gDNA on relevant target organs (brain and lung) revealed prevalence of R7B in tissues from mice infected with both yeast and spore forms, showing a more significant presence in lung tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>). In particular, the presence of R7B in lung tissue was higher at day 2 post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g006">Fig 6C</xref>) than at five days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g006">Fig 6D</xref>), indicating a decrease of fungal biomass in mice over time. Such fungal burden decrease was less accentuated on infection with R7B yeasts, suggesting that this fungal form is more persistent in mice during the infection progression. Despite these differences in fungal load, symptoms and mortality rates were similar after infection with R7B spores and yeasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Conversely, a low amount of fungal DNA in mice infected with NRRL3631 and mutant strains <italic>ΔmcplD</italic> and <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic> was detected, even below the limit of detection (0.005 ng) after five days of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>). These results, together with survival outcomes, indicated a greater capacity of R7B strain to infect and invade mice tissues, causing higher mortality rates than the mutants <italic>ΔmcplD</italic> and <italic>Δmcmyo</italic>.</p>

<title>Delayed germination and reduced polar growth as new virulence determinants in mucormycosis</title>
<p>The determinants of virulence in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> have been studied during the initial interaction of spores with macrophages, in which the main factor distinguishing virulent and avirulent strains was the size of the spores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref014">14</xref>]. Therefore, spore and yeast cell sizes of virulent and avirulent strains were determined. The size of yeast cells produced by the avirulent control strain NRRL3631(+) was pronouncedly reduced compared with yeasts produced by virulent control strain R7B(-) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s007">S7B Fig</xref>), in the same manner as occurred with the size of the spores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref014">14</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). However, the sizes of the spores or yeast cells of the mutant strains <italic>ΔmcplD</italic>, <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup> and <italic>Δmcclasp</italic> were not significantly reduced when compared to the virulent strain R7B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006150.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). These results suggested that the reduction of virulence in the strains <italic>ΔmcplD</italic> and <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup> might be due to other factors that are independent of the initial size of the fungal spore or yeast cells. In order to find these factors, the interaction between macrophages and the mutant strains <italic>ΔmcplD</italic> and <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup> was also studied. Spores and yeast cells (from <italic>ΔmcplD</italic> and <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup>, respectively) were co-cultured with the mouse macrophage cell line J774A.1 (ATCC, TIB-67), during four hours. At this time of interaction, all the spore/yeast cells have been phagocytized by macrophages and virulent strains initiate germination and polar growth trying to escape before being inactivated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref014">14</xref>]. Thus, we quantified the germination rate and polarity index (a quotient between cell length and cell width [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref039">39</xref>]) as a measure of virulence of the different strains tested here. A germination delay and a reduced polarity index were observed in mutants <italic>ΔmcplD</italic> and <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup> relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Mutant <italic>ΔmcplD</italic> presented a germination delay and polarity index similar to the avirulent strain NRRL3631, whereas mutant <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup> showed a reduction of the polarity index even more pronounced than the avirulent control strain, as well as a similar germination delay. Mutants grown in absence of macrophages also presented the same delay in germination and polar growth. The knockout strain in the <italic>mcclasp</italic> gene showed a non-significant reduction of the polarity index and no changes in the germination rate when compared to the wild type. As mutant <italic>Δmcclasp</italic> is not affected in virulence, these results highlight the relevance of spore germination and hyphal growth rates within macrophages for <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> virulence.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we have developed a new approach based on RNAi high-throughput libraries that allows the identification of genes responsible for virulence in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic>. This work represents the first application of a functional genomic approach to identify virulence determinants in Mucorales. RNAi-based reverse genetics has allowed successful whole-genome functional studies in animals (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec001">Introduction</xref>), but this technology presents several restrictions in fungi that have prevented its use at whole genome level. Following this reverse genomic approach, the only known study carried out in fungi was firstly reported in a plant pathogen, <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, in which the function of a calcium-signaling family of 37 genes was studied using silencing plasmids for each gene of this family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref040">40</xref>]. Our platform presents an opposite approach in which a collection of phenotypes are generated by transformation with a whole-genome RNAi library and afterward the genes responsible for a particular phenotype are identified. This approach represents the first forward genetic strategy to study gene function at the whole genome level in Mucorales. Following this strategy, a general screening of a collection of silenced <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> transformants led us to the isolation of twenty-six strains showing a wide range of distinct phenotypes in fungal processes such as virulence, growth and sporulation. One advantage of this approach versus traditional chemical or insertional mutagenesis is that essential genes could be isolated, since RNAi usually reduces the expression of the target gene rather than a total inhibition. Another advantage of this RNAi-based functional genomic platform is the possibility of designing conditional screenings. The screenings shown here were performed under non-specific growth conditions, as it was intended to prove the general utility of the platform to apply functional genomics and to show how genes related to virulence can be identified from general screenings. However, the collection of silenced transformants offers the opportunity to carry out specific screenings under particular conditions to select phenotypes related to virulence, such as yeast growth, thermotolerance, protease over-production, etc. Moreover, another attractive advantage of this approach is its exportability to other Mucorales or fungi from different groups like Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, since the only conditions required are the existence of a functional RNAi mechanism and an efficient transformation method, which are both present in many fungal groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>The application of the RNAi-based functional genomic platform has facilitated the identification of the genes <italic>mcplD</italic> as an essential factor to maintain full virulence in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic>, both in a heterologous model like <italic>G</italic>. <italic>mellonella</italic> and a murine host model. Knockout mutants in <italic>mcplD</italic> showed deficient growth accompanied with sporulation reduction and increased production of β-carotene, and more importantly, reduced virulence in the host models <italic>G</italic>. <italic>mellonella</italic> and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic>. The gene <italic>mcplD</italic> codes for a Phospholipase D enzyme (PLD), a well-known protein that is highly conserved in different organisms. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond of glycerophospholipids to generate phosphatidic acid and a free headgroup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref037">37</xref>]. Phosphatidic acid functions as an intracellular lipid messenger that activates different target kinases, which in turn activate a broad range of cellular processes such as receptor signaling, control of intracellular membrane transport, and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref037">37</xref>]. This pleiotropic function of PLD could explain the complex phenotype observed in the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> mutant for the <italic>mcplD</italic> gene. In addition, PLD has been described as a major virulence factor in <italic>Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis</italic>, being involved in macrophage death and systemic dissemination of this pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref042">42</xref>]. In fungi, <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> PLD regulates its internalization into lung epithelial cells, and the <italic>pld</italic> gene of <italic>Purpureocillium lilacinum</italic> is significantly up-regulated during infection of <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> eggs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref044">44</xref>]. In <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic>, <italic>mcplD</italic> may regulate some signaling pathways involved in germination and hyphal growth, since mutants in this gene showed delayed germination and reduction of the polarity index. The other gene related to virulence that has been found in this study, <italic>mcmyo5</italic> encodes a processive cargo transporter belonging to the Myosin V Class (Myo5). Myosins play important roles in morphogenesis of filamentous fungi, since they are involved in the establishment and/or maintenance of polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref045">45</xref>]. Among Myosins, Myo5 supplies a constant transport of organelles, membranous cargo, secretory vesicles, mRNA, lipid and protein vesicles on actin tracks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref046">46</xref>]. In <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic>, Myo5 might play an essential role in viability, since the knockout mutant was viable only as a heterokaryon containing a small proportion of wild type nuclei. This heterokaryotic strain was unable to produce regular hyphae and presented a yeast-like phenotype with no polar growth. Likely, the lack of a continuous transport mediated by Myo5 impairs the correct formation of the mycelium. Since filamentous growth is a major determinant of virulence in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref013">13</xref>], the yeast-like knockout strain <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup> presented a pronounced reduced virulence in <italic>G</italic>. <italic>mellonella</italic>. Similarly, in the dimorphic plant pathogenic fungus <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>, a single Myosin class V protein encoded by <italic>myo5</italic> was involved in hyphal growth and pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref047">47</xref>]. However, the reduction of virulence shown by the <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup> heterokaryotic mutant in a murine host model did not reach the significance level stablished, although the reduction in the fungal burden was similar to the mutant <italic>mcplD</italic>. These partially contradictory results obtained from the two host models could be precisely due to the heterokaryotic state of mutant <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup>. The virulence assays in <italic>G</italic>. <italic>mellonella</italic> are performed during eight days, whereas in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>musculus</italic> the assays are prolonged until the twentieth day, which could be time enough for the heterokayotic strain under non selective conditions to segregate and lose mutant nuclei, reverting to the wild type phenotype. According to this hypothesis, wild type patches segregating from <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup> mutant cells growing under non selective culture conditions are easily observed after several days of incubation. In addition, a correlation between the segregation to wild type genotype and the restitutions of virulence was observed after genotyping the nuclei proportion of several retrieved CFUs, which further supported a role of gene <italic>mcmyo5</italic> in the virulence of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic>. Similar results were obtained in <italic>Rhizopus oryzae</italic> when <italic>FTR1</italic> gene was disrupted by double cross-over homologous recombination, but multinucleated <italic>R</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> could not be forced to segregate to a homokaryotic null allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref048">48</xref>]. The heterokaryotic strain <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup> showed the strongest reduction of polar growth and germination rates when phagocyted by macrophages, since it was tested during only four hours in non-selective medium, which is not time enough for segregation. Our results from the <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis and the intravenous infection model showed the potential role of <italic>mcmyo5</italic> in virulence of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic>. Although Myo5 is a highly conserved protein, which disqualifies it as a specific antifungal target, the fungal cargo domain and the proteins that interact with this domain could represent a promising target for future antifungal developments.</p>
<p>The analysis of germination and polar growth of <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup> <italic>and ΔmcplD</italic> mutants and their interaction with mouse macrophages revealed a delayed germination and reduced polarity index of those strains relative to the wild type strain, although the size of the infecting particles (spores or yeast cells) was not reduced in these mutants. These results suggested that a big size of the infecting particle (spore or yeast cells) is not enough to counteract a delayed germination and reduced polarity index. Time of germination and polarity index are two values that measure the velocity of the pathogen growing inside the macrophage and escaping from it. Thus, a possible explanation of the reduced virulence observed in <italic>ΔmcplD</italic> and <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup> mutants might be that delayed germination and reduced polarity index concede macrophages time enough to inactivate the pathogen before it escapes from its cytoplasm. Along with the size of the spore previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref014">14</xref>], our work demonstrated that the time required for germination and the hyphal elongation rate, measured as polarity index, are two new factors to be considered in the analysis of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> virulence.</p>
<p>Besides genes related to virulence, a third gene named <italic>mcclasp</italic> was selected from the RNAi-based functional genomic screenings for further studies. Mutant <italic>Δmcclasp</italic> presented a complex phenotype affecting several fungal processes like vegetative growth, carotene production and sporulation in a similar manner to the <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic><sup><italic>(-)(+)</italic></sup> <italic>and ΔmcplD</italic> mutants, although the <italic>Δmcclasp</italic> strain was not affected in virulence. Besides that, the main differences between <italic>Δmcclasp</italic> and those mutants were the formation of sporangiophores, which were normal in length in <italic>Δmcclasp</italic> mutants, allowing the formation of satellite colonies in low pH media, along with a less pronounced reduction of growth and sporulation. The gene product of <italic>mcclasp</italic> is similar to CLASP proteins that are involved in the attachment of microtubules to the cell cortex in animals and plants, thereby contributing to self-organization of cortical microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref049">49</xref>]. During mitosis, CLASP proteins control the interactions of astral microtubules with the cell cortex, helping the proper positioning and orientation of the spindle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref050">50</xref>]. This important role of CLASP proteins during cell division might be behind the reduced growth and decreased sporulation observed in the <italic>Δmcclasp</italic> mutants. In addition, the role of CLASP proteins in the stability of microtubules is essential for the motility of motor proteins, such as kinesins and dyneins. Kinesins participate in the maintenance of the polarity of filamentous fungi (reviewed by Harris, 2006), which could explain the reduction in the polarity index of the <italic>Δmcclasp</italic> mutant relative to the wild type strain. However, unlike Myo5, kinesins does not seem to be involved in polarity establishment in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic>, since strains without CLASP protein are still able to generate hyphal growth, although their elongation rate is lower than the wild type strain. Mutant <italic>Δmcclasp</italic> showed a reduced growth rate and vegetative sporulation and an increase in β-carotene production compared to control strain R7B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006150.g005">Fig 5C, 5D and 5E</xref>, respectively), similarly to the phenotypes observed in <italic>ΔmcplD</italic> and <italic>Δmcmyo5</italic> mutants. However these phenotypes are not associated with reduced virulence in mutant <italic>Δmcclasp</italic>, indicating that growth defects are not necessarily linked to attenuated virulence and suggesting a possible specific role of <italic>mcplD</italic> and <italic>mcmyo5</italic> genes in pathogenesis. The identification and analysis of <italic>mcclasp</italic> gene demonstrated that along with virulence, other fungal processes can be studied and genetically dissected with the RNAi-based functional genomic platform developed in this work.</p>
<p>In summary, the absence of classic molecular genetic tools and the scarce information about virulence and pathogenesis in Mucorales encouraged us to develop a robust system for RNAi-based functional genomics in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic>. It is a new genetic tool that can be used in the study of a wide range of biological processes, including the identification and study of genes related to virulence and pathogenesis. As a result of its implementation, we have identified new virulence determinants in Mucorales that could represent new targets for future antifungal therapies.</p>

<p>To calculate the coverage of the genomic libraries in the genome of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>circinelloides</italic> and confidence levels, we followed the formula: N = ln(1-P)/ln(1-f); where N is the necessary number of recombinants, P is the desired probability that any fragment of the genome is represented in the library at least one time, and f is the fractional proportion of the genome in a single recombinant. “f” can be further shown to be f = i/g, where i is the insert size and g is the genome size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006150.ref051">51</xref>].</p>

<p>The total phospholipase D activities in wild type (R7B) and mutant <italic>ΔmcplD</italic> were measured using a commercial Phospholipase D Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). In this assay, PLD hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to choline, which is determined using choline oxidase resulting in a colorimetric (570nm) product, proportional to the PLD activity in the sample.</p>
