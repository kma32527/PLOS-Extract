<abstract>
<p>Mucins are heavily glycosylated proteins that give mucus its gel-like properties. Moreover, the glycans decorating the mucin protein core can alter the protective properties of the mucus barrier. To investigate whether these alterations could be parasite-induced we utilized the <italic>Trichuris muris</italic> (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic>) infection model, using different infection doses and strains of mice that are resistant (high dose infection in BALB/c and C57BL6 mice) or susceptible (high dose infection in AKR and low dose infection in BALB/c mice) to chronic infection by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic>. During chronicity, within the immediate vicinity of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> helminth the goblet cell thecae contained mainly sialylated mucins. In contrast, the goblet cells within the epithelial crypts in the resistant models contained mainly sulphated mucins. Maintained mucin sulphation was promoted by T<sub>H</sub>2-immune responses, in particular IL-13, and contributed to the protective properties of the mucus layer, making it less vulnerable to degradation by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> excretory secretory products. Mucin sulphation was markedly reduced in the caecal goblet cells in the sulphate anion transporter-1 (Sat-1) deficient mice. We found that Sat-1 deficient mice were susceptible to chronic infection despite a strong T<sub>H</sub>2-immune response. Lower sulphation levels lead to decreased efficiency of establishment of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection, independent of egg hatching. This study highlights the complex process by which immune-regulated alterations in mucin glycosylation occur following <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection, which contributes to clearance of parasitic infection.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Approximately 2 billion people are infected with worms every year, causing physical, nutritional and cognitive impairment particularly in children. Mucins are large sugar-coated (glycosylated) proteins that form the intestinal mucus layer. This mucus layer protects our ‘insides’ from external insults and plays an important role during worm infection. We discovered that there is a difference in the glycosylation of mucins in people infected with worms compared to uninfected individuals. Therefore, using different mouse models we investigated the role of glycosylation, and in particular sulphation of mucins in infection. We found that mucin glycosylation is controlled by the immune response and increased sulphation correlated with the expulsion of the worm from the host. Highly sulphated mucins were protected from degradation by the worm. Moreover, mice lacking a sulphate transporter had significantly lower sulphation levels on mucins, which resulted in a reduction in the establishment of the worms and chronic infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The intestinal epithelium is lined by a continuous mucus barrier which provides physical protection and chemically protects the epithelial cell layer by sequestering important host defence factors within its complex matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref001">1</xref>]. Gel-forming mucins (Muc2 in the intestine) produced by goblet cells, give mucus its gel-like properties and play a significant role in protection against helminth infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref002">2</xref>]. Mucins are large heavily glycosylated proteins, predominantly consisting of O-glycans which account for at least 70% of their molecular weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref003">3</xref>]. The O-linked sugars are assembled progressively by glycosyltransferases on to a serine or threonine residue, found in the serine-threonine-proline rich tandem repeat regions of the mucin protein core [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref001">1</xref>]. These glycan chains have well-established fundamental roles in many biological processes including in inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Changes in mucin glycosylation have been previously described in murine parasitic infections. Whether these changes are important in the protective function of the mucus barrier, however, has not yet been established. Several studies have investigated the direct role of glycans as protective elements that attach and clear pathogens from the gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref008">8</xref>], but most of the evidence for the protective role of the glycans present on mucins comes from animal models. A change in the glycans can lead to inflammation because of the alteration in the protective properties of the mucus barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref012">12</xref>]. For example, the terminal sugar fucose has been shown to be crucial in host-pathogen interaction in <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref013">13</xref>]. Moreover, inducing colitis in mice deficient in the N-acetylglucosamine-6-O-sulphotransferase-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref014">14</xref>] which is expressed highly in the colon, results in a significantly higher leukocyte infiltration and is thought to exacerbate inflammation. Mice lacking either core 1- or core 3-derived O-glycan chains, or both, develop spontaneous colitis with the double knockout mice having the most severe and widespread disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that inducing mucin sulphation with reserpine <italic>in vivo</italic> reduces the establishment of infection with the intestinal helminth <italic>Strongyloides venezuelensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref018">18</xref>]. Sulphotransferases were also up-regulated shortly before the rejection of the helminth, <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic> and have been suggested to play a protective role during worm expulsion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref020">20</xref>]. In addition, the up-regulation of sialomucins observed in other helminth models such as <italic>Trichinella spiralis</italic>, which have been found to be regulated by T cells, are thought to be protective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref010">10</xref>]. Moreover, gastrointestinal disorders such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease are associated with a loss of mucin sulphation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref022">22</xref>]. Whether the changes observed in mucin glycosylation in human colitis occur as a consequence of disease or are an active alteration important in resolving the disease has yet to be fully elucidated. Mucin glycosylation is known to be important in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and an absence of mucin glycosylation results in inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref023">23</xref>]. It was shown that a reduction in mucin sulphation, in particular, can lead to an increase in susceptibility to colitis and bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref024">24</xref>]. In the intestine, a rich commensal flora is maintained within the outer mucus layer and it is thought that the microbiota can influence the level of sulphation in the intestine, which could in turn effect mucin sulphation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref025">25</xref>]. Paradoxically, mucin sulphation can also protect the mucin core from bacterial glycosidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref004">4</xref>]. Overall, it is thought that the alterations in glycosylation can lead to reduced effectiveness of the mucus barrier, which in turn may exacerbate inflammation.</p>
<p>The intestinal niche occupied by nematodes, in particular the caecum, contains mucins that are more sulphated than in any other site in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref021">21</xref>]. Using the <italic>Trichuris muris</italic> (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic>) mouse model, we have shown that intestinal mucins play an essential role in the expulsion of this helminth from the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref026">26</xref>]. Therefore, the changes in mucin sulphation could alter the protective nature of the mucus barrier and affect helminth establishment and/or expulsion. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> helminth infection model provides a robust model of both acute and chronic infection. Using this model, we observed a clear switch in glycosylation from sulphomucins to sialomucins during chronic infection in the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> murine model. For the first time, we also demonstrate that mucin sulphation is influenced by IL-13 and mucus with high sulphomucin content is more resistant to degradation by the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> excretory secretory products (ESPs). Moreover, underlining the functional importance, Sulphate anion transporter1 (Sat1)-deficient mice with reduced mucin sulphation developed chronic <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection. Interestingly, a preliminary histopathological examination of individuals infected with <italic>Enterobius vermicularis</italic>, a highly prevalent gastrointestinal dwelling nematode of human cecum showed a decreased mucin sulphation staining supportive of the mouse studies.</p>

<p>To gain an understanding of whether mucin glycosylation plays an important role during helminth infection, we utilised the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> model of helminth infection in mice.

Normally in the caecum, the niche of the parasite, the mucins are predominantly highly sulphated with little evidence of sialomucin-containing goblet cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006218.g001">Fig 1A</xref>—naïve levels).

<title>Up-regulation of sulphotransferase genes in acute infection</title>
<p>Mucin glycosylation is dependent on the array of glycosyltransferases present within the Golgi apparatus of the goblet cells.

<p>Subsequently, at day 35 pi., which is considered to be a chronic infection, these mice were re-challenged with a high dose (&gt;150) of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006218.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).

However, most worms were eradicated 21 days after reinfection (day 56 pi.) and no worms were present in the caecum by 35 days post-reinfection (day 70 pi.).

<title>Sulphation of mucins is controlled by IL-13</title>
<p>It is well-established that the mice resistant to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection mount strong T<sub>H</sub>2-type immune responses and those susceptible to chronic infection exhibit T<sub>H</sub>1-type immune responses (as can be seen from the relative caecal expression of genes encoding the T<sub>H</sub>2 and T<sub>H</sub>1 cytokines <italic>Il13</italic> and <italic>Ifnγ</italic> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006218.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref028">28</xref>]. To assess the role of the T<sub>H</sub>2-type immune response and in particular, IL-4 and IL-13, in mucin sulphation, IL-4 knockout (KO) and IL-4R KO mice on the BALB/c background were infected with a high dose of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> eggs. The IL-4 KO mice were able to expel worms, however worm expulsion was slightly delayed in these mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006218.s003">S3A Fig</xref>), as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref029">29</xref>]. On day 18 pi. goblet cell hyperplasia was less pronounced in the IL-4 KO mice when compared to the wild-type BALB/c mice, although this was not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006218.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). A significant increase in the number of goblet cells was observed in the IL-4 KO mice by day 32 post infection compared to naïve mice. Furthermore, HID-AB staining showed that goblet cells in the IL-4KO mice predominantly contained sulphated mucins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006218.g003">Fig 3E and 3F</xref>). As IL-4 and IL-13 act through a heterodimeric receptor involving IL-4Rα, IL-4R KO mice do not respond to either cytokine and are unable to mount strong T<sub>H</sub>2-type immune responses, and consequently are susceptible to chronic <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection (worm burden; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006218.s003">S3A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref029">29</xref>]. Importantly, uninfected control IL-4R KO mice had significantly lower levels of sulphation compared to the naïve wild type and IL-4 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006218.g003">Fig 3D–3F</xref>).

As infection progressed, a decrease in the number of goblet cells was also observed in the IL-4R KO mice compared to naïve and IL-4 KO mice. Moreover, the goblet cells lost their ‘goblet like morphology’, exhibiting very small thecae, which stained blue with HID-AB, indicative of predominantly containing sialylated mucins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006218.g003">Fig 3F</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine whether the differences in sulphomucin content alters the properties of the mucus barrier, we compared mucus from wild-type mice and NaS1 KO mice, which lack the Na<sup>+</sup>-sulphate transport 1 (Slc13a1)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref030">30</xref>]. Slc13a1 is primarily expressed in the ileum/caecum/colon and kidney where it mediates sulphate absorption and reabsorption, respectively. Deletion of <italic>Slc13a1</italic> in mice leads to hyposulfataemia and reduced sulphonation capacity which leads to depleted intestinal sulphomucin content (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006218.s004">S4A Fig</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref024">24</xref>]). Mucus extracted from the uninfected wild-type and NaS1 mice was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and western blotted. Staining with HID confirmed that mucin sulphation was significantly reduced in the NaS1 mice compared to wild-type mice, with PAS staining (reacts with all mucin carbohydrates) used to confirm that comparable amounts of glycoproteins were isolated and compared (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006218.s004">S4B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The excretory/secretory products (ESPs) released by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic>, contains a mixture of enzymes. We have previously demonstrated that serine proteases secreted by the helminth can specifically depolymerise the Muc2 mucin polymers that give mucus its viscoelastic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref031">31</xref>]. Therefore, we assessed the contribution of the mucin sulphation to the resistance to depolymerisation of Muc2. Caecal mucus was isolated from wild type and Nas1 KO mice and treated with 50 μg/ml of ESPs from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> for 2 or 6 hours at 37°C to determine whether ESPs can alter mucus. Treated or untreated mucus was subsequently subjected to rate zonal centrifugation to assess the change in size and/or shape of mucins by analysing their distribution by PAS-staining. The sedimentation profiles of untreated glycoproteins from wild-type (high sulphomucin content) and NaS1 KO (lower sulphomucin content) were comparable with broad peaks (fractions 9–20) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006218.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). After treatment with ESPs from <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic>, the sedimentation profile of glycoproteins from NaS1 KO mice was altered, whereas the profile of wild type glycoproteins was substantially unchanged. The PAS-positive material from the NaS1 KO mice shifted to the top of the gradient (fractions 4–17) compared to PAS-positive material from the wild-type mice present in fractions 9–20, consistent with reduced size of mucin polymers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006218.s004">S4C Fig</xref>; quantification of rate zonal data presented as percentage of area under the curve shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006218.s004">S4C Fig</xref>).

<title>Lower mucin sulphation does not affect worm establishment or expulsion in NaS1 KO mice</title>
<p>High sulphomucin content that accompanies helminth rejection was predominately controlled by IL-13. This was confirmed <italic>in-vitro</italic> by treating the intestinal cell lines, LS174T cells, with 50 ng/mL of IL-13 for 24 h. We observed an increase in mucin production, which was accompanied by an increase in sulphotransferase and a decrease in sialyltransferase genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006218.s003">S3C and S3D Fig</xref>). Treatment of LS174T cells with IFN-γ lead to an increase in sialytransferases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006218.s003">S3E Fig</xref>), whereas no alterations in sulphotransferases were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006218.s003">S3E Fig</xref>). We also examined degradation by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> ESPs of mucins produced by LS174T cells with and without IL-13 stimulation and found that sulphated mucins induced by IL-13 treatment are more resistant to degradation by parasite ES products. Moreover, sialylated mucins induced by IFNγ treatment were degraded rapidly compared to control mucins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006218.s003">S3F Fig</xref>). As IL-13 is an essential mediator in the expulsion of helminths and altered sulphation levels via the regulation of sulphotransferases, we hypothesised that the level of mucin sulphation in the caecum could affect <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection, in particular worm establishment and rejection. To address this possibility, NaS1 KO and their wild-type littermates (C57BL/6-background) were infected with a high dose of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> eggs. As stated previously, the mucin sulphation in the caecum of the naïve NaS1 KO mice was lower as compared to the wild-type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref024">24</xref>]. This, however, did not have an effect on the establishment of infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006218.s004">S4D Fig</xref>); similar number of worms were present, on day 12 pi., in the NaS1 KO and wild-type mice.

<p>As we had demonstrated that the NaS1 KO mice expel <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> over a similar time course as wild-type mice, RT-PCR was used to determine whether these mice mount a similar and concurrent T<sub>H</sub>2-type immune response to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection.

The effect of the elevated IL-4/IL-13 levels was reflected in the histological analysis, as goblet cell hyperplasia. We have previously demonstrated that in the absence of the major intestinal mucin Muc2, results in a delay in the expulsion of the helminth <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> from the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref002">2</xref>]. Importantly, <italic>denovo</italic> expression of the mucin Muc5ac in the niche of the helminth is critical for its expulsion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref026">26</xref>]. However, in the NaS1 KO mice Muc2 and Muc5ac levels were similar compared to the WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006218.s005">S5D–S5F Fig</xref>). HID-AB staining intensity showed that caecal mucin sulphation in the NaS1 knockout naïve mice was significantly less than in wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006218.s004">S4E and S4F Fig</xref>). However, surprisingly, as the infection advanced, the levels of mucin sulphation recovered in the NaS1 KO mice, and by day 25 of infection no difference was observed in the sulphation of the goblet cells in the caecal crypts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006218.s004">S4E and S4F Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>As the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection progressed in the NaS1 KO mice, the depletion in the sulphomucin content within the goblet cells was reversed, suggesting that free sulphates, although lower systemically due to renal excretion, were transported efficiently through another sulphate transporter expressed in the caecal epithelium to be incorporated into the mucins. In addition to NaS1, sulphate anion transporter-1 (Sat1, Slc26a1) is the other major sulphate transporter in the caecum. Sat1 is expressed on the basolateral surface of epithelial cells and functions independently of NaS1, which is expressed on the apical membrane in the ileum, caecum and colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref032">32</xref>].

<title>Sat1 is essential for the establishment and expulsion of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection</title>
<p>HID-AB staining clearly showed that the mucins have low sulphation in Sat1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006218.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Interestingly, on day 7 pi., there was a significant reduction in the worm burden demonstrating a difference in the establishment of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006218.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Despite lower establishment of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic>, as infection progressed it was clear that the Sat1 KO mice were susceptible to chronic infection; these mice harboured infection until day 56 pi. and were unable to clear the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006218.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). The differences in establishment could be due to a variation in the efficiency of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> egg hatching. Therefore <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> eggs were incubated <italic>in-vitro</italic> with caecal explants from WT mice and Sat1 heterozygous and KO mice overnight. However, there were no significant differences in the percentage of eggs hatched in WT or Sat1 KO mice under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006218.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Moreover, no differences in the immune response were observed at day 7 pi., where IFN-γ and IL-13 cytokine levels from cultured mesenteric lymph nodes were similar between WT and Sat1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006218.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). We have previously shown that the mucins critical to worm expulsion adversely affect worm metabolism measured by ATP production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref026">26</xref>], and therefore we analysed ATP production in worms exposed to sulphated and non-sulphated mucins. Sulphated mucins (isolated from the caecum of wild-type mice) lowered the energy levels of worms, whereas this effect was lost with decreased mucin sulphation (isolated from the caecum of Sat1 KO mice) directly implicating sulphated oligosaccharides in the anti-parasitic function of the mucins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006218.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). These findings in the Sat1 KO mice show that mucin sulphation is a critical element of effective helminth expulsion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The mucus barrier overlaying the intestinal epithelium is the first line of defence against enteric parasitic infections. We have previously demonstrated a protective role of mucins, the major component of the mucus barrier, in helminth expulsion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref002">2</xref>]. It is thought that the glycans that decorate the mucin protein backbone, contribute to the protective properties of the mucus gel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref001">1</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrate that sialylated mucins are mainly present in chronic helminthic infection. We described the changes in glycosylation in chronic and acute <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection and show, in the strong T<sub>H</sub>2 environment that accompanies worm expulsion, that mucins were highly sulphated driven primarily by IL-13 mediated upregulation of goblet cell sulphotransferases. In contrast, predominantly sialylated mucins were found within the goblet cells during chronic <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection in mice and in human appendices with <italic>Enterobius</italic> infection. Mice incapable of appropriate mucin sulphation could not expel <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> demonstrating the importance of mucin sulphation as a key element of immune-driven worm expulsion. Providing a mechanistic explanation for the role of sulphated mucins in worm expulsion, we demonstrated that mucin polymers with high sulphomucin content were inherently more effective in repressing worm metabolism <italic>in vitro</italic> and were also more resistant to degradation by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> excretory secretory products. Using two genetic models of sulphate transporter deficiency we were able to establish the importance of mucin sulphation in both establishment of infection and subsequent immune clearance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006218.g005">Fig 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Schematic illustrating the important role of sulphate transporters during helminth infection.</title>
<p>(A) In normal caecal epithelia, NaS1 expressed on the apical surface and Sat1 expressed on the basolateral surface is involved in the uptake of sulphates to maintain sulphate homeostasis and ensure sufficient substrate for sulphation of caecal mucins. (B) During acute <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection, the demand for sulphation increases as a result of goblet cell hyperplasia, leading to the upregulation of NaS1 and Sat1, allowing uptake of sulphates from the luminal surface as well as blood, respectively. (C) In the absence of NaS1 blood sulphate decreases due to decreased intestinal absorption and renal reabsorption. Consequently, Sat1 on the basolateral membrane in the caecal epithelia is upregulated earlier in infection to ensure sufficient uptake of sulphates from blood. This compensation for the deficiency in blood sulphate leads to the recovery of sulphation on mucins ensuring effective worm expulsion. (D) In the absence of Sat1, mice develop hyposulfataemia and the cellular requirement for sulphates is unable to be met by NaS1, leading to reduced mucin sulphation. Reduced mucin sulphation reduces the efficiency of establishment of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection, but then prevents eradication of the infection.</p>

<p>Changes in mucin glycosylation have been reported to coincide with inflammation in several gastrointestinal diseases such as ulcerative colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref033">33</xref>]. Moreover, alterations glycosylation of mucins have also been reported to occur during several models of helminth infection; <italic>N</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic>, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>spiralis</italic> and <italic>H</italic>. <italic>polgyrus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref034">34</xref>]. Whether these changes occur as a result of an on-going inflammatory response or as a result of an active change in order to resolve infection is not yet known. Our data suggests that distinct mechanisms regulate glycosyltransferases responsible for mucin sialylation and sulphation, corroborating previously published work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref019">19</xref>] and definitively showing that IL-4/IL-13 receptor signalling preferentially drives expression of sulphotransferases. Histological analysis revealed that the changes in glycosylation with chronic <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection were localised only within the caecum, consistent with the localised mucosal immune response. Interestingly, similar to goblet cell hyperplasia which is restricted to the caecum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref002">2</xref>], no major changes in glycosylation were observed in the colon post <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection. The changes in glycosylation were restricted to the helminths niche, it suggests these could be due to or a local immune response to/by the helminth itself. As human <italic>EV</italic> infection was also associated with an increased number of activated lymphoid follicles, this may represent an altered inflammatory milieu, which could contribute to the changes in mucin glycosylation. Mirroring the changes observed with the histology, an increase in the gene expression of sulphotransferases was observed in resistance, and sialotransferases were up-regulated in susceptibility. In chronic infection by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic>, along with the down-regulation of goblet cell differentiation transcription factors, glycosylation within the goblet cells could possibly be perturbed. Indeed, there is evidence of a general loss of mature glycosylation on mucins in chronic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref035">35</xref>]. The loss of sulphation was in naïve uninfected IL-4R KO mice when compared to the IL-4 KO mice, suggesting that in health the basal level of mucin sulphation is in part due to IL-13. In-vitro data showed that IL-13-treatment of colonic cell lines leads to an increase in sulphotransferase expression and subsequently protects the mucins from degradation by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> ESPs. Alterations in glycosylation could affect the hydration of the mucus gel and the viscosity of the barrier, which we have previously shown to be altered during worm expulsion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref026">26</xref>]. It is important to acknowledge that in endemic areas, people are often infected with low doses of helminths, repeatedly. Therefore, the gradual change in glycosylation that occurs as a result of infection may eventually contribute to ‘acquired immunity’ and worm expulsion.</p>
<p>Parasitic excretory secretory products have the ability to degrade purified mucins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref036">36</xref>]. The excretory secretory products (ESPs) of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> helminth, that lives within the blanket of mucus, have been shown to be highly immunogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref037">37</xref>]. However, whether ESPs affect crude mucus has not been previously investigated. Comparable amounts of mucus extracted from naïve NaS1 and wild-type mice were used to compare the effect of ESPs on low and highly sulphated mucins, respectively. After treatment with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> ESPs, the mucus with low sulphomucin content (from NaS1 KO mice) was reduced in size, which is evidence of degradation of the polymeric macromolecule responsible for the viscoelastic properties of the mucus and its ability to retain other host factors. This difference in the effect of ESPs was apparent on mucus with low sulphomucin content after only 2 hours of treatment, whereas ESPs had little effect on the mucus from wild-type naïve mice even after 6 hours. As we have demonstrated ESPs may be released as part of the helminths regime to promote its own survival, as the degradation of mucins would lead to diminishing the gel-like consistency of the mucus surrounding the worm and the delivery of anti-helminthic host factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref031">31</xref>]. Our findings here suggest that glycosylation plays an important role in preventing degradation, and that highly sulphated mucins protect the mucin protein core from the degradative effects of the helminths ESPs. Indeed studies of von Willebrand factor (vWF), which is a large multimeric glycoprotein homologous to gel-forming mucins, revealed that sialylated glycans increase susceptibility to its proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>We demonstrate that mucin sulphation patterns seen during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection influence both the establishment and expulsion of the parasite. Increased sulphation on intestinal mucins has been shown to reduce the establishment of the helminth <italic>Strongyloides venezuelensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref018">18</xref>]. We noted that depleted levels of sulphation using the Sat1 KO had a major effect on the establishment of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection. Of note, the caecum, which is the chosen niche of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> helminth, is the highly sulphated. There is a possibility that sulphation is the cue for the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> eggs to hone in to the caecum as with reduced sulphation we did observe a decrease in establishment, no worms were found in the other parts of the intestine (small intestine, proximal colon or distal colon). The differences in establishment were not due to differences in the hatching of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> eggs. Together with our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref026">26</xref>] we now know that mucins are critical to expulsion, MUC5AC is more important than MUC2, oligomerisation of the mucins is not required for the adverse effects on metabolism, and sulphated oligosaccharides are required. How the long intact sulphated mucin molecules transmit their adverse effects on worm metabolism remain to be demonstrated. No effect on <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> establishment was noted in the NaS1 KO mice, possibly because the depletion in sulphation was not sufficient to have an effect on worm establishment. In the absence of the apical sulphate transporter, NaS1, these hyposulphataemic mice up-regulated the expression of Sat1 transporter, which is involved in the uptake of sulphates from blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006218.ref032">32</xref>]. Interestingly, Sat1 is elevated with the increasing demand for sulphates during the rejection of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic>, earlier in the NaS1 KO mice compared to the wild-type mice. Sat1 levels return almost to baseline in the NaS1 KO mice by day 25 pi., which is when the goblet cell hyperplasia seemed to subside. Such evidence suggests that Sat1 expression is up-regulated in response to the increased cellular requirement of sulphates, rather than the immune response and is effectively scavenging sufficient sulphate to effectively sulphate the mucins and ensure worm clearance. Importantly, the sustained sulphation observed in the acute <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> model is essential for the expulsion of the helminth from the host.</p>
<p>In summary, we have demonstrated that maintained mucin sulphation, influenced by the T<sub>H</sub>2 type immune response, is clearly a feature of resistance to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection. This has likely evolved as a part of the immune response against <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> as increased sulphation changes the properties of the mucus barrier making the mucins more resistant to degradation. Depleted levels of mucin sulphation, have a significant effect on the establishment of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection that appear independent of changes in the microbiome. With the high demand of cellular sulphate during <italic>T</italic>. <italic>muris</italic> infection, Sat1 was up-regulated in the caecal epithelium and is essential for efficient mucin sulphation with deficiency leading to inability to clear infection. Given the essential role of mucins in clearing helminth infections, this study highlights the complex process by which alterations in mucin glycosylation occur following infection and contribute to the establishment and clearance of infection.</p>
