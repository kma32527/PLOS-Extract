<abstract>
<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of chronic liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Golgi protein 73 (GP73) is a serum biomarker for liver diseases and HCC. However, the mechanism underlying GP73 regulates HCV infection is largely unknown. Here, we revealed that GP73 acts as a novel negative regulator of host innate immunity to facilitate HCV infection. GP73 expression is activated and correlated with interferon-beta (IFN-β) production during HCV infection in patients’ serum, primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) and human hepatoma cells through mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular regulated protein kinase (MEK/ERK) pathway. Detailed studies revealed that HCV infection activates MAVS that in turn recruits TRAF6 <italic>via</italic> TRAF-interacting-motifs (TIMs), and TRAF6 subsequently directly recruits GP73 to MAVS <italic>via</italic> coiled-coil domain. After binding with MAVS and TRAF6, GP73 promotes MAVS and TRAF6 degradation through proteasome-dependent pathway. Moreover, GP73 attenuates <italic>IFN-β</italic> promoter, IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and nuclear factor κB (<italic>NF-κB</italic>) promoter and down-regulates <italic>IFN-β</italic>, <italic>IFN-λ1</italic>, interleukin-6 (<italic>IL-6</italic>) and IFN-stimulated gene 56 (<italic>ISG56</italic>), leading to the repression of host innate immunity. Finally, knock-down of <italic>GP73</italic> down-regulates HCV infection and replication in Huh7-MAVSR cells and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs), but such repression is rescued by GP73m4 (a mutant GP73 resists to GP73-shRNA#4) in Huh7-MAVSR cells, suggesting that GP73 facilitates HCV infection. Taken together, we demonstrated that GP73 acts as a negative regulator of innate immunity to facilitate HCV infection by interacting with MAVS/TRAF6 and promoting MAVS/TRAF6 degradation. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of HCV infection and pathogenesis, and suggests that GP73 is a new potential antiviral target in the prevention and treatment of HCV associated diseases.</p>

<p>Golgi protein 73 (GP73) is a serum biomarker for liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, the authors reveal that GP73 acts as a novel negative regulator of host innate immunity to facilitate hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. GP73 expression is activated and correlated with IFN-β production during HCV infection in patients’ serum, primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) and human hepatoma cells through mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and MEK/ERK pathway. They further demonstrate that during viral infection, MAVS recruits TRAF6 that subsequently directly binds with GP73. After binding with MAVS and TRAF6, GP73 promotes MAVS and TRAF6 degradation. Moreover, GP73 attenuates <italic>IFN-β</italic> promoter, IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and <italic>NF-κB</italic> promoter and down-regulates <italic>IFN-β</italic>, <italic>IFN-λ1</italic>, interleukin-6 (<italic>IL-6</italic>) and IFN-stimulated gene 56 (<italic>ISG56</italic>), leading to the repression of host innate immunity and the facilitation of virus infection. These results reveal a novel mechanism by which GP73 acts as a novel negative regulator of host innate immunity to facilitate virus infection and also provide new insights into the therapeutic design of anti-HCV drugs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Innate immune response is critical for host defense against microbial infection including bacteria, fungi and viruses. Upon microbial infection, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which lead to the production of type I interferons (IFNs), proinflammatory cytokines and downstream effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref001">1</xref>]. Among PRRs, Toll-like-receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) recognize viral RNAs. Certain TLRs detect viral RNA in endosome, such as TLR3 senses viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and TLR7/8 recognizes single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref003">3</xref>]. While RLRs, including retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), sense viral RNA in the cytoplasm, which in turn recruit and activate mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref007">7</xref>]. MAVS further recruits TNF receptor associated factors (TRAF2/3/5/6) to activate nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factors (IRF3/7) leading to the production of IFNs and cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver diseases, chronic hepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis, which have a marked risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref010">10</xref>]. HCV contains a 9.6-kb positive-sense RNA genome encoding a 3000-amino acids polyprotein that is cleaved into four structural proteins (Core, E1, E2 and P7) and six nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref011">11</xref>]. NS3/4A protease is essential for generating mature proteins required for virus replication and abrogating host antiviral innate immunity by cleaving MAVS and TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β (TRIF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref013">13</xref>]. Previous studies showed that <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed HCV genomic RNA and 3’untranslated region (3’UTR) of RNA are recognized by RIG-I to trigger IFN response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref015">15</xref>]. Recent study reported that MDA5 plays a major role in IFN response during HCV infection by introducing a mutant MAVS (MAVS-C508R, resistant to NS3/4A cleavage) into human hepatoma Huh7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Golgi protein 73 (GP73) is a resident Golgi membrane protein initially identified in adult giant-cell hepatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref017">17</xref>]. It is constitutive expressed in normal livers, but up-regulated in liver diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref018">18</xref>]. Clinical reports showed that GP73 is a novel HCC serum marker with high specificity and sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref023">23</xref>]. HCV facilitates GP73 expression that in turn enhances HCV secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref024">24</xref>]. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC1) up-regulates GP73 that subsequently promotes HCC cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref025">25</xref>]. However, the mechanism by which GP73 regulates HCV infection and pathogenesis is largely unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we revealed a novel mechanism by which GP73 facilitates HCV infection through repressing IFN signaling. Initially, HCV infection activates GP73 in patients’ serum, primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) and human hepatoma cells by regulating MAVS/TRAF6 and MEK/ERK pathway. Subsequently, GP73 binds with MAVS/TRAF6 to promote MAVS and TRAF6 degradation by proteasome-dependent pathway, which leads to the repression of host innate immunity and facilitation of HCV infection.</p>

<p>It was reported that MDA5 senses HCV RNA to trigger IFN response after introducing a C508R mutant of MAVS (MAVSR) into Huh7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref016">16</xref>]. We next investigated the expression status of <italic>GP73</italic> and <italic>IFN-β</italic> in HCV-infected Huh7-MAVSR cells. The results demonstrated that in Huh7-MAVSR cells, <italic>GP73</italic> and <italic>IFN-β</italic> mRNAs were up-regulated by at least 3-fold during HCV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006321.g001">Fig 1G</xref>), the protein levels of GP73 were also significantly enhanced during HCV infection in Huh7-MAVSR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006321.g001">Fig 1H and 1I</xref>). We also showed that GP73 and IFN-β were activated by other RNA viruses, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006321.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). These results demonstrated that GP73 production is activated and correlated with IFN-β activation during viral infection, probably through MAVS.</p>
<p>After MAVS activation during viral infection, IRF3/NF-κB is stimulated to induce IFN, whereas TAK1/MAPK is also activated to modulate cell proliferation. Thus, we determined which pathway is involved in GP73 activation. <italic>GP73</italic> mRNA level was not affected by the treatments of recombinant IFN-α or recombinant IFN-λ1, suggesting that <italic>GP73</italic> is not an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006321.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). <italic>GP73</italic> mRNA was repressed by PD98059 and U0126 (MEK/ERK inhibitors), but not by GF109203, LY294002, SP600125, SB203580 or BAY11-7082 (PKC, PI3K, JNK, P38 or NF-κB inhibitors) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006321.s001">S1D Fig</xref>), and <italic>GP73</italic> mRNA was attenuated by PD98059 and U0126 in dose-dependent manners (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006321.s001">S1E Fig</xref>), suggesting that <italic>GP73</italic> expression is modulated by MEK/ERK pathway, but not PKC, PI3K, JNK, P38 or NF-κB pathways. Since mTORC1 pathway activates GP73 in HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref025">25</xref>], we examined the effect of rapamycin (mTORC1 inhibitor) on <italic>GP73</italic> expression. <italic>GP73</italic> mRNA was not affected by rapamycin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006321.s001">S1F Fig</xref>), but GP73 protein was repressed by rapamycin or U0126 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006321.s001">S1G Fig</xref>), suggesting that <italic>GP73</italic> transcription is dependent on ERK pathway. Thus, GP73 expression is activated and correlated with IFN activation through MAVS and probably through MAVS-mediated MEK/ERK pathway during HCV infection in human serum, primary human hepatocytes and human hepatoma cells.</p>

<title>GP73 represses host innate immunity during viral infection</title>
<p>Because GP73 production is correlated with IFN activation, we evaluated the effect of GP73 on the regulation of IFN signaling in HEK293 cells transfected with IFN-β-Luc, ISRE-Luc or NF-κB-Luc reporters and infected with SeV. IFN-β-Luc, ISRE-Luc and NF-κB-Luc were activated by SeV, but such activation was attenuated by GP73 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006321.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), indicating that GP73 represses IFN-β, ISRE and NF-κB activities. GP73 contains an N-terminal trans-membrane (TM) domain required for membrane localization, a C-terminal acidic tail, and a middle coiled-coil domain required for endosome-to-Golgi traffic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref028">28</xref>]. Based on the functional domains, we constructed a series of truncations of GP73 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006321.s002">S2A Fig</xref>) and examined the effects of mutants on the regulation of <italic>IFN-β</italic>. Activation of <italic>IFN-β</italic> reporter mediated by SeV was repressed by GP73, D1 (1–348) and D2 (1–205), enhanced by D4 (56–401), D5 (56–348) and D6 (56–205), but not affected by D3 (1–55) or D7 (206–401) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006321.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), indicating that TM domain plus coiled-coil domain, but not coiled-coil domain alone, repress SeV-mediated activation of <italic>IFN-β</italic>. These results also implicated that inhibitory effect of GP73 dependents on Golgi membrane targeting or sub-cellular compartments trafficking. Further expression analysis showed the protein levels of GP73 D1 and GP73 D2 were comparable to FL GP73, but GP73 D4 and GP73 D6 were lower than FL GP73 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006321.s002">S2C Fig</xref>), suggesting the TM domain plus coiled-coil domain were sufficient to inhibit <italic>IFN-β</italic> activation, and that the expression level of <italic>GP73</italic> may affect its repression effect on <italic>IFN-β</italic> activation.</p>

<p>The role of endogenous GP73 in virus-triggered IFN signaling was examined by three shRNAs targeting to <italic>GP73</italic> gene (<italic>GP73</italic>-shRNA#2, #3 and #4), which could attenuate <italic>GP73</italic> mRNA and GP73 protein level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006321.s002">S2D Fig</xref>). <italic>IFN-β</italic> and <italic>NF-κB</italic> activities were induced by SeV and further facilitated by <italic>GP73</italic>-shRNA #3 and <italic>GP73</italic>-shRNA#4 in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006321.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), indicating that knock-down of <italic>GP73</italic> up-regulates virus-induced <italic>IFN-β</italic> and <italic>NF-κB</italic>.</p>
<p>The effect of GP73 on the regulation of innate immunity was assessed. We initially showed that <italic>GP73</italic> mRNA was highly expressed in Huh7 and Huh7.5.1 cells, at low levels in L02, HEK293, THP-1 and HeLa cells, but not detected in HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006321.s002">S2E Fig</xref>). Thus, we generated three stable cell lines: Huh7-MAVSR/lentivirus-Con-shRNA, Huh7-MAVSR/lentivirus-GP73-shRNA#3 and Huh7-MAVSR/lentivirus-GP73-shRNA#4. IFN-β, IL-6 and IFN-stimulated gene 56 (ISG56) were enhanced by GP73-shRNA#3 and GP73-shRNA#4 in the presence of JFH1 HCV genomic RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006321.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), indicating that knock-down of GP73 up-regulates IFN-β, IL-6 and ISG56. In addition, p-IRF3 and p-IκBα were facilitated by GP73-shRNA#3 and GP73-shRNA#4 in the presence of HCV genomic RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006321.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), suggesting that knock-down of <italic>GP73</italic> enhances IRF3 and IκBα phosphorylation. Moreover, <italic>IFN-β</italic>, <italic>IFN-λ1</italic>, <italic>IL-6</italic> and <italic>TNF-α</italic> mRNAs were activated by SeV in the presence of <italic>GP73</italic>-shRNA #4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006321.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>), indicating that knock-down of <italic>GP73</italic> facilitates <italic>IFN-β</italic>, <italic>IFN-λ1</italic>, <italic>IL-6</italic> and <italic>TNF-α</italic> expression.

<p>We then determined whether GP73 is associated with components of IFN pathway in HEK293 cells co-transfected with HA-GP73 and Flag-tagged signaling components.

It was reported GP73 is a glycosylated Golgi-localized protein, depending on the TMD with a positively charged residue in the cytoplasmic N-terminal tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref028">28</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> endoglycosidase digestion assay indicated the faster band of GP73 was lack of glycosylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006321.s003">S3A Fig</xref>).

Because the mitochondrial associated membrane (MAM) is the major site of MAVS-mediated IFN signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref029">29</xref>], while GP73 is a Golgi membrane protein and thus, we analyzed which sub-cellular compartment is the site for MAVS and GP73 interaction. Differential centrifugation and WB demonstrated that GP73 was co-localized with MAVS to the Mito/MAM fraction (P5K) upon SeV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006321.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). CoIP results of MAVS with Golgi-defective GP73 mutants (WT2-K2E and WT2-ΔK2) also indicated the GP73/MAVS interaction was not dependent on its Golgi localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006321.s003">S3B Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>As a central adaptor of IFN signaling, MAVS contains an N-terminal CARD domain required for RIG-I-mediated oligomerization, a proline-rich domain involved in protein-protein interaction, and a C-terminal transmembrane domain (TM) inserting MAVS into mitochondrial outer membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref031">31</xref>]. MAVS also carries three TRAF-interacting motifs (TIMs) required for the binding of TRAF2/3/5/6 to activate downstream signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref031">31</xref>]. To determine the functions of MAVS domains in the binding with GP73, we generated a series of MAVS truncations and deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006321.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In co-transfected HEK293 cells, GP73 only interacted with FL MAVS (1–540), but not with C-terminal deletions MAVS (1–510), MAVS (1–467), MAVS (1–440), MAVS (1–360) or MAVS (1–180) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006321.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), indicating that C-terminal TM domain is required for the interaction with GP73. Similarly, GP73 only interacted with MAVS (1–540), but not with N-terminal deletions MAVS (91–540), MAVS (181–540) or MAVS (361–540) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006321.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), suggesting that N-terminal CARD domain is involved in the interaction with GP73. Moreover, GP73 was interacted with MAVS (1–540) and M11 MAVS (1–90/441–540), but not with MAVS (91–540), MAVS (1–510) or M15 MAVS (1–90/468–540) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006321.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). These results indicated that CARD domain, TM domain and TIM3 domain are sufficient and efficient for the binding with GP73. Although M14 MAVS (1–90/181–540) contains M11 MAVS and middle sequence of MAVS, it is less efficient in the binding with GP73, which can be explained with an auto-inhibitory effect of middle sequence of MAVS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref032">32</xref>]. Interestingly, M15 MAVS (compared with M11, lacking TIM3 and surrounding 20 aa) failed to bind to GP73, which highlighted the importance of TIM3 in MAVS and GP73 interaction. Further analysis of mutations in TIM3 (ΔTIM3: AAANEY instead of PEENEY), that lost the ability of TIM3 to bind TRAF6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref031">31</xref>], showed that GP73 strongly interacted with MAVS (1–540), M11 MAVS (1–90/441–540) and M12 MAVS (1–180/441–540), weakly interacted with FL MAVS ΔTIM3, M12 MAVS ΔTIM3 and M17 MAVS (1–180/468–540), but not with M11 MAVS ΔTIM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006321.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> GST pull-down assays showed GP73 can directly bind M11 and T6CC (TRAF6 coiled-coil domain) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006321.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). To analysis whether putative polyubiquitination of MAVS mediated by activated TRAF6 is necessary in MAVS and GP73 interaction, we made a series of lysine-to-arginine (K to R) point mutations on M11, which contains only four lysine residues. CoIP results showed the M11-KO mutant still interacted with GP73, suggesting polyubiquitination is not necessary for MAVS and GP73 interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006321.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrated that TIMs (TIM1, TIM2 and TIM3) are required for MAVS to interact with GP73, probably through activated TRAF6.</p>

<title>GP73 facilitates proteasome-dependent degradation of MAVS and TRAF6</title>
<p>Since GP73 interacts with MAVS/TRAF6, we determined whether GP73 affects the stability of MAVS/TRAF6. In HEK293 cells, MAVS and TRAF6 proteins were reduced in the presence of GP73 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006321.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), whereas TRAF3 and STING proteins were not affected by GP73 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006321.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). In addition, endogenous MAVS protein was attenuated by GP73 over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006321.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Furthermore, endogenous MAVS and TRAF6, but not IRF3 or IκBα, were up-regulated by GP73-shRNA#4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006321.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).

<p>There are at least three main systems for protein degradation: ubiquitin-proteasome, autophagosome and lysosome pathways. We evaluated which pathway is involved in GP73-mediated MAVS/TRAF6 degradation. MAVS protein was attenuated by GP73, and the degradation of MAVS was diminished by MG132 (proteasome inhibitor), but not by 3-MA (autophagosome inhibitor), CQ (lysosome inhibitor) or Z-VAD-FMK (apoptosis inhibitor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006321.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Similarly, TRAF6 protein was reduced by GP73, and such reduction was blocked by MG132 and BTZ (proteasome inhibitors), but not by CQ (lysosome inhibitor) or BFA (an inhibitor that disrupts the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of GP73) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref033">33</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006321.g005">Fig 5G</xref>).

<p>We discovered a key function of GP73 in the regulation of host innate immunity and revealed a novel mechanism by which GP73 regulates HCV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006321.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Initially, we showed that HCV infection activates GP73 in patients’ serum, PHHs and human hepatoma cells. Subsequently, we demonstrated that GP73 in turn binds directly with MAVS and TRAF6 to promote MAVS/TRAF6 degradation, which result in the repression of host innate immunity and facilitation of HCV infection.</p>

<p>It is known that the mitochondrial-associated ER membrane (MAM) is the major site of MAVS signaling, and HCV NS3/4A protease cleaves MAVS synapse from MAM, but not from mitochondria, to ablate immune defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref029">29</xref>]. Upon RIG-I/MDA5 activation, MAVS forms large prion-like aggregates to propagate antiviral innate immunity by recruiting TRAF2/3/6 E3 ubiquitin ligases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref034">34</xref>]. ER-to-Golgi transport compartments mediate the dynamic association of TRAF3 with MAVS at MAM, leading to inducing innate immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref035">35</xref>]. Our studies showed that GP73, a resident Golgi membrane protein, is recruited to MAVS/TRAF6 signalosome on MAM to inhibit immune defenses against HCV infection, which highlight the roles of Golgi apparatus and membrane compartments traffic in modulating innate immunity. Proteomic analysis during RNA virus infection also indicates GP73 traffic to MAM during RNA virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref036">36</xref>]. Knock-down of <italic>GP73</italic> in Huh7-MAVSR cells transfected with <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed HCV genomic RNA activates IFN production, whereas in Huh7 cells transfected with J6/JFH1-Rluc RNA impairs HCV replication. We could not exclude the possibility that GP73 may have other strategies to facilitate HCV infection, such as promoting HCV particle assembly and secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref024">24</xref>], or mediating MAVS-NS3/4A interaction on MAM. We also reported that GP73 mediates the interaction of ApoE and HCV NS5A to promote viral secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref037">37</xref>]. Further studies are needed to clarify other functions of GP73 in HCV life cycle and HCV associated liver diseases.</p>
<p>Negative regulation of innate immunity plays an important role in maintaining the balance of cell signaling. The adaptor protein MAVS and the ubiquitin E3 ligase TRAF6 play central roles in virus-triggered innate immunity. We revealed that GP73 interacts with TRAF6/MAVS and the interaction of GP73 with MAVS is dependent on TRAF-interacting-motifs. Because after TRAF6 recruitment by MAVS activation, TRAF6 synthesizes polyubiquitin chains on MAVS followed by the recruitment of TBK1 and IKKβ, leading to MAVS phosphorylation and subsequent IRF3 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref009">9</xref>]. Possibilities are existed that the polyubiquitination or phosphorylation modifications serve as scaffolds for GP73 binding, just likes the model of TBK1 and IRF3 binding to MAVS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref009">9</xref>]. The M11-KO mutant CoIP and <italic>in vitro</italic> GST pull-down experiments further indicated the direct binding of GP73 with MAVS, but not the polyubiquitin chains. TRAF6 is known as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, while K48-linked polyubiquitination chains target proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation. As not an E3 ubiquitin ligase, GP73 must recruit E3 ligases to MAVS/TRAF6 signalosome to synthesize K48-linked polyubiquitin chains. The exact E3 ligase involved in GP73-mediated proteasome degradation of MAVS/TRAF6 remains unidentified.</p>
<p>More recently, it reported that single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of <italic>GP73</italic> is associated with cytokine signaling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon bacteria and fungi stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006321.ref038">38</xref>]. This study further expands that GP73 acts as a negative regulator of innate immunity to facilitate HCV infection by interacting with MAVS/TRAF6 to promote MAVS/TRAF6 degradation. We also showed that GP73 plays a stimulatory role in VSV replication. Taken together, these results suggested that GP73 plays a broad role in the regulation of pathogen infection, including fungi, bacteria and viruses. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of HCV infection and pathogenesis, and also suggests that GP73 acts as a potential antiviral target in the prevention and treatment of pathogen infections.</p>
