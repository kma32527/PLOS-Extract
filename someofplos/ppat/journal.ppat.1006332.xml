<abstract>
<p>Cell cycle of <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic>, the etiological agent of amoebiasis, follows a novel pathway, which includes nuclear division without the nuclear membrane disassembly. We report a nuclear localized Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> (abbreviated hereafter as EhCaBP6), which is associated with microtubules. We determined the 3D solution NMR structure of EhCaBP6, and identified one unusual, one canonical and two non-canonical cryptic EF-hand motifs. The cryptic EF-II and EF-IV pair with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding EF-I and EF-III, respectively, to form a two-domain structure similar to Calmodulin and Centrin proteins. Downregulation of EhCaBP6 affects cell proliferation by causing delays in transition from G1 to S phase, and inhibition of DNA synthesis and cytokinesis. We also demonstrate that EhCaBP6 modulates microtubule dynamics by increasing the rate of tubulin polymerization. Our results, including structural inferences, suggest that EhCaBP6 is an unusual CaBP involved in regulating cell proliferation in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> similar to nuclear Calmodulin.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p><italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>, the etiological agent of amoebiasis, is a protozoan parasite responsible for around 100,000 deaths per year in developing nations. Though the organism has been identified more than 100 years back, there is not much understanding about the biology of this organism. Calcium signaling plays an important role in the biology of this organism. Here we show structure-functional relationship of one of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins (abbreviated as EhCaBP6) and suggest its involvement in cell division in this parasite. EhCaBP6, a nucleo-cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein, is a microtubule end binding protein and overexpression of its gene induces an increase in number of microtubular assemblies in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>. Cell division cycle in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> occurs along the microtubular structures without disruption of nuclear envelope. Occurrence of multinucleated cells in culture suggests duplication and reduplication of nuclear DNA without cytokinesis. Although Kinesin like protein (Klp1), Formin1 and EhCaBP6 were shown to be part of the microtubular assembly, their role in regulation of the cell cycle is not yet documented. Further, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> does not have a typical CaM like protein. However, the 3D structure of EhCaBP6 with two Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites is similar to CaM, in spite of their low sequence similarity. Here, we demonstrate that EhCaBP6 regulates cell cycle specifically by facilitating DNA synthesis, transition from G1 to S phase and cytokinesis. The structural and functional similarity between EhCaBP6 and CaM suggests EhCaBP6 to be a functional homologue of nuclear CaM with important roles in regulation of cell cycle.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins (CaBPs) such as Calmodulin (CaM), Centrins and Annexins have been implicated in cell cycle regulation and progression in many eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref002">2</xref>]. The <italic>in-vivo</italic> and <italic>in-vitro</italic> cell culture studies have revealed spikes in the levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the G1 and G1/S boundaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref004">4</xref>]. The nuclear localized CaM plays the role of a major signal-transducing factor during the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref005">5</xref>]. CaM associates with the microtubule organizing centre (MTOC) and acts as the key molecule that couples cell cycle with Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref007">7</xref>]. The levels of intracellular CaM were found to increase during the G1/S transition in normal human fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref008">8</xref>]. Centrins, also known as Caltractins, are a family of EF-hand Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding phosphoproteins found in the centrosomes of eukaryotes. Centrins are present in the centrioles and they are required for the centriole duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref010">10</xref>]. They are also considered to play a role in severing of microtubules by causing calcium-mediated contraction. Similar function has been established for the Centrin homologue in yeast, CDC31 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref011">11</xref>]. Cells in the mutant strain of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, lacking this protein, do not divide despite having grown abnormally large and having accumulated double the amount of DNA. Centrins undergo phosphorylation during G2/M phase boundary, thus assisting in the chromosome separation and mitotic spindle assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref012">12</xref>]. Moreover, CaBP Annexin II was shown to have an increased expression in HeLa cells at the G1/S and S/G2 boundaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref013">13</xref>]. Taken together, a significant role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and CaBPs emerges in the regulation of cell cycle progression.</p>
<p><italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> encodes twenty-seven Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins (CaBPs): a fact alluding to the existence of an extensive Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling system in this protist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref015">15</xref>]. The structural and functional characterization of a few of these EhCaBPs has implicated their role in phagocytosis and pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref018">18</xref>]. However, as observed in other organisms many of these CaBPs have the potential to be involved in a diverse array of cellular functions. Interestingly, the homolog of the ubiquitous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein CaM present in almost all eukaryotic cells, has not been found in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>, though there is a database entry in the name of CaM. Sequence analysis revealed EhCaBP3 as the closest homolog (49% sequence identity) among all CaBPs. However, functionally EhCaBP3 is found to be distinctly different from CaM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref017">17</xref>]. This is also reflected in sequence similarity analysis as CaMs of different species are highly conserved. One of these CaBPs, designated as EhCaBP6, has been reported to be abundantly localized in the nucleus near the microtubule ends and also concentrated along the intercellular bridge with the microtubules during the cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref019">19</xref>]. The overexpression of EhCaBP6 was correlated with a significant increase in the number of microtubular assemblies suggesting that this protein is involved in the regulation of chromosomal segregation and cytokinesis in this protozoan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref019">19</xref>]. Cell division cycle in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> has been shown to occur along the microtubular assemblies without disruption of the nuclear envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref021">21</xref>]. Occurrence of multinucleated cells in cell culture suggested duplication and reduplication of nuclear DNA without cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref023">23</xref>]. Although Kinesin like protein (Klp1), Formin1 and EhCaBP6 were shown to be part of the microtubular assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref025">25</xref>], their role in regulation of the cell cycle is not yet documented. Further, although CaM activity was biochemically shown in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>, the presence of a typical CaM protein with high sequence and functional similarity is not yet reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref026">26</xref>].</p>

<p>We set out to determine the 3D solution NMR structure of EhCaBP6 as a prelude to understand the structural and functional homologs of EhCaBP6 (if any), and to investigate its role in regulating cell cycle. EhCaBP6 is a monomeric protein with molecular weight of 18 kDa. The 3D structure revealed one unusual (EF-I; defined later), one canonical (EF-III) and two non-canonical (cryptic EF-II and EF-IV) EF-hands (see Scheme I). The cryptic EF-II and EF-IV pair with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding EF-I and EF-III, respectively, and thus form a two-domain structure as in the case of CaM and Centrin proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref029">29</xref>]. The observed structural similarity between EhCaBP6 and CaM, despite their low sequence identity, suggests that they may be having similar functions during the cell cycle. Exploring this hypothesis, we investigated the localization and interaction of EhCaBP6 with microtubules at different stages of the cell cycle using confocal imaging, immuno-precipitation and co-sedimentation studies. Further, we investigated the role of EhCaBP6 in the regulation of amoebic cell cycle specifically by facilitating DNA synthesis and transition from G1 to S phase. The downregulation of EhCaBP6 has been shown to affect cellular proliferation (by causing delay in G1-S transition), DNA synthesis and cytokinesis. Overall our results show the importance of EhCaBP6 in the regulation of cell proliferation in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>, a feature not observed in other parasites.</p>

<title>EhCaBP6 exists as a predominantly α–helical stable monomer</title>
<p>The purity and molecular size of protein was checked using gel-filtration chromatography, mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The protein showed a single band in SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s001">S1A Fig</xref>) indicative of its purity and molecular size. The MALDI-TOF data showed a strong peak at 18.488 kDa and a weak peak at 9.240 kDa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s001">S1B Fig</xref>), which correspond to mono- and doubly-charged states of the protein, respectively. The hydrodynamic radius as determined by DLS was found to be 2.3 nm, which corresponds to the monomeric form of EhCaBP6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). These results suggest that the protein exists in a monomeric state under the chosen experimental conditions.</p>
<p>The far-UV circular dichroism (CD) experiments were performed with EhCaBP6 to characterize the secondary structural elements in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound form. The far -UV CD spectra exhibited a minima near 208 nm (π–π*) and 222 nm (n-π*), which are characteristic signatures of α–helical conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref030">30</xref>]. The molar ellipticity in far-UV CD spectra was earlier used to characterize the secondary structure content of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref019">19</xref>], which also revealed that protein adopts predominantly an α–helical conformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s001">S1D Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Identification of EF-hand motifs and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding properties in EhCaBP6</title>
<p>Many Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding proteins (CaBPs) consist of two domains with a linker having a pair of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding motifs in each domain and the metal binding has been shown to be highly cooperative in nature. Study of sequence homology showed the presence of one unusual (EF-I) and one canonical (EF-III) EF-hand in EhCaBP6. The unusual character of the EF-I is attributed to the presence of Gln (Q34) residue at the 12<sup>th</sup> position of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loop instead of a highly conserved Glu or Asp. It is worth mentioning here that E to Q point mutation was used in the past to convert an active Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site into a cryptic one that does not bind Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Intriguingly, the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data showed that EhCaBP6 binds two Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a sequential manner, implicating that EF-I retains the ability to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref019">19</xref>]. The binding affinities (K<sub>1</sub>: 1.07×10<sup>5</sup> ± 1.1×10<sup>4</sup>, K<sub>2</sub>: 4.44×10<sup>3</sup> ± 1.1×10<sup>2</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>) were reported to be comparatively lower, which could be attributed to the unusual primary structure of EF-hands. NMR Ca<sup>2+</sup>-titration experiments carried out with apo-EhCaBP6 confirmed the two Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites. The <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H peaks arising from G28 and G101 at the sixth position of EF-I and EF-III were used as markers to identify the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The appearance of these two downfield shifted peaks indicated the presence of two Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites. Since NMR can give the amino acid residue level information, we monitored the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-filling pathways and noticed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> indeed binds sequentially, first to EF-I and then to EF-III (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). We have carried out site-directed mutagenesis of residues belonging to EF-I (D23A, D25A) and EF-III (D96A and D98A) in order to confirm their role in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The 2D-[<sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H]-HSQC of such mutant recorded in the presence or absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> were similar and did not show Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding signatures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>The structure of EhCaBP6</title>
<p>As mentioned above, EhCaBP6 has one unusual (EF-I), one canonical (EF-III) and two non-canonical (EF-II and EF-IV), EF-hands. NMR and ITC data confirm the EF-I and EF-III to be the two putative Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding EF-hands. On the other hand, the EF-II and EF-IV were found to be cryptic EF-hands that still pair with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding EF-I and EF-III, respectively, to form a two-domain structure similar to CaM. The 3D structure of EhCaBP6 was determined using NMR data as described in Methods. A superposition of NMR derived 20 minimum energy conformers of the NTD and CTD is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006332.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>, respectively. Each domain behaved independently and hence exhibited structural heterogeneity when aligned with respect to one another. NMR structures within a given domain showed good convergence with low root-mean-square-deviations (RMSD) of 0.7 and 0.6 for NTD and CTD, respectively and well-defined tertiary folds. The structural statistics shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006332.t002">Table 2</xref> support this conclusion. The minimum energy structures of EhCaBP6, having the least residual target functions were chosen as representative structures of NTD and CTD as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006332.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>, respectively. The central linker region however exhibits large flexibility, suggesting the spatial heterogeneity of the two-domains, with an overall RMSD of 7.0 for full-length protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s005">S5 Fig</xref>; <italic>pdb id</italic>: 5B7X). Poor convergence of the full-length protein was due to the lack of sufficient nOes in the linker region and also due to the absence of any inter-domain long-distance constraints. As mentioned earlier, the EF-I exhibits an unusual EF-hand with a Gln residue at its 12<sup>th</sup> position of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loop. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-coordination geometry of EF-I of EhCaBP6 was found to be octahedral in geometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), instead of the pentagonal bipyramidal geometry, which is typically observed in EF-hand CaBPs. The octahedral geometry is similar to that of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-coordination present in other CaM like CaBPs.</p>

<title>EhCaBP6 does not participate in phagocytosis</title>
<p>A number of EhCaBPs (EhCaBP1, EhCaBP3, EhCaBP5) have been shown to participate in phagocytosis, thereby influencing pathogenesis in amoebiasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref018">18</xref>]. Each of these proteins performs different roles during phagocytosis. However, unlike EhCaBP1, EhCaBP3 or EhCaBP5, EhCaBP6 was not found at phagocytic cups during the initiation or in phagosomes after completion of phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Taken together, this data suggest that EhCaBP6 does not participate in erythrophagocytosis.</p>

<title>EhCaBP6 interacts with Ehβ–tubulin in micro-tubular structures</title>
<p>The nuclear EhCaBP6 did not appear to come out of the nucleus at any given instant of time during the cell cycle or during phagocytosis. Its involvement in cell division was proposed to be via association with microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref019">19</xref>]. We visualized EhCaBP6 at different stages of the cell cycle using confocal imaging. Cell division in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> spans for a period of 8–10 h and during this period, EhCaBP6 was found in various micro-tubular structures that ranged from a speculated <italic>Micro-Tubule Organizing Centre</italic> (MTOC), which was characterized by an intense dot-like structure in the middle of the nucleus, to radial arrays of Ehβ–tubulin radiating from it. EhCaBP6 was thus observed to co-localize with Ehβ–tubulin along the spindle fibers and with the segregated DNA of anaphase-like nucleus. Further, we observed co-localization of EhCaBP6 and Ehβ–tubulin along the intracellular bridge in physically separated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006332.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In all of these micro-tubular structures, EhCaBP6 was found to co-localize with Ehβ–tubulin with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.93 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006332.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>

<title>EhCaBP6 interacts with microtubule and not with monomer of β–tubulin</title>
<p>To validate the interaction between Ehβ–tubulin and EhCaBP6, we carried out EhCaBP6 pull down assay using total HM1 lysate. Ehβ–tubulin was found to be immuno-precipitated by the EhCaBP6 antibody suggesting that these two proteins indeed interact with each other. Intriguingly, we observed that the interaction between EhCaBP6 and Eh β–tubulin did not require Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the interaction was also noticed in the presence of EGTA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Further, EhCaBP6 binding to monomeric or polymeric forms of Ehβ–tubulin was tested using <italic>Surface Plasmon Resonance</italic> (SPR) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Bovine β–tubulin was used in these <italic>in-vitro</italic> experiments due to the availability of highly pure form of the protein. SPR experiment indicated a low binding affinity of 2 mM with the monomeric form of bovine β–tubulin. The interaction between EhCaBP6 and monomeric form of bovine β–tubulin was unaffected by the presence or the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. To test whether EhCaBP6 binds polymerized β–tubulin, microtubule co-sedimentation assay was carried out in the presence and the absence of 1 mM GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006332.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The results showed an interaction of EhCaBP6 with the microtubule in the presence of 1 mM GTP and 20 μM Taxol. A significant amount of EhCaBP6 was found in the pellet fraction along with microtubules while in the absence of GTP neither EhCaBP6 nor tubulin was present in the pellet fraction. Taken together, we conclude that EhCaBP6 binds microtubule in a GTP dependent manner, while a low affinity binding takes place with the monomeric form of β–tubulin in a GTP independent manner.</p>

<p>Our analysis suggested that EhCaBP6 associates with microtubules. We employed light scattering assay to investigate the role of EhCaBP6 in modulating microtubule dynamics by studying its effect on tubulin polymerization. In the presence of EhCaBP6, we observed enhanced rates of tubulin polymerization in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006332.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The rate of tubulin polymerization in the presence of EhCaBP6 was twofold as compared to its absence. Besides, EhCaBP6 alone did not show self-polymerization, thus suggesting that EhCaBP6 indeed affects microtubule dynamics. Further, densitometric analysis of the observed turbidity in each reaction (post assay) showed increased turbidity with an increase in EhCaBP6 concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006332.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>The role of EhCaBP6 in cell proliferation was further studied by expression downregulation using the gene in sense and antisense orientation in tetracycline inducible vector Tet-O-CAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006332.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Cell lines harboring the constructs of EhCaBP6 were analyzed for expression of the gene post-induction with varying concentration of tetracycline. The western analysis of total lysate probed with anti-m-EhCaBP6 antibody revealed significant reduction (50%) in expression of EhCaBP6 in antisense cell line upon induction with 30 μg/ml of tetracycline as compared to wild-type HM1, tetracycline induced vector control (TOC) or uninduced antisense cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006332.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).

EhCaBP6 being a nucleo-cytosolic protein, the effect of its downregulation was studied on the rate of cell proliferation and DNA synthesis.

<title>EhCaBP6 downregulation perturbs and delays transition from G1 to S phase</title>
<p>H<sup>3</sup>-thymidine incorporation assay suggested that EhCaBP6 affects DNA synthesis. FACS analysis of G1 synchronized cell culture was performed to clearly demarcate which phase of the cell division cycle was inhibited. In tetracycline induced vector control (TOC), 99% of cells were obtained in G1 phase at 0 time. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006332.g006">Fig 6A</xref>. At 4 h, post-induction mixed population of cells were obtained containing 79% cells in G1 phase and 21% cells in S phase whereas no G2 phase was observed. On further incubation proportion of cells in G1 further decreased with concomitant increase of cells at S phase. At 8h, G2 phase cells start appearing and by 10 h no S phase cells were seen suggesting that the cells were undergoing next round of cell division and DNA synthesis occurs between 4 to 8 h of cell division cycle in normal cells. Based on these results, we infer that in normal proliferating cells, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006332.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), DNA synthesis occurs between 4–8 h of cell division cycle.</p>

<p>In the sense cell line of EhCaBP6, significant percent of cells (91%) were observed in S phase at 6 h, subsequently the number gradually declined. At 8 h, we visualized G2 cell population (69%), with 31% cells still in S phase and no G1 phase cell population. However, at 10 h we could see reappearance of G1 cell population (61%) suggesting that the cells are undergoing next round of cell division. Contrary to the vector control and sense cell lines, the antisense cell line failed to transit from G1 phase with a small fraction of cells (25%) in S phase and no G2 phase cells till 10 h. Thus, we conclude that EhCaBP6 down-regulation perturbs DNA synthesis (S phase) besides the transition from G1 to G2 phase. This is likely to be a possible reason behind reduced cell proliferation. Quantitative analysis of cells at different phases further suggested that there is a delayed S phase in the antisense EhCaBP6 cell line and a failure in transition from G1 to G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006332.g006">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s014">S1 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>EhCaBP6 perturbs cytokinesis in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic></title>
<p>In normal proliferating cells, EhCaBP6 was observed to line-up the inter-nuclear and inter-cellular bridges along with Eh-β-tubulin. Hence, we attempted to investigate the possible role of EhCaBP6 in cytokinesis. The EhCaBP6 downregulated cell line was serum synchronized and immunostaining was performed after induction with 30 μg/ml of tetracycline. Interestingly, we observed truncated nuclear structures with peripheral nuclear localization of EhCaBP6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006332.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). No significant co-localization of EhCaBP6 and Ehβ-tubulin was observed along the truncated nuclear structures and inter-nuclear bridges as evident from intensity profile analysis and Pearson’s correlation coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006332.g008">Fig 8B and 8C</xref>). Thus, suggesting a possible role of EhCaBP6 in cytokinesis. In case of nuclear division followed by failed cytokinesis we expect to observe accumulation of cells with multiple nuclei. Therefore, we quantitated the percentage of multinucleation in various cell lines under study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006332.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Quantitative analysis for a period of 72 h suggested enhanced multinucleation in the antisense cell line as compared to the cells with only the vector or the sense cell line. Taken together we conclude that EhCaBP6 may have a role in cytokinesis.</p>

<title>Depletion of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> led to translocation of EhCaBP6 from nucleus to cytoplasm</title>
<p>We hypothesized that Ca<sup>2+</sup> may play an important role in determining the subcellular localization of EhCaBP6. In order to test this hypothesis, EhCaBP6 localization was studied upon treatment of cells with BAPTA-AM, an intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-chelator (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Immuno-staining was carried out after the treatment of cells with different concentrations of BAPTA-AM for 30 min. The study showed gradual translocation of EhCaBP6 from nucleus to cytoplasm with increasing concentrations of BAPTA-AM. This was validated by cellular fractionation of untreated and 500 μM BAPTA-AM treated HM1 cells followed by western blot analysis of the fractions using anti-m-EhCaBP6 antibody. Immuno-staining of western blotted antigens showed enrichment of EhCaBP6 in the cytoplasmic fraction upon treatment with 500 μM BAPTA-AM. Further, in the presence of ionomycin, that allows increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, EhCaBP6 remained inside the nucleus.</p>
<p>Further, we went on to investigate if cytosolic shuttling of EhCaBP6 upon BAPTA-AM treatment is a direct or indirect effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion. To begin with we generated a Ca<sup>2+</sup> defective mutant (EhCaBP6ΔEF) of EhCaBP6 tagged with GFP at the N-terminal and transfected the construct into <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> trophozoites. Binding studies carried out using ITC of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> defective mutant confirmed loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding ability with very low Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding affinities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). The expression of GFP-tagged EhCaBP6ΔEF and native protein in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> trophozoites increased with increasing concentration of G418 as seen in the western blots using anti-GFP antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s012">S12A Fig</xref>). Imaging of GFP-EhCaBP6ΔEF showed that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding defective mutant also resides in the nucleus similar to that of the native EhCaBP6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s012">S12B and S12C Fig</xref>). Hence, we conclude that the shuttling of EhCaBP6 between cytoplasm and nucleus is indeed an indirect effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion and, may be brought about by other cellular or molecular factors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling has been demonstrated as one of the most pivotal pathways in amoebic pathogenesis. However, as pointed out earlier, the influence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in amoebic cells has not been extensively investigated till date. The occurrence of twenty-seven distinct CaBPs in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> suggests their massive contribution in the regulation of various Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling pathways. The involvement of a few CaBPs in phagocytosis and gene expression underlines the need for further detailed studies with other CaBPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>We have determined 3D solution structure of EhCaBP6 by NMR and investigated its role in cell cycle. The results reported here, along with the past reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref019">19</xref>], suggest that EhCaBP6 is functionally different from other EhCaBPs studied so far. Strong evidence of co-localization with microtubules during various stages of the cell cycle and direct interaction with microtubules in a GTP-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent manner illuminated the particulars of its participation in the cell cycle.</p>
<p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling inside the nucleus is important in many essential cellular processes including cell division cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref005">5</xref>]. Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are shown to regulate various checkpoints of cell division through CaBPs that activate the downstream processes. This signaling pathway is generally mediated by CaM in other eukaryotic systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref002">2</xref>]. The absence of CaM in the genome of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> entails the existence of another functionally analogous candidate involved in cell cycle regulation. EhCaBP6 protein was thus considered as a viable alternative molecule modulating the cell cycle. As nuclear membrane of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> does not disintegrate during cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref021">21</xref>], it is not surprising that EhCaBP6 continues to be localized within the nucleus during the cell division which is important for its involvement in nuclear division. This is in contrast to the behavior of the nuclear EhCaBP3, which migrates to the cytoplasm during phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref017">17</xref>]. EhCaBP6 can, therefore, be classified into a protein class distinct from EhCaBP3 and other EhCaBPs studied so far.</p>
<p>Our sequence analysis results, complemented with ITC and NMR data, revealed that EhCaBP6 has two Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites (D23-Q34 and D96-D107). The EF-I of EhCaBP6 (D23-Q34) showed unusual Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding as it has Gln (Q34) at the twelfth position of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding loop instead of the highly conserved Glu/Asp in the other EF hands. The Q34 coordinates to Ca<sup>2+</sup> through its side-chain amide oxygen atom forming an octahedral geometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), a feature of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding, which was characterized on the basis of the paramagnetic titration experiments, where the side-chain NH<sub>2</sub> protons of Q34 were seen to completely broaden out in the presence of paramagnetic Ce<sup>3+</sup>. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-titration data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) of apo- to holo-EhCaBP6 revealed sequential occupancy of the two sites present in EhCaBP6, with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding first to the EF-I in the NTD, followed by its binding to the EF-III in the CTD as monitored by the downfield shift of Gly peaks upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006332.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>As reported, the NMR results suggested that the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>2</sub>-EhCaBP6 predominantly exists in an α–helical conformation with four short stretches of β-strands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref032">32</xref>]. The EF-hands within a protein can have different binding affinities for metal ions, and their pairing results in cooperativity having a functional consequence on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding along with maintaining structural stability of the metal binding motif and the domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref033">33</xref>]. Proteins containing four EF-hand motifs usually have two domains. Each of the domains is formed by a pair of EF-hands, usually separated by a flexible linker, which could be extended in forming classical dumbbell structures seen for CaM and troponin C. The structural characterization of EhCaBP1 and EhCaBP2 revealed presence of two-domain structures with four EF-hands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref035">35</xref>]. On the other hand, EhCaM (EhCaBP3) was shown to possess a pair of EF-hands (EF-I and EF-II) in its NTD and a completely unstructured CTD having a lone unpaired non-canonical EF-hand (EF-III) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref036">36</xref>]. The NMR derived 3D-structure of EhCaBP6 showed that EhCaBP6 has one unusual (EF-I; D23-Q34), one canonical (EF-III; D96-D107) and two non-canonical (cryptic) (EF-II and EF-IV) EF-hands. The cryptic EF-II and EF-IV pair with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding EF-I and EF-III, respectively, and provide the structural stability to form a two-domain structure similar to CaM and centrin proteins. The structural similarity between EhCaBP6 and CaM, despite their low sequence similarity, provides a compelling evidence for EhCaBP6 as a functional replacement of CaM in cell division. This has further been supported by the increased rate of tubulin polymerization in the presence of EhCaBP6. Localization of EhCaBP6 in the nucleus does not allow this protein to be an overall functional equivalent of CaM. In that sense it displays properties of CaM, associated with cell division.</p>
<p>The downregulation of EhCaBP6 in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> cells resulted in decreased cell proliferation and DNA synthesis. We also observed a delayed transition between G1 to S phase and failed cytokinesis upon downregulation of EhCaBP6. Numerous reports on studies of different cell types have proven that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM mediated signaling intricately regulates the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref002">2</xref>]. CaM was reported to be indispensable for DNA synthesis; its inhibition causes delays in G1/S, G2/M and metaphase-anaphase transition. In HeLa cell lines, CaM was reported to be localized with central spindles and abnormal distribution of CaM resulted in inhibition of cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref006">6</xref>]. Number of studies in mammalian cells have shown that a defect in cytokinesis can lead to polyploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref037">37</xref>]. In these systems a large number of proteins are involved in not only cytokinesis, but also different check point controls. Unfortunately, very little is known in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> except for the presence of a few homologs identified through sequence similarity searches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006332.ref038">38</xref>]. Therefore, identification of EhCaBP6 as a potential cytokinesis and cell division regulating molecule is likely to help understand this complex process in this important parasite. We conclude from this study that EhCaBP6 is a CaM like protein, which regulates cell cycle in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> cells.</p>

A total of 1003 distance constraints, which included 465 intra-residue, 428 inter-residue (sequential), 59 medium-range, and 51 long-range distance constraints, were used in the structure calculation. Hydrogen bond constraints were added for residues that are involved in α–helical and β–sheet conformation. These secondary structural elements were characterized by the chemical shift indices and <sup>3</sup>J(<sup>1</sup>H<sup>N</sup>-<sup>1</sup>HA) values derived from GFT (3, 2)D HNHA, and were further supported by calculating deuterium exchange rates. A total of 78 H-bond constraints were used during the structure calculation. The dihedral angle constraints were derived from TALOS using the backbone <sup>1</sup>HA, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>13</sup>CA, <sup>13</sup>CB, and <sup>13</sup>CO chemical shift values. A total of 252 (φand ψ) dihedral angle constraints were used in the structure calculation of EhCaBP6 in its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound state.</p>
<p>Crystallographic data on several EF-hand proteins suggest that in a canonical Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loop there is a strong hydrogen bond formed between the side-chain carboxyl oxygen of Asp at position 1 and the backbone <sup>1</sup>H<sup>N</sup> of the Gly residue at position 6. In the present case, the <sup>1</sup>H<sup>N</sup> of Gly-28 and Gly-101 are involved in such hydrogen bonding, causing a downfield chemical shift in their spectral signatures. Further, this led to the appearance of corresponding <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H<sup>N</sup> correlations 2D [<sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H] HSQC in a non-overlapping region. It has also been found from crystallographic studies on several EF-hand CaBPs that Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordinates directly with the highly homologous residues at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, and 12 of individual Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops. In the present case, the coordinating residues in EF-I and EF-III could be confirmed by paramagnetic titration experiments, where in Ca<sup>2+</sup> is displaced by a trivalent Ce<sup>3+</sup> in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>2</sub>-EhCaBP6, which results in the broadening of the spectral signatures of the coordinating residues. The information thus derived was used in the final stages of structure determination and refinement. The upper bound distance constraints between the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and residues at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, and 12 were thus varied from 3 Å to 4.5 Å to fix the Ca<sup>2+</sup> within the two Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding loops EF-I and EF-III.</p>
