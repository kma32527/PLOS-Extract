<abstract>
<p>Post-translational modification by the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) regulates a variety of cellular functions, and is hijacked by viruses to remodel the host cell during latent and productive infection. Here we have monitored the activity of the SUMO conjugation machinery in cells productively infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We found that SUMO2/3 conjugates accumulate during the late phase of the productive virus cycle, and identified several viral proteins as bone fide SUMOylation substrates. Analysis of the mechanism involved in the accumulation of SUMOylated proteins revealed upregulation of several components of the SUMO-conjugation machinery and post-transcriptional downregulation of the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase RNF4. The latter effect was mediated by selective inhibition of RNF4 protein expression by the viral miR-BHRF1-1. Reconstitution of RNF4 in cells expressing an inducible miR-BHRF1-1 sponge or a miR-BHRF1-1 resistant RNF4 was associated with reduced levels of early and late viral proteins and impaired virus release. These findings illustrate a novel strategy for viral interference with the SUMO pathway, and identify the EBV miR-BHRF1-1 and the cellular RNF4 as regulators of the productive virus cycle.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>We have investigated the activity of the SUMOylation machinery in cells infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human herpesvirus that infects B-lymphocytes and is associated with malignancies. We found that activation of the productive virus cycle is accompanied by accumulation of SUMO conjugates, upregulation of components of the SUMO conjugation machinery, and downregulation of the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase RNF4. The decrease of RNF4 is due to post-transcriptional downregulation by miR-BHRF1-1, a member of the BHRF1 microRNA cluster that is upregulated during productive infection. The effect of miR-BHRF1-1 was confirmed in luciferase reported assays, by mutation of the RNF4 3â€™UTR seed site, by transfection of a synthetic miR-BHRF1-1 mimic, by ectopic expression of miR-BHRF1-1 and by the reversal of RNF4 downregulation in cells expressing a miR-BHRF1-1 sponge. We also found that several early and late viral proteins are bona fide SUMOylation substrates. Reconstitution of RNF4 in productively infected cells was accompanied by proteasome-dependent degradation of the SUMOylated viral protein and by a significantly reduced virus yield. These findings illustrate a new strategy for viral interference with the SUMO pathway, an unexpected contribution of miR-BHRF1-1 to the productive cycle of EBV and a previously unrecognized role of the RNF4 ligase in the regulation of virus production.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Increasing evidence implicates post-translational modification by the small ubiquitin-like modifiers SUMO1, SUMO2 and SUMO3 in the regulation of a broad variety of cellular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref001">1</xref>]. Conjugation of the SUMO paralogs, SUMOylation, is a highly dynamic process, with dramatic changes occurring in response to different types of intracellular or exogenous stress, including oxidation, heat shock and hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref002">2</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Similar to ubiquitination, SUMOylation is a multistep process involving an activating enzyme, the SAE1/SAE2 heterodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref005">5</xref>], a conjugating enzyme, UBC9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref006">6</xref>], and one of several SUMO ligases, including the PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STATS) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref007">7</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref009">9</xref>]. SUMO2 and SUMO3 can polymerize to form polySUMO chains whereas SUMO1 prevalently forms mono conjugates and may serve as terminator of mixed chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref010">10</xref>]. SUMO-specific peptidases, such as the six members of the SENP family, mediate the maturation of SUMO pro-peptides, remove SUMO from conjugates, and depolymerize SUMO chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref011">11</xref>]. In addition, the proteasome-dependent turnover of poly-SUMOylated proteins is modulated by SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs), such as the human RNF4 and RNF111 ligases, that recognize their SUMOylated substrates via multiple SUMO interacting motifs (SIMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Pathogenic viruses and intracellular bacteria adopt a variety of different strategies to interfere with SUMOylation in order to establish a cellular environment that is favorable to their survival and replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref013">13</xref>]. Bacteria examples include the <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> virulence protein YopJ that mimics the activity of SENPs to inhibit the MAPK signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref014">14</xref>], and the listeriolysin-O of <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> that promotes bacterial infection by inducing the proteasomal degradation of UBC9 through a yet unknown mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref015">15</xref>]. Different types of viruses exploit or inhibit SUMOylation during different phase of the infection. For example, SUMOylation regulates the function of many immediate-early (IE) and early (E) products of DNA viruses. These are often transcriptional factors, such as the IE1 and IE2 of cytomegalovirus (CMV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref017">17</xref>], E1 and E2 of human papillomavirus (HPV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref019">19</xref>], BZLF1 and BRLF1 of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref021">21</xref>], and the K-pZIP of Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) that also serves as a specific SUMO2/-3 ligase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref022">22</xref>]. Some virus structural proteins were shown to be SUMOylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref023">23</xref>]. The early proteins ICP0 of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref024">24</xref>] and K-Rta of KHSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref025">25</xref>] are STUbLs that inhibit antiviral responses by promoting the degradation of the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Viral proteins may modulate the SUMOylation of specific cellular proteins, including the tumor suppressor Rb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref026">26</xref>] and the transcriptional co-repressor KAP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref028">28</xref>], while the avian adenovirus Gaml protein promotes a global impairment of SUMOylation by interfering with the activity of the SAE1/SAE2 heterodimer and by reducing the expression of UBC9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>EBV is a gamma-herpesvirus that establishes latent infection in B-lymphocytes and is associated with lymphoid and epithelial cell malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref031">31</xref>]. The switch from latent to productive infection is mediated by products of the immediate early genes BZLF1 and BRLF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref032">32</xref>]. SUMO1, -2 and -3 modify BZLF1 on Lys12, which regulates its transcriptional activity and is at least partially responsible for the destruction of PML bodies during productive infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref033">33</xref>]. BRLF1 interacts with UBC9, RanBP2 and PIAS1 and is modified by the SUMO paralogs at multiple Lys residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref035">35</xref>]. Interaction with the EBV L2 protein promotes SUMOylation while inhibiting the transcriptional activity of BRLF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref035">35</xref>]. In addition, the early protein BGLF4 binds SUMO2 through N- and C-terminal SIM motifs. Mutation of the SIMs changes the intracellular localization of BGLF4 and inhibits its capacity to: regulate the SUMOylation of BZLF1, trigger the DNA damage response, and promote virus release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref036">36</xref>]. The latent membrane protein (LMP)-1 interacts with UBC9 via its C-terminal activating region (CTAR)-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref037">37</xref>], and promotes SUMOylation of the interferon regulatory factor IRF7, which limits the transcriptional activity of IRF7 and the activation of innate immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref038">38</xref>]. Collectively, these findings point to a pivotal role of SUMOylation in the regulation of both viral and cellular functions during different phases of EBV infection.</p>
<p>In this study, we have monitored the abundance of SUMO conjugates in EBV infected cells entering the productive virus cycle. We found that virus replication is accompanied by a robust accumulation of poly-SUMOylated proteins, which is mediated by transcriptional upregulation of several components of the SUMOylation machinery, and post-transcriptional downregulation of RNF4 due to selective blockade of RNF4 expression by the EBV encoded BHRF1-1 miRNA. Reversal of RNF4 downregulation in productively infected cells expressing a miR-BHRF1-1 sponge or a miR-BHRF1-1 resistant RNF4 was accompanied by reduced accumulation of SUMO conjugates, proteasome-dependent degradation of viral proteins and impaired release of infectious viral particles. Thus, miR-BHRF1-1 promotes virus production by regulating a RNF4-mediated cellular defense against infection.</p>

<title>Poly-SUMO conjugates accumulate during productive infection</title>
<p>The abundance of SUMO conjugates was monitored in Akata-Bx1 cells following induction of the productive virus cycle by cross-linking of surface IgG. Western blots of cell lysates prepared at different times post-induction in the presence of cysteine protease inhibitors that block the activity of SUMO deconjugases were probed with antibodies specific for the EBV transactivator BZLF1, SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The activation of productive infection was confirmed by detection of a strong BZLF1 specific band starting from 8 hrs post-induction, followed by the expression of early and late viral gene products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006338.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). Several distinct bands and a weak smear of high molecular weight species that are likely to correspond to mono-SUMOylated proteins and SUMO1 terminated poly-SUMO chains were detected by the SUMO1 specific antibody in untreated Akata-Bx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In agreement with the notion that poly-SUMO conjugates rapidly accumulate in stressed cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref039">39</xref>], a significantly increased intensity of the high molecular weight species was reproducibly observed after treatment for 1 h with the anti-IgG antibody, which corresponds to time 0 of the monitoring kinetics. However, while the increase of SUMO conjugates induced by acute stress is usually transient, in productively EBV infected cells the high molecular weight species progressively accumulated, reaching a maximum 72 hrs post-induction when monitoring was ended due to increasing cell death. Re-probing the blots with antibodies to SUMO2/3 revealed a similar increase in the intensity of high molecular weight species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), suggesting that productive EBV infection is specifically associated with the accumulation of poly-SUMO conjugates. The specificity of the effect was confirmed by the failure to accumulate poly-SUMO conjugates in anti-IgG treated EBV negative Akata cells and TPA/Bu treated AGS cells, whereas accumulation of SUMO2/3-reactive high molecular weight species was observed in EBV positive AGS-Bx1 upon induction of the productive virus cycle by treatment with TPA/Bu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). A similar virus reactivation-dependent accumulation of polySUMO conjugates was observed in TPA/Bu treated B95.8 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006338.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). It is noteworthy that the virus induced effect was clearly appreciated in all EBV positive cell lines tested in spite of widely different baseline abundance of SUMO conjugates.</p>

<title>The SUMO conjugation machinery is upregulated and RNF4 is post-transcriptionally downregulated in productively infected cells</title>
<p>The accumulation of poly-SUMO conjugates reflects a substantial remodeling of the SUMOylation machinery that may feature either enhanced conjugation or decreased turnover of the conjugates, due to impaired deconjugation or slowdown of ubiquitin-dependent degradation. To discriminate between these possibilities, the mRNA and protein levels of members of the SUMO conjugation cascade were monitored over time by specific qPCR and western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006338.s001">S1 Table</xref>). A progressive upregulation of SUMO2 mRNA was detected starting from 8 h post-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The SAE1 subunit of the SUMO activating enzyme, the SUMO ligase PIAS1 and PIAS3 and the SUMO specific proteases SENP1, SENP3, SENP6 and SENP7 that preferentially recognizes SUMO2/3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref040">40</xref>] were also significant upregulated with approximately the same kinetics, whereas the mRNA levels of SUMO1, SAE2, UBC9, SENP2, SENP5 and RNF4 were not significantly affected. The increase of SUMO2, SENP6 and to a minor extent PIAS1 mRNAs were paralleled by corresponding changes in the abundance of the encoded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). In contrast, a progressive decrease of RNF4 was observed starting from 24â€“48 hrs post induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>).</p>

<p>RNF4 was downregulated upon induction of the productive virus cycle in the EBV positive cell lines, Akata-Bx1 and AGS-Bx1, while this effect was not observed in the anti-IgG treated of EBV negative Akata and TPA/Bu treated AGS, suggesting that the loss of RNF4 is dependent on virus reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>).

<title>The EBV miR-BHRF1-1 inhibits RNF4 expression and promotes the accumulation of SUMO conjugates</title>
<p>MicroRNAs have emerged as an important means of viral interference with a variety of cellular functions and signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref041">41</xref>]. EBV infected cells express miRNAs encoded in two clusters located in the BHRF1 and BART regions of the viral genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref042">42</xref>]. The BHRF1 cluster is selectively upregulated during productive infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref043">43</xref>] and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006338.s004">S3 Fig</xref>, suggesting that one or more of the encoded miRNAs may target RNF4. This possibility was substantiated by scanning the 3â€™UTR of RNF4 with six open source miRNA target prediction programs, which consistently identified high confidence target sites for the BHRF1-1 miRNA (henceforth indicated as miR-BHRF1-1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006338.s005">S4 Fig</xref>). The prediction was tested by measuring the effect of the miRNAs on the expression of an RNF4-3â€™UTR-LUC reporter. A significant reduction of luciferase activity was reproducibly observed when the reporter was co-transfected in HEK293T cells together with a plasmid expressing miR-BHRF1-1, whereas expression of miR-BHRF1-2 or miR-BHRF1-3 had only slight effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The specificity of the inhibition was confirmed by mutation of the predicted miR-BHRF1-1 seed site in the RNF4-3â€™UTR. A highly significant reduction of the inhibitory effect of miR-BHRF1-1 was observed when the RNF4-3â€™UTR seed sequence TCAGGTT was mutated to T<underline>ACA</underline>GTT whereas a weaker but still significant reduction was observed with the TCA<underline>ATC</underline>T mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), which may be due to different effects of the mutations on the affinity of binding to the RNF4 mRNA. The inhibitory effect of miR-BHRF1-1 was further substantiated by a dose-dependent decrease of RNF4 in Akata-Bx1 cells transfected with a corresponding synthetic oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess whether the capacity of miR-BHRF1-1 to inhibit RNF4 is also observed in a relevant cell type and under physiological levels of expression, Akata-Bx1 was stably transduced with recombinant lentiviruses expressing miR-BHRF1-1 under the control of a doxycycline-regulated promoter. Treatment of the transduced cells with doxycycline resulted in more than 10-fold increase in the levels of the miRNAs relative to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), which is similar to the expression of the endogenous miRNA during productive infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006338.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). Expression of miR-BHRF1-1 alone, in the absence of other lytic viral products, was sufficient for significant reduction of the RNF4 protein levels, while expression of a control scrambled miRNA had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g005">Fig 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>We next asked whether the upregulation of miR-BHRF1-1 is responsible for the decrease of RNF4 and accumulation of polySUMO conjugates in productively infected cells. To this end, Akata-Bx1 cells were stably transduced with a recombinant lentivirus expressing a doxycycline-regulated miR-BHRF1-1 sponge. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g006">Fig 6</xref>, expression of the sponge had no significant effect on the expression of either miR-BHRF1-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) or RNF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>) in untreated Akata-Bx1, whereas it significantly reduced the upregulation of miR-BHRF1-1 and the downregulation of RNF4 in anti-IgG treated cells. In line with the possibility that the miR-BHFR1-1 mediated downregulation of RNF4 may be responsible for the accumulation of polySUMO conjugates, expression of the miR-BHRF1-1 sponge was accompanied by a significant reduction in the accumulation of polySUMO conjugates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g007">Fig 7A and 7C</xref>). The involvement of RNF4 downregulation in the induction of this phenotype was further substantiated using a stable recombinant lentivirus transduced subline of Akata-Bx1 expressing an inducible RNF4 that lacks the 3â€™UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g007">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>). Sustained expression of the ectopic miRNA-resistant RNF4 during productive infection was accompanied by failure to accumulate high molecular weight SUMO2/3 conjugates. In line with the capacity of the ligase to promote the proteasome-dependent degradation of poly-SUMOylated protein, the effect of RNF4 reconstitution was reversed by treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>). This finding supports the conclusion that the miR-BHRF1-1-mediated downregulation of RNF4 during productive EBV infection protects poly-SUMOylated proteins from proteasomal degradation.</p>

<title>Inhibition of RNF4 by miR-BHRF1-1 is required for efficient virus production</title>
<p>The accumulation of SUMOylated proteins starting from 24 h post-induction suggests that a consistent fraction of the conjugates may be viral proteins expressed during the productive cycle. To explore this possibility, we first tested whether a selection of viral proteins expressed during the productive cycle are bona fide SUMOylation substrates. Since antibodies to EBV lytic antigens suitable for direct analysis of SUMOylation are not available, FLAG-tagged versions of the coding sequences for the DNA polymerase processivity factor BMRF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref044">44</xref>], the viral alkaline exonuclease BGLF5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref045">45</xref>], the capsid assembly scaffold protein BVRF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref046">46</xref>] and the viral capsid protein BdRF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref047">47</xref>] were cloned in an eukaryotic expression vectors and co-transfected in HEK293T cells together with His-tagged SUMO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g009">Fig 9</xref>). A Flag-tagged version of the known SUMOylation substrate BZLF1 was included for reference. Polypeptides of the expected molecular weight were detected by an anti-FLAG antibody in western blots of total cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). Consistent with the described auto-proteolytic activity of BVRF2, bands of approximately 75 and 27 kDa were detected in the transfected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref046">46</xref>]. SUMOylated proteins were affinity purified from cell lysates made in presence of 7M urea using Ni-NTA affinity resin and western blots were probed with the anti-FLAG antibody. High MW species of size shift corresponding to single or multiple SUMO-conjugated moieties were detected in the lysates of cells expressing the five viral proteins but not in cells transfected with the FLAG vector control, indicating that the viral proteins are bona fide SUMOylation substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g009">Fig 9B</xref>).</p>

<p>The parallel accumulation of SUMOylated protein and decrease of RNF4 during productive infection is consistent with a scenario where the STUbL may regulate the abundance of SUMOylated viral proteins by promoting their proteasome-dependent degradation. In order to test this possibility, the downregulation of RNF4 was reversed in anti-IgG treated Akata-Bx1 expressing the miR-BHRF1-1 sponge and the abundance of viral proteins was assessed by probing western blots of total cell lysates with specific antibodies. More than 50% reduction in the intensity of the BGLF5 and BVRF2 specific bands was detected in parallel with upregulation of RNF4 in induced cells expressing the miR-BHRF1-1 sponge, and the effect was reversed upon treatment with MG132, confirming that the decrease is due to proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g010">Fig 10A and 10B</xref> left panel).

<p>Since EBV structural proteins were found to be poly-SUMOylated, in the final set of experiments, we sought to assess the role of RNF4 downregulation in the production of infectious virus. To this end, the productive cycle was induced in Akata-Bx1, Akta-Bx1 expressing the inducible miR-BHRF1-1 sponge and Akata-Bx1 expressing the miR-resistant RNF4 in the presence or absence of doxycycline and the amount of virus particles was quantified by qPCR in culture supernatants harvested 3 and 7 days post-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006338.g011">Fig 11</xref>). In order to exclude contamination by free viral DNA or virus fragments released by damaged cells, the supernatants were treated with DNase I before DNA extraction. The amount DNase I resistant viral DNA was quantified relative to a standard curve produced using a BZLF1 encoding plasmid. In line with the finding that reconstitution of RNF4 is accompanied by the proteasome-dependent degradation of structural viral proteins, the doxycycline-induced expression of either the miR-BHRF-1-1 sponge or the miR-resistant RNF4 was accompanied by a significant decrease in the amount of released virus particles.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Compelling evidence supports a pivotal role of SUMO in regulating key facets of the interaction of viruses with their host cells. Here we discovered a novel function of the EBV miR-BHRF1-1 whereby, through inhibition of the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase RNF4, the virus counteracts a cellular defense that operates during the late phase of productive infection.</p>
<p>Changes in the global levels of SUMOylation were shown to correlate with either enhanced or reduced virus yields in cells infected with different viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref049">49</xref>], suggesting that SUMOylation may play different roles depending on the type of virus and stage of the virus cycle that is affected. We have found that a robust accumulation of SUMO conjugates is required for efficient virus production in EBV infected cells. At least two events act synergistically in promoting the accumulation of SUMOylated proteins. First, we observed transcriptional upregulation and increased protein levels of several components of the SUMOylation machinery, which, in light of the general shutoff of cellular transcription that accompanies the productive virus cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref050">50</xref>], suggests that SUMOylation is actively promoted. Second, we found that the accumulation of SUMO conjugates correlates with a progressive decrease of RNF4, resulting in very low to undetectable levels of the protein 72 hrs post-induction. Our finding that the decrease of RNF4 is dependent on the activity of a viral microRNA illustrates a new strategy by which the virus interferes with SUMO-regulated events, and highlights a previously unrecognized function of EBV miRNAs during productive infection.</p>
<p>The capacity of EBV miR-BHRF1-1 to specifically target RNF4 was confirmed using luciferase reporters expressing wild type and mutant RNF4 3â€™UTR sequences, by expression of a synthetic miR-BHRF1-1 oligonucleotide or the inducible miRNA at levels comparable to those observed during productive infection, and, most importantly, by reversal of the phenotype upon selective inhibition of the endogenous miRNA in cells expressing an inducible miR-BHFR1-1 sponge. The effect was also reproduced in different cell types, which excludes cell-specific artifacts. Since miR-BHRF1-1 is expressed at relatively low levels in latently EBV infected cells where RNF4 is clearly detected, including in the Akata-Bx1 cell line used in our experiments, the inhibition observed upon induction of the productive infection highlights the importance of the relative amounts of the miRNA in determining its functional target repertoire.</p>
<p>Previous work using recombinant EBV lacking the entire or individual members of the BHRF1 cluster suggested that these miRNAs contribute to B-cell transformation and may play a role in the expansion of the latent viral reservoir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref051">51</xref>], possibly due to their capacity to promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref052">52</xref>]. However, although several putative targets have been identified by bioinformatics predictions and in RISC-IP studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref042">42</xref>], evidence for the capacity of miR-BHRF1-1 to regulate specific viral or cellular genes during latent infection is still lacking. Furthermore, cells infected with viruses lacking the BHRF1 cluster do not spontaneously enter the productive cycle as measured by the expression of immediate early and late viral genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref051">51</xref>], suggesting that the miRNAs are not essential for the maintenance of latency. The upregulation of the BHRF1 cluster during productive infection clearly point to a distinct role of the miRNAs in the lytic cycle. It is noteworthy that, although all the BHRF1 miRNAs are induced upon entry into lytic cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref053">53</xref>], miR-BHRF1-1 is upregulated with a slower kinetics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006338.s004">S3 Fig</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref043">43</xref>]), suggesting that it may have a specific function in the late phase of the replicative cycle when infectious virus particles are assembled. This scenario is consistent with the findings of Wahl et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref054">54</xref>] who demonstrated a significant delay in the appearance of circulating viral DNA in humanized mice infected with a mutant EBV lacking the BHRF1 cluster without concomitant impairment of the oncogenic potential <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting a predominant effect on virus production and spread rather than on the proliferation of the infected cells.</p>
<p>Our finding that the miR-BHRF1-1 mediated inhibition of RNF4 promotes the accumulation of SUMO conjugates during the late phase of productive EBV infection suggests that the cellular ligase could have different roles in the virus cycle. RNF4 regulates the activity of PML bodies by promoting the proteasome-dependent degradation of its poly-SUMOylated components, including SP100, DAXX and PML itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref055">55</xref>]. PML bodies participate in the intrinsic cellular defense against virus infection and are rapidly dispersed upon induction of the productive cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref056">56</xref>]. Several members of the herpesvirus family express functional homologs of RNF4, such as the immediate early proteins ICP0 of HSV1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref057">57</xref>] and K-Rat of KSHV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref025">25</xref>], that promote virus production by targeting the PML bodies. EBV does not encode a functional homolog of RNF4 and it is therefore tempting to speculate that the virus may hijack the cellular protein to overcome cellular constraints that prevent virus reactivation. This putative early virus promoting effect stands in sharp contrast to the capacity of RNF4 to inhibit events that occur later during infection, as illustrated by the ubiquitination of SUMOylated BRLF1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and its proteasome-dependent degradation in productively infected cells, which hampers the efficiency of virus reactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref058">58</xref>]. Collectively, these findings highlight the complexity of the relationship between the virus and the host cell where the same cellular function may be either harnessed or suppressed in different phases of the infection.</p>
<p>The concomitant downregulation of RNF4 and upregulation of several components of the SUMO conjugation machinery, together with the inhibitory effect of RNF4 on the yield of virus particles, emphasizes the importance of SUMOylation for the production of infectious virus. Given the involvement of SUMO in the regulation of nuclear transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref060">60</xref>], SUMOylation may be required for the accumulation of viral proteins produced in the cytoplasm to the site of virus replication and assembly in the nucleus. SUMOylation may also guide the gathering of protein complexes that control the late phases of virus production, as shown for several multistep cellular processes, such as DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref061">61</xref>]. In addition, SUMOylation may play an important role in the building of virus particles. While the assembly of virions is dependent on the local accumulation of structural proteins, high protein concentrations are likely to favor protein misfolding, with consequent aggregation and ubiquitin-dependent degradation. SUMOylation could counteract this process by promoting the solubility of aggregation-prone proteins, as illustrated by the finding that SUMOylation delays aggregation of the natively unfolded neuronal protein Î±-synuclein <italic>in vitro</italic>, whereas mutation of two lysines required for SUMOylation promotes aggregation and toxicity <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref062">62</xref>]. Thus, SUMOylation may be required to maintain a pool of soluble viral proteins available for incorporation into the nascent virus particles. In this attractive scenario, the increased SUMOylation capacity achieved through upregulation of the SUMO conjugation machinery, and the concomitant downregulation of RNF4, could work in concert towards the generation of infectious virus.</p>
<p>While a comprehensive list of the viral and cellular SUMOylation substrates in productively infected cells is beyond the scope of this report, it is remarkable that all the early and late viral proteins that were included in the study were shown to be bona fide SUMOylation substrates, suggesting that the SUMOylation of viral proteins may be more common than previously appreciated. It is also noteworthy that although putative SUMOylation sites are predicted in several EBV proteins, in particular tegument proteins and other virion components, only one of the putative substrates identified in our study, BVRF2, contains a canonical SUMO-conjugation motif. SUMOylation at non-canonical sites may be a distinctive characteristic of the viral protein or, alternatively, it may reflect the particular environment in which the modification occurs. Indeed, SUMOylation at non canonical sites has been observed also in cellular proteins, and adherence to the consensus motif was shown to drop significantly in cells exposed to heat-shock or other type of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006338.ref063">63</xref>].</p>
<p>Collectively, our findings highlight a key role of SUMOylation in the regulation of productive EBV infection and point to the SUMO machinery as a possible target for the development of new antiviral drugs.</p>

The sequences of the 3â€²UTR of RNF4 were retrieved from the human Ensembl database [release 73] and the sequence of the 4 mature miRNAs encoded by the BHRF1 cluster (BHRF1-1, BHRF1-2, BHRF1-2* and BHRF1-3) were downloaded from the MiRBase collection. Six miRNAs-target prediction programs including miRanda, NbMICTAR, MiRTif, RNA Hybrid, PITA and Target Spy were used to predict all possible BHRF1 miRNAs target sites. The outputs of each programs including the predicted free energy of the miRNA- mRNA duplex, the scores for the context of the sites within the UTR, conservation or SVM scores are listed. The miRanda prediction was also used as the input duplex for MiRTif. A strict model for the binding sites that requires almost-perfect degree of complementarity between nucleotides 2â€“8 in the 5â€™-end of the miRNA and the 3â€²UTR (SEED region) was applied for miRanda and Target Spy. The scores are marked in bold when positive interactions are predicted by the default cut-off values of each program. <bold>B</bold>.
