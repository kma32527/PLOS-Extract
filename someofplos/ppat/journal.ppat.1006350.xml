<abstract>
<p>Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a herpesvirus that is linked to Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman’s disease (MCD). KSHV establishes persistent latent infection in the human host. KSHV undergoes periods of spontaneous reactivation where it can enter the lytic replication phase of its lifecycle. During KSHV reactivation, host innate immune responses are activated to restrict viral replication. Here, we report that NLRX1, a negative regulator of the type I interferon response, is important for optimal KSHV reactivation from latency. Depletion of NLRX1 in either iSLK.219 or BCBL-1 cells significantly suppressed global viral transcription levels compared to the control group. Concomitantly, fewer viral particles were present in either cells or supernatant from NLRX1 depleted cells. Further analysis revealed that upon NLRX1 depletion, higher IFNβ transcription levels were observed, which was also associated with a transcriptional upregulation of JAK/STAT pathway related genes in both cell lines. To investigate whether IFNβ contributes to NLRX1’s role in KSHV reactivation, we treated control and NLRX1 depleted cells with a TBK1 inhibitor (BX795) or TBK1 siRNA to block IFNβ production. Upon BX795 or TBK1 siRNA treatment, NLRX1 depletion exhibited less inhibitory effects on reactivation and infectious virion production, suggesting that NLRX1 facilitates KSHV lytic replication by negatively regulating IFNβ responses. Our data suggests that NLRX1 plays a positive role in KSHV lytic replication by suppressing the IFNβ response during the process of KSHV reactivation, which might serve as a potential target for restricting KSHV replication and transmission.</p>

<p>Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is linked to a number of different human cancers, including Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman’s disease (MCD). KSHV predominantly establishes life-long latency in the infected host. Lytic reactivation from latency is critical for KSHV survival and replication. During KSHV reactivation from latency, host innate immune responses are activated to restrict viral replication. Here, we report that NLRX1, a negative regulator of the type I interferon response, is important for optimal KSHV reactivation and subsequent lytic replication.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also known as human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), is a linear double-stranded DNA virus. It is causally linked with Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman’s disease (MCD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref002">2</xref>]. In the majority of KS lesion cells or PEL cells, KSHV maintains latent infection, where KSHV lytic gene expression can only be detected in a small subset of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref003">3</xref>]. While latent infection is important for maintaining the viral reservoir, reactivation of KSHV from latent infection is important for viral particle production and transmission of KSHV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref005">5</xref>]. The balance between lytic and latent infection is critical for KSHV pathogenicity. During reactivation, many cellular signaling pathways are activated and regulated by both host and viral proteins. For example, KSHV infection has been shown to trigger innate immune responses through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which results in interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref006">6</xref>]). KSHV encodes multiple proteins that modulate host immune responses to facilitate viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref011">11</xref>]. However, a better understanding of the role of cellular genes in viral reactivation is also critical for understanding the pathogenesis associated with KSHV.</p>
<p>NLRX1 (also known as CLR11.3 and NOD9) is a member of nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing protein family (also known as NOD-like receptors, NLRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref014">14</xref>]. NLRs were originally widely studied as sensors or receptors of inflammasome signaling, but were recently reported to regulate type I interferon production as well (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref016">16</xref>]). NLRX1 was identified as a negative regulator of RIG-I like receptor (RLR) dependent type I interferon production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref012">12</xref>]. NLRX1 localizes to the mitochondria and associates with MAVS (also known as Cardif, VISA and IPS-1), a mitochondria-localized adaptor downstream of RIG-I, to disrupt cytosolic RNA induced type I interferon responses. Depletion of NLRX1 led to enhanced antiviral responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref012">12</xref>]. Notably, NLRX1 was also identified to facilitate HIV-1 primary infection through negative regulation of the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway. NLRX1 was shown to sequester the DNA-sensing adaptor STING from interaction with TBK-1, and therefore block sufficient type I interferon production. In a similar vein, NLRX1 deficient mice also exhibited stronger innate immune responses and thus reduced HSV1 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref017">17</xref>]. In correlation with these findings, in SIV infection of rhesus monkeys, expression of NLRX1 was negatively correlated with a type I interferon signature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref018">18</xref>]. Therefore, in the context of viral infection, NLRX1 might be a key factor in determining the battle between host and virus.</p>
<p>KSHV reactivation has been previously reported to activate MAVS-dependent cytosolic RNA sensing pathways. Blocking MAVS was shown to downregulate type I interferon and thus facilitate KSHV lytic replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref019">19</xref>]. Therefore, as a MAVS negative regulator, it is plausible that NLRX1 plays an important role in KSHV reactivation, and functions as a potential target for restricting KSHV transmission.</p>

<title>NLRX1 is required for optimal KSHV reactivation</title>
<p>To investigate the role of NLRX1 as a potential restriction factor against KSHV lytic reactivation from latency, we utilized KSHV latently infected epithelial cells, iSLK.219 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref020">20</xref>]. We used control siRNA or siRNA against NLRX1 to specifically deplete NLRX1 in iSLK.219 cells before reactivation. The iSLK.219 cells harbor a latent BAC16-KSHV with a constitutive GFP marker, a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible RTA, which is necessary and sufficient to induce lytic reactivation, and a RFP marker driven by the promoter of the KSHV lytic gene, PAN, which is activated during KSHV lytic replication. Therefore, GFP serves as a marker for infected cells while RFP serves as a marker for KSHV lytic replication. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006350.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, while Dox successfully induced KSHV reactivation and lytic replication in both non-specific (NS) siRNA and NLRX1 siRNA transfected cells at each time point, there were lower percentages of RFP positive cells in the NLRX1 depleted samples. Moreover, while we did not observe significant GFP variation, RFP intensity quantitation showed significant inhibition of RFP intensity in the NLRX1 siRNA transfected samples compared to the control NS siRNA transfected samples. This suggests that KSHV lytic replication is suppressed in NLRX1 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006350.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). We also tested a second NLRX1 siRNA (siNLRX1 #2) and examined its effect on viral reactivation by investigating RFP fluorescence. The results with the second NLRX1 siRNA was similar to the first siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006350.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). We next monitored KSHV viral particles in the supernatant as well as in infected iSLK.219 cells from each group harvested at 24, 48 and 72 hours post reactivation. Consistent with RFP expression levels, we detected significantly fewer KSHV genomes in the NLRX1 siRNA transfected samples compared to control NS siRNA transfected samples as determined by KSHV genome copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006350.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). NLRX1 knockdown efficiency was checked by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006350.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).</p>

<title>NLRX1 is required for optimal KSHV gene transcription and expression upon reactivation</title>
<p>To determine the impact of NLRX1 on viral genes, we examined KSHV lytic gene expression. Knockdown efficiency of NLRX1 was monitored by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006350.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006350.s002">S2E Fig</xref>). NLRX1 deficient cells showed a reduced ability to induce lytic gene transcription (such as ORF57, vIRF1 and K8.1) than the control NS siRNA transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006350.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006350.s002">S2C and S2D Fig</xref>). Both ORF45 and K8alpha lytic proteins were downregulated at 24, 48 and 72 hours post reactivation in the NLRX1 siRNA group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006350.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Knockdown efficiency of NLRX1 was also monitored by immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006350.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). To broadly profile KSHV viral gene expression during reactivation in control versus NLRX1 depleted samples, we also performed KSHV whole genome transcriptional profiling. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006350.g002">Fig 2E</xref>, Dox treatment successfully induced KSHV gene expression, and depletion of NLRX1 led to a suppression and delay of viral genome transcription at each time point that we tested, which correlates well with our qRT-PCR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006350.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). We also monitored viral gene transcription at later time points, and we observed a smaller difference between the siNS and siNLRX1 groups at later time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006350.s003">S3A–S3C Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Loss of NLRX1 results in increased type I interferon responses</title>
<p>We next probed for the mechanism by which NLRX1 depletion restricts KSHV lytic reactivation from latency. In order to rule out the possibility that siNLRX1 affects the induction of RTA, we tested if siNLRX1 would affect RTA mRNA transcription induced by Dox. Because RTA transcription in iSLK.219 cells can be both affected by Dox and KSHV reactivation, we used iSLK.RTA cells without KSHV infection to test if siNLRX1 would affect Dox induced RTA. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006350.s003">S3D and S3E Fig</xref>, knockdown of NLRX1 did not attenuate RTA mRNA transcription.</p>
<p>Since NLRX1 has been reported to negatively regulate type I interferon, we then investigated if NLRX1 altered type I interferon responses upon KSHV reactivation. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006350.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, loss of NLRX1 did result in stronger <italic>ifnb</italic> transcriptional activity. IFNβ is known to activate the JAK/STAT pathway to induce ISGs for effective antiviral responses against viruses. To investigate this further, we next tested whether the upregulated <italic>ifnb</italic> transcription level in NLRX1 deficient cells led to the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. We performed microarray analysis of genes in the JAK/STAT pathway using KSHV infected cells that were transfected with either control or NLRX1 siRNAs at timepoints of 0 hour, 24 hours and 48 hours post reactivation. We compared JAK/STAT responsive genes that were activated in cells transfected with NLRX1 and NS siRNA at each time point. At 0, 24 and 48 hours, many JAK/STAT pathway genes were induced at least 2 fold higher in NLRX1 depleted cells compared to NS siRNA transfected cells, indicating a higher potential for JAK/STAT pathway upregulation upon NLRX1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006350.g003">Fig 3B–3D</xref>). Moreover, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006350.g003">Fig 3E and 3F</xref>, at 24 hours post Dox treatment, 16 genes were upregulated by 2 fold in the NS siRNA control samples while 48 genes were upregulated at least 2 fold in the in NLRX1 siRNA transfected samples. At 48 hours post Dox treatment, 20 genes were upregulated by more than 2 fold in the NS siRNA control samples while 46 genes were upregulated at least 2 fold in the NLRX1 siRNA transfected samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006350.g003">Fig 3G and 3H</xref>). In summary, NLRX1 deficient cells induce a much wider variety of JAK/STAT pathway related genes at each time point tested in KSHV reactivated cells compared to the control cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006350.g003">Fig 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006350.s008">S1 Table</xref> depicts the overall gene expression of all 84 JAK/STAT related genes tested. As shown, most genes exhibit a higher expression level in NLRX1 deficient cells compared to control cells at each time point tested. We noticed that many JAK/STAT related genes were upregulated in the absence of KSHV lytic reactivation. To eliminate that this is not due to an off target effect of the NLRX1 siRNA, we also tested an alternative NLRX1 siRNA (siNLRX1 #2) to monitor the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway before KSHV was reactivated. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006350.s004">S4A–S4D Fig</xref>, we have also observed many upregulated genes. Specifically, of 57 upregulated genes in siNLRX1 #2 group, 54 of the genes were also upregulated in siNLRX1 group, compared to the siNS group. We also transiently overexpressed NLRX1 in iSLK.219 cells to explore the role of NLRX1 in KSHV reactivation. Consistent with the siRNA experiments, we detected attenuated levels of IFNβ mRNA and increased levels of viral ORF57 mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006350.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>).

<title>NLRX1 negatively regulates MAVS-dependent type I interferon responses</title>
<p>NLRX1 was identified as a negative regulator of MAVS. Therefore, in order to further detail the mechanism by which NLRX1 facilitates KSHV reactivation, we looked at IFNβ regulation by MAVS. MAVS has previously been shown to play a role in limiting KSHV reactivation. Therefore, we hypothesized that NLRX1 blocks MAVS to attenuate type I interferon responses in KSHV-infected cells, and thus facilitates KSHV reactivation. To prove this, we first tested the integrity and functionality of the MAVS signaling pathway. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006350.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, we transfected poly I:C into KSHV infected iSLK.219 cells and successfully triggered MAVS dependent IFNβ induction, which is indicative of a functional RLR pathway. Moreover, NLRX1 depletion in these cells resulted in higher induction of IFNβ, suggesting NLRX1 blocks MAVS signaling in KSHV-infected iSLK.219 cells without reactivation. NLRX1 knockdown efficiency was monitored by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006350.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). We also tested if poly I:C, an activator of the MAVS pathway, could mimic the effect of NLRX1 knockdown to inhibit KSHV reactivation. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006350.s005">S5A–S5F Fig</xref>, poly I:C induced IFNβ during reactivation, and this correlated with inhibition of KSHV reactivation as determined by RFP fluorescence and viral lytic gene expression.</p>

<p>To further test if NLRX1 blocks MAVS signaling in KSHV-infected cells upon reactivation, we used BX795, an inhibitor of TBK1, which acts directly downstream of MAVS. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006350.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, when we treated cells with NLRX1 siRNA and BX795, we observed significant inhibition of IFNβ compared to the NLRX1 siRNA and vehicle only treated group at 24 and 48 hours post reactivation. IFNβ levels in the NLRX1 siRNA and BX795 treated group were similar to that of the NS siRNA treated group. NLRX1 knockdown efficiency was monitored by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006350.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). To eliminate the possibility that NLRX1 directly acts as a negative regulator of IRF3, we tested whether NLRX1 could modulate IFNβ promoter luciferase activation by an IRF3 super activator (SA). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006350.s001">S1D–S1F Fig</xref>, NLRX1 overexpression inhibited dRIG-I- or MAVS- dependent activation of the IFNβ promoter, but the IRF3(SA) activated IFNβ promoter activation was not affected. These data suggest that NLRX1 inhibits MAVS in KSHV-infected cells and supports KSHV lytic replication.</p>

<title>TBK1 inhibition by BX795 partially rescues KSHV reactivation and gene expression</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>KSHV reactivation from latency is a complex process for both virus and host, which is tightly regulated by a variety of signaling pathways. Efficient lytic replication of KSHV requires disruption of restrictive signaling pathways that keep the virus latent. This can be achieved by the action of either viral proteins or host proteins. For example, upon KSHV reactivation, cytosolic RNA and DNA dependent pathways were reported to be activated and type I interferon was produced to suppress viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref019">19</xref>]. Previously, we have reported that in order to facilitate viral lytic replication, KSHV encodes multiple proteins to inhibit type I interferon production, such as vIRF1. vIRF1 knockdown in the context of viral reactivation can result in enhanced IFNβ production and insufficient reactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref008">8</xref>]. While viral inhibitors of type I interferon are important for KSHV lytic replication, in this study, we focused on exploring the role of a host type I interferon inhibitor, NLRX1, during KSHV reactivation. We demonstrated that NLRX1 is required for optimal KSHV reactivation. NLRX1 deficiency in iSLK.219 cells led to enhanced type I interferon production, as well as global suppression of KSHV genome transcription activity, decreased level of lytic proteins, and attenuated virion production. A similar phenotype was observed in BCBL-1 cells as well, suggesting NLRX1 is critical for KSHV reactivation and subsequent replication in multiple cell lines. We noticed that viral genes clustered together based on their expression patterns following NLRX1 depletion. A future goal will be to further explore the differences among these different clusters to better understand the regulation of KSHV reactivation.</p>
<p>NLRX1 was previously reported to suppress the RIG-I-MAVS signaling pathway, which is triggered by cytosolic RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref012">12</xref>]. It has also been previously reported that KSHV reactivation generates dsRNA intermediates that can trigger RIG-I-MAVS signaling in KSHV-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref019">19</xref>]. As shown in our study, we demonstrate the functionality of the MAVS-dependent pathway in both KSHV-infected iSLK.219 and BCBL-1 cells. More importantly, NLRX1 negatively regulated MAVS-dependent IFNβ transcription before and after KSHV reactivation in both iSLK.219 and BCBL-1 cells, indicating that NLRX1 regulates KSHV reactivation through a MAVS-dependent pathway. Inhibition of type I interferon induction by the TBK1 antagonist, BX795, mitigated the effect of NLRX1 deficiency on KSHV lytic replication.</p>
<p>We have also explored TBK1’s effect on KSHV lytic reactivation. Although this is the first time that TBK1 was reported to be a negative regulator of KSHV lytic reactivation, TBK1 was previously reported as a restriction factor of RNA viruses, such as Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) and Sendai virus (SeV), by acting downstream of MAVS and positively regulating IFN responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref022">22</xref>]. This correlates with our previously published results that MAVS play a negative role in KSHV reactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref019">19</xref>]. Moreover, TBK1 also inhibits replication of HSV-1, an alpha herpesvirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006350.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Although NLRX1 plays an important role in KSHV reactivation, we did not observe significant upregulation or downregulation of NLRX1 at either the transcript or protein level during KSHV reactivation. Therefore, it is possible that NLRX1 serves as a steady-state negative regulator of type I interferon to facilitate KSHV reactivation. However, it is also plausible that NLRX1 may undergo some type of post translational modifications upon KSHV reactivation, which might further benefit KSHV lytic replication. A third possibility is that during lytic reactivation, a KSHV encoded protein(s) might also bind directly or indirectly to the NLRX1 signaling complex to regulate its function. In sum, we report for the first time that NLRX1 plays a pivotal role in modulating KSHV reactivation from latency.</p>
