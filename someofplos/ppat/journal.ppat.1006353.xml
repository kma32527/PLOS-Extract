<abstract>
<p>Human T lymphotropic Virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiological agent of Adult T cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-Associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Both CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells and dendritic cells (DCs) infected with HTLV-1 are found in peripheral blood from HTLV-1 carriers. We previously demonstrated that monocyte-derived IL-4 DCs are more susceptible to HTLV-1 infection than autologous primary T-cells, suggesting that DC infection precedes T-cell infection. However, during blood transmission, breast-feeding or sexual transmission, HTLV-1 may encounter different DC subsets present in the blood, the intestinal or genital mucosa respectively. These different contacts may impact HTLV-1 ability to infect DCs and its subsequent transfer to T-cells. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> monocyte-derived IL-4 DCs, TGF-β DCs and IFN-α DCs that mimic DCs contacting HTLV-1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we show here that despite their increased ability to capture HTLV-1 virions, IFN-α DCs restrict HTLV-1 productive infection. Surprisingly, we then demonstrate that it is not due to the antiviral activity of type–I interferon produced by IFN-α DCs, but that it is likely to be linked to a distinct trafficking route of HTLV-1 in IL-4 DCs vs. IFN-α DCs. Finally, we demonstrate that, in contrast to IL-4 DCs, IFN-α DCs are impaired in their capacity to transfer HTLV-1 to CD4 T-cells, both after viral capture and trans-infection and after their productive infection. In conclusion, the nature of the DCs encountered by HTLV-1 upon primo-infection and the viral trafficking route through the vesicular pathway of these cells determine the efficiency of viral transmission to T-cells, which may condition the fate of infection.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Human T-Lymphotropic Virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiological agent of Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-Associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (HAM/TSP). In chronically infected patients, the provirus is mainly detected in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell population. However, beside lymphocytes, HTLV-1 infects blood or monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, we previously showed that DCs are more susceptible to HTLV-1 infection than autologous T-cells, suggesting that DCs might be the first cells to be infected upon primo-infection, and important intermediaries for the viral spread to surrounding lymphocytes. Interestingly, different DC subsets are found in the blood or in the mucosa, the two entry routes used by HTLV-1 during infection of new individuals. In this study, we show for the first time that the different DC subsets are not equally susceptible to HTLV-1 infection. Furthermore we demonstrate that DC subsets with an increased ability to capture HTLV-1 virion are restricted to HTLV-1 productive infection. This restriction is linked to DC maturation but not to the antiviral activity of IFN-α produced by resistant DCs. Finally, we demonstrate that efficient viral transmission to T-cells is dependent upon DC productive infection rather than trans-infection. Altogether, our results indicate that the nature of the DCs encountered by HTLV-1 upon primo-infection determines the efficiency of viral transmission to T-cells, which may condition the fate of infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human T-Lymphotropic Virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infects 5–10 million people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref001">1</xref>]. HTLV-1 is mainly present in Japan, inter-tropical Africa, the Caribbean and South America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref003">3</xref>]. After a long period of clinical latency, HTLV-1 infection leads, in a fraction of infected individuals, either to Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref004">4</xref>], an uncontrolled CD4<sup>+</sup> T–cell proliferation of very poor prognosis, or to an inflammatory disorder named HTLV-1 Associated Myelopathy / Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (HAM/TSP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref005">5</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic>, in chronically infected individuals, HTLV-1 is mainly found in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells, but infected dendritic cells (DCs) are also detected <italic>in vitro</italic> and more importantly <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref011">11</xref>]. Their function is subsequently altered <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref013">13</xref>] and these cells are therefore likely to be involved in viral pathogenesis.</p>
<p>The role of DC infection in HTLV-1 dissemination to T-cells has been investigated in mice exposed to chimeric HTLV-1-infected cells, in which the HTLV-1 envelope had been replaced by that of the Moloney murine leukemia virus, to allow HTLV-1 to enter murine cells. In this context, DC depletion leads to a decreased proviral load in mouse CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref014">14</xref>]. In addition, HTLV-1 viruses harboring mutations in the p12 and p30 regulatory genes that have lost their ability to infect human DCs, also have an impaired ability to infect macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref015">15</xref>]. Altogether, these <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments strongly suggest that infection of DCs is required for the establishment and maintenance of HTLV-1 infection in animal models. Consistent with these data, we recently showed that human monocytes-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) are more susceptible to HTLV-1 infection than autologous lymphocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref009">9</xref>], supporting a model where DC infection represents an important step upon primo-infection <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>In addition to the blood, DCs are widely distributed in peripheral tissues and in mucosae, where antigen capture might occur. DCs play a central role in activating naïve T-cells and directing the subsequent immune response. DCs are constituted of several distinct subsets that differ in their ability to activate immunity or to promote tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref016">16</xref>]. Since HTLV-1 is transmitted through contact with infected cells present in maternal milk, semen or blood, viruses may first be in contact with different DC subsets present in these different tissues. The interaction of HTLV-1-infected cells with a given DC subset may thus affect the subsequent immune response. In addition, interaction with distinct DC subsets might have an impact on the risk of developing ATLL in the case of mother-to-child transmission or on the risk of developing HAM/TSP in the case of infection with contaminated blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>We therefore investigated whether different MDDC subsets that are similar to tissue-resident DCs exposed to HTLV-1 during primary infection in humans, are equally susceptible to HTLV-1 infection. Human MDDCs were generated with cytokines that allow differentiation into different subsets: interleukin-4 (IL-4) for myeloid DCs of the blood, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) for mucosal DCs of the gut and interferon-alpha (IFN-α) for inflammatory DCs found in injured skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref019">19</xref>]. We demonstrate that IL-4 DCs and to a lesser extent TGF-β DCs are susceptible to HTLV-1 infection, while IFN-α DCs are not. We then demonstrate that IFN-α DC resistance to HTLV-1 infection is not due to IFN-α production. In contrast, we demonstrate that DC maturation, in addition to viral trafficking through acidic vesicles, contributes to DC resistance to HTLV-1 infection. Finally, we show that HTLV-1 productive infection of immature DCs, rather than viral capture by matured-DCs, is required for HTLV-1 transmission from DCs to T-cells. These results demonstrate for the first time that immature DCs represent the main DC population that allows infection of T-cells.</p>

<title>Immature IL-4 DCs and tolerogenic TGF-β DCs but not IFN-α DCs are susceptible to HTLV-1</title>
<p>To determine whether all DC subsets were equally susceptible to HTLV-1, IL-4 DCs, TGF-β DCs and IFN-α DCs were generated from human primary monocytes. DC differentiation was controlled by the loss of CD14 expression and the acquisition of CD11c expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Consistent with previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref019">19</xref>], IL-4 DCs and TGF-β DCs displayed the most immature phenotype, with a low surface expression of CD86, CD40 and HLA-DR markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Expression of these maturation markers was increased in IFN-α DCs confirming their more mature phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). The three different DC subtypes were then exposed to infected C91-PL cells. Infection was first monitored by the accumulation of the structural p19<sup>gag</sup> viral protein over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In IL-4 DCs, the relative abundance of p19<sup>gag</sup>-positive cells significantly increased between 3h and 72 h post infection (p.i.), while it significantly decreased in IFN-α DCs, suggesting that IFN-α DC are not productively infected. Of note, in TGF-β DCs, the amount of p19<sup>gag</sup>-positive cells did not change significantly, suggesting a reduced level of infection. To confirm this result, the amount of proviral DNA was quantified 3 and 5 days after contact of the different DCs with purified HTLV-1 viral biofilm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Viral biofilm are membrane-bound viruses that are embedded in extracellular matrix-rich structures at the surface of infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref021">21</xref>]. Infection with purified viral biofilm allows quantification of viral DNA resulting from <italic>de novo</italic> infection of target cells, without contamination with viral DNA from C91-PL that occurs when infection is perfomed through co-culture with infected cells. As previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref009">9</xref>], proviral DNA was detected in IL-4 DCs exposed to viral biofilm, and its amount significantly increased during the course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Proviral DNA was also detected in TGF-β DCs exposed to viral biofilm but, consistent with the low accumulation of viral p19<sup>gag</sup>, its amount did not significantly increase during the course of exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), suggesting that TGF-β DCs are less susceptible than IL-4 DCs to HTLV-1 infection. In contrast, HTLV-1 viral DNA was barely detected in IFN-α DCs exposed to viral biofilm and its amount did not change during the course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). As a control, no viral DNA was detected when heat-inactivated viral biofilm was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Productive infection was further confirmed by detection of Tax expression, since this viral protein is absent from the viral particle. Consistent with the amount of viral DNA, a higher percentage of IL-4 DCs expressed Tax compared to TGF-β DCs, with a mean of 0,6% infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). A significant reduction in the number of Tax-expressing cells was observed among IL-4 DCs when infection was performed in the presence of AZT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s001">S1B Fig</xref>), confirming that Tax expression results from productive infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref009">9</xref>]. In addition, a very low percentage of Tax-expressing cells were found in the IFN-α DC population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) with a mean of 0,1% infected cells. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the IL-4 DC population is more susceptible to HTLV-1 infection than the TGF-β one, and that the IFN-α DC population is resistant to HTLV-1 infection.</p>

<title>HTLV-1 viral entry is more efficient in DCs that restrict HTLV-1 infection</title>
<p>To understand the mechanism leading to differential susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection in the three DC subsets, we first controlled the expression of HTLV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Two proteins, the binding receptor NRP-1 and the fusion receptor Glut-1, have been involved in HTLV-1 entry in CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref025">25</xref>]. In addition, DC-SIGN is involved in HTLV-1 binding to DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref007">7</xref>] and is important for DC infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref006">6</xref>]. NRP-1 was expressed in all DC subsets, although its level was significantly higher in IL-4 and TGF-β DCs than in IFN-α DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Similarly, DC-SIGN was expressed in all DC subsets but its expression was significantly higher in IL-4 DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In contrast, Glut-1 expression was similar in all three DC subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). These results suggest that HTLV-1 binding might be lower in IFN-α DC and TGF-β compared to IL-4 DC. We therefore measured viral capture using detection of p19<sup>gag</sup> in the DC populations 3h after contact with C91-PL infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g002">Fig 2D</xref>) in addition to productive infection determined 3 days post contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Surprisingly, capture was 6-fold higher in IFN-α DCs and 3 fold higher in TGF-β DCs compared to IL-4 DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). This suggests that viral capture is inversely correlated to productive infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), and could be independent of NRP-1 and/or DC-SIGN expression level. Thus, IFN-α DC resistance to HTLV-1 infection is not linked to decreased capture efficiency or to a lower expression of viral fusion receptor.</p>

<title>Exposure to type I IFN does not restrict infection of IL-4 DCs</title>
<p>It is well established that type I IFN controls several viral infections through the induction of numerous interferon-inducible genes (ISGs) that restrict viral cycle at different levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref026">26</xref>].

<p>Given that IFN-α production by IFN-α DCs could be responsible for their resistance to HTLV-1 infection, we treated IL-4 DCs with increasing doses of recombinant IFN-α 2a before co-cultivating them with C91-PL infected cells. We first verified that recombinant IFN-α treatment did not affect IL-4 DC phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s002">S2A Fig</xref>) and was sufficient to induce expression of ISGs as measured by the up-regulation of <italic>Mx-1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Surprisingly however, treatment of IL-4 DCs with recombinant IFN-α did not affect their susceptibility to HTLV-1 as exemplified by the number of CD11c-positive Tax-positive cells shown for a representative experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) and the percentage of infected DCs observed in different experiments performed with cells from several independent donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), or by the number of p19<sup>gag</sup>-positive cells after 3h of DCs exposure to C91-PL cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). These results suggest that IL-4 DC exposure to recombinant IFN-α 2α does not affect their susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection.</p>
<p>Type I IFN includes IFN-β and 12 different IFN-α proteins that have different antiviral properties. IFN-α 2a was recently shown to have the weakest antiviral activity against HIV-1 compared to eight others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref028">28</xref>]. Thus, recombinant IFN-α 2a used above might not be sufficient for the restriction of HTLV-1 infection in IFN-α DCs. To address this issue, we tested the ability of the physiological type I IFN-α present in the supernatant of IFN-α DCs to restrict HTLV-1 infection in IL-4 DCs. Again, the number of Tax positive IL-4 DCs did not differ significantly when cells were cultured for 18 h with or without the supernatant from IFN-α DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g003">Fig 3E and 3F</xref>), confirming that type I IFN produced by IFN-α DCs is not responsible for the resistance of IFN-α DCs to HTLV-1 infection.</p>

<title>Decreased susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection is linked to DC maturation</title>
<p>IFN-α DCs are more mature than IL-4 DCs, as shown by the up-regulation of HLA-DR and CD40 markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s001">S1A Fig</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref019">19</xref>]). We thus asked whether DC maturation could account for restriction of HTLV-1 infection in IFN-α DCs. To test this hypothesis, IL-4 DCs were treated with LPS, a TLR-4 agonist, which induces the up-regulation of DC maturation markers such as HLA-DR, CD40 and CD86 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). Both immature and LPS-matured IL-4 DCs were then exposed to C91-PL cells for 3 h to measure viral capture, or for 3 days to measure productive infection. Similar to our results with IFN-α DCs, the percentage of p19<sup>gag</sup>-positive DCs was significantly higher in LPS-matured DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), while the percentage of Tax positive DCs was significantly lower when cells had been matured with LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). This indicates that LPS treatment of IL-4 DCs increases HTLV-1 uptake but restricts their productive infection and seems to recapitulate IFN-α DC restriction of HTLV-1. LPS-treatment of IL-4 DCs induced their maturation and was also accompanied with type I IFN production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). We thus tested whether type I IFN production after LPS-treatment could account for the decreased level of HTLV-1 productive infection. IL-4 DCs were treated with LPS for 3 h. Medium was then removed, cells were extensively washed to remove any trace of LPS and cultured for 18 h in LPS-free medium. Culture supernatant was then collected and added to another set of the same autologous IL-4 DCs. Addition of this supernatant induced an increase in CD86 expression level although lower to that of fully matured DCs, without any other change in the expression of CD40 or HLA-DR maturation markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). Interestingly, treatment of IL-4 DCs with the supernatant from LPS-matured DCs did neither affect DC susceptibility to HTLV-1 as shown using a result from one representative experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) nor the percentage of infected DCs observed in different experiments performed on independent donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g004">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s003">S3B Fig</xref>), or the number of p19<sup>gag</sup>-positive cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). These results suggest that maturation rather than type I IFN production accounts for the decreased susceptibility of LPS-matured DCs to HTLV-1 infection. To confirm this hypothesis, we induced IL-4 DC maturation with different TLR agonist treatments. Stimulation of IL-4 DCs with PolyI:C, R848 or LPS, that are agonists of TLR-3, TLR-7/8 or TLR-4 respectively, induced a fully mature phenotype, as measured by the up-regulation of HLA-DR, CD86 and CD40 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s004">S4A Fig</xref>) and type I IFN production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). In contrast, stimulation of IL-4 DCs with PAM3 or flagellin that are ligands of TLR-2 or TLR-5 respectively, induced an incomplete mature phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s004">S4A Fig</xref>) with no type I IFN production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). Interestingly, while treatment with ligands of TLR-3 or TLR-4 significantly increased viral capture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g004">Fig 4E</xref> lanes 4 and 5), treatment with ligands of TLR-3, TLR-7/8 or TLR-4 significantly decreased productive infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g004">Fig 4F</xref>, lanes 4–6). In contrast, treatment with ligands of TLR-2 or TLR-5 did not affect viral capture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g004">Fig 4E</xref>, lanes 2–3) but led to an increased productive infection of IL-4 DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g004">Fig 4F</xref>, lanes 2–3). Altogether, these results suggest that DC maturation independently of type I IFN present in the supernatant of matured DC is responsible for the restriction of HTLV-1 infection in DCs.</p>

<title>HTLV-1 uses partially overlapping entry routes in IL-4 and IFN-α DCs</title>
<p>To explain the differential susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection, we hypothesized that viral entry mechanisms might differ in IL-4 DCs vs. LPS-matured and IFN-α DCs. Vesicular entry pathways are mediated by several mechanisms of endocytosis that can be blocked by pharmacological inhibitors. Hence, immature IL-4 DCs, LPS-matured IL-4 DCs or IFN-α DCs were treated with inhibitors targeting dynamin-mediated and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (dynasore and chlorpromazine respectively), caveolin-mediated endocytosis (methyl-β-cyclodextrin and nystatin), actin polymerization (latrunculin, cytochalasin D) or macropinocytosis (amiloride) before being co-cultured with C91-PL infected cells. We controlled that treatment with inhibitors did not change the viability of the different DC subsets compared to untreated DCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s006">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>). Viral capture was measured after 3 h of contact with C91-PL. Treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin and nystatin, that depleted cholesterol as controlled by the lack of lipids droplets stained by Nile red in IL-4 treated DCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s006">S6C Fig</xref>), did not affect p19<sup>gag</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s006">S6D Fig</xref>), suggesting that HTLV-1 entry does not follow caveolin-mediated endocytosis. However, HTLV-1 entry was significantly reduced by both chlorpromazine and latrunculin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), suggesting a requirement for clathrin-mediated endocytosis and actin polymerization. Interestingly, HTLV-1 entry was significantly reduced by amiloride and dynasore in immature IL4 DCs and LPS-matured DCs but not in IFN-α DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), suggesting the requirement of macropinocytosis specifically in immature and mature IL-4 DCs. Macropinocytosis involves PI3K and PKC that control actin polymerization through the activation of Rac 1 GTPase. Rac 1 GTPase in turn controls the polymerization of actin through the activation of Pak-1. All these processes finally lead to the extension of filopodia that fold back onto the cell membrane to form large irregular macropinosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref029">29</xref>]. HTLV-1 entry was blocked in immature and LPS-matured IL-4 DCs by the PI3K inhibitor wortmanin, the PKC inhibitors rottlerin and Gö6976, and inhibitors of Rac 1 (NSC23766) and Pak1 (IPA-3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). This further confirms the implication of macropinocytosis in HTLV-1 entry in these subsets. Interestingly, compared to entry in IL-4 DCs, HTLV-1 entry in LPS-matured DCs was more reduced after treatment with genistein, rottlerin and NSC, less reduced after treatment with Gö6976 and not blocked by the inhibitor of actin fibers elongation cytochalasin D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), suggesting the involvement of a different macropinocytosis process in LPS-matured DCs. Finally, HTLV-1 entry in immature and LPS-matured IL-4 DCs was not blocked by nocodazole and blebstatin, suggesting that microtubule or myosin contraction are not involved in the macropinocytosis process of HTLV-1 entry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s006">S6E Fig</xref>). Altogether, these results demonstrate that HTLV-1 entry in immature and LPS-matured IL4-DCs requires macropinocytosis as well as clathrin-mediated endocytosis while entry in IFN-α DC used mainly clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</p>

<title>Acidic pH of vesicles decreases DC infection</title>
<p>Since HTLV-1 entry pathways, and intracellular localization are similar in immature IL-4 DCs that are susceptible to infection and in IFN-α DCs that are resistant to infection, we next wondered whether intravesicular pH could modify the ability of the virus to establish a productive infection. Indeed, previous studies reported that immature DCs have vesicles with neutral pH, while vesicles pH is more acidic in mature DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref030">30</xref>]. Using acidic lysotracker, which fluorescence intensity is dependent on acidic pH, and using drugs that induce intravesicular acidification (diphenylene-iodonium DPI) or alkalization (chloroquine), we were able to modulate and monitor the pH of vesicles. The neutral pH of vesicles in immature IL-4 DC was acidified after DPI treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), while the slightly more acidic pH of vesicles in IFN-α DCs was alkalized after chloroquine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). As a control, the acidic pH of vesicles in LPS-treated DCs was alkalized after choloroquine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g007">Fig 7G</xref>). IL-4 DCs treated with DPI captured similar amount of HTLV-1 than untreated IL-4 DCs when co-cultured with C91PL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). However, productive infection was significantly reduced under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). This suggests that HTLV-1 trafficking into acidic vesicles inhibits productive infection of IL-4 DCs. In contrast, in the same co-culture conditions, chloroquine treatment of IFN-α DCs, reduced viral capture to a level similar to that of IL-4 DCs, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). In addition, Tax expression was significantly increased in chloroquine-treated IFN-α DCs compared to untreated IFN-α DCs, although it did not reach the level of Tax expression in IL-4 DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). This suggests that productive infection is only partially restored by alkalization of IFN-α DC vesicles. Similar results were obtained after treatment of LPS-matured DCs before their co-culture with C91-PL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g007">Fig 7H and 7I</xref>), further suggesting that alkalization of matured DC vesicles partially restores productive infection. Altogether, our results suggest that productive infection of DCs by HTLV-1 requires a neutral pH of vesicles and an immature phenotype of the DCs.</p>

<title>Productive infection of DCs is required for viral transfer to T-cells</title>
<p>We have previously shown that productive infection of IL-4 DCs was the main route of HTLV-1 transmission to lymphocytes, although passive transfer from HTLV-1-exposed IL-4 DCs in presence of AZT may have occurred in rare cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref009">9</xref>]. This passive transfer, also known as “trans-infection” (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref031">31</xref>]), results from transmission of captured viral particles without productive infection, and is the main route used by HIV-1 for spreading to T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref032">32</xref>]. Since viral capture is around three-fold higher in LPS-matured DCs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g004">Fig 4E</xref>) and six-fold higher in IFN-α DCs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g002">Fig 2D</xref>) than in IL-4 DCs, we hypothesized that trans-infection might occur preferentially with mature DCs compared to IL-4 DCs. IL-4 DCs, LPS-treated DCs or IFN-α DCs were thus exposed to C91-PL for 3 h to allow viral capture, and then separated from C91-PL using positive selection with anti-BDCA-4 antibodies. We controlled that the DC phenotype was not changed after the purification process (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>) and allowed the removal of at least 95% of C91-PL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006353.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). Purified DCs were then co-cultured for 2 days with Jurkat LTR-Luc reporter cells, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Luciferase signals significantly decreased when co-culture was performed with LPS-treated IL-4 DCs or IFN-α DCs, compared to co-culture with IL-4 DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Interestingly, when IFN-α DCs were treated with chloroquine before co-culture with C91-PL, luciferase signals were significantly higher compared to co-culture with untreated IFN-α DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g008">Fig 8A</xref> see graph). These results suggest that although HTLV-1 capture is higher in mature DCs, internalized virus in acidic vesicles cannot be transferred to T-cells. To control that the decreased luciferase signals were not due to a decreased ability of IFN-α or LPS-treated DCs to engage cell-to-cell contacts with Jurkat-LTR-Luc cells, we counted the number of DC-Jurkat-LTR-Luc conjugates in co-cultures containing DCs, C91-PL and Jurkat-LTR-Luc cells. To distinguish the different cell types in the co-culture, C91-PL were stained with a cell tracker and appeared in red, while Jurkat-LTR-Luc cells were transduced with GFP-expressing lentivectors, and appeared in green. DCs were left unstained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). The number of cell conjugates between unstained DCs and GFP-labelled Jurkat-LTR-Luc cells after 3 h of co-culture did not change significantly when IL-4, IFN-α or LPS-treated DCs were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, see graph), suggesting that decreased viral transfer from IFN-α DCs and LPS-treated DCs was not due to a lack of contacts with Jurkat cells. Next, IL-4 DCs, LPS-treated DCs or IFN-α DCs were exposed to C91-PL for 3 h, purified using positive selection with anti-BDCA-4 antibodies and cultured for three days to allow productive infection. Then, Jurkat-LTR-Luc reporter cells were added in the MDDCs culture and luciferase signals monitored two days later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). In that setting, IL-4 DCs were able to transfer significant amounts of HTLV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g008">Fig 8C</xref>), while reduced luciferase signals were detected using LPS-treated IL-4 DCs or IFN-α DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g008">Fig 8C</xref>), confirming that productive infection is required to allow virus transfer to T-cells. This was further controlled using AZT treatment, which significantly reduced luciferase signals.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, AZT treatment of LPS-treated IL-4 DCs or IFN-α DCs also reduced luciferase signals observed with the untreated DC subsets, suggesting that the viral transfer observed with these subsets relies on their productive infection and not on long term viral capture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). In addition, when IFN-α DCs were treated with chloroquine before their exposure to C91-PL and their purification, viral transfer to T-cells was partially restored, but only in the absence of AZT. Altogether, these results suggest that viral transmission from DCs to T-cells mainly results from transmission of newly synthesized virus from productively infected DCs, and not from passive transmission after viral capture by LPS-matured or IFN-α DCs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Apart from circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes that represent the main infected cell population in chronically infected individuals, HTLV-1 proviral DNA is also detected in antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as myeloid DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref033">33</xref>], monocytes and plasmacytoid DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref011">11</xref>]. We previously showed that <italic>in vitro</italic> MDDCs are more susceptible to HTLV-1 infection than autologous primary T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref009">9</xref>], supporting a model in which DCs would be the first cells to be infected during primary infection. <italic>In vivo</italic>, DCs come with different flavors and functions depending on their location in the body. Thus, virus interaction with DCs may have different outcomes depending on the nature of the DCs encountered in the course of infection. In this study, we used dendritic cells differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> from human monocytes to generate different DC subsets mimicking those present <italic>in vivo</italic>. We demonstrate for the first time that DCs are not all equally susceptible to HTLV-1 infection. While immature DCs are more susceptible than tolerogenic-TGF-β DCs to HTLV-1 infection, inflammatory DCs and mature DCs are resistant to HTLV-1 infection.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, resistance is neither due to the presence of high level of type-I interferon produced by inflammatory DCs or mature DCs, nor to the exogenous recombinant interferon used to generate those DCs. Interestingly, these results are different from previous reports, including ours, obtained in T-cells, which showed that their susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection is sensitive to IFN-α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref027">27</xref>]. Of note, cell-type-dependent susceptibility to IFN has already been reported and was linked to the use of cell-type-specific patterns of STAT activation as well as to usage of additional signaling components that can finely tune ISGs expression in a given cell type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref035">35</xref>]. In addition, substantial quantitative differences in STAT activation in different cell-types may be linked to the induction of the same ISGs but with different amplitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref036">36</xref>]. In T-cells, treatment with exogenous IFN-α2 results in a block in HTLV-1 protein expression, due to protein kinase R (PKR) activation while the early steps of the viral cycle are maintained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref023">23</xref>]. Strikingly, it was shown that treatment with recombinant IFN-α2 induced a higher expression of PKR in DCs than in T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref036">36</xref>]. Thus, our results, which demonstrate a lack of antiviral control in DCs after IFN treatment, suggest that PKR induction in DCs might not be as efficient as in T-cells to restrict HTLV-1 infection. Alternatively, PKR phosphorylation that is required for its antiviral activity might not be present or sufficient in DCs treated with type I IFN. In addition, PKR antiviral activity could be counterbalanced by the concomitant induction of ADAR-1 (Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA type 1), another ISG that has been shown to enhance replication of several viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref037">37</xref>]. Interestingly, ADAR-1 expression in T-cells suppresses IFN-α inhibitory effect on HTLV-1 expression through the repression of PKR phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref038">38</xref>]. Thus, the inability of IFN-α to restrict HTLV-1 infection in DCs might be the result of an unbalanced expression of ADAR-1 over that of PKR.</p>
<p>Our results also demonstrated that restriction was not due to a lack of viral entry in mature DCs, although the level of viral binding receptors is lower than in susceptible DCs. This suggests that viral capture by DCs that have been exposed to infected cells may use other receptors. Interestingly, HTLV-1 was observed in CD82 positive compartment in all DC subsets. CD82 is a tetraspanin receptor located in MVBs and at the plasma membrane, and has been shown to interact with the HTLV-1 envelope glycoprotein in T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref039">39</xref>]. Thus, one could hypothesize that CD82 is used by HTLV-1 to enter DCs during cell-to-cell transfer, and maybe involved in the targeting of HTLV-1 to vesicles in DCs. This is currently under investigation in our laboratory. Indeed, localization of incoming viruses in vesicles in both susceptible and resistant DCs could reflect a distinct entry route in these cell types compared to T-cells, in which it is assumed that HTLV-1 entry occurs after fusion at the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref040">40</xref>]. We observed that the level of the fusion receptor Glut-1 is similar in the three DC subsets, suggesting that HTLV-1 capsids could be delivered to the cytosol after fusion of the viral envelope with the membrane of the vesicles. Accordingly, both in susceptible DCs and in restricted DCs in which vesicles had been alkalized after treatment with chloroquine, Tax expression was detected. This indicates that the viral cycle can be completed after the virus had trafficked through the endocytosis pathway. In contrast, Tax was not detected in susceptible DCs in which vesicles had been acidified after treatment with DPI, thus in which incoming vesicular viruses had been inactivated. This suggests that viral fusion at the plasma membrane, even if it is present, does not allow a productive infection. Vesicular uptake of viruses may not be limited to DCs and could be a feature of cell-to-cell transmission. Indeed, such a mechanism was also reported during HIV-1 cell-to-cell transfer between T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref043">43</xref>]. In that case, viral fusion occurred in the vesicles of the target cells after the late maturation of Gag proteins, authorizing the interaction of HIV-1 envelope with its co-receptor and thus the release of HIV-1 capsids into the cytoplasm, and subsequent productive infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref044">44</xref>]. It is thus possible that similar entry pathways occur during HTLV-1 cell-to-cell transmission.</p>
<p>We showed here that maturation of DCs strongly limited their productive infection. Interestingly, it was shown that stimulation of primary hepatocytes with TLR agonists was able to inhibit replication of woodchuck hepatitis B virus (WHBV) in an interferon-independent pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref045">45</xref>]. In this study, restriction was not due to the expression of a soluble factor nor to activation of JAK/STAT pathway that is specific to IFN signaling, but was induced by TLR signaling via activation of the MAPK/ERK and PI-3K/Akt pathways. It was therefore suggested that TLR-induced proteins could act as restriction factors. We cannot exclude that maturation of DCs may induce HTLV-1 specific restriction factors. However, our results suggest that the first mechanism of HTLV-1 replication restriction relies on a post entry blockade and on specific viral trafficking.</p>
<p>DC maturation is a complex process that modifies DC function such as antigen capture, antigen processing and presentation. Pathogen capture mainly occurs via macropinocytosis, a non-receptor mediated endocytic pathway. Macropinocytosis is a constitutive process in immature DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref046">46</xref>], while it is switched to an induced process in mature DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref047">47</xref>]. Indeed, in the absence of pathogen-induced signaling, mature DCs have lower abilities to internalize pathogens compared to immature DCs. Interestingly, we showed here that HTLV-1 entry was blocked by genistein, an inhibitor of induced macropinocytosis but not by cytochalasin D, a drug acting on actin fibers elongation in mature but not in immature DCs. This suggests distinct actin requirements that may be relevant to mechanisms specific to constitutive versus induced macropinocytosis.</p>
<p>These entry mechanisms may be consistent with the intracellular localization of HTLV-1 in the different subsets. Interestingly, earlier studies using electron microscopy analyses of MDDCs co-cultured with HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes, showed viral particles internalized in vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref006">6</xref>], although the nature of these vesicles was not identified. Our results showed that in all DCs subsets, viruses were found in large vesicles also positive for tetraspanin but not for early endosome marker. This staining is evocative of MVB, and is reminiscent of the Virus-Containing Compartments (VCC) described in HIV-1 infected macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref056">56</xref>].</p>
<p>Thus, based on all our results, we propose a schematic model for HTLV-1 infection of DC subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g009">Fig 9</xref>). When HTLV-1 encounters immature DCs, viral entry through constitutive macropinocytosis would lead to internalization of HTLV-1 in MVB-like compartments from which the neutral pH would authorize viral capsid exit and completion of the viral replication cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g009">Fig 9A</xref>, left panel). In contrast, in IFN-α DCs, entry through clathrin-mediated endocytosis and not through macropinocytosis would lead to trafficking in vesicles targeted to degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). Finally, if DCs are matured before their interaction with HTLV-1, entry using constitutive macropinocytosis would deliver viruses to vesicles with an acidic pH, that would impair HTLV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006353.g009">Fig 9A</xref>, right panel). Surprisingly, alkalization of vesicles from mature DCs using chloroquine restored HTLV-1 infection, but only partially with a percentage of infection around 60% lower than that observed in immature DCs. This suggests that in addition to the traffic in acidic compartments, induction of HTLV-1-specific restriction factors induced after DC maturation would insure an efficient blockade of HTLV-1 replication in mature DCs.</p>

<p>Are these different outcomes of HTLV-1 infection in the different DC subsets important for the virus transfer to T-cells? In the HIV-1 model, DCs are resistant to HIV-1 infection due to the presence of several restriction factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref057">57</xref>], and thus most of the viral transfer from DCs to T-cells occurs by trans-infection, which does not require productive infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref058">58</xref>]. More importantly, DC-mediated trans-infection is more efficient when HIV-1 virions have been captured by mature DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref059">59</xref>]. Interestingly, DC maturation with TLR agonists also renders them susceptible to X4-tropic HIV-1 infection, although they are still resistant to infection with R5-tropic HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref060">60</xref>]. This suggests that DC infection with HIV-1 is controlled by several factors that depend upon the DC maturation status and upon HIV-1 strains. Depending on the viral strain, transfer of HIV-1 from DCs to T-cells would use either trans-infection in the case of R5-tropic viruses or cis-infection in the case of X4-tropic viruses. In any case, mature DCs would be responsible for the efficient transfer to T-cells and rapid spreading of HIV-1 within individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref032">32</xref>]. During HTLV-1 infection, interaction with DCs is also important for the establishment of the chronic infection of T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006353.ref061">61</xref>]. However, since this infection has not been linked to immune activation, HTLV-1 might more likely interact with immature DCs. Thus, our results showing that immature DC are the only subset able to transfer the virus to T-cells, in a process mainly based on their productive infection, is relevant to the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation. The nature of the DCs encountered by HTLV-1 upon primo-infection, which display a differential susceptibility to HTLV-1 infection, would therefore determine the efficiency of viral transmission to T-cells. Finally, in contrast to the dissemination of HIV-1 by mature DCs, our results strongly suggest that the restriction of HTLV-1 infection in mature DCs and more importantly, their inability to transfer the virus to T-cells might be an efficient way for the host to limit HTLV-1 spread.</p>
