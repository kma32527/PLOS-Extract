<abstract>
<p>Identification of cellular receptors and characterization of viral tropism in animal models have vastly improved our understanding of morbillivirus pathogenesis. However, specific aspects of viral entry, dissemination and transmission remain difficult to recapitulate in animal models. Here, we used three virologically identical but phenotypically distinct recombinant (r) canine distemper viruses (CDV) expressing different fluorescent reporter proteins for <italic>in vivo</italic> competition and airborne transmission studies in ferrets (<italic>Mustela putorius furo</italic>). Six donor ferrets simultaneously received three rCDVs expressing green, red or blue fluorescent proteins via conjunctival (ocular, Oc), intra-nasal (IN) or intra-tracheal (IT) inoculation. Two days post-inoculation sentinel ferrets were placed in physically separated adjacent cages to assess airborne transmission. All donor ferrets developed lymphopenia, fever and lethargy, showed progressively increasing systemic viral loads and were euthanized 14 to 16 days post-inoculation. Systemic replication of virus inoculated via the Oc, IN and IT routes was detected in 2/6, 5/6 and 6/6 ferrets, respectively. In five donor ferrets the IT delivered virus dominated, although replication of two or three different viruses was detected in 5/6 animals. Single lymphocytes expressing multiple fluorescent proteins were abundant in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues, demonstrating the occurrence of double and triple virus infections. Transmission occurred efficiently and all recipient ferrets showed evidence of infection between 18 and 22 days post-inoculation of the donor ferrets. In all cases, airborne transmission resulted in replication of a single-colored virus, which was the dominant virus in the donor ferret. This study demonstrates that morbilliviruses can use multiple entry routes in parallel, and co-infection of cells during viral dissemination in the host is common. Airborne transmission was efficient, although transmission of viruses expressing a single color suggested a bottleneck event. The identity of the transmitted virus was not determined by the site of inoculation but by the viral dominance during dissemination.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Canine distemper virus (CDV) infection of ferrets is a tractable animal model for measles. Ferrets are highly susceptible to CDV, and inoculation with a low dose leads to lethal disease. We performed <italic>in vivo</italic> competition experiments to study virus entry, dissemination and transmission. Ferrets were simultaneously inoculated with CDV via the conjunctival, intra-nasal and intra-tracheal routes. The viruses were identical except for the fluorescent reporter protein encoded by the viral genome. By detecting cells expressing the different fluorescent reporter proteins at various sites in the host, we determined that CDV can enter the host in parallel at multiple sites. Virus spread in the ferret occurred via infected lymphocytes, which often turned out to be double- or triple-infected. Sentinel ferrets, placed in physically separated adjacent cages, became infected by airborne transmission. Transmission of the dominant single color despite replication of multicolor viruses in the upper respiratory tract suggested a bottleneck event.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Morbilliviruses are enveloped, non-segmented, negative strand RNA viruses that belong to the family <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref001">1</xref>]. They are highly contagious, spread via the respiratory route, cause profound immune suppression but also elicit lifelong immunity in surviving hosts, and have a propensity to cause large outbreaks associated with high morbidity and mortality in previously unexposed populations. Measles virus (MV) is the prototype morbillivirus and remains a significant cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in the developing world. Measles is characterized by fever, skin rash, cough and conjunctivitis, followed by a transient immune suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref002">2</xref>]. The resulting increased susceptibility to secondary infections can lead to life-threatening complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref003">3</xref>]. In spite of the availability of safe and effective live-attenuated MV vaccines, measles outbreaks continue to occur in the industrialized world due to inadequate vaccination coverage and importations of this highly transmissible virus from endemic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>The narrow host range and long incubation period of MV have restricted the characterization of its pathogenesis since patients are not recognized as having measles until onset of rash, and animal studies predominantly rely on experimental infections of non-human primates (NHPs). A surrogate model for MV pathogenesis is infection of ferrets with canine distemper virus (CDV), a morbillivirus that can infect a wide range of carnivores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref007">7</xref>]. However, CDV in carnivores is highly neurotropic and often leads to fatal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref008">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref012">12</xref>], which is in sharp contrast to MV infection of humans and NHPs.</p>
<p>Morbilliviruses are amongst the most contagious viruses known and are primarily transmitted by aerosols or respiratory droplets. Once inhaled, virions establish primary infection by receptor-dependent fusion at the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref013">13</xref>]. Two cellular receptors involved in morbillivirus infection have been identified: signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family member 1 (SLAM/F1, or CD150), expressed by subsets of thymocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), hematopoietic stem cells, macrophages, T- and B-lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref014">14</xref>], and nectin cell adhesion molecule 4 (nectin-4, previously known as poliovirus receptor-related 4), expressed at the adherens junction complex of epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref016">16</xref>]. Both receptors play a crucial role in viral pathogenesis (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref017">17</xref>]), with CD150-mediated infection being critical for entry and dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref019">19</xref>] and nectin-4-mediated infection critical for virus transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>A number of aspects of morbillivirus pathogenesis remain unresolved. Studies in mice and NHPs have shown that MV initially infects alveolar macrophages and DCs in the lungs, instead of epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref022">22</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref024">24</xref>]. Even though this is a possible entry route, it seems unlikely that a highly contagious virus with an R<sub>0</sub> of 12â18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref025">25</xref>] and of which infection with one 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>) is sufficient to cause productive infection in macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref026">26</xref>], exclusively depends on infection of target cells in the alveoli. Additional routes of entry into a susceptible host have been postulated, including infection of CD150<sup>+</sup> immune cells within the epithelium of the respiratory tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref027">27</xref>]. As DCs are abundant within this epithelium, and DC-SIGN was previously identified as an attachment receptor for MV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref029">29</xref>], it is suggested that DCs could play a crucial role in this entry route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref030">30</xref>]. Additionally, damage to the upper respiratory tract epithelium by mechanical injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref031">31</xref>] or respiratory co-infections potentially exposes nectin-4 as a cellular entry receptor. Another potential route of entry for morbilliviruses involves CD150<sup>+</sup> and/or DC-SIGN<sup>+</sup> cells present in the conjunctiva of the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref033">33</xref>]. However, direct <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence from animal models for these alternative entry strategies is lacking.</p>
<p>Recombinant (r) viruses expressing fluorescent reporter proteins have allowed sensitive assessment of morbillivirus entry and dissemination <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref035">35</xref>]. Multicolored viruses have been used to demonstrate MV polyploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref036">36</xref>], ribonucleoprotein trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref037">37</xref>], superinfection immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref038">38</xref>], potential of segmenting the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref039">39</xref>] and a cross-genomic cooperation modulating phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref040">40</xref>]. Recognizing the power of this approach for <italic>in vivo</italic> competition studies, we simultaneously administered three rCDVs expressing green (Venus), red (dTom) or blue (TagBFP) fluorescent proteins to ferrets to assess viral entry, intra-host dissemination and inter-host transmission. We show that CDV enters the host efficiently if delivered to the nose or lung, and that infection of the host through conjunctival administration, although less efficient, is also possible. <italic>In vivo</italic> competition showed that the route of entry had no influence on viral dissemination. However, exclusive single-color virus transmission of the systemically dominant virus to recipient ferrets was observed, suggesting a bottleneck during transmission.</p>

The decline in viral load in WBC during the second week was likely due to the virtual absence of lymphocytes in peripheral blood, resulting in exhaustion of susceptible CD150-positive cells.

<title>rCDV uses multiple routes of entry in parallel</title>

In five out of six donor ferrets, IN inoculation also resulted in viremia, demonstrating that morbilliviruses can also efficiently invade a host when 3300 TCID<sub>50</sub> in a low volume (25Î¼l/nostril) was deposited in the upper respiratory tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).

<title>Multi-route delivery of rCDVs results in widespread systemic replication</title>
<p>Next we focused on the period between onset of viremia and euthanasia of the donor ferrets to assess morbillivirus dissemination. In one ferret (<italic>D1</italic>) the virus inoculated via the IN route became dominant, while in all other ferrets the virus given by IT inoculation became dominant. Likewise, viruses that predominated in WBC were in most cases also present at the greatest level in single cell suspensions from lymphoid tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>Detection of fluorescent protein expression in WBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) showed a good correlation with virus isolation from WBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>, left panel). Ferrets <italic>D1</italic> and <italic>D2</italic> illustrate this since these animals represented two extremes of the study. In ferret <italic>D1</italic> two viruses were detected systemically (rCDV<sup>SH</sup>Venus(6) and rCDV<sup>SH</sup>dTom(6)), however one virus (rCDV<sup>SH</sup>dTom(6)) became dominant. In ferret <italic>D2</italic> all three viruses replicated at comparable levels.

Photomicrographs in the left panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref> show a high resolution CLSM image of a representative well, while the large pie charts show the relative color distribution produced by viruses isolated from WBC collected at 8 DPI.

Interestingly, the proportion of green fluorescent virus in ferrets <italic>D1</italic> and <italic>D2</italic> was higher in BAL than in all other tissues, corresponding to IT inoculation of these two ferrets with rCDV<sup>SH</sup>Venus(6). In ferret <italic>D1</italic>, low systemic detection of green fluorescent cells, was contrasted by a relatively high percentage of green fluorescent cells in the tracheo-bronchial lymph node (TB LN) which drains the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). At necropsy, CLSM analysis of respiratory tract tissues and lymph nodes of ferret <italic>D1</italic> revealed a predominance of red fluorescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, right panels), whereas the same tissues collected from ferret <italic>D2</italic> contained a mixture of different colored fluorescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, right panels).</p>
<p>Macroscopic fluorescence produced by rCDV<sup>SH</sup>Venus(6) and rCDV<sup>SH</sup>dTom(6) was imaged both in living ferrets and at necropsy.

<title>Double- and triple-rCDV-infected cells <italic>in vivo</italic> during dissemination</title>
<p>Morbillivirus viremia is mediated by circulation of infected cells rather than cell-free virions. As a consequence, morbilliviruses predominantly disseminate by cell-to-cell spread within the host. It has been hypothesized that superinfection immunity is a significant barrier to dual infections of cells. Unexpectedly, during virus isolation procedures from WBC we not only observed green, blue or red syncytia, but also syncytia that contained two or three fluorescent proteins, pseudo-colored as yellow (Venus / dTom), purple (dTom / TagBFP), cyan (Venus / TagBFP) or white (Venus / dTom / TagBFP) following image acquisition by CLSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Since it may be possible that double- and triple-positive syncytia could have been caused by fusion of single-infected cells, thus not representing true double or triple infections of single cells, we performed direct CLSM of tissues collected during necropsy. This confirmed the presence of double-infected cells in the epithelium of the trachea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, upper panel, Venus / TagBFP cell shown as cyan [*] and Venus / dTom cell shown as yellow [#]) and in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, lower panel). In the spleen, single-infected cells were observed throughout the section in red, green and blue, whereas many double-positive cells were observed in cyan, yellow and purple. Finally, double and triple infections were confirmed by flow cytometry. As an example, WBC obtained from ferret <italic>D2</italic> at 8 DPI were gated for positive events for a single reporter protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, left panels), for which subsequently the other two reporter proteins were plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, right panels). This demonstrated the presence of single-infected cells (lower-left quadrant), but double- (lower-right and upper-left quadrant) and triple-infected (upper-right quadrant) lymphocytes were also commonly detected. Although triple-infected cells were only detected in 2/6 animals, double-infected cells were more common and were detected in 5/6 animals.

<p>In ferret <italic>D5</italic>, rCDV was detected in the nasal cavity and CNS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006371.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). In the nasal cavity, the number of CDV positive cells was lower in comparison to ferret <italic>D4</italic>, and consisted predominantly of fibroblasts and macrophage-like cells in the submucosa. In the CNS, CDV-infected cells were frequently observed in the meninges, predominantly in the meninges surrounding the cerebellum. Positive ependymal cells were detected in the choroid plexus, responsible for the production of CSF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006371.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), which corresponds to the isolation of virus from the CSF from this ferret. In the cerebellum, meninges surrounding the cerebellum and brainstem, endothelial cells and cells adjacent to blood vessels were occasionally CDV positive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006371.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). This suggests hematogenous spread of CDV into the CNS.

<title>rCDV infection of donor ferrets results in airborne transmission to recipient ferrets</title>
<p>To assess airborne transmission, CDV-naive recipient (<italic>R1 âR6</italic>) ferrets were placed in transmission cages at 2 DPI. Donor and recipient ferrets were sampled every other DPI and followed for a maximum of 16 or 22 DPI respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Ferrets were housed in pairs, meaning that recipient ferret <italic>R1</italic> was placed in a cage adjacent to donor ferret <italic>D1</italic>. Body temperature was measured in 4 out of 6 recipient ferrets. Fever was not observed in the recipient ferrets tested up to the time point of euthanasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). However, the majority of recipient ferrets showed decreased lymphocyte counts shortly before euthanasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Airborne transmission was confirmed in all donor-recipient pairs and infectious rCDV was isolated from WBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g006">Fig 6E</xref>), nose, throat, eye and/or rectal swabs collected from recipient ferrets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). By using flow cytometry, rCDV replication was detected in WBC of 5 out of 6 ferrets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). For recipient ferret (<italic>R4</italic>) in which CDV-infected cells were not detected by flow cytometry, rCDV<sup>SH</sup>dTom(6) was isolated from throat and eye swabs.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have performed <italic>in vivo</italic> competition and transmission studies in ferrets with virologically identical but spectrally distinct rCDVs administered simultaneously via multiple routes. Our aim was to study the temporal and spatial interplay of viruses during the early, intermediate and late stages of CDV infection. These ârainbow CDVâ studies are the first to show that morbilliviruses can use multiple entry routes in parallel. Detection of circulating or lymphoid tissue-derived lymphocytes expressing multiple fluorescent reporter proteins was common, demonstrating that <italic>in vivo</italic> superinfection immunity is not a restrictive phenomenon. Airborne transmission to recipient ferrets was detected in all animal pairs, underpinning the highly infectious nature of morbilliviruses.</p>
<p>Animal models of human viral diseases provide the bedrock of much of the current understanding of tropism and pathogenesis, and are essential for the development and licensure of drugs and vaccines. Ideally the human pathogen under study should not need to be adapted to the animal and the disease process should recapitulate the full clinical spectrum in people. This is challenging and oftentimes either the pathogen or host must be genetically altered to produce disease. Therefore, related animal pathogens infecting natural host species provide useful surrogates in the pathogenesis toolkit. For example, Sendai virus infection of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref044">44</xref>], bovine respiratory syncytial virus infection of calves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref045">45</xref>] and simian immunodeficiency virus infection of NHPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref046">46</xref>] have provided important insights into the pathogenesis of closely related human viruses. Likewise, experimental CDV infections of ferrets have provided important insights into the pathogenesis of MV and other morbilliviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref047">47</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref050">50</xref>].</p>
<p>Both measles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref051">51</xref>] and canine distemper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref047">47</xref>] are recognized as highly infectious diseases that are spread via the respiratory tract. The availability of rMVs expressing fluorescent proteins allowed us to identify alveolar macrophages and DCs in NHPs as early target cells following aerosol inhalation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref024">24</xref>]. In that study, substantial numbers of MV-infected cells were not detected in the upper respiratory tract even though minuscule numbers of macrophages and DCs were detected in the deep lung at early time points after inoculation. This fitted well with our experience of IT inoculation as a highly reliable and standardized route of experimental MV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref026">26</xref>]. The majority of CDV pathogenesis studies in ferrets has used IN inoculation, delivering the virus to the upper respiratory tract. Although it is important to note that IN inoculation of relatively large volumes can easily result in deposition of virus in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref052">52</xref>], we also hypothesized that it was unlikely that morbilliviruses exclusively used the lower respiratory tract as a portal of entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref030">30</xref>]. Therefore, we simultaneously inoculated ferrets with multicolor rCDVs via the IN and IT routes, ensuring delivery to only the upper and lower respiratory tract, respectively. Since the conjunctivae have also been suggested as a portal of entry for many respiratory viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref033">33</xref>], including MV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref032">32</xref>], ocular inoculation was used as a third possible route of entry. IN and IT delivery resulted in viremia in 5 out of 6 and 6 out of 6 ferrets, respectively, within a week after inoculation. The fact that the IT-delivered virus became dominant in 5 out of 6 ferrets suggests that this is the most efficient port of entry, confirming previous observations with MV infection of NHPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref026">26</xref>]. This could be explained by the fact that in the lungs the potential target cells (alveolar macrophages and/or DCs) are directly accessible and not shielded by an epithelial barrier. However, since virus delivered by IN inoculation in a low volume also resulted in viremia in the majority of the ferrets, this demonstrated that multiple routes of entry can be used in parallel. Inoculation of the virus onto the conjunctivae resulted in infection in only 2 out of 6 ferrets, demonstrating that this is a legitimate, albeit less efficient entry portal. However, since there is a direct connection between the eyes and the upper respiratory tract via the nasolacrimal duct, transport of virus particles to the upper respiratory tract after conjunctival delivery cannot be excluded. Moreover, it is important to note that this study was not designed to assess statistically significant differences between these routes of entry.</p>
<p>CDV dissemination is mediated by infected circulating and tissue-resident B- and T-lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref035">35</xref>], and results in lymphopenia and fever. During dissemination the infection remains highly cell-associated, and few virions are detected in plasma. Spread is mediated mostly by direct cell-to-cell transmission, e.g. by the formation of virological synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref054">54</xref>]. Here, we show that regardless of the route of entry, all donor ferrets developed a similar course of fatal disease, and severity was independent of the number of circulating rCDVs. Interestingly, significant numbers of lymphocytes co-expressed two or three fluorescent reporter proteins, demonstrating that they were infected with viruses inoculated at different sites. Although it has been shown that morbillivirus infection induces superinfection immunity <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref038">38</xref>], the incredibly rapid dissemination of CDV (with percentages of infected WBC rising from undetectable to more than 50% within 2 days in some animals) leads to lymphocytes being double- or triple-infected. We consider serial, direct cell-to-cell transmission of rCDVs from different donor cells to single acceptor cells the most likely explanation of the existence of double or triple infections. In fact, double infection was readily reproduced <italic>in vitro</italic> by exposing a B-lymphoblastic canine cell line to two rCDVs, and was also reproduced when the second infection was performed six hours after the first.</p>
<p>Multi-route delivery of virologically identical but phenotypically distinct viruses is a powerful approach to dissect the complex interplay in evolving pathogenesis. None of the data suggest that the expression of different fluorescent reporter proteins had an effect on virus fitness and we have done our utmost to ensure that rCDVs were genetically identical in terms of genome length and ATU design. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that genes encoding Venus, dTom and TagBFP contain secondary or tertiary RNA structures or immune-activating sequences. Alternating the rCDVs and administration routes in three subsequent experiments further mitigated this risk.</p>
<p>Although epidemiological observations have demonstrated that CDV is a highly contagious virus, surprisingly few experimental studies have examined transmission. In 1926, Dunkin and Laidlaw meticulously described precautions taken to perform experimental CDV infections of ferrets and keep their breeding stock of animals free of canine distemper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref047">47</xref>]. Three transmission pathways: direct contact between sick and healthy animals, housing a healthy animal in a cage from which a moribund animal had been removed several hours earlier, and airborne transmission were described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref047">47</xref>]. The timespan between onset of disease in the donor and recipient animals was around ten days. Subsequent direct transmission studies documented a period of 6 to 11 days for development of disease in recipient animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref055">55</xref>] and experimental CDV outbreak studies in ferrets support a role for airborne transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref056">56</xref>]. The observed time period required for CDV transmission in our experiment was in good accordance with these previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref056">56</xref>].</p>
<p>Even though we could not determine the exact tissue origin of transmitted virus due to widespread dissemination of different colored viruses throughout the donor ferrets, the dominant virus of the donor always was the only virus transmitted to the recipient. The added value of our study was that the transmission of a single color rCDV, even when two or three rCDVs were detected in donor ferrets, suggested a bottleneck event during airborne transmission: apparently only one or a few infectious units were transmitted from donor to recipient ferret. This mirrors influenza airborne transmission between ferrets, in which virus populations in recipient ferrets proved to be genetically much more homogeneous than those of the donor ferrets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref058">58</xref>]. However, in this model transmission was restricted to airborne transmission, so the situation could be different for indirect and direct contact transmission. Overall, this illustrates the utility of gaining a comprehensive understanding of transmission in this important animal model, which is also being developed for Ebola virus and Nipah virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref059">59</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref061">61</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we have performed <italic>in vivo</italic> competition and transmission studies with rCDVs discernable on basis of their fluorescent reporter proteins. We believe that this model will prove its use in the future for <italic>in vivo</italic> competition studies to identify factors associated with viral fitness.</p>

<p>Animal experiments were conducted at Erasmus MC, in strict compliance with European guidelines (EU directive on animal testing 2010/63/EU) and Dutch legislation. The study protocol was approved by Stichting Dier Experimenten Commissie Consult (DEC Consult, permit number EMC3043), a Dutch independent animal experimentation ethics review board. The manuscript was prepared in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref062">62</xref>].</p>
<p>CDV-naive ferrets were housed in groups prior to rCDV infection, received standard feed on a daily basis and had access to water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Cages contained several sources of environmental enrichment. During the infection and transmission studies, ferrets were housed in transmission cages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref063">63</xref>]. Briefly, ferrets were housed individually in perspex cages, with paired donor (<italic>D</italic>) and recipient (<italic>R</italic>) ferrets being separated by two stainless steel grids. The bottom of the cages was covered with carpet and cages were not cleaned during the course of the experiment to prevent aerosolizing bodily excretions. Transmission cages were placed in HEPA-filtered, negatively pressurized biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) isolators. Animal welfare was checked on daily basis, and all animal handling was performed under light anesthesia using ketamine and medetomidine. After handling, atipamezole was administered to antagonize the effect of medetomidine.</p>

<title>Generation of rCDVs expressing Venus, dTom and TagBFP fluorescent proteins</title>
<p>Recombinant CDV strain Snyder-Hill (SH) viruses were generated as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref010">10</xref>]. Genes encoding the fluorescent reporter proteins Venus, dTom or TagBFP were added as an ATU at the sixth (6) position of the genome (between H and L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Importantly, TagBFP and dTom were modified by the addition of six (GGSGSG) and five (GSGSG) amino acids, respectively, to the carboxyl terminus to make them identical in size to Venus (239 amino acids). This ensured that the viral genome lengths were identical from the perspective of replication and transcription by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The three viruses were designated rCDV<sup>SH</sup>Venus(6), rCDV<sup>SH</sup>dTom(6) and rCDV<sup>SH</sup>TagBFP(6). Fluorescence produced in cells infected with these viruses can be readily discerned by flow cytometry, UV epifluorescence microscopy and CLSM. Virus stocks were grown in Vero-cCD150 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) and tested negative for contamination with <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> species.

<title>Animal study design</title>
<p>Twelve CDV-seronegative ferrets (<italic>Mustela putorius furo</italic>) were used for the rCDV infection and transmission studies. A temperature probe was implanted intraperitoneally 2 weeks before the beginning of the experiments to monitor body temperature noninvasively. Six donor ferrets (randomly selected, <italic>D1-6</italic>) were inoculated with 10<sup>4</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub> rCDV, divided in three equal parts of rCDV<sup>SH</sup>Venus(6): rCDV<sup>SH</sup>dTom(6): rCDV<sup>SH</sup>TagBFP(6) (each 3.3 x 10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>). Each reporter virus was administered via a different route, which were alternated over three experiments. Ferrets <italic>D1</italic> and <italic>D2</italic> received rCDV<sup>SH</sup>TagBFP(6) ocularly (Oc), rCDV<sup>SH</sup>dTom(6) intra-nasally (IN) and rCDV<sup>SH</sup>Venus(6) intra-tracheally (IT); ferrets <italic>D3</italic> and <italic>D4</italic> received rCDV<sup>SH</sup>Venus(6) Oc, rCDV<sup>SH</sup>TagBFP(6) IN and rCDV<sup>SH</sup>dTom(6) IT; ferrets <italic>D5</italic> and <italic>D6</italic> received rCDV<sup>SH</sup>dTom(6) Oc, rCDV<sup>SH</sup>Venus(6) IN and rCDV<sup>SH</sup>TagBFP(6) IT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Oc administration was performed by pipetting virus suspension (50Î¼l) directly onto each of the conjunctivae, IN inoculation by pipetting virus suspension (50Î¼l) into the nostrils while the ferret was held on its back to prevent spread to the trachea and IT inoculations by direct instillation of virus suspension (1ml) into the lower respiratory tract after intubation with a flexible catheter. Following inoculation, the six donor ferrets were placed individually in purpose built cages specifically designed to allow airborne transmission over a 10 cm divide. Donor ferrets were sampled every other day and were euthanized at 14â16 DPI. Six CDV-seronegative recipient ferrets (<italic>R1-6</italic>) were placed in the transmission cages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006371.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) at 2 DPI of the donor ferret.

<p>Small-volume blood samples were collected in Vacuette tubes (Greiner Bio-One, KremsmÃ¼nster, Austria) containing K<sub>3</sub>EDTA as an anticoagulant every other DPI of donor ferrets, or every other day after placement of recipient ferrets in transmission cages. Recipient ferrets were always sampled first to prevent direct contamination of recipient animals by sampling of the donor animals. Total WBC and lymphocyte counts were obtained using an automated counter (pocH-100iV; Sysmex). WBC were obtained by lysis of whole blood with red blood cell lysis buffer (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), washed and resuspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium as described above. Cells were counted using a hemocytometer and used directly for flow cytometry and virus isolation. The percentages of WBC infected by different reporter viruses were determined by detection of fluorescent reporter proteins by flow cytometry. Isolation of rCDV was performed on Vero-cCD150 cells using an infectious center test as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref066">66</xref>]. Virus isolations were monitored for cytopathic effect (CPE) by microscopy after co-cultivation with Vero-cCD150 cells for 3 to 6 days and results were expressed as the number of virus-infected cells/10<sup>6</sup> total cells. Relative contribution of the different reporter viruses to the number of virus-infected cells was determined by screening virus isolations on Vero-cCD150 cells for Venus, dTom and TagBFP expression by CLSM.</p>
<p>Throat and rectal swabs (cytobrush plus; Medscand Medical) and nose and eye swabs (polyester-tipped minitip urethral swab; Copan) were collected every other DPI from donor ferrets, or every other day after placement from recipient ferrets, in transport medium (Eagle's minimal essential medium [EMEM] with Hanks' salts, supplemented with lactalbumin enzymatic hydrolysate, penicillin, streptomycin, polymyxin B sulfate, nystatin, gentamicin, and glycerol) and frozen at â80Â°C. After being thawed, samples were vortexed, the swab was removed, and the remaining transport medium was used for virus isolation. Isolation of rCDV was performed on Vero-cCD150 cells using an infectious center test as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref066">66</xref>]. Virus isolations were monitored for CPE by microscopy after co-cultivation with Vero-cCD150 cells for 3 to 7 days and results were expressed as TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml. Relative contribution of the different reporter viruses to the number of virus-infected cells was determined by separately screening virus isolations for Venus, dTom and TagBFP by CLSM.</p>

<title>Necropsy</title>
<p>Ferrets were euthanized by exsanguination under deep ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia. Macroscopic detection of Venus and dTom was performed with an LED lamp and the appropriate filters as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref018">18</xref>]. Post-euthanasia, CSF was obtained by lumbar puncture. Virus isolation from CSF was performed by direct titration on Vero-cCD150 cells. A broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was performed postmortem by direct infusion of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 5 ml) into the right-hand side of the lung. BAL cells were resuspended in culture medium with supplements as described above, counted, and used directly for flow cytometry and virus isolation. The infection percentages of BAL cells were determined by detection of fluorescent reporter proteins by flow cytometry. Virus isolation was performed on Vero-cCD150 cells as previously described for MV on Vero cells expressing human CD150 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref018">18</xref>]. During necropsy, multiple tissues including brain, trachea, primary bronchus, lungs and spleen were harvested and screened directly for expression of fluorescent reporter proteins by CLSM. The left lung was inflated with 2% (W/V) low-melting-point agarose before being screened, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006371.ref067">67</xref>]. After screening, non-lymphoid tissues were transferred to 10% neutral-buffered formalin (FA). From two ferrets (<italic>D4</italic> and <italic>D5</italic>), the complete head was stored in 10% neutral-buffered FA for immunohistochemistry. Lymphoid tissues were collected in PBS for preparation of single-cell suspensions using cell strainers with a 100 Î¼m pore size (BD Biosciences, Erembodegem, Belgium) and directly used for flow cytometry. The infection percentages of single cell suspensions by different reporter viruses were determined by flow cytometry.</p>

<title>Histological and immunohistochemical analysis</title>
<p>After fixation in 10% formalin, ferret heads were decalcified in 10% EDTA (pH 7.4) for at least a month. After decalcification heads were embedded in paraffin. CDV<sup>SH</sup> was detected using a monoclonal antibody (VMRD Inc., Pullman, WA, USA). Briefly, 3Î¼m paraffin sections were deparaffinized and antigens were retrieved by boiling slides for 15 minutes in citric acid buffer (10mM, pH 6.0). Sections were incubated with the anti-CDV antibody for 1 hour at RT. Binding of the primary antibody was detected using a biotinylated rabbit-anti-mouse Ig (DAKO), after which tissue sections were incubated with ABComplex-HRP (DAKO) for 30 minutes. Peroxidase was revealed using 3-Amino-9-ethyl-carbazole (AEC, Sigma) resulting in a bright red precipitate. In each staining procedure an isotype control was included as a negative control.</p>
