<abstract>
<p>miR-122, a liver-specific microRNA, is one of the determinants for liver tropism of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Although miR-122 is required for efficient propagation of HCV, we have previously shown that HCV replicates at a low rate in miR-122-deficient cells, suggesting that HCV-RNA is capable of propagating in an miR-122-independent manner. We herein investigated the roles of miR-122 in both the replication of HCV-RNA and the production of infectious particles by using miR-122-knockout Huh7 (Huh7-122KO) cells. A slight increase of intracellular HCV-RNA levels and infectious titers in the culture supernatants was observed in Huh7-122KO cells upon infection with HCV. Moreover, after serial passages of HCV in miR-122-knockout Huh7.5.1 cells, we obtained an adaptive mutant, HCV<sub>122KO</sub>, possessing G28A substitution in the 5âUTR of the HCV genotype 2a JFH1 genome, and this mutant may help to enhance replication complex formation, a possibility supported by polysome analysis. We also found the introduction of adaptive mutation around miR-122 binding site in the genotype 1b/2a chimeric virus, which originally had an adenine at the nucleotide position 29. HCV<sub>122KO</sub> exhibited efficient RNA replication in miR-122-knockout cells and non-hepatic cells without exogenous expression of miR-122. Competition assay revealed that the G28A mutant was dominant in the absence of miR-122, but its effects were equivalent to those of the wild type in the presence of miR-122, suggesting that the G28A mutation does not confer an advantage for propagation in miR-122-rich hepatocytes. These observations may explain the clinical finding that the positive rate of G28A mutation was higher in miR-122-deficient PBMCs than in the patient serum, which mainly included the hepatocyte-derived virus from HCV-genotype-2a patients. These results suggest that the emergence of HCV mutants that can propagate in non-hepatic cells in an miR-122-independent manner may participate in the induction of extrahepatic manifestations in chronic hepatitis C patients.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>A liver-specific microRNA, miR-122, is one of the key determinants of hepatitis C virus (HCV) hepatotropism and is required for efficient propagation of HCV. On the other hand, chronic infection with HCV is often associated with extrahepatic manifestations (EHMs), and a low level of HCV-RNA replication has been detected in some non-hepatic cells. Nonetheless, the detailed mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain unknown. Here, we show that miR-122 is dispensable for low-level replication or infectious particle formation, and a mutant virus adapted to miR-122-knockout cells exhibited efficient but miR-122-independent propagation. The adaptive virus of HCV genotype 2a possessed a G28A substitution in the 5âUTR and facilitated efficient replication complex formation under an miR-122-deficient condition, while it propagated at a level comparable to the wild type HCV in the presence of miR-122. Moreover, various adaptive mutations including C30U were introduced into genotype 1b, which originally had an adenine at the nucleotide position 29. These observations suggest that substitutions that yield miR-122-independent propagation are not induced during propagation in hepatocytes; however, treatment with an miR-122 inhibitor or persistent infection of HCV in non-hepatic cells may induce the emergence of mutant viruses, as evidenced by clinical samples.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects over 170 million people worldwide and is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and a high rate of hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref001">1</xref>]. Chronic infection with HCV is often associated with extrahepatic manifestations (EHMs) such as mixed cryoglobulinemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, thyroiditis and diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref002">2</xref>]. A low level of HCV-RNA replication has been detected in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and neuronal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref004">4</xref>], suggesting that EHMs might be induced by the extrahepatic propagation of HCV. If so, however, the detailed mechanisms remain unknown.</p>
<p>Although there is no effective vaccine against HCV due to its genetic variability (quasispecies), the recent development of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) targeting viral proteins, such as NS3-4A protease, NS5A or NS5B polymerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref005">5</xref>], has improved the outcome. However, it has been reported that during DAA treatment, adaptive mutations in the HCV genome can be readily induced due to the low fidelity of NS5B RNA polymerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref006">6</xref>], resulting in the emergence of drug-resistant viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref007">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>A liver-specific microRNA (miRNA), miR-122, has been shown to be one of the most important host factors for HCV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref010">10</xref>]. In general, miRNA negatively regulates the translation of mRNA through an interaction with the 3âUTR in a sequence-specific manner. miR-122 regulates gene expressions important for functions involved in the maintenance of liver homeostasis, including the functions of lipid metabolism, iron metabolism, and carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref012">12</xref>]. On the other hand, the HCV 5âUTR has two binding sites for miR-122, which are highly conserved beyond the HCV genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref013">13</xref>]. Upon HCV infection, miR-122 has been shown to stabilize HCV-RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref014">14</xref>] and enhance internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref016">16</xref>] and replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref017">17</xref>] of HCV-RNA through direct interaction with the HCV 5âUTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref019">19</xref>]. However, the detailed function of miR-122 in the HCV lifecycle has not been understood well. In addition, this interaction results in the sequestration of miR-122 from host mRNA targets, which may be responsible for the long-term oncogenic potential of HCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Recent studies have revealed the importance of Ago2, a catalytic component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), and of Xrn1 and Xrn2, 5â to 3âexonucleases involved in mRNA decay, on the stabilization of HCV-RNA; however, the detailed mechanisms are largely unclear. Ago2 participates in the stabilization and enhancement of translation and replication of HCV-RNA via direct interaction with miR-122 and the HCV 5âUTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref022">22</xref>], and Xrn1 and Xrn2 are involved in degradation of HCV-RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref023">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref025">25</xref>], while miR-122 might protect the HCV genome from such degradation. A locked nucleic acid (LNA) complementary to miR-122 has advanced to phase II clinical trial, and subcutaneous injection of LNA into chronic hepatitis C patients was shown to suppress the propagation of HCV without the appearance of any drug-resistant virus or adaptive mutation in the 5âUTR of the HCV genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref026">26</xref>]. Recently, however, the G28A mutation adjacent to the miR-122 binding site in the 5âUTR of the genotype 2a Jc1 genome introduced during infection in the presence of an miR-122 decoy has been shown to possess more potent accessibility and affinity to miR-122 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref027">27</xref>]. In addition, we and another group have previously shown that a low level of replication of HCV occurred in several miR-122-deficient cells including non-hepatic Hec1B and hepatoma Hep3B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref029">29</xref>], suggesting that HCV-RNA is capable of propagating in an miR-122-independent manner.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the roles of miR-122 not only on replication of HCV-RNA but also on production of infectious particles by using miR-122-knockout Huh7 cells. Adaptive HCV mutants obtained after serial passages in miR-122-knockout cells exhibited efficient RNA replication in an miR-122-independent manner by introduction of the G28A mutation for miR-122-independence and several mutations for higher infectivity. The emergence of an HCV mutant that can propagate in an miR-122-independent manner may participate in the induction of extrahepatic manifestations in chronic hepatitis C patients.</p>

<title>Establishment of miR-122-knockout Huh7 cells</title>
<p>To clarify the biological significance of miR-122 in the life cycle of HCV in more detail, we established miR-122-knockout Huh7 (Huh7-122KO) cells by using artificial endonucleases (transcription activator-like effector nucleases: TALEN). Two clones (clone #1 and #2) of Huh7-122KO cells were obtained and mutations in the miR-122-coding region were assessed by Surveyor nuclease assay and sequencing analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). Lack of expression of miR-122 in Huh7-122KO cells was confirmed by Northern blotting and qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). In addition, we established Huh7-122KO cells in which the expression of miR-122 was recovered by infecting Huh7-122KO#1 and Huh7-122KO#2 cells with a lentiviral vector expressing miR-122 and obtained Huh7-122KOR#1 and Huh7-122KOR#2 cells, respectively. Next, to confirm that the loss of miR-122 activity suppressed translation of the target gene in Huh7-122KO cells, a pmirGLO vector carrying the complementary sequence of miR-122 under the luciferase gene was transfected into Huh7-122KO cells. Suppression of luciferase activity was observed not only in parental Huh7 cells, but also in Huh7-122KOR#1 and Huh7-122KOR#2 cells, while no suppression was observed in Huh7-122KO#1 and Huh7-122KO#2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). Furthermore, we confirmed that cell growth and viability of Huh7-122KO cells were comparable to those of restored cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). These results suggest that Huh7-122KO cells are functionally deficient in miR-122 activity and exogenous expression of miR-122 restored their biological function.</p>

<title>miR-122 is required for replication complex formation in the early phase of infection but not for maintenance of replication</title>
<p>First, we compared the expression levels of host mRNAs between Huh7-122KO and Huh7-122KOR cells by cDNA microarray. From the results of pathway prediction in Huh7-122 KO cells by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), the expression levels of genes involved in lipid metabolism were changed in Huh7-122KO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s022">S1 Table</xref>), as in previous reports on miR-122-knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref012">12</xref>]. Previous reports have shown that lipid metabolism participates in the entry or assembly of HCV. Therefore, to examine the effect of miR-122-knockout-induced changes in the lipid composition on the entry of HCV, pseudotyped VSV bearing HCV envelope proteins, HCVpv, was inoculated into the cell lines. No difference in luciferase activity was observed irrespective of miR-122 expression upon infection with HCVpv (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), suggesting that the knockout of miR-122 has no significant effect on the entry of HCV. Next, to investigate the function of miR-122 on the replication of viral RNA, we examined the effects of stable and transient expression of miR-122 in the miR-122-knockout cells on colony formation. HCV subgenomic replicon (SGR) RNA of the JFH1 strain was electroporated into Huh7-122KO and Huh7-122KOR cells. The numbers of colonies were significantly higher in Huh7-122KOR cells than in Huh7-122KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, left panels), while the expression of NS5A and formation of membranous webs were similarly observed in both Huh7-122KO-SGR and Huh7-122KOR-SGR cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s004">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>), respectively. In addition, the inhibitory effect by treatment with IFNÎ± and BILN was comparable with Huh7-122KO-SGR cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Although higher levels of miR-122 expression in Huh7-122KO cells transduced with the mature form of miR-122 (miR-122-mimic) were detected at 72 h post-electroporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), no miR-122 was detected at the time of colony harvest (at 21 days post-electroporation) due to the instability of miR-122-mimic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, lower panel). However, enhancement of colony formation was observed upon electroporation of SGR RNA together with miR-122-mimic but not of control-mimic in Huh7-122KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, right panels), suggesting that not continuous but transient expression of miR-122 is sufficient for the enhancement of colony formation. Next, we confirmed that HCV SGR RNA in miR-122 KO cells could replicate independently from miR-122. High levels of HCV-RNA replication were detected in Huh7-122KO-SGR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, upper panel), which were resistant to the treatment with miR-122 inhibitor, in contrast to Huh7-122KOR-SGR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). In addition, more abundant HCV-RNA was detected in the Ago2 complex immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody in Huh7-122KOR-SGR cells than in Huh7-122KO-SGR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). These results suggest that miR-122 is required in the early phase for the efficient translation of viral RNA crucial for formation of the replication complex, and transient expression of miR-122 is able to rescue viral replication in Huh7-122KO cells. However, once the replication complex is formed, the HCV genome can replicate in an miR-122-independent manner.</p>

<title>miR-122-independent propagation of HCV</title>
<p>Next, we examined the effect of the knockout of miR-122 in Huh7 cells on the propagation of HCV. Although Huh7-122KOR cells exhibited efficient HCV replication, a slight increase of intracellular HCV-RNA levels and detectable infectious titers in the culture supernatants was observed in Huh7-122KO cells upon infection with HCV at an MOI of 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). To rule out the possibility of incorporation of miR-122 into viral particles, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed full-genomic HCV-RNA was electroporated into Huh7-122KO cells together with either control- or miR-122-mimic, and infectious titers in the culture supernatants were determined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). A slight but significant increase of infectious titer was detected in the culture supernatants of Huh7-122KO cells co-electroporated with viral RNA and control-mimic. To further confirm the miR-122 independent propagation of HCV, we examined the effect of inhibitors for HCV, including IFNÎ±, DAA and anti-CD81 antibody, on the propagation of HCV in Huh7-122KO cells. The level of HCV-RNA in Huh7-122KO cells upon infection with HCV was decreased by the treatment with the reagents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). However, as we expected, the treatment with LNA-miR-122 exhibited no effect on the replication of HCV in Huh7-122KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Previous reports showed that a specific membrane alteration that is involved in viral replication, i.e., the formation of a membranous web, was observed in HCV-replicating cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref030">30</xref>]. Correlative fluorescence microscopy-electron microscopy (FM-EM) also revealed the localization of NS5A on convoluted structures such as the membranous web in Huh7-122KO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Moreover, HCV core proteins and lipid droplets were co-localized in Huh7-122KO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s008">S8 Fig</xref>), suggesting that HCV can propagate in an miR-122-independent manner.</p>

<p>Next, to examine the role of miR-122 on the spread of HCV infection, we compared the focus formation in Huh7-122KO and Huh7-122KOR cells at 72 h post-infection. The size and number of foci formed in Huh7-122KO cells were smaller and fewer than those in Huh7-122KOR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Focus-formation efficiency was 1000-fold lower in Huh7-122KO cells than in Huh7-122KOR cells upon infection with HCV at an MOI of 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In addition, the average numbers of infected cells constituting one focus in Huh7-122KO cells (approximately 3 cells/focus) were significantly smaller than those in Huh7-122KOR cells (approximately 10 cells/focus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). To investigate the propagation of HCV in Huh7-122KO cells in more detail, the expression of dsRNA and NS5A protein in cells upon infection with HCV was assessed by immunofluorescence analysis. Co-localization of dsRNA and NS5A in Huh7-122KOR cells was observed at 24 h post-infection, but was detected at 48 h post-infection in Huh7-122KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that miR-122 is required for the efficient formation of the replication complex as shown by replicon assay. Because expression of lipoprotein-associated ApoB, ApoE or MTTP was decreased in Huh7-122KO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s009">S9 Fig</xref>), we examined the involvement of miR-122 in HCV particle formation. However, no significant difference was observed in particle formation relative to intracellular copy number at 72 h post-infection between Huh7-122KO and Huh7-122KOR cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s010">S10 Fig</xref>), suggesting that miR-122 does not participate in infectious particle formation. Collectively, these results suggest that the low levels of focus formation of HCV in Huh7-122KO cells are attributable to inefficient translation and replication of the HCV genome, but not to the particle formation process.</p>

<title>miR-122-knockout Huh7.5.1 cells exhibit a high susceptibility to HCV infection</title>
<p>Generally, it has been reported that cured cells established by the elimination of viral RNA from HCV replicon cells exhibited more potent propagation of HCV than parental cells. Previous reports have shown that the high susceptibility of cured cells to HCV infection is due to the high level of miR-122 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref031">31</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref033">33</xref>]. On the other hand, Huh7.5.1 cells, which are also derived from HCV replicon cells, carry mutations in RIG-I, a key innate immune sensor for viral RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref034">34</xref>] and express a low level of CREB3L1/OASIS, which specifically inhibits the proliferation of cells infected with HCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>To determine the difference in propagation of HCV in the absence of miR-122 between Huh7 and Huh7.5.1 cells, we established 3 clones of miR-122-knockout Huh7.5.1 (751-122KO) cells (#1- #3) and the miR-122 deficiency in each clone was confirmed by sequencing analysis and qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s011">S11A and S11B Fig</xref>). The results showed that RNA replication and infectious particle formation in the supernatants of 751-122KO cells were higher than those in Huh7-122KO cells or cured cells upon infection with HCV at an MOI of 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

However, the infectivity of cured cells was comparable to that of parental Huh7-122KO cells, suggesting that the high susceptibility of Huh7.5.1 cells to HCV infection depends not only on a high level expression of miR-122 but also on other factors.</p>

<title>An adapted mutant, HCV<sub>122KO</sub>, can propagate in an miR-122-independent manner</title>
<p>Because 751-122KO cells exhibit higher susceptibility to HCV propagation than Huh7-122KO cells, we tried to generate an adapted mutant that could propagate in an miR-122-independent manner in 751-122KO cells.

<p>To verify the ability of HCV<sub>122KO</sub> to propagate efficiently in an miR-122 independent manner, several miR-122-deficient cells, including non-hepatic cells, were infected with HCV<sub>122KO</sub>. miR-122-independent intracellular RNA replication and infectious particle formation of HCV<sub>122KO</sub> was observed in Hep3B cells deficient in miR-122 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref029">29</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

Although co-expression of miR-122 and ApoE is required for the production of infectious particles in 293T-CLDN1 cells upon infection with HCV, expression of ApoE alone permits particle formation in cells infected with HCV<sub>122KO</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>). In addition, the replications of HCV and HCV<sub>122KO</sub> in non-hepatic Hec1B and 293T-CLDN1 cells were also inhibited by the NS3-4A inhibitor BILN as observed in Huh7-122KO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s015">S15 Fig</xref>), suggesting that HCV<sub>122KO</sub> can propagate in non-hepatic cells in the absence of miR-122.</p>

<title>Identification of mutations in the 5âUTR of HCV<sub>122KO</sub></title>
<p>To clarify the molecular mechanisms of the miR-122-independent propagation of HCV<sub>122KO</sub>, we first confirmed the introduction of adaptive mutations into the viral genome of three independently isolated HCV<sub>122KO</sub> by direct sequencing analyses. The mutation of G28A in the 5âUTR of HCV was identified in all independently isolated HCV propagated in 751-122KO cell clones (751-122KO-#1~#3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). To analyze this result in more detail, deep sequencing analysis of a mixture of six independently isolated HCV<sub>122KO</sub> was performed. Deep sequencing by Pac-bio enables long-reads (~3 kbp) and detects single nucleotide variants (SNVs) including accidental sequencing errors. Compared with HCV at five serial passages in Huh7.5.1 cells (JFH-P5), only the dominant mutation G28A was observed from a mixture of six independently isolated HCV<sub>122KO</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g006">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s016">S16AâS16C Fig</xref>). We also identified a few synonymous substitutions at nucleotide position (nt) 4579 in NS3, nt7658 in NS5A and nt7888 or nt7951 in NS5B at a low rate; however, they were from different fragments of cDNA of HCV-RNA. These results indicated that, except in the case of G28A, these mutations arise irregularly, and are not specific to an miR-122-deficient condition. In addition, G28A mutation also emerged by the transfection of a plasmid encoding a full-genomic HCV cDNA, pHH-JFH1-E2p7NS2mt, into 751-122KO cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s017">S17A and S17B Fig</xref>), while there was no adaptive mutation in HCV SGR RNA from replicon cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s017">S17C Fig</xref>). Therefore, we examined the difference between the G28A virus and HCV<sub>122KO</sub> infectivity in Huh7-122KO and Huh7-122KOR cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s018">S18 Fig</xref>). Compared to the wild type HCV, both the G28A and HCV<sub>122KO</sub> virus showed miR-122-independence, while HCV<sub>122KO</sub> had higher infectivity than the G28A virus both in Huh7-122KO and Huh7-122KOR cells. Therefore, we concluded that not only the G28A mutation responsible for miR-122-independence but also other adaptive mutations involved in higher replicative fitness are required for efficient propagation in an miR-122-independent manner.</p>

<title>An adapted virus from gt1b/2a chimeric HCV also propagates in miR-122-deficient cells in an miR-122-independent manner</title>
<p>Because genotype 1b originally has adenine at nt29, which corresponds to the position of G28A in genotype 2, we tried to identify adaptive mutations that could facilitate efficient propagation in an miR-122-independent manner by using the chimeric virus of genotype 1b Con1 and 2a JFH1 strain (Con1C3/JFH) at the C3 loop in NS2, which includes the 5âUTR of Con1. Because serial passages of Con1C3/JFH only in 751-122KO cells failed due to the low efficiency of viral replication, both Huh7.5.1 and 751-122KO cells were used to obtain the adaptive virus. Infectious titers in the supernatants of 751-122KO cells were gradually increased during alternative passages and reached 10<sup>5</sup> FFU/ml, and the resulting virus was designated Con1C3/JFH<sub>122KO</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). In addition to HCV<sub>122KO</sub>, Con1C3/JFH<sub>122KO</sub> showed efficient propagation both in Huh7.5.1 and 751-122KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), while the HCV-RNA replication level of Con1C3/JFH<sub>122KO</sub> was significantly higher than that of Con1C3/JFH both in Huh7.5.1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g007">Fig 7C</xref>) and in non-hepatic 293T-CLDN1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Therefore, we compared Con1C3/JFH and Con1C3/JFH<sub>122KO</sub> by sequence analysis. Fifteen adaptive mutations were introduced throughout Con1C3/JFH RNA during serial passages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s019">S19A Fig</xref>). Especially, G1A in 5âUTR has known to emerge during passages of gt1b replicon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref038">38</xref>] or in gt1b patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref039">39</xref>]. Compared with Con1C3/JFH, Con1C3/JFH<sub>122KO</sub> has additional 3 non-synonymous mutations located at the structural protein-coding region, 3 synonymous mutations at the non-structural protein-coding region and a single nucleotide mutation C30U in 5âUTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006374.s019">S19B and S19C Fig</xref>). These results suggest that Con1C3/JFH<sub>122KO</sub> also requires adaptive mutation that was directly involved in the role of miR-122 as with G28A mutation in 5â-UTR of JFH1 RNA to acquire miR-122-independence.</p>

<p>Next, to clarify the effect of mutation of G28A in the 5âUTR of HCV<sub>122KO</sub> on the replication of HCV-RNA, wild type or G28A-mutated JFH-SGR RNA was electroporated into Huh7-122KO and Huh7-122KOR cells. Although colony formation in Huh7-122KO cells transduced with G28A-mutated JFH-SGR RNA was higher than that in the cells transduced with the wild type RNA, there was no significant difference in colony formation between the Huh7-122KOR cells transduced with G28A and those transduced with wild type RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).

Although infectious titers in the supernatants of Huh7.5.1 cells did not change appreciably with the number of passages, those of 751-122KO were increased by cell passaging. The G28A mutant exhibited higher replicative fitness for survival in 751-122KO cells, while replication of the G28A mutant was comparable to that of the wild type in Huh7.5.1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g008">Fig 8D</xref>).

<title>Interaction of the G28A mutant with Ago2 is dispensable for HCV RNA replication in miR-122 KO cells</title>
<p>Because the HCV<sub>122KO</sub> genome still contains two miR-122-binding sites in the 5âUTR, we further examined the effect of the miR-122 inhibitor on the propagation of HCV<sub>122KO</sub> in Huh7-122KO and Huh7-122KOR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006374.g010">Fig 10A</xref>). Although intracellular viral RNA replication and infectious particle formation in the culture supernatants of Huh7-122KOR cells treated with the LNA control upon infection with HCV and HCV<sub>122KO</sub> are comparable, those treated with LNA-miR-122 exhibited more potent suppression upon infection with HCV than HCV<sub>122KO</sub>. Interestingly, propagation of HCV<sub>122KO</sub> in Huh7-122KOR cells was still significantly suppressed by the treatment with LNA-miR-122, suggesting that HCV<sub>122KO</sub> utilizes miR-122 for its propagation, even in the presence of an abundance of miR-122. Next, to examine the effect of G28A mutation on the interaction with other miRNAs, Ago2 complexes in HCV infected Huh7.5.1 and 751-122KO cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ago2 antibody and the levels of Ago2 and HCV-RNA were determined by immunoblotting and qRT-PCR, respectively at 12 dpi.

<title>Interaction of miR-122 with G28A mutation changes the balance between translation and replication</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>HCV exists as a quasispecies due to the low fidelity of its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and escape mutants often appear during treatment with anti-HCV drugs. On the other hand, miR-122 interaction sites in the 5âUTR of HCV-RNA are highly conserved. A previous report has shown that the administration of an miR-122 inhibitor to chimpanzees chronically infected with HCV achieved a long-term suppression of viral load without the emergence of a resistant virus or any adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref043">43</xref>]. In addition, a recent phase II clinical trial of an miR-122 inhibitor revealed that it suppressed HCV propagation in chronic hepatitis C patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref026">26</xref>]. However, several studies have reported that adaptive mutations can be introduced around miR-122 interaction sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref044">44</xref>] and substitution of G28A in the 5âUTR of HCV has been selected by serial passages in miR-122-knockdown cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref027">27</xref>] and knockout cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref045">45</xref>]. In this study, we could also obtain an adaptive mutant with G28A mutation in the 5âUTR by adaptation to miR-122 knockout cells, HCV<sub>122KO</sub>, which was capable of propagating efficiently in miR-122-deficient cells, and analyzed its biological significance.</p>
<p>Most of the HCV genotypes, including genotype 1, originally have adenine at the position corresponding to G28A of genotype 2a. Although Israelow <italic>et al</italic>. showed that A28 genotypes have lower sensitivity to an miR-122 inhibitor than G28 genotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref027">27</xref>], the emergence of adaptive mutation involved in the resistance to miR-122 inhibitor has been reported by the study about gt1b HCV. The C3U mutation adjacent to the miR-122 binding site I in the 5âUTR of the genotype 1b genome introduced during treatment with an miR-122 inhibitor in clinical practice has been shown to be resistant to the miR-122 inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref039">39</xref>]. Interestingly, in the current study, adaptive mutation C30U was introduced in the 5âUTR of Con1C3/JFH<sub>122KO</sub>, which has 5âUTR of genotype 1b. Although there is a difference of genome structure between the full-length viral genome and chimeric virus Con1C3/JFH used in our study, adaptive mutations were introduced in miR-122-binding sites. Together with the requirement of several substitutions throughout the genomic RNA of Con1C3/JFH<sub>122KO</sub> to increase infectivity, these findings suggest that the adaptive mutations required not only for higher replication fitness but also for miR-122-independence such as G28A substitution of gt2a and C3U or C30U of gt1b should be introduced into the HCV genome to allow the virus to replicate efficiently under an miR-122-deficient condition. To examine the role of adaptive mutation C3U or C30U for miR-122-independence in gt1b HCV, further investigation is needed.</p>
<p>Based on our previous and current experiments, chronic HCV infection might induce viral replication not only in the liver but also in other non-hepatic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref046">46</xref>] such as PBMCs and neuronal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref004">4</xref>]. The current study shows that during persistent infection in non-hepatic PBMCs of HCV gt2a patients, G28A mutation can be introduced into HCV-RNA, in some cases resulting in EHMs such as hypothyroidism and malignant lymphoma. G28A mutation can spontaneously emerge in non-hepatic cells such as PBMCs upon establishment of persistent infection. Once G28A mutation is introduced into viral genome, mutant viruses can replicate efficiently through an enhancement of replication complex formation without interaction of Ago2/miR-122 with HCV-RNA in non-hepatic cells. Most recently, several studies about HCV and lymphoma were reported. Lymphotropic HCV strain (HCV-SB) was isolated from HCV gt2b-positive B cell lymphoma with adaptive mutations in 5âUTR and E1/E2 region and B7.2 (CD86) was identified as a lymphotropic HCV receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref047">47</xref>]. Moreover, after HCV treatment with DAA (sofosbuvir) and ribavirin to HCV gt3a patient, remission of lymphoma was induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref048">48</xref>]. These observations suggest that low levels of HCV-RNA replication in the non-hepatic tissues or liver with treatment of miR-122 inhibitors may persist in an miR-122-independent manner, resulting in the emergence of HCV mutants that might induce EHMs. Therefore, it is important to control the emergence of miR-122 inhibitors-resistant mutants, which confers a replicative advantage to HCV propagation in miR-122 deficient cells.</p>
<p>It has been shown that P-body components consisting of Xrn1, Lsm1 and PatL1, which are involved in mRNA decay, participate in translation of the HCV genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref049">49</xref>]. Although previous siRNA-mediated knockdown studies showed that miR-122 contributes to stabilization of the HCV genome by protecting it from exonuclease Xrn1 or Xrn2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref024">24</xref>], HCV-RNA replication was not affected by Xrn1 knockdown in Huh7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref023">23</xref>], and the ability of miR-122 to promote HCV infectivity was shown to be independent of the protection of viral RNA from Xrn1 by a reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic> system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref050">50</xref>]. In this study, we observed no significant effect of Xrn1 and Xrn2 on the emergence of G28A mutation, suggesting that HCV-RNA decay by exonuclease was not involved in G28A-mediated miR-122-independence.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Lsm1 was suggested to be involved in the miR-122-dependent enhancement of translation of HCV-RNA in Huh7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref051">51</xref>]. Bromo mosaic virus, a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus, requires the Lsm complex for switching from primary translation to viral RNA replication via viral protein-mediated trafficking of viral RNA to the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref052">52</xref>]. Similarly, a recent study showed the importance to the HCV life cycle of a switching system in which miR-122 stimulates RNA synthesis by altering the balance of replication and translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref017">17</xref>]. PCBP2, which binds to the stem-loop I in the 5âUTR of HCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref053">53</xref>], is predicted to be required for the circularization of viral RNA through direct binding to the 5â and 3â ends of viral RNA, but this interaction was inhibited by miR-122 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref054">54</xref>] followed by a switch from translation to viral RNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref017">17</xref>]. These reports suggest that the inefficient replication of HCV in miR-122-deficient cells may be attributable to degradation of viral RNA and a delay in the switching from translation to replication. We have shown that HCV replicon RNA possessing G28A mutation exhibits efficient colony formation in the absence of miR-122. In addition, a competition assay revealed that HCV<sub>122KO</sub> carrying a mutation of G28A in the 5âUTR exhibits a growth advantage compared to wild type HCV in the absence but not in the presence of miR-122, suggesting that G28A mutation in the 5âUTR of HCV confers at least limited ability to propagate under an miR-122-deficient condition. Polysome analysis clearly showed the excessive replication status in the G28A mutant in miR-122-deficient cells, resulting in efficient propagation. Although a system for equilibrating PCBP2 and the miR-122-Ago2 complex exists, the role of miR-122 on the G28A mutant is to moderate excessive replication but enhance translation, which is the opposite of its role on the wild type virus. These observations indicate that miR-122 may fine-tune the balance between translation and replication not only in the wild type but also the G28A mutant and thereby lead to efficient propagation.</p>
<p>In summary, we have shown that HCV can replicate in an miR-122-independent manner. This finding indicates that treatment of hepatitis C patients with an inhibitor for miR-122 would be effective to eliminate HCV in the liver but not in non-hepatic tissues, and may induce the emergence of adaptive mutants capable of propagating in miR-122-deficient cells, leading to the induction of EHMs.</p>

<title>Deep sequencing analysis</title>
<p>RNA was extracted from 100 Î¼l of virus-containing culture supernatants after 5 passages in Huh7.5.1 cells (JFH-P5) or a mixture of those after 5 and 4 passages in 751-122KO#1 and 751-122KO#2 cells, respectively (6 x 122KO). The first-stranded cDNA was synthesized by using a PrimeScript 1st strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara Bio) and three fragments of the HCV genome region were amplified. PacBio DNA libraries were prepared from three pooled fragments (each 100 ng) of the respective HCV genomes using a DNA Template Prep Kit 2.0 (3â10 kbp) (Pacific Biosciences) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Sequencing was performed by the PacBio RS II system with a 240 min movie using the DNA Sequencing Kit 4.0 (Pacific Biosciences) with P6 polymerase. Circular consensus sequences (CCS) constructed from more than four full-pass subreads were produced through PacBio SMRT analysis.</p>

<p>Polysome analysis was performed as described by Masaki et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006374.ref017">17</xref>] with some modifications. In brief, three 10-cm dishes containing 5x10<sup>5</sup> of Huh7-122KO or Huh7-122KOR cells were infected with HCV or HCV<sub>122KO</sub>. At 3 dpi, the cells were incubated with CHX (100 Î¼g/ml) for 10 min. After washing with PBS with CHX (100 Î¼g/ml), the cells were harvested from three dishes (total number of cells: ~2x10<sup>7</sup> cells/dish) by using a cell scraper and centrifuged for 5 min at 1,400 rpm at 4Â°C. Cell pellets were suspended in 500 Î¼l of polysome lysis buffer (PLB; 140 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.01% Triton X-100, 10 mM DTT, 100 Î¼g/ml CHX) with RNase inhibitor (100 U/ml) and passaged 5 times with a 27-gauge needle on ice. Cell pellets were removed by two 5-min rounds of centrifugation at 13,000 rpm and 4Â°C. The supernatant was layered on the top of a linear 10%-50% sucrose gradient in PLB and centrifuged in an SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA) for 2 h at 32,000 rpm at 4Â°C (no brake). The absorbances at OD254 of the 76 fractions collected from the top by using a Piston Gradient Fractionator (BioComp, NB, Canada) were determined and divided into 19 fractions for quantification of HCV-RNA and Î²-actin mRNA by qRT-PCR as described above.</p>

<p>(A) A PCR product (450 bp) including a TALEN-targeted miR-122 seed region was digested with Cel-I, resulting in 300 and 150 bp fragments (red arrowheads). We obtained 2 clones of miR-122-knockout Huh7 cell clones #1 and #2. (B) The target sequence of TALEN for knockout of miR-122 and the genome sequence of the miR-122 allele in Huh7-122KO cells. Mutations in the miR-122 allele with an 11 nt or a 21 nt deletion in the Huh7-122KO#1 clones or a 2 nt or an 8 nt deletion in the Huh7-122KO#2 clones were identified. (C) Detection of miR-122 expression by Northern blot (top panel) and qRT-PCR (bottom). Total RNA was extracted from each cell and the relative expression of miR-122 was determined by qRT-PCR by using U6 snRNA as an internal control. (D) miR-122 activity in miR-122-knockout Huh7 cells. pmirGLO vectors carrying the complementary sequence of miR-122 under the luciferase gene were transfected into Huh7-122KO and Huh7-122KOR cells. At 48 h post-transfection, the luciferase activity was determined. The data are representative of three independent experiments. Error bars indicate the standard deviation of the mean and asterisks indicate significant differences (**P &lt; 0.01) versus the results for the control.</p>
