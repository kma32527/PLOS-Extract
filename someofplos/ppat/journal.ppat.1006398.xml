<abstract>
<p>FAS-associated factor-1 (FAF1) is a component of the death-inducing signaling complex involved in Fas-mediated apoptosis. It regulates NF-ÎºB activity, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation. Here, we found that FAF1 positively regulates the type I interferon pathway. FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice, which deficient in FAF1, and FAF1 knockdown immune cells were highly susceptible to RNA virus infection and showed low levels of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferon (IFN) production. FAF1 was bound competitively to NLRX1 and positively regulated type I IFN signaling by interfering with the interaction between NLRX1 and MAVS, thereby freeing MAVS to bind RIG-I, which switched on the MAVS-RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling cascade. These results highlight a critical role of FAF1 in antiviral responses against RNA virus infection.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Type I interferon-mediated antiviral response is critical for controlling virus infections. However, interferon-mediated immune responses need to be tightly regulated to maintain host immune homeostasis. Recently, molecules involved in regulating interferon-mediated innate immune response are the subject of much research. Among these, the first protein to be identified as a negative regulator of MAVS was the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing family member, NLRX1. NLRX1 associates with MAVS to inhibit antiviral signaling by interrupting virus-induced RLR-MAVS interactions. Interestingly, we found that FAF1 interacts with NLRX1 in response to RNA virus infection and this interaction inhibits binding of MAVS to NLRX1, which in turn switches on RIG-I mediated antiviral immune responses. As results, we showed that FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice, which deficient in FAF1, and FAF1 knockdown immune cells were highly susceptible to RNA virus infection and showed low levels of inflammatory cytokines and type I interferon (IFN) production. Our findings suggest that FAF1 is a crucial regulator that induces the antiviral innate immune responses against RNA virus infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>FAS-associated factor 1 (FAF1) was originally identified as a member of the FAS death-inducing signaling complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref001">1</xref>]. FAF1 harbors several protein interaction domains, including FAS-interacting domains (FID), a death effector domain-interacting domain (DEDID), and multi-ubiquitin-related domains, which interact with ubiquitinated target proteins and regulate their proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref002">2</xref>]. Although FAF1 initially demonstrated to have Fas induced apoptotic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref003">3</xref>], it also has diverse biological functions such as regulation of NF-ÎºB signaling, chaperone activity and proteosomal degradation by ubiquitination. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref004">4</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Early recognition of invading viruses by host cells is critical to antiviral innate immunity. Invading viruses trigger type I interferon-mediated antiviral responses and induce production of effector proteins that inhibit completion of the virus cycle and virus dissemination in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref008">8</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref012">12</xref>]. Germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) within the innate immune system sense signature molecules expressed by pathogens, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). To date, PRRs are classified into three families: retinoic acid inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs), Toll-like receptors (TLR), and the nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) and leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing (NLRP) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref013">13</xref>]. RLRs such as RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA-5) are important molecules that detect viral RNA in the cytosol. In uninfected cells, RIG-I exists in an auto-repressed conformation in which the caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) are not available for binding to induce downstream signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref014">14</xref>]. Upon recognition of viruses, particularly RNA viruses, RIG-I is activated and undergoes self-dimerization and structural modifications that permit CARD-CARD interactions with the downstream adapter molecule, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS; also known as IPS-1, VISA, and Cardif) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref015">15</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref020">20</xref>]. Then it activates type I interferon responses via downstream signaling molecules TBK1/IKKi and IRF3, and NF-ÎºB activation via IKK, to elicit inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref021">21</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>However, interferon- or NF-ÎºB-mediated immune responses need to be tightly regulated to maintain host immune homeostasis, otherwise the uncontrolled immune response can be deleterious, or even fatal, to the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref027">27</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref032">32</xref>]. Hence, molecules involved in regulating interferon-mediated innate immune response are the subject of much research. Indeed, mechanisms that regulate RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling, which is tightly controlled by a series of positive and negative regulators, have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref034">34</xref>]. Among these, NLRX1, a member of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich-repeat-containing (NLR) protein family, resides on the outer mitochondrial membrane and interfere CARD-CARD interactions between MAVS and RIG-I to negatively regulate antiviral interferon signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref035">35</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref038">38</xref>]. However, during virus infection, the mechanism which controls type I interferon (IFN) signaling via modulating the MAVS and NLRX1 interaction, needs to be investigated more in detail. Here, we show that FAF1 is a positive regulator of the NF-ÎºB and type I interferon signaling pathways during RNA virus infection. FAF1 competitively binds to NLRX1, thereby disrupting its interaction with MAVS and ultimately amplifying the downstream antiviral immune response.</p>

<title>FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice show increased susceptibility to virus infection</title>
<p>To examine the biological function of FAF1, we performed experiments using FAF1<sup>+/+</sup> and FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice after confirmed by genotyping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, panels A-B-C). First, mice were infected with the of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) Indiana strain (VSV-Indiana) via tail-vein injection and their survival was monitored to determine susceptibility to viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006398.g001">Fig 1</xref>, panel A). Knockdown of FAF1 rendered mice significantly more susceptible to lethal VSV infection. A plaque assay and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to measure the amount of VSV in spleen, lung, liver, and brain tissues at 24 hr and 6 days post-infection (hpi and dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006398.g001">Fig 1</xref>, panels B-C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, panel D). Organs from FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice contained higher amount of virus than those from FAF1<sup>+/+</sup> mice. This suggests that the virus replicates more actively in FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice than in FAF1<sup>+/+</sup> mice, resulting increased mortality. Additionally, serum samples were collected at different time points after mice were infected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged VSV (VSV-GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006398.g001">Fig 1</xref>, panels D-E) or treated with Poly (I:C) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, panel E). The serum of FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice contained more replicating virus and lower levels of IFN-Î² and IL-6 than that of FAF1<sup>+/+</sup> mice, indicating that knockdown of FAF1 suppresses cytokine secretion upon virus infection. Moreover, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from both groups of mice injected with VSV-GFP via tail-vein were collected and measured to check mRNA encoding IFN-related genes expression at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006398.g001">Fig 1</xref>, panel F). PBMCs from FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice expressed lower levels of mRNA encoding IFN-related genes than those from FAF1<sup>+/+</sup> mice. These results provide in vivo evidence that FAF1 knockdown affects type I IFN mediated signaling and antiviral immunity.</p>

<title>FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice are susceptible to virus infection and show suppressed immune responses.</title>
<p>(A) Wild-type mice (FAF1<sup>+/+</sup>) (n = 10) and FAF1 knockdown mice (FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup>) (n = 10) were infected with VSV-Indiana (2 Ã— 10<sup>8</sup> pfu/mouse) via tail-vein injection and survival was monitored for 12 days. (B) Organs (spleen and brain) from FAF1<sup>+/+</sup> (n = 10) and FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> (n = 10) mice were collected at 6 dpi with VSV-Indiana (2 Ã— 10<sup>8</sup> pfu/mouse) via tail-vein injection.

<p>BMDMs were isolated from the bone marrow of FAF1<sup>+/+</sup> and FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice and infected with VSV-GFP or GFP tagged H1N1 influenza virus (A/PR8/8/34; PR8-GFP).

BMDMs of FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice produced less IL-6 and IFN-Î² than BMDMs of FAF1<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Next, BMDCs and PBMCs were isolated from FAF1<sup>+/+</sup> and FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice, and stimulated with VSV-GFP, PR8-GFP or Poly (I:C).

<title>Knockdown and overexpression of FAF1 in RAW264.7 cells affects type I IFN secretion and viral replication</title>
<p>To exclude the possibility that positive regulation of type I IFN signaling by FAF1 is a cell type-specific phenomenon, knockdown FAF1 murine macrophage cell line was prepared by infecting a lentivirus harboring FAF1 shRNA (small hairpin RNAs) or transfecting FAF1 siRNA (small interfering RNA) to RAW264.7. First, reduced FAF1 expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s004">S4 Fig</xref>, panel A). Viral titers and cytokine levels were evaluated after VSV-GFP or PR8-GFP infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006398.g004">Fig 4</xref>, panels A-B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s004">S4 Fig</xref>, panels B-C) and treatment with Poly (I:C) or 5â€™ppp-dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006398.g004">Fig 4</xref>, panel C). Consistent with our previous results, viral titers were higher and cytokine levels were lower in both shRNA and siRNA FAF1 knockdown RAW264.7 cells than in control (scramble) cells. Additionally, THP-1 cells (a human immune cell line) were transfected with siRNA targeting FAF1, and virus replication and cytokine levels were measured after virus infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s004">S4 Fig</xref>, panels D-E-F-G). The results were similar to those for FAF1 knockdown RAW264.7 cells. To confirm these results, we generated stable FAF1 overexpressing RAW264.7 cells and overexpression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s005">S5 Fig</xref>, panel A). FAF1-overexpressing RAW264.7 cells infected with PR8-GFP, VSV-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006398.g004">Fig 4</xref>, panels D-E) or NDV-GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s005">S5 Fig</xref>, panels B-C) showed lower levels of viral replication and higher levels of IL-6, IFN-Î², and IFN-Î± production than control RAW264.7 cells. Treatment with Poly (I:C) or 5â€™ppp-dsRNA yielded consistent results with the virus infection experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s005">S5 Fig</xref>, panel D). Additionally, to find out whether FAF1 has no effect to DNA virus infection in RAW264.7 cells, similar to HSV infection in BMDMs, GFP tagged adenovirus (Adeno-GFP) were infected to control and FAF1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, panel A) or overexpressing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, panel B) RAW264.7 cells. Accordance with the results of HSV-GFP in BMDMs, Adeno-GFP experiment also showed no difference in virus replication and cytokine secretion levels between control and FAF1 knockdown or overexpressing cells. Taken together, these results suggest that, irrespective of the cell type, FAF1 positively regulates type I IFN secretion upon RNA virus infection, and not upon DNA virus infection.</p>

<p>Moreover, to confirm whether enhanced VSV-GFP replication in FAF1 knockdown RAW264.7 cells and MEFs was due to repressed IFN secretion by knockdown of FAF1 and not due to intrinsic block to replication of RNA viruses, we infected VSV-GFP to FAF1 knockdown RAW264.7 cells and MEFs in the presence of an anti-IFNAR blocking antibody (IFNAR Ab) and determined VSV-GFP replication level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s007">S7 Fig</xref>, panels A-B). As shown in the results, IFNAR Ab treated control cells showed almost two to three times higher virus replication level compared with non-treated control cells due to the IFNAR blocking effect of IFNAR Ab. On the contrary, in FAF1 knockdown cells, virus replication levels slightly enhanced after treatment of IFNAR Ab, which indicated that IFNAR Ab could not exhibit IFNAR blocking effect prominently in FAF1 knockdown RAW264.7 cells, since type I IFN secretion was already suppressed by knockdown of FAF1. These results suggests that enhanced or reduced virus replication depends on knockdown or overexpression of FAF1 due to the regulation of type I IFN secretion by FAF1. Furthermore, from our results of Poly (I:C) and 5â€™ppp-dsRNA stimulation studies, we could anticipate that FAF1 regulates type I IFN signaling through RIG-I-MAVS signaling pathway, as those stimulants induce type I IFN signaling pathway by activating RIG-I. To investigate whether FAF1 regulates type I IFN secretion not through TLR7 and TLR9, we also stimulated the TLR7 and TLR9 by their agonists, imiquimod and ODN2395, respectively to FAF1 knockdown RAW264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s007">S7 Fig</xref>, panel C). According to data, the IL-6 and IFN-Î² secretion levels of control and FAF1 knockdown RAW264.7 cells were similar, which indicate that FAF1 regulates type I IFN signaling through RIG-I mediated pathway, and not via the TLR7 and TLR9 mediated pathway.</p>

<p>To further examine the effects of FAF1 on the antiviral signaling cascade, we next examined virus-induced phosphorylation of IRF3, p65, STAT1, p38, and TBK1. Cells were stimulated with PR8-GFP and samples were collected at indicated time points. Whole cell lysates (WCL) were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006398.g005">Fig 5</xref>, panels A-B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s008">S8 Fig</xref>, panel A). First, scramble and FAF1 knockdown RAW264.7 cells were infected with PR8-GFP, and phosphorylation levels of the indicated proteins were examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006398.g005">Fig 5</xref>, panel A). Protein phosphorylation in both scramble and FAF1 knockdown RAW264.7 cells was initiated at 8 hpi, and increased until 16 hpi, however, at later time points the levels of protein phosphorylation detected in FAF1 knockdown cells were lower than those in scramble RAW264.7 cells. By contrast, FAF1-overexpressing RAW264.7 cells showed higher levels of phosphorylation at early time points than control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006398.g005">Fig 5</xref>, panel B). These results provide strong evidence that FAF1 activates the type I IFN signaling pathway. In addition, we examined phosphorylation of target proteins in FAF1 knockdown and FAF1-reconstituted MEFs after PR8-GFP infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s008">S8 Fig</xref>, panel A). The results showed that higher phosphorylation of these signaling proteins occurred at early time points in FAF1-reconstituted MEFs than in FAF1 knockdown MEFs. mRNA encoding IFN-related gene expressions were measured to determine whether type I IFN-related gene transcriptions were affected by FAF1 protein knockdown and reconstitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006398.g005">Fig 5</xref>, panels C-D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s008">S8 Fig</xref>, B-C). Lower mRNA expression levels were observed in FAF1 knockdown MEFs than WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006398.g005">Fig 5</xref>, panel C), and significantly higher levels were noted in FAF1-reconstituted MEFs compared to FAF1 knockdown MEFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s008">S8 Fig</xref>, panel B). Furthermore, we examined the expression of mRNA encoding IFN-related genes in BMDMs and PBMCs isolated from FAF1<sup>+/+</sup> mice and FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice after infection with PR8-GFP or VSV-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006398.g005">Fig 5</xref>, panel D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s008">S8 Fig</xref>, panel C). Consistent with our previous findings, low levels of IFN-related gene transcription was observed in BMDMs and PBMCs of FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice. To examine FAF1 expression levels in response to viral infection, the levels of FAF1 mRNA were measured in BMDMs, RAW264.7, THP-1, HEK293T, HeLa and A549 cells after PR8-GFP infection. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s009">S9 Fig</xref>, panel A, FAF1 mRNA expression levels were increased after viral infection, however, this increase varied according to cell type.

<title>FAF1 inhibits binding between MAVS and NLRX1</title>
<p>To further elucidate the interaction between FAF1 and NLRX1, the NLRX1 domains responsible for the interaction with FAF1 were analyzed using GST-labeled NLRX1 domain constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006398.g007">Fig 7</xref>, panel A). This experiment revealed that amino acids (aa) 1â€“327 of NLRX1 are required for the interaction with FAF1. Moreover, we found that the FAF1 binding site within NLRX1 overlapped with the binding site for MAVS (aa 75â€“556) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006398.g007">Fig 7</xref>, panel B). For further confirmation, another two NLRX1 fragments were constructed (aa 556â€“975 and 75â€“975) to check whether FAF1 can bind with MAVS binding region of NLRX1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s010">S10 Fig</xref>, panel A). FAF1 bound to aa 75â€“975 of NLRX1, however, did not bind to aa 556â€“975 of NLRX1. This indicates that FAF1 binds with the aa 75â€“556 region of NLRX1 which binds with MAVS. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that FAF1 and MAVS compete for binding to NLRX1. To test this, a competition assay was performed by transfecting HEK293T cells with V5-tagged FAF1 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006398.g007">Fig 7</xref>, panel C). The results confirmed reduced binding between MAVS and NLRX1, meanwhile increased binding between FAF1 and NLRX1. Thus, FAF1 inhibits the interaction between NLRX1 and MAVS by binding to NLRX1 competitively. To investigate time-dependent changes in the interaction between FAF1 and NLRX1 after virus infection, RAW264.7 cells and BMDMs were infected with H1N1 or PR8-GFP and then harvested at different time intervals. Immunoprecipitation using an anti-NLRX1 antibody, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-FAF1 antibody, revealed that FAF1 bound to NLRX1 in RAW264.7 cells and BMDMs at early time points (4 and 2 hpi, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006398.g007">Fig 7</xref>, panel D). Additionally, the interaction between NLRX1 and FAF1 or NLRX1 and MAVS were examined in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006398.g007">Fig 7</xref>, panel E). The interaction between NLRX1 and MAVS in non-infected cells was markedly reduced after viral infection in a time-dependent manner, importantly, there was a corresponding increase in FAF1-NLRX1 binding. These results suggest that FAF1 interacts with NLRX1 and inhibits binding between MAVS and NLRX1. For further confirmation of this mechanism, we checked whether knockdown of NLRX1 abolishes the antiviral effect of FAF1 on type I IFN signaling. FAF1 and NLRX1 was knockdown in HEK293T cells using FAF1 and NLRX1 specific siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s011">S11 Fig</xref>, panel A), and then VSV-GFP was infected to the cells. First, we confirmed antiviral effect of FAF1 in HEK293T cells, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006398.s011">S11 Fig</xref>, panel B-C. In knockdown of NLRX1, increased cytokine secretion and reduced VSV-GFP replication were observed. Interestingly, knockdown and overexpression of FAF1 had no effect to virus replication and cytokine secretion levels in NLRX1 knockdown condition. These results correlated with our proposed mechanism that FAF1 regulates NLRX1 mediated type I IFN signaling upon virus infection by interacting with NLRX1. Indeed, FAF1 competes with MAVS for binding to NLRX1, leading to disassociation of NLRX1 from MAVS, MAVS is then free to interact with RIG-I and initiate type I IFN signaling.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>MAVS is the key adaptor protein for RLR-mediated signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref039">39</xref>]. The RLR signaling pathway is initiated by recognition of distinct species of viral RNA by RIG-I or MDA5, and activated RLRs bind MAVS via CARD-mediated interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref019">19</xref>]. MAVS then recruits downstream signaling molecules and, eventually, induces production of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref040">40</xref>]. Although activation of MAVS plays a role in inducing type I IFN to limit virus spread, it must be tightly modulated to prevent excessive cellular immune responses that may have a detrimental effect on the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref041">41</xref>]. After viral infection, MAVS is regulated negatively or positively by different mechanisms, including mitochondrial dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref043">43</xref>], post-translational modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref045">45</xref>], or protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref047">47</xref>]. With respect to protein-protein interactions, the first protein to be identified as a negative regulator of MAVS was the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing family member, NLRX1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref035">35</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref038">38</xref>]. Although conflicting results have been reported with regard to the function of NLRX1 as a negative regulator of RLR-mediated antiviral signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref048">48</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref050">50</xref>], it is believed that NLRX1 associates with MAVS on the mitochondrial membrane to inhibit antiviral signaling by interrupting virus-induced RLR-MAVS interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref035">35</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref051">51</xref>]. However, the mechanism that regulates NLRX1 during virus infection remains poorly characterized.</p>
<p>FAF1, a member of the ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) family, potentially interacts with diverse proteins and functions as a negative and/or positive regulator in variety of biological possesses, including apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref003">3</xref>], tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref004">4</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref007">7</xref>], protein degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref052">52</xref>] and chaperone activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref053">53</xref>]. Here, we provide several lines of evidence showing that FAF1 is a positive regulator that modulates the type I interferon signaling pathway in response to RNA virus infection. First, FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice were more susceptible to infection by VSV as they were permissive to high rates of virus replication and mounted weak antiviral immune responses. Second, knockdown of endogenous FAF1 in immune cells or MEFs from FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice reduced RNA virus-induced IFN-Î² and proinflammatory cytokines production and increased viral replication. Third, overexpression of FAF1 in immune cells or MEFs promoted RLR-mediated antiviral response against RNA virus infection but not DNA virus infection. Fourth, FAF1 interacts with NLRX1 in response to RNA virus infection or RLR stimulation, and aa 1â€“327 of NLRX1 are responsible for the interaction between FAF1 and NLRX1. Finally, FAF1 interacts with NLRX1 at the early time points after RNA virus infection; this interaction inhibits binding of MAVS to NLRX1, which in turn switches on RIG-I mediated antiviral immune responses. Taken together, these findings indicate that FAF1 is a crucial regulator that induces the antiviral innate immune responses against RNA virus infection.</p>
<p>Recently, Song et.al., reported that FAF1 negatively regulates virus-induced IFN-Î² signaling and the antiviral response by inhibiting the translocation of active phosphorylated IRF3 from the cytosol to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref054">54</xref>]. However, this result contradicts that presented herein, and we clearly demonstrated that FAF1 acts as a positive regulator of the type I IFN signaling pathway during RNA virus infection. In particular, we identified the physiological role of FAF1 in innate immune responses against viral infection in FAF1<sup>+/+</sup> and FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice. FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice were more susceptible to infection with VSV than FAF1<sup>+/+</sup> mice, resulting high mortality in FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice due to a high viral load in the organs. After virus infection or Poly (I:C) stimulation, FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice showed lower levels of cytokine production (IL-6 and IFN-Î²) than FAF1<sup>+/+</sup> mice, which strongly supporting an impaired antiviral immune response, especially with respect to type I IFN signaling.</p>
<p>We also evaluated antiviral responses in several cell types. BMDMs, BMDCs, and PBMCs isolated from FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice, as well as FAF1 knockdown RAW264.7 cells and MEFs showed higher viral replication and lower IL-6 and IFN-Î² production, suggesting reduced antiviral and inflammatory responses due to suppression of FAF1. However, reconstitution of FAF1 in FAF1 knockdown MEFs restored the antiviral function of FAF1 by recovering production of these cytokines. Consistent with this, overexpression of FAF1 in RAW264.7 cells resulted enhanced antiviral responses. These results strongly support the involvement of FAF1 as a positive regulator of RNA virus-mediated type I IFN signaling. Here, we also examined the phosphorylation of IRF3 (the main integral component of the type I IFN response), p65 (a subunit of NF-ÎºB), STAT1, p38, and TBK1 after the induction of IFN responses by PR8-GFP. Together with this, significantly decreased type I IFN, ISGs, and antiviral mRNA transcript levels were observed in BMDMs and PBMCs of FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice compared with those in FAF1<sup>+/+</sup> mice after infection with VSV and PR8.</p>
<p>Interestingly, our large scale co-immunoprecipitation data demonstrated that FAF1 is one of the binding partners for NLRX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006398.g006">Fig 6</xref>, panel A), which negatively regulates type I IFN signaling by modulating the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref035">35</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref038">38</xref>]. We confirmed that FAF1 binds to and co-localizes with NLRX1. Moreover, we performed domain studies to better understand the mechanism underlying the interaction between FAF1 and NLRX1, and to identify which domain of NLRX1 binds to FAF1. The results showed that the MAVS binding site within NLRX1 (aa 75â€“556) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref035">35</xref>] overlaps with the binding site for FAF1 (aa 1â€“327). Hence, we postulate that the mechanism by which FAF1 positively regulates IFN signaling probably operates through FAF1-mediated disassociation of NLRX1 from MAVS. This supports our time course binding studies, which showed that FAF1 binds to NLRX1 at early time points (2 and/or 4 hpi) after virus infection. We also examined the time course binding of NLRX1 and MAVS and compared it with that of NLRX1 and FAF1 after the virus infection. Similar to previous studies showing constitutive interaction between RIG-I and MAVS in NLRX1-deficient cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref038">38</xref>], we found that NLRX1 bound to MAVS in the absence of virus infection. This suggests that under normal conditions NLRX1 blocks the interaction between MAVS and RIG-I. However, after virus infection, FAF1 appears to displace MAVS from NLRX1 by competitive binding to NLRX1. Thus, we postulate that FAF1 stimulates type I IFN signaling pathway by sequestering NLRX1 from the RIG-I-MAVS-mediated pathway. Furthermore, we confirmed that knockdown of NLRX1 abolishes the FAF1 mediated effects on type I IFN signaling, which supports our proposed mechanism. Nevertheless, several controversial reports are related with NLRX1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref048">48</xref>â€“<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref050">50</xref>], indicating more complicate mechanisms might involve on the role of NLRX1 on MAVS-dependent antiviral responses that unexplored yet, and FAF1 could be one of the key participant molecule in this mechanism which needs to be elucidated in future.</p>
<p>Recently, Guo et al. demonstrated that NLRX1 is a negative regulator of host innate immune responses to DNA viruses by sequestering the DNA-sensing adaptor, STING, from TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006398.ref055">55</xref>]. However, in this study, we found no differences in cytokine secretion levels or viral replication levels after HSV infection, suggesting that FAF1 may not modulate type I IFN production via STING-mediated sequestration of NLRX1 upon DNA virus infection. Hence, the present data indicate that FAF1 targets NLRX1 to regulate type I IFN production upon infection with RNA virus only. Moreover, the upstream signaling molecule that activates FAF1 after RNA virus infection and the reason that FAF1 only regulates NLRX1 upon RNA virus invasion remains unclear.</p>
<p>In summary, we showed that FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> mice are highly susceptible to RNA virus infection and show defective innate immune responses both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in vivo. Upon RNA virus infection, FAF1 binds competitively to NLRX1, thereby preventing it from binding to MAVS; this frees MAVS to interact with RIG-I and switch on the antiviral signaling cascade. These results suggest a plausible and novel mechanism by which FAF1 positively regulates type I IFN signaling and increases our understanding of the molecules that control type I IFN signaling and antiviral immune responses.</p>

<title>FAF1 enhances type I IFN signaling and expression of mRNA encoding IFN and IFN-related gene.</title>
<p>(A) The amount of phosphorylated IRF3, p65, STAT1, p38, and TBK1 and total IRF3, p65, and STAT1 was examined by immunoblot analysis of cell extracts from FAF1 knockdown MEFs (MEF/FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup>) and FAF1-reconstituted MEF/FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> (MEF/FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup>/FAF1) at the indicated times after PR8-GFP (MOI = 3) infection. Î²-actin was used to confirm equal protein loading. (B and C) MEF/FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> and MEF/FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup>/FAF1 (B) and PBMCs isolated from FAF1<sup>+/+</sup> (PBMC/FAF1<sup>+/+</sup>) and FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup> (PBMC/FAF1<sup>gt/gt</sup>) mice (C) were infected with PR8-GFP (MOI = 1 and 3, respectively) for 12 hr. Total RNA was extracted from infected cells to determine the expression of mRNA encoding IFN-Î², IFN-Î±, PKR, OAS, MX-1, ISG-15, ISG-20, ISG-56, ADAR1 and IL-6 for MEFs and IFN-Î², PKR, OAS, OAS-1Î², ISG-15, ISG-20 and ISG-56 for PBMCs was analyzed by qRT-PCR.
