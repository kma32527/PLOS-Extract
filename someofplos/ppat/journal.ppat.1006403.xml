<abstract>
<p><italic>Candida albicans</italic> is able to proliferate in environments that vary dramatically in ambient pH, a trait required for colonising niches such as the stomach, vaginal mucosal and the GI tract. Here we show that growth in acidic environments involves cell wall remodelling which results in enhanced chitin and Î²-glucan exposure at the cell wall periphery. Unmasking of the underlying immuno-stimulatory Î²-glucan in acidic environments enhanced innate immune recognition of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> by macrophages and neutrophils, and induced a stronger proinflammatory cytokine response, driven through the C-type lectin-like receptor, Dectin-1. This enhanced inflammatory response resulted in significant recruitment of neutrophils in an intraperitoneal model of infection, a hallmark of symptomatic vaginal colonisation. Enhanced chitin exposure resulted from reduced expression of the cell wall chitinase Cht2, via a Bcr1-Rim101 dependent signalling cascade, while increased Î²-glucan exposure was regulated via a non-canonical signalling pathway. We propose that this âunmaskingâ of the cell wall may induce non-protective hyper activation of the immune system during growth in acidic niches, and may attribute to symptomatic vaginal infection.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>To be able to colonise a host or cause infection, microbes must be able to adapt and respond to changes in their environment. One of the most important environmental signals for opportunistic pathogens is ambient pH, with changes in external pH resulting in phenotypic, metabolic and physical changes in fungi and bacteria (i.e. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, <italic>Candida</italic>). <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is an opportunistic fungal pathogen of humans that can colonise and infect niches of varying pH including the acidic mucosa of the vagina. Here we show that growth in an acidic environment results in structural modification of the fungal cell wall, a dynamic organelle key to immune recognition. These cell wall perturbations resulted in enhanced immune recognition of the fungal pathogen, a strong proinflammatory immune response and enhanced recruitment of neutrophils. Therefore, colonisation of acidic mucosa may result in the unmasking of cell wall components that trigger hyper-activation of the innate immune response and could contribute to immunopathology associated with vaginal candidiasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The opportunistic fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is a commensal in up to 80% of the population, and can cause superficial mucosal infections in healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref002">2</xref>] and invasive disease in immune supressed patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref004">4</xref>]. Mucosal infections increase population morbidity and are expensive to treat, while disseminated disease is associated with high mortality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>One attribute of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> that has made it such a successful opportunistic pathogen is its ability to adapt and proliferate in a broad range of host environments. One of the most important environmental conditions that fluctuate between different niches is ambient pH. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> is able to grow in media ranging from pH2 to pH10, and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> has been isolated from a range of anatomical sites that vary dramatically in ambient pH including the stomach (pH2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref007">7</xref>], vagina (pH4-5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref008">8</xref>] and the oral mucosa (pH6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref009">9</xref>], suggesting that adaptation to environmental pH is key to the pathogenicity of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>. Adaptation of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> to acidic environments regulates key biological processes including morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref010">10</xref>], white-to-opaque switching, and mating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref011">11</xref>]. However, the impact environmental adaptation has on the structure and composition of the fungal cell wall, the first point of contact between the fungus and host, is not well defined.</p>
<p>The fungal cell wall is a complex, multi-layered structure of mannoproteins, Î²-glucans and chitin that provides rigidity and shape and protects the fungus from the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref012">12</xref>]. These protein and carbohydrate motifs are immunogenic and play important roles in innate immune recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref012">12</xref>]. Environmental adaptation influences the cell wall proteome and impacts on the structure of the glycans that decorate the cell wall proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref013">13</xref>]. For instance, growth in blood or lactate media decreases the structural complexity of the outer mannan fibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref014">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref016">16</xref>], while antifungal drug treatment influences Î²-glucan exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref018">18</xref>]. Structural changes in the cell wall, as a result of mutation in key glycolytic cell wall assembly enzymes, confirm that modulation of the cell wall has profound implications for innate immune recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref019">19</xref>]. Therefore, understanding how environmental adaptation impacts on cell wall biogenesis, and the consequence this cell wall remodelling has on innate immune recognition is an important, but understudied, area of fungal biology. Here, we investigate how adaptation to acidic environments that mimic the pH of the vaginal mucosa impact on the structure and composition of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> cell wall and deduce how this cell wall remodelling affects the innate immune recognition of the pathogen.</p>

<title>Growth in acidic environments alters the ultrastructure of the fungal cell wall</title>
<p>The impact of adaptation to environmental pH on the ultrastructure of the cell wall was investigated via transmission electron microscopy. The cell wall of mid-log phase yeast cells grown in YPD buffered at pH2, pH4 pH6, pH8 and standard YPD were imaged. Under all tested conditions, the cell wall maintained two distinct layers: an inner layer comprised of glucan and chitin, and an outer, fibrillar layer of mannoproteins. However, adaptation to acidic conditions resulted in a significant loss of structural organisation in the outer cell wall, which appeared to be less fibrillar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Quantification of the thickness of the outer cell wall layer confirmed that adaptation to acidic environments significantly reduced mannan fibril length (pH2 23.23 Â± 3.58 nm (p = 0.0001), pH4 39.49 Â± 4.61 nm (p = 0.0495), compared to pH6 60.22 Â± 10.73 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We hypothesized that this loss of fibrillar structure might be due to changes in the underlying architecture of the cell wall. Therefore, we investigated whether pH similarly influences chitin structure.</p>

<title>Acidic environments induce reorganisation of the fungal cell wall through modulation of chitin</title>
<p>Although chitin only forms a small fraction of the fungal cell wall (3â5% by dry weight), a major compensatory mechanism of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> to cell wall stress is to up-regulate chitin synthesis to provide increased cell wall integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref020">20</xref>]. To identify whether the observed disorganisation of the outer cell wall layer was a result of increased chitin incorporation, the cell wall of acidic adapted cells was stained with Calcofluor White (CFW). Quantification of CFW fluorescence indicated that the chitin content of the cell wall was only elevated at pH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), a result that was confirmed by HPLC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006403.t001">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that adaptation to environments of very low pH requires chitin synthesis. However, staining the cell wall with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a lectin that binds surface exposed chitin, indicated that even adaptation to pH4 required reorganisation of cell wall chitin, with chitin becoming increasingly exposed during adaptation to acidic pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Microscopy confirmed that cells adapted to acidic pH showed significant de-cloaking of chitin around the cell periphery, with intense WGA staining occurring at bud scars at pH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). To deduce whether this de-cloaking phenomenon is an active process, we analysed the de-cloaking of chitin in response to pH in dead cells. De-cloaking of cell wall chitin only occurred in live cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006403.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), confirming that the observed increase in surface exposure of chitin was not a physical effect of the pH simply degrading the cell wall. Thus, adaptation to acidic environments is a two-stage process with moderate acidic environments (pH4) causing active de-cloaking of chitin, and strong acidic environments (pH2) inducing <italic>de novo</italic> chitin synthesis and further de-cloaking of chitin.</p>

<title>Neither Mkc1, Hog1, or Crz1 regulate chitin exposure in response to moderate pH stress</title>
<p>Chitin synthesis is regulated by the cell wall salvage, calcium/calcineurin and high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref021">21</xref>].

<title>Rim101 and Bcr1 coordinate correct localisation of chitin in the cell wall through regulation of Cht2</title>
<p>Chitin can be remodelled in the cell wall through the actions of four chitinases (Cht1-4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref022">22</xref>].

<p>To investigate the mechanism by which <italic>CHT2</italic> is repressed during adaptation to acidic environments, we focused on the Rim101 transcription factor. Rim101 has previously been shown to regulate the expression of the cell wall modifying enzymes Phr1 and Phr2 in response to environmental pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref024">24</xref>], has been implicated in cell wall reorganisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref025">25</xref>], and is an activator of gene expression in alkaline environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref026">26</xref>]. The expression of <italic>CHT2</italic> was repressed in the <italic>rim101</italic>Î mutant in environments above pH6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), with <italic>CHT2</italic> expression levels at pH6 or pH8 being comparable to pH4, suggesting that Rim101 is a pH-dependent activator of <italic>CHT2</italic> expression. Alkaline induced expression of <italic>CHT2</italic> was dependent on Bcr1, as <italic>CHT2</italic> levels remain low under all pH conditions in the <italic>bcr1</italic>Î mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine how the deregulation of <italic>CHT2</italic> expression affects chitin exposure, the <italic>bcr1</italic>Î and <italic>rim101</italic>Î mutants were grown in YPD buffered at pH4 and pH6, and stained with WGA. Deletion of <italic>BCR1</italic> resulted in increased chitin exposure at pH6 (p = 0.0076) and pH4 (p = 0.0491), but maintained some pH dependency, while deletion of <italic>RIM101</italic> resulted in constitutively high chitin exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). To investigate whether expression of Rim101 at pH4 would affect the phenotype, we quantified chitin exposure in a strain expressing constitutively active Rim101 (CARP1-1). FACS analysis confirmed that expression of active Rim101 in acidic environments reduced chitin exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g004">Fig 4E</xref>), but was still insufficient to completely mask the chitin. These results confirm that Rim101 plays an important role in the regulation of cell wall genes pivotal to correct chitin incorporation.</p>
<p>The mRNA of <italic>CHT2</italic> is a target of She3, which transports mRNAs to the cell wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref027">27</xref>]. Therefore, we determined whether this complex is also required for correct incorporation of chitin into the cell wall. Deletion of <italic>SHE3</italic> resulted in enhanced de-cloaking of chitin in environments above pH4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g004">Fig 4F</xref>), similar to the <italic>cht2</italic>Î and <italic>bcr1</italic>Î mutants. Taken together, these results suggest that incorporation of chitin into the inner cell wall at pH6 is regulated by Rim101 and Bcr1 and requires She3 dependent delivery of Cht2 to the cell wall, while growth in an acidic environment inactivates this pathway leading to reduced <italic>CHT2</italic> expression and enhanced exposure of chitin at the cell surface.</p>

<title>Low pH promotes unmasking of the underlying Î²-glucan</title>
<p>Î²-glucan is a major component of the cell wall, which is highly immunostimulatory and consequently is normally masked by a dense layer of glycosylated proteins. As a result, fungal cells have a degree of resistance to extracellular glucanases, which break down the cell wall and cause cell lysis. Therefore, the sensitivity of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> to recombinant Î²-glucanase can be used as an indirect measure of Î²-glucan exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref028">28</xref>]. Growth of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> in acidic environments enhanced Î²-glucanase sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g005">Fig 5Ai and ii</xref>) compared to pH6 or pH8 grown cells, suggesting that Î²-glucan is more accessible in cells grown in media buffered to pH4. In agreement with this, immunofluorescent staining of the cell wall with a monoclonal Î²1,3-glucan antibody revealed enhanced staining around the cell wall periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Quantification of the immunofluorescent staining by FACS revealed that acid adapted cells had almost 4-fold more surface exposed Î²-glucan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g005">Fig 5C</xref>) than cells grown in YPD media, suggesting that adaptation to acidic environments induces unmasking of Î²-glucan. To rule out the possibility that the pH simply degrades the cell wall, exposing the underlying Î²-glucan, dead cells were exposed to YPD at pH2, 4 and 6 for 4 h and surface exposure quantified by FACS. Only live cells unmasked their Î²-glucan in response to acidic pH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006403.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), confirming that, like the chitin exposure, unmasking of Î²-glucan is an active process.</p>

<p>To determine whether Î²-glucan synthesis was required for this unmasking effect, total glucan levels were quantified by staining the cells with Aniline Blue. Binding of Aniline Blue to the fungal cell wall was consistent across all pH conditions, suggesting that total Î²-glucan levels remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Furthermore, HPLC analysis confirmed that the amount of glucose in the cell wall was not significantly different in cells grown in media buffered to different pHs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006403.t001">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, the increase in Î²-glucan exposure occurs as a result of cell wall remodelling, and not enhanced Î²-glucan synthesis.</p>
<p>To deduce whether de-cloaking of the cell wall was a general adaptation response of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, pH-dependent cell wall reorganisation of a series of clinical isolates from different sites and types of infection was examined. All clinical isolates de-cloaked their cell wall in response to acidic environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), confirming that this phenomenon is not restricted to laboratory-evolved strains.</p>
<p>To investigate whether the form of acid used to pH the media affects unmasking, YPD media was buffered using lactic acid an organic acid produced by Lactobacilli during colonisation of the vaginal mucosa. Growth in YPD buffered to pH4 with lactic acid still induced unmasking of the cell wall, similar to reducing pH with HCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Therefore, physiologically relevant acids drive unmasking of the cell wall in a pH-dependent manner. In order to determine whether environments that more closely mimic the environment of the female reproductive tract induce cell wall remodelling, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> was grown in Vaginal Simulation Media (VSM) buffered to pH4, pH6 or pH7. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> unmasked significantly more Î²-glucan (p = 0.0022) when the VSM was buffered to pH4 than either pH6 or pH7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), suggesting that the environment within the female reproductive tract has the potential to induce exposure of Î²-glucan. Because infection sites are known to contain a mixture of yeast and hyphal cells, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> hyphae were generated in acidic media in elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide, a potent inducer of morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref029">29</xref>] and in the presence of vaginal epithelial cells. Both yeast and hyphal cells showed increased chitin and Î²-glucan exposure compared to their respective controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>). Therefore, both yeast and hyphal cells undergo cell wall remodelling during adaptation to acidic environments, which results in the surface exposure of Î²-glucan.</p>

<p>As adaptation to acidic pH resulted in surface exposure of both chitin and glucan we investigated whether these carbohydrates became exposed at the same or different points in the cell wall. Dual immunofluorescent imaging using TRITC-WGA and FITC-glucan, confirmed that while chitin exposure occurred mainly at bud scars at pH4 with increase exposure occurring in the lateral cell wall at pH2, glucan exposure was continuously localised to punctate patches around the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g007">Fig 7</xref>). As the exposed carbohydrates were not co-localised we hypothesised that they are not dependent on each other, and may be regulated via different processes.</p>

<p>One potential hypothesis to explain the unmasking response to acidic pH is that the chemical cleavage of the outer phosphomannan could reduce the mannan complexity and result in a more porous outer mannan shield, permitting access to the underlying cell wall layers. To test this hypothesis, carbohydrate exposure after adaptation to acidic pH in the <italic>mnn4</italic>Î mutant, which is devoid of phosphomannan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref030">30</xref>], was examined.

<p>The <italic>rim101</italic>Î and <italic>bcr1</italic>Î mutants displayed levels of chitin exposure at pH6 similar to those observed at pH4.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> has a remarkable ability to respond and adapt to a multitude of environmental signals. Here, we demonstrate that adaptation to low pH results in significant remodelling of the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> cell wall. The most striking effects include the de-cloaking of the underlying chitin and Î²-glucan. Unmasking of these underlying carbohydrate epitopes was an active process, and was independent of phosphomannan loss, suggesting that chemical cleavage of this outer cell wall component did not sufficiently deplete the outer mannan armour to reveal internal pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).</p>
<p>Chitin is remodelled in the cell wall through the actions of chitinases. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> expresses four chitinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref022">22</xref>], however only deletion of <italic>CHT2</italic> prevented the pH-dependent de-cloaking of chitin. Cht2 is mainly expressed in yeast cells, and is GPI-anchored to the cell wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref034">34</xref>]. pH-dependent de-cloaking of cell wall chitin also was dependent on the Rim101 and Bcr1 transcription factors. Rim101 is C-terminally processed in response to alkaline environments through the <italic>RIM101</italic> signalling cascade, and activates the expression of alkaline induced genes, while repressing the transcription of acid induced genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref026">26</xref>]. Bcr1 is essential for biofilm formation and controls the expression of many cell wall associated genes including <italic>HWP1</italic>, <italic>ALS1</italic>, <italic>ALS3</italic> and <italic>HYR1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref035">35</xref>]. The expression of <italic>CHT2</italic> was dependent on Bcr1, and showed Rim101 pH-dependent expression in environments above pH6. This alkaline dependent increase in expression was lost in the <italic>bcr1</italic>Î mutant, suggesting that Bcr1 is essential for <italic>CHT2</italic> expression, as indicated in large scale transcriptomic analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref036">36</xref>]. However, Bcr1 also positively regulates <italic>RIM8</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref037">37</xref>], suggesting that inactivation of <italic>BCR1</italic> would also decrease processing of Rim101, linking the two pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g012">Fig 12A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>One hypothesis for the de-cloaking of chitin is that during growth in neutral or alkaline environments Rim101 and Bcr1 activate the expression of <italic>CHT2</italic>. She3 then delivers <italic>CHT2</italic> mRNA to the cell wall, where it is translated, and incorporated into the cell wall via its GPI anchor. Cht2 is predicted to possess endo-chitinase activity. Therefore, once in the cell wall, Cht2 would act internally on the chitin microfibrils, decreasing their length, and permitting correct incorporation in the inner layer of the cell wall. However, during growth in acidic conditions, Rim101 is inactive, resulting in lower transcriptional levels of <italic>CHT2</italic> and other cell wall regulatory enzymes. In this case, there will be less Cht2 to act on the chitin microfibrils, which may increase the length of these microfibrils, hindering their embedment into the inner layer of the cell wall and resulting in increased exposure of chitin at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006403.g012">Fig 12B</xref>).</p>
<p>More striking than the de-cloaking of chitin was the unmasking of the highly pro-inflammatory PAMP, Î²-glucan. Dissection of key pathways known to be involved in the regulation of cell wall biosynthesis and pH sensing suggested that these conventional pathways are not responsible for regulating the change in distribution of Î²-glucan. In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, adaptation to acidic environments has opposing effects inducing masking of Î²-glucan, which is mediated by the Hog1 signal transduction pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref028">28</xref>]. Deletion of <italic>HOG1</italic> had no impact on Î²-glucan unmasking in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, suggesting that significant transcriptional rewiring has occurred during evolution between <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> is isolated from 95% of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) cases, with the remaining 5% of infections being mainly caused by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>glabrata</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref038">38</xref>]. During colonisation of the vaginal mucosa <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> is exposed to many environmental conditions including low mucosal pH (vaginal pH = 3.5â4.5). Unlike bacterial vaginosis, which is associated with alkalisation of the vaginal mucosa, during VVC mucosal pH remains low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref039">39</xref>]. Therefore, during both colonisation and infection of the vaginal mucosa, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> is exposed to acidic conditions.</p>
<p>The pH-dependent unmasking of the cell wall results in enhanced recruitment of innate immune cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, which correlated with enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> assays confirm that this enhanced immune recognition was mediated via the C-type lectin like receptor Dectin-1, a dominant receptor in fungal innate immunity known to recognise Î²-glucan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>Symptomatic vaginal colonisation by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> results in excessive neutrophil migration, with vaginal secretions displaying enhanced chemotactic potential and increased mucosal damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref041">41</xref>]. Neutrophil depletion reduces inflammation and symptoms associated with VVC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref042">42</xref>], suggesting that neutrophil recruitment in VVC is non-protective, in contrast to oral candidiasis where neutrophil recruitment and activation of Th17 responses are protective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
<p>Growth of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> in VSM (a media which more closely resembled vaginal fluid) confirmed that the unmasking of Î²-glucan is not media specific, but is pH dependent, with unmasking only occurring at acidic pH. This raises questions regarding the link between Î²-glucan unmasking and VVC, as mouse VVC models, which elicit similar immunopathologies to human samples, have a neutral, not an acidic, vaginal pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref044">44</xref>]. Although the mouse models can replicate some conditions experienced during VVC, these still do not provide a complete model of VVC. For example, mice are not naturally colonised by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> in the vaginal tract, and are normally immune suppressed with oestrogen to maintain colonisation and the high inoculum used to establish the infection is unlikely to reflect fungal burdens during the initiation of VVC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref044">44</xref>]. The cells used for intravaginal inoculation will also be immunogenically different to those acquired from the GI tract or skin, which is the primary source of vaginal seeding in human VVC. Finally, the neutral pH of the mouse vaginal mucosa would favour rapid hyphal development of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, which will activate the inflammasome pathway more rapidly resulting in increased epithelial activation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref045">45</xref>]. Therefore, although the mouse model parallels the symptoms of human VVC we still do know whether the observed immunopathology arises from the same underlying mechanism. For example, it has recently been reported that neutrophils also promote unmasking of Î²-glucan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref046">46</xref>], which would also increase inflammation. Therefore, although we have animal models for VVC, these do not currently directly reflect human infection. It is conceivable that in human VVC, a gradual increase in fungal burden in combination with pH-dependent unmasking of the immunostimulatory Î²-glucan in both yeast and hyphal cells, as a response to environmental changes within the vaginal niche, might initiate a earlier, stronger proinflammatory cytokine response, resulting in increased neutrophil recruitment causing symptomatic vaginal colonisation.</p>

<title>High pressure freeze substitution transmission electron microscopy</title>
<p>The ultrastructure of the cell wall of wild type (NGY152) cells grown at different pH was visualised by TEM. Exponentially growing cells at 37Â°C were frozen under high pressure in liquid nitrogen and embedded in resin as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006403.ref048">48</xref>]. Ultrathin sections (70 nm) were cut and mounted on 400 mesh copper grids and stained in 4.5% uranyl acetate in 1% acetic acid for 45 min and Reynolds lead citrate for 7 min. Images were acquired using a Jeol 1230 at 80 kV accelerating voltage fitted with a Gatan 791 multiscan camera. Five cells were selected at random for each condition and multiple images taken around the cell periphery. The thickness of the inner and outer cell wall layers was measured from at least 30 different points of each cell using ImageJ. Data were analysed by two-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Tukeyâs multiple comparisons test at 95% confidence.</p>
