<abstract>
<p>When confronted with poor oxygenation, cells adapt by activating survival signaling pathways, including the oxygen-sensitive transcriptional regulators called hypoxia-inducible factor alphas (HIF-αs). We report here that HIF-1α also regulates the life cycle of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Incubation of EBV-positive gastric carcinoma AGS-Akata and SNU-719 and Burkitt lymphoma Sal and KemIII cell lines with a prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, L-mimosine or deferoxamine, or the NEDDylation inhibitor MLN4924 promoted rapid and sustained accumulation of both HIF-1α and lytic EBV antigens. ShRNA knockdown of HIF-1α significantly reduced deferoxamine-mediated lytic reactivation. HIF-1α directly bound the promoter of the EBV primary latent-lytic switch <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene, Zp, activating transcription via a consensus hypoxia-response element (HRE) located at nt -83 through -76 relative to the transcription initiation site. HIF-1α did not activate transcription from the other EBV immediate-early gene, <italic>BRLF1</italic>. Importantly, expression of HIF-1α induced EBV lytic-gene expression in cells harboring wild-type EBV, but not in cells infected with variants containing base-pair substitution mutations within this HRE. Human oral keratinocyte (NOK) and gingival epithelial (hGET) cells induced to differentiate by incubation with either methyl cellulose or growth in organotypic culture accumulated both HIF-1α and Blimp-1α, another cellular factor implicated in lytic reactivation. HIF-1α activity also accumulated along with Blimp-1α during B-cell differentiation into plasma cells. Furthermore, most <italic>BZLF1</italic>-expressing cells observed in lymphomas induced by EBV in NSG mice with a humanized immune system were located distal to blood vessels in hypoxic regions of the tumors. Thus, we conclude that HIF-1α plays central roles in both EBV’s natural life cycle and EBV-associated tumorigenesis. We propose that drugs that induce HIF-1α protein accumulation are good candidates for development of a lytic-induction therapy for treating some EBV-associated malignancies.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Most adults throughout the world are infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human herpesvirus frequently associated in a latent state with some cancers of epithelial and B-cell origin such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Burkitt lymphoma, respectively. To develop an oncolytic therapy for treating patients with EBV-associated cancers, we need a method to efficiently induce synthesis of lytic EBV proteins. The EBV protein encoded by its immediate-early <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene usually mediates the switch into lytic viral infection. We show here that HIF-1α, a cellular transcription factor that accumulates in cells when deprived of normal levels of oxygen, can induce lytic EBV infection. HIF-1α mediates this switch by directly binding to a specific sequence located within the <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene promoter, activating its expression. Importantly, we also show that deferoxamine, an FDA-approved drug that inhibits degradation of HIF-1α, can induce synthesis of lytic EBV proteins in some EBV-positive epithelial and lymphocytic cell lines. These findings indicate that HIF-1α-stabilizing drugs, administered in combination with nucleoside analogues such as ganciclovir, may be helpful as part of a lytic-induction therapy for treating some patients with EBV-positive malignancies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous human gamma herpesvirus that infects over 90% of the world’s population. In healthy hosts, primary infection after childhood often results in infectious mononucleosis (IM). Following primary infection, EBV establishes a life-long latent infection in a tiny subset of its host’s memory B cells where its genome is maintained as an episome that replicates in synchrony with the host’s cellular DNA (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref002">2</xref>]). Latency is characterized by expression of, at most, a small number of viral protein-encoding genes (EBNAs and LMPs), two non-coding RNAs (EBERs), and some micro (mi) RNAs (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref003">3</xref>]). Latent EBV infection is associated with some malignancies in humans, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), some gastric cancers (GC), a subset of Burkitt lymphomas (BL), diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), and post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases (PTLD) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref005">5</xref>]). Several EBV-encoded latency proteins and miRNAs have been shown to contribute to cell transformation and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Like other herpesviruses, EBV’s long-term success requires it to undergo lytic as well as latent modes of infection during its life cycle. While latent infection permits persistence of the virus for the life of the host, lytic replication enables production of infectious virus necessary for transmission from cell to cell and host to host. Thus, EBV occasionally reactivates out of latently infected B cells. Physiological inducers of EBV reactivation include B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) activation leading to plasma cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref002">2</xref>], butyrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref007">7</xref>], and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref009">9</xref>]. Subsequently, EBV infects differentiated cells within the normal oropharyngeal epithelial where infection is usually lytic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>EBV reactivation is initiated by transcriptional activation of one or both of the viral immediate-early (IE) gene promoters, Zp and Rp, leading to production of its two IE proteins, Zta (the product of the <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene; also called Z, ZEBRA, and EB1) and Rta (the product of the <italic>BRLF1</italic> gene; also called R), respectively. Synthesis of Zta is sufficient to induce reactivation in most EBV-positive (EBV<sup>+</sup>) cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref011">11</xref>], while Rta induces reactivation in some cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref013">13</xref>]. Rta and Zta are transcription factors that then activate each other’s promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref015">15</xref>] and, subsequently, activate expression of EBV’s early (E) genes, including <italic>BMRF1</italic>, a viral DNA polymerase processivity factor [also called early-antigen diffuse (EAD)], and <italic>BGLF4</italic>, a virus-encoded protein kinase (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref016">16</xref>]).</p>
<p>Given that expression of the <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene serves as the primary gatekeeper to the viral latent-to-lytic switch in most EBV<sup>+</sup> cell lines, transcriptional regulation of Zp has been studied extensively. Numerous <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements and their cognate <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors have been identified that contribute to silencing during latency and activation in response to inducers (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref016">16</xref>]).</p>
<p>Poor oxygenation, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., hypoxia, contributes to tumor progression and resistance to conventional chemotherapy (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref019">19</xref>]). The mechanisms by which cells respond to hypoxic environments are known (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref021">21</xref>]). Under normal oxygen tension corresponding to approximately 21% O<sub>2</sub>, cellular transcription factors called hypoxia-inducible factor alphas (HIF-αs) are synthesized but rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. Three distinct genes encode the HIF-αs (HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-3α). Hydroxylation of specific proline residues by oxygen-dependent cellular prolyl hydroxylases (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., PHD2, encoded by the <italic>EGLN1</italic> gene) marks these proteins for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. The hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by PHDs also involves the conversion of α–ketoglutarate to succinate, Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe <sup>3+</sup>, and O<sub>2</sub> to CO<sub>2</sub>, with vitamin C required for the regeneration of Fe<sup>2+</sup>. Under hypoxic conditions (or in the presence of iron chelators or competitors), PHDs fail to hydroxylate HIF-αs, resulting in accumulation of these proteins to high levels. Stabilized HIF-αs form heterodimers with their constitutively present binding partner, HIF-1β [also called aryl hydrocarbon nuclear receptor translocator (ARNT)], translocate to the nucleus, and sequence-specifically bind to hypoxia-response elements (HREs) located within the promoter regions of cellular genes involved in angiogenesis, anaerobic metabolism, and erythropoiesis.</p>
<p>The roles hypoxia and HIF-1α play in the life cycle of Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), another member of the gamma herpesvirus family, have been extensively studied (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref023">23</xref>]). Analogously, Jiang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref024">24</xref>] reported that incubation of the EBV<sup>+</sup> marmoset-derived B-cell line, B95-8, in 2% oxygen conditions leads to induction of Zta synthesis within one-to-two days, and Murata <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref025">25</xref>] confirmed that hypoxia (1% oxygen; 36 h) induces <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene expression in human EBV<sup>+</sup> Akata B cells and LCLs as well as B95-8 cells.</p>
<p>Here, we report that drugs that mimic hypoxia induce lytic EBV infection in some EBV<sup>+</sup> epithelial and B-cell lines by a HIF-1α-dependent mechanism. HIF-1α induces the switch to lytic-gene expression through directly activating <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene expression by sequence-specific binding to an HRE located within Zp. We further show that HIF-1α can play important roles in EBV’s natural life cycle and tumorigenesis induced by this virus. These findings suggest a new class of drugs that may be useful in the development of a lytic-induction therapy for treating patients with some EBV-associated malignancies.</p>

<title>HIF-α stabilizers induce EBV reactivation in some EBV<sup>+</sup> cell lines</title>
<p>Our long-term objective is to find drugs suitable for use in EBV-targeted oncolytic therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref027">27</xref>]. Thus, we chose to mimic hypoxia by incubating cells with deferoxamine (DFO; also called Desferal) or L-mimosine (Mim; also called Leucenol), two drugs that inhibit prolyl hydroxylase activity by chelating iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref028">28</xref>]. The EBV<sup>+</sup> cell lines examined were Burkitt lymphoma-derived Sal and KemIII and gastric carcinoma-derived AGS-Akata and SNU-719. SNU-719, Sal, and KemIII retain their original-infecting EBV genomes. SNU-719 cells have type I latency plus LPM2A, Sal cells have Wp-restricted latency, and KemIII have type III latency. In an initial experiment, we found that incubation of Sal cells with mimosine promoted both stabilization of HIF-1α and induction of synthesis of the immediate-early (IE) lytic EBV antigen, Zta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). However, because mimosine is not FDA-approved for internal use, we largely focused on DFO in subsequent experiments. Incubation of all four of these cell lines with DFO for 24 h promoted stabilization of HIF-1α protein along with inducing synthesis of Zta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g001">Fig 1B–1E</xref>). Quantitation of the efficiency of EBV reactivation by staining cells for presence of Zta indicated that 15%-30% of AGS-Akata cells were induced into lytic-gene expression within 24 h of addition of 200 μM DFO, while 1 ½%-to-3% of Sal, SNU-719, and KemIII cells were induced within this time frame (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006404.s001">S1 Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>).</p>

<p>MLN4924 (Pevonedistat), an inhibitor of the NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE), also blocks degradation of HIF-αs. By preventing NEDDylation of the cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), MLN4924 inhibits degradation of approximately 20% of cellular proteins, including the HIF-αs, whose levels are regulated in part via the proteasome degradation pathway (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref029">29</xref>]). We found that MLN4924 reactivation of EBV into lytic infection at a roughly similar efficiency to DFO in the EBV<sup>+</sup> GC-derived cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Thus, we conclude that two classes of HIF-α stabilizing drugs with different off-target effects can both induce lytic EBV infection.</p>
<p>We also asked whether temporary stabilization of HIF-αs resulted in abortive lytic infection or activation of the complete lytic replication cycle. Removal of DFO after 24 h led to loss of HIF-1α, as expected, yet the lytic cycle continued to progress, leading to high-level synthesis of EAD and the late (L) EBV-encoded viral capsid antigen (VCA, also called p18) by 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). These data also suggest that the percentage of cells reactivated by DFO might well be higher than observed after only 24 h. Thus, we conclude that HIF-α-stabilizing drugs can induce lytic EBV infection in EBV<sup>+</sup> cells of lymphocytic and epithelial origin and in a variety of latency types.</p>

<title>HIF-1α is the predominant HIF-α expressed in EBV<sup>+</sup> cells</title>
<p>While DFO induced high-level accumulation of HIF-1α protein in all four of these cell lines, it only induced HIF-2α protein to moderately high levels in SNU-719 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Analysis of RNA-sequencing data of mRNA purified from SNU-719 cells indicated that HIF-1α mRNA was 5.5-fold more abundant than HIF-2α mRNA and 43-fold more abundant than HIF-3α mRNA. Thus, even though we could detect some HIF-2α protein in DFO-treated SNU-719 and AGS-Akata cells, it was probably present at considerably lower levels than was HIF-1α protein.</p>
<p>HIF-1α was also the predominant isoform of the three HIF-αs detected at the RNA level in primary tissues exhibiting EBV tropism. Transcriptome analysis of four high EBV<sup>+</sup> primary gastric cancers from the TCGA cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref030">30</xref>] indicated that HIF-1α mRNA was, on average, 2.9-fold more abundant than HIF-2α mRNA (range 1.9-fold to 4.9-fold), with HIF-3α mRNA undetectable above background level. A similar analysis of 17 EBV<sup>+</sup> endemic Burkitt lymphomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref031">31</xref>] indicated HIF-1α mRNA was, on average, nine-fold more abundant than HIF-2α mRNA (range 2-fold to 19-fold), with HIF-3α mRNA detectable above background in only one of these 17 tumors (at 1/20<sup>th</sup> of the HIF-1α level). Further, HIF-1α accounts for almost all of the HIF-α-related mRNA present in primary human B-cells throughout the various stages of B-cell differentiation into plasma cells (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., see data presented below). Thus, although HIF-2α may contribute to EBV’s life cycle under some conditions in epithelial cells, HIF-1α appears to be the predominant HIF-α expressed in cell types of physiological relevance to EBV. Given this finding, most of the studies presented here were performed with HIF-1α. We occasionally confirmed our findings with HIF-2α and did not conduct further studies with HIF-3α.</p>

<p>If HIF-1α induces EBV reactivation, one would expect most Zta<sup>+</sup> cells to also be HIF-1α<sup>+</sup>. To determine the level of coincidence between Zta<sup>+</sup> and HIF-1α<sup>+</sup> cells, we performed dual immunofluorescence staining (IFS) assays.

<title>HIF-1α primarily induces EBV lytic-gene expression by activating transcription from Zp</title>
<p>HIF-1α induces KSHV reactivation by directly enhancing expression of its <italic>ORF50</italic> gene, the orthologue of EBV’s <italic>BRLF1</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref033">33</xref>].

HEK 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids expressing the oxygen-insensitive variant of HIF-1α, HIF-1β, and reporters driving luciferase expression from Rp or Zp. We used an Rta expression plasmid as a positive control since Rta is a potent transcriptional activator of both Zp and Rp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref015">15</xref>]. While addition of HIF-1α/HIF-1β activated transcription from the Zp-luc reporter approximately 24-fold, it activated the Rp-luc reporter similarly to the four-fold activation observed with the negative control TATA-luc reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g004">Fig 4</xref>). As expected, Rta robustly activated both reporters. Thus, HIF-1α/HIF-1β heterodimers activate transcription from Zp approximately six-fold above the non-specific level observed in this assay while failing to activate specifically transcription from Rp.

To examine whether HIF-1α-dependent transactivation of Zp mapped to this sequence, we constructed a set of base-pair substitution mutant variants of our WT luciferase reporter, pWTZp-luc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).

We identified the HIF-1α-containing protein-DNA complex by showing it was lost by incubation with a HIF-1α-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Competition electrophoretic-mobility-shift assays (EMSAs) were performed by pre-incubation of the extract with various amounts of the unlabeled, double-stranded WT or mutant (MT) oligonucleotides indicated in panel C. WT Zp HRE-containing oligonucleotide competed for binding the HIF-1α/HIF-1β complex as well as the consensus WT HRE oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, lanes 9–11 vs. lanes 3–5, respectively) while the 3-bp mutant variant of this consensus HRE oligonucleotide failed to compete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, lanes 6–8 vs. lane 2). Likewise, a 3-bp mutant variant of the Zp HRE-containing oligonucleotide corresponding to the M3 mutation that abolished HIF-1α/HIF-1β-dependent transcriptional activation of Zp-luc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g005">Fig 5</xref>) also largely failed to compete for binding HIF-1α/HIF-1β complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, lanes 12–14 vs. lane 2). Thus, the <italic>trans</italic>-activation and DNA-binding activities of HIF-1α co-localize to the HRE present within Zp.</p>

<title>HIF-1α-induced reactivation of EBV requires the Zp HRE</title>
<p>To confirm that HIF-1α induction of lytic EBV infection truly occurs via binding to this Zp HRE rather than indirectly via downstream signaling events, we constructed two independent HRE variants of EBV containing the M2 and M4 substitution mutations analyzed in our reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g005">Fig 5</xref>) within the context of the p2089 BAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref036">36</xref>]. 293T cells were transfected in parallel with these two EBV HRE mutant BACs alongside their parental WT EBV BAC and selected for resistance to hygromycin to establish the cell lines 293T-EBV M2, 293T-EBV M4, and 293T-EBV WT, respectively. Confirming our observation with AGS-Akata cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), co-transfection of 293T EBV-WT cells with plasmids expressing the oxygen-insensitive variant of HIF-1α along with HIF-1β efficiently induced expression of EBV IE and E genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g008">Fig 8A</xref>, lane 2 vs. lane 1). Strikingly, co-transfection of HIF-1α/HIF-1β expression plasmids into 293T cells latently infected with either the M2 or M4 HRE mutant variant of EBV failed to induce synthesis of lytic EBV antigens above the background level of spontaneous reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g008">Fig 8A</xref>, lane 4 and lane 6, respectively).</p>

<p>To rule out non-HRE-related causes for our negative finding, we also transfected these cell lines with plasmids expressing Zta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g008">Fig 8B</xref>) or Rta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). When either of these EBV IE proteins was provided, all three cell lines exhibited similar high-level expression of both the non-transfected IE gene and the EAD-encoding gene, <italic>BMRF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, lanes 2, 4, and 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g008">Fig 8C</xref>, lanes 2, 4, and 6). We also recovered the viral DNAs from these mutant-infected cell lines and thoroughly analyzed their genomes for second-site mutations; none were found by either DNA sequencing or restriction fragment pattern analysis. Thus, mutation of the Zp HRE within the context of whole EBV genomes disables HIF-1α-dependent induction of <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene expression. We conclude that HIF-1α induces lytic reactivation in EBV primarily (possibly, exclusively) via direct binding to this single HRE located within Zp.</p>
<p>Some HREs respond to both of the two major HIF-α isoforms whereas others primarily or solely respond to only one of them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref018">18</xref>]. As indicated above, we observed that HIF-1α RNA is more abundant that HIF-2α RNA in all of the EBV<sup>+</sup> epithelial and B cell lines and tumors we have examined to date. Nevertheless, given our finding that HIF-2α can also activate Zp in reporter assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g005">Fig 5</xref>), it remains possible that some conditions exist (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., chronic hypoxia) in which HIF-2α is the more physiologically important HIF-α regarding some aspects of EBV’s life cycle. Thus, we examined likewise whether latent EBV genomes can also be induced into lytic infection using a plasmid that expresses an oxygen-insensitive variant of HIF-2α. As with HIF-1α, we observed high-level induction of EBV IE and E gene expression in the cells latently infected with the WT EBV genome, but not cells latently infected with the Zp HRE M2 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g008">Fig 8D</xref>, lane 2 vs. lane 4, respectively). Noteworthy is the fact that neither HIF-1α nor HIF-2α directly activated <italic>BRLF1</italic> gene expression in cells infected with Zp HRE mutant genomes; if they had, we should have seen synthesis of Zta and EAD as well as Rta protein as was observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g008">Fig 8C</xref>. This finding demonstrates that HIF-α/β heterodimers fail to activate transcription from Rp in the context of full-length latent EBV genomes as well as in reporter assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Thus, we conclude that, when present, either of the two major HIF-α isoforms can mediate EBV reactivation via the Zp HRE.</p>

<title>HIF-1α protein accumulates during epithelial and B-cell differentiation</title>
<p>Why might EBV have evolved to contain an HRE within Zp? To answer this question, we examined whether the appearance of HIF-1α protein during differentiation of normal epithelial and B cells coincides with the cell types in which lytic EBV infection takes place. In B cells, lytic EBV reactivation occurs when memory B-cells begin to differentiate into plasma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref002">2</xref>]. To determine when functionally active HIF-1α protein is present in B cells, we mined existing microarray data sets obtained from B cells harvested at eight different stages of differentiation, ranging from naïve B cells to fully differentiated plasma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g009">Fig 9</xref>). HIF-1α mRNA is present at high levels in all of these stages, declining somewhat only during the very last stage. However, functionally active HIF-1α protein, as measured by expression of the HIF-1α-activated genes <italic>VEGFA</italic> and <italic>PDK1</italic>, dramatically increases in the post-memory cell preplasmablast and plasmablast stages, respectively. These are the same stages during B-cell differentiation when expression of both ZEBs plummets (possibly due, in part, to HIF-1α also activating synthesis of miR-429 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref037">37</xref>], a down-regulator of ZEB levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref039">39</xref>]), and expression of Blimp-1α and XBP-1 dramatically increases. Thus, the stages during B-cell differentiation when EBV reactivates are coincident with the stages when three of the Zp activators (HIF-1α, Blimp-1α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref040">40</xref>], and XBP-1s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref042">42</xref>]) appear and two of the major Zp repressors (ZEB1 and ZEB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref044">44</xref>]) disappear.</p>

<p>Another stage of EBV’s natural life cycle involves the infection of differentiated epithelial cells by EBV (either free virions or virus produced in reactivated EBV<sup>+</sup> B cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref010">10</xref>]. Expression of Blimp-1α is also induced during epithelial cell differentiation, synergizing with KLF4 to activate transcription from both Zp and Rp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref045">45</xref>]. To determine whether HIF-α protein accumulation is induced by epithelial cell differentiation, we incubated telomerase (TERT)-immortalized human normal oral keratinocyte (NOK) cells with the differentiation-inducing agent, methylcellulose (MC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g010">Fig 10A</xref>). Both HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein, along with some Blimp-1α, appeared within 2 h of MC addition; they remained present for at least 12 h. Thus, their stabilization may be among the earliest events to occur during epithelial cell differentiation, hours before the appearance of involucrin, another marker of epithelial cell differentiation. The kinetics of appearance of HIF-1α and Blimp-1α were similar in MC-treated NOK-Akata, cells infected with EBV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g010">Fig 10B</xref>). This latter finding suggests that regulation of the stabilization of HIF-1α protein during epithelial cell differentiation occurs independently of the presence of EBV. We examined likewise hTERT-infected human gingival epithelial (hGET) cells. In this case, HIF-1α protein and Blimp-1α were both abundantly present, along with involucrin, 48 h after addition of MC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g010">Fig 10C</xref>, lane 2); accumulation of HIF-1α protein was within a few-fold of that observed when these cells were incubated with 50 μM DFO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g010">Fig 10C</xref>, lane 4). HIF-1α protein also accumulated together with Blimp-1α and involucrin when NOK cells were induced to differentiate by growth in organotypic culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g010">Fig 10D</xref>). Thus, both HIF-1α and Blimp-1α are present in differentiated cells of the types present in the human oral cavity.</p>

<title>HIF-1α also enhances lytic EBV reactivation <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Given the above findings, we hypothesized that hypoxic regions within growing EBV<sup>+</sup> tumors accumulate HIF-1α, thereby increasing the probability that latent EBV infection will reactivate into lytic replication. To test this hypothesis, we examined EBV<sup>+</sup> B-cell lymphomas [similar in phenotype to human diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs)] that had been induced in NSG (NOD/LtSz-<italic>scid/IL2Rγ</italic><sup><italic>null</italic></sup>) mice by inoculation with human cord blood that had been infected with the M81 strain of EBV by co-culture for 90 min immediately prior to injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref046">46</xref>]. If our hypothesis is valid, EBV<sup>+</sup> tumor cells located distally from blood vessels (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., in poorly oxygenated regions) are more likely to reactivate into lytic replication than ones located near them. Latently EBV-infected B-cells were identified by IFS for the latent EBV protein, EBNA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g011">Fig 11A</xref>); lytic infection was identified by IFS for the lytic EBV protein, Zta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g011">Fig 11B and 11C</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006404.s003">S3 Fig</xref> for adjacent serial sections, including H&amp;E staining).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is the first one to identify the mechanism by which hypoxia induces lytic EBV infection, leading us to conclude that HIF-1α plays roles in both EBV’s natural life cycle and EBV-associated tumorigenesis. We demonstrated with shRNA knockdown experiments that HIF-1α was required for induction of EBV reactivation by the hypoxia mimic DFO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Expression of an oxygen-insensitive variant of HIF-1α was also sufficient to induce EBV reactivation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g003">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g008">8A</xref>). HIF-1α activated transcription from Zp, but not Rp, in both a reporter assay and in the context of whole EBV genomes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g008">8A</xref>), with activation mediated by a consensus HRE located at nt -83 through -76 relative to the transcription initiation site of Zp (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g008">8</xref>). EMSAs and ChIP assays confirmed that HIF-1α bound Zp via this HRE (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g007">7</xref>). Remarkably, 3-bp substitution mutations in this HRE were sufficient to eliminate HIF-1α-mediated reactivation in the context of the intact viral genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Thus, HIF-1α induces lytic EBV infection by sequence-specific binding to a single HRE located within Zp.</p>
<p>Consistent with HIF-1α playing roles in EBV’s natural life cycle, we showed that the stages during epithelial and B-cell differentiation during which HIF-1α and Blimp-1α are present correlate with the onset of lytic EBV infection (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g009">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g010">10</xref>). We also presented data from EBV-induced B-cell lymphomas and gastric cancer xenografts indicating that hypoxia increases the frequency of lytic EBV reactivation <italic>in vivo</italic> (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g011">11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g012">12</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006404.s003">S3</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006404.s005">S5</xref> Figs). Thus, HIF-1α likely also contributes to EBV-associated tumorigenesis given a small amount of lytic infection is known to enhance tumor growth (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref047">47</xref>]).</p>
<p>Lastly, we used several compounds that induce stabilization of HIF-αs to investigate how hypoxia triggers lytic EBV infection. We showed that incubation with deferoxamine, an FDA-approved drug with long-standing clinical uses, promoted accumulation of HIF-1α and lytic EBV antigens in EBV<sup>+</sup> cells of both epithelial and lymphocytic origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g001">Fig 1</xref>). A 24-h treatment with DFO was sufficient to induce high-level synthesis of early and late lytic EBV antigens by 48 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). L-mimosine, another iron-chelating drug, also efficiently induced synthesis of Zta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), but was not investigated further because its clinical use is restricted to topical applications due to toxicity. MLN4924, a drug currently in phase I/II clinical trials for a variety of cancers, induces EBV reactivation at least as well as DFO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Thus, we conclude that HIF-α-stabilizing drugs may have utility in lytic-induction therapy for treating patients with a variety of EBV-associated cancers.</p>
<sec id="sec015">
<title>HRE versus ZIIR elements of Zp</title>
<p>The HRE identified here overlaps the previously identified ZIIR element of Zp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref035">35</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Thus, one possibility was that binding of HIF-1α to this HRE activates transcription from Zp by displacing the yet-to-be-identified ZIIR repressor. Inconsistent with this hypothesis was our finding that mutations known to relieve ZIIR-mediated repression affected neither HIF-1α- nor HIF-2α-induced activation of transcription from Zp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>, respectively) unless they also impinged upon the HRE element (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006404.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, HRE mutations that abolished HIF-α-induced reactivation of EBV had no effect on the frequency of spontaneous reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g008">Fig 8</xref>), a frequency enhanced in ZIIR mutant variants of EBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref035">35</xref>]. Thus, we conclude that the HRE and ZIIR elements are genetically distinguishable, independently acting regulatory elements of Zp, with HIF-α proteins functioning as transcriptional activators via binding to the HRE.</p>

<title>HIF-1α versus HIF-2α</title>
<p>The sequence encompassing the HRE present in the promoter of KSHV’s latent gene, <italic>ORF73</italic> [encoding latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA)], is identical to that of the EBV Zp HRE we identified here, with both HREs being responsive to both major HIF-α isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref048">48</xref>] (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g008">8</xref>). However, HIF-1α was the predominant HIF-α expressed at the RNA level in all of the EBV<sup>+</sup> primary tumors and cell lines we have examined to date. Consistent with this finding, the gastric cancer-derived cell lines, SNU-719 and AGS-Akata, were the only ones in which we detected HIF-2α protein upon incubation with DFO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Previous reports of others likewise indicated preferential accumulation of HIF-1α protein with exposure to hypoxia in EBV<sup>+</sup> LCLs that contain little HIF-2α mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref049">49</xref>] and in EBV<sup>+</sup> NPC-derived cell lines that contain some HIF-2α mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref050">50</xref>]. Thus, we conclude that HIF-1α is the primary HIF-α of physiological relevance to EBV’s natural life cycle and in EBV<sup>+</sup> tumors.</p>

<sec id="sec017">
<title>Role of HIF-1α in EBV’s natural life cycle and tumorigenesis</title>
<p>Much literature exists indicating HIF-1α plays central roles in regulating both lytic infection and tumorigenesis by KSHV (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref023">23</xref>]). Functional HREs are present within the promoter regions of KSHV’s latent gene, <italic>ORF73/LANA</italic>, as well as its IE lytic gene, <italic>ORF50/RTA</italic>, and lytic <italic>ORF34-ORF37</italic> gene cluster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref051">51</xref>]. HIF-1α complexes with LANA to activate <italic>ORF50</italic> gene expression during hypoxia, inducing lytic KSHV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref033">33</xref>], yet a SUMOylated form of LANA inhibits HIF-1α induction of RTA synthesis to maintain latency during normoxia while still enabling HIF-1α to promote angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref052">52</xref>].</p>
<p>As with KSHV, the relationship between EBV’s latent gene products and HIF-1α is also complex. EBNA3A and EBNA-LP bind PHDs, blocking their catalytic activity and, thereby, inhibiting oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF-1α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref053">53</xref>]. LMP1 promotes accumulation of HIF-1α by signaling PHD1 and PHD2 degradation pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref055">55</xref>]. EBNA3A stabilizes HIF-1α via protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref053">53</xref>], a complex somewhat analogous to the LANA/HIF-1α complex. However, these above-mentioned EBV-encoded proteins are clearly not necessary for HIF-1α-induced activation of <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene expression given we showed here that HIF-1α can induce transcription from Zp in EBV-negative cells and Zta synthesis in EBV<sup>+</sup> Sal cells that are in a Wp-restricted latency in which these proteins are not expressed. In latency types in which these above-mentioned proteins stabilize HIF-1α, other factors are likely also present in the cells to inhibit HIF-1α from inducing lytic reactivation. EBNA1, present in all EBV<sup>+</sup> cells, also has been reported to enhance HIF-1α activity, most likely indirectly via its effects on AP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref056">56</xref>].</p>
<p>We propose that HIF-1α plays central roles in regulating both lytic replication and tumorigenesis by EBV. Regarding EBV’s natural life cycle, we hypothesize that B cells from the naïve B-cell through memory B-cell stages lack functional HIF-α activity as well as Blimp-1α and XBP-1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g009">Fig 9</xref>) (other known inducers of <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene expression), while containing several known direct or indirect repressors of this gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref043">43</xref>] and inhibitors of Zta activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref058">58</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g013">Fig 13</xref>). Thus, EBV infection tends to go latent. However, if an EBV-infected B cell begins to undergo plasma cell differentiation, the virus may reactivate due to the appearance of functionally active HIF-1α along with these other activators and loss of these repressors. Likewise, when epithelial cells differentiate, they accumulate HIF-αs along with Blimp-1α and KLF4 (known inducers of <italic>BRLF1</italic> as well as <italic>BZFL1</italic> gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref045">45</xref>]) and lose repressors of these genes such as the ZEBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g013">Fig 13</xref>). Thus, when EBV virion particles or EBV-infected B cells come into close contact with differentiated epithelial cells within the oral cavity, the introduction of EBV genomes into these cells can lead to lytic replication and production of infectious virus, helping to spread the virus from cell-to-cell and host-to-host.</p>

<p>How might HIF-1α and the Zp HRE contribute to tumorigenesis by EBV <italic>in vivo</italic>? We propose that HIF-αs contribute via two routes to tumor growth in EBV<sup>+</sup> cancers. As is true of most tumors, EBV<sup>+</sup> tumors develop hypoxic regions as they enlarge (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g011">Fig 11C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006404.s003">S3A Fig</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref059">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref061">61</xref>]), leading to accumulation of the HIF-αs whose genes are being expressed. These HIF-αs then activate expression of a variety of cellular genes involved in angiogenesis and anaerobic metabolism that help the tumor to continue to enlarge (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref062">62</xref>]). In the case of EBV<sup>+</sup> tumors, presence of HIF-α also contributes to activation of <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene expression, leading to EBV lytic-gene expression in some tumor cells. We showed here by examining EBV-induced lymphomas and EBV<sup>+</sup> gastric cancer xenografts that Zta<sup>+</sup> cells were preferentially located in regions of the tumors that were clearly hypoxic as indicated by Hypoxyprobe staining or, presumably, hypoxic because they were located distal to blood vessels (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g011">11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006404.s003">S3</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006404.s005">S5</xref> Figs). Thus, we propose the following model: Hypoxic regions develop in EBV<sup>+</sup> tumors as they grow in size, leading to accumulation of HIF-1α and, in some cases, HIF-2α. Prior to angiogenesis, HIF-α increases the frequency of lytic EBV infection in these hypoxic regions, with these lytic-infected cells secreting a variety of cellular and viral factors, some of which contribute to the enhancement of tumor growth (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref047">47</xref>]).</p>

<title>HIF-1α and oncolytic therapy</title>
<p>The goal of chemotherapy is to kill cancer cells while minimizing harm to healthy cells. Treatment of some EBV<sup>+</sup> cancers with minimally toxic drugs that rapidly and efficiently induce EBV lytic-gene expression, in combination with prodrugs such as ganciclovir (GCV), may be one way to achieve this goal ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref063">63</xref>] and references cited therein). Based upon the findings presented here, we propose that briefly targeting the PHDs or other enzymes that regulate degradation of HIF-1α (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., NAE) may be useful as part of a strategy to achieve efficient EBV lytic-induction therapy. Transient expression of HIF-1α induced sufficient Zta synthesis to promote expression of EBV early- and late-lytic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Furthermore, these expressed early-lytic genes included <italic>BGLF4</italic> [as indicated by the presence of phosphorylated forms of EAD (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g008">8</xref>)], the gene that encodes the EBV-PK that can phosphorylate GCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref064">64</xref>]. Intrinsic features of EBV and HIF-1α make this strategy feasible: (i) Once <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene expression is activated by an inducer, Zta synthesis usually continues after the inducer is removed because of its positive feedback loop with Rta (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g001">Fig 1C</xref>); and (ii) The HIF-αs are rapidly degraded once HIF-α-stabilizing drugs are removed (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006404.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Thus, brief treatment with a stabilizer of HIF-1α may well be sufficient, reducing potential adverse reactions due to off-target effects of the drug and HIF-1α. Quite likely, one may be able to increase considerably the percentage of the EBV<sup>+</sup> cells reactivated by using DFO, MLN4924, or another HIF-1α stabilizer in combination with other drugs known to activate <italic>BZLF1</italic> gene expression via different cellular signaling pathways (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., HDAC inhibitors).</p>
<p>We were fortunate to identify here an already FDA-approved drug as a possible candidate for use in lytic-induction therapy.

<p>For IFS of cells grown in culture, cells were seeded onto cover slips placed within 10-cm dishes, incubated in medium with or without the indicated concentration of DFO for 24 h, and fixed by incubation with cold methanol:acetone (1:1) for 10 min immediately after washing with cold PBS containing DFO or after incubation in medium without DFO for the indicated additional times. Non-specific antibody binding was blocked by incubation with Blotto [5% casein, 5% donkey serum (Sigma)] for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were probed for Zta protein by incubation at 4°C overnight with mouse anti-BZLF1 antibody (1:300 in Blotto, #sc-53904; Santa Cruz) followed by incubation for 2 h at room temperature with secondary antibody conjugated to a fluorescent dye (1:500, donkey anti-mouse IgG with Alexa Fluor 488, #37114; Invitrogen). After washing, DNA was stained by incubation with 4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:2,000), for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were stained likewise for HIF-1α by primary incubation with rabbit anti-HIF-1α antibody (1:500, #GTX127309; GeneTex) followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 647 anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500, #A32733; Molecular Probes).</p>
<p>Frozen M81 and SNU-719 tumor sections (8 μm and 10 μm, respectively) were fixed for IFS in cold acetone (for Hypoxyprobe and Zta co-stain) or -20°C methanol (for EBNA2, Zta, and CD31 co-stains), and blocked in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% goat serum (EBNA2 co-stain with CD31), 5% casein, 5% donkey serum (Zta co-stain with Hypoxyprobe), or 5% casein, 5% goat serum (Zta co-stain with CD31). Sections were then incubated in the indicated primary antibody overnight. The antibodies used were as follows: anti-Zta primary (1:100, BZ1; Santa Cruz) or anti-EBNA2 primary (1:50, #ab90543; Abcam), followed by goat anti-mouse IgG with Alexa Fluor 488 (1:250, #A11001; Invitrogen); anti-CD31/PECAM1 primary (1:50, #ab28364; Abcam) followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG with Alexa Fluor 594 (1:500, #A11012; Invitrogen); and Hypoxyprobe primary (1:50, #PAb2627AP; Hypoxyprobe, Inc.) followed by donkey anti-rabbit with Alexa Fluor 594 (1:500, #A21207; Invitrogen). Images were taken and distance measurements were determined with a Zeiss AxioImager M2 microscope and Axiovision Software version 4.8.2.</p>
<p>For the IHC studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006404.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006404.s005">S5</xref> Figs), the cells and M81-induced lymphomas were fixed immediately after harvest, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, deparaffinized, the antigens retrieved by incubation with 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 20 min at 98°C, and processed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref078">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref079">79</xref>]. Sections were probed for the indicated proteins using the following antibodies: CD20 (1:600, clone H1; BD Biosciences); EBNA2 (1:100, PE2; Leica Microsystems); and Zta (1:200, BZ1; Santa Cruz).</p>

<title>Transient transfections</title>
<p>For reporter assays, 293T cells maintained in 24-well plates were co-transfected using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus Corp.) with (i) 45 ng pHA-HIF-1α P402A/P564A-pcDNA3 plus 45 ng pHIF-1β or 45 ng of each of their parental expression plasmids as controls, and (ii) 200 ng of the indicated luciferase reporter plasmid. Cells were harvested 24-to-48 h later, lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was determined according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All assays were performed in triplicate on three or more occasions. For all other assays, expression plasmids were transfected into the indicated cells using TransIT-LT1 and the amounts of DNA indicated followed by incubation at 37°C for the times indicated prior to harvesting and processing as indicated in each figure legend.</p>

<title>Knockdown of HIF-1α</title>
<p>AGS-Akata cells maintained in 10-cm dishes were transiently transfected when approximately 60% confluent using TransIT-LT1 with 0.8 μg each of five pLKO.1-based lentiviral vector DNAs encoding shRNAs that target HIF-1α (plasmids #3808, #3809, #3810, #3811, and #10819; Thermo Scientific). As controls, cells were transfected with 4 μg of pLKO.1 expressing the non-targeting shRNA 1864 (cntl. #1, #1864; Addgene) or NT (cntl. #2, #SHC002; Sigma-Aldrich). Two days later, cells were incubated with 200 μM DFO for 24 h, harvested, lysed in SUMO buffer, and processed for immunoblot analysis.</p>
<p>To transduce Sal cells with these shRNA-encoding lentiviruses, the lentiviruses were first packaged into virions as described by Open Biosystems. 293T cells in 10-cm-diameter dishes were co-transfected with (i) 0.8 μg of the five individual shRNA lentiviral vectors targeting HIF-1α or 4 μg of non-targeting shRNA cntl. #1 lentiviral vector, (ii) 1.4 μg of pCMV-dR8.2 dvpr (#8455; Addgene), and (iii) 0.6 μg of a plasmid encoding vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) (gift from Bill Sugden). The medium containing the virus was harvested 72 h later, passed through 0.8-μm-pore-size filters, and used to infect the Sal cells subsequently processed as described above for AGS-Akata cells except that the DFO was added three days after infection with the lentiviruses.</p>

<title>Electrophoretic-mobility-shift assays</title>
<p>The protein source was nuclear extract prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref040">40</xref>] from AGS cells that had been incubated with 200 μM CoCl<sub>2</sub> for 24 h. The probe was the 5’-end-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide, 5’- AAACGCAAGC<underline>CGCACGTC</underline>TCACAGATCC-3’ (underlined sequence indicates consensus HRE). Reactions were performed with 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.1 M KCl, 6 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 μg poly(dI-dC):(dI-dC), 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT, 8% Ficoll in a final volume of 20 μl. For immunoshift EMSAs, 10–100 μg of protein extract was pre-incubated in the reaction buffer for 20 min at 4°C with 1 μg anti-HIF-1α polyclonal antibody (#ab103063, Abcam) prior to addition of the radiolabeled probe and incubation at room temperature for 15 min. For competition EMSAs, unlabeled, competitor double-stranded oligonucleotides were pre-incubated likewise with the reaction mixture prior to addition of the radiolabeled probe. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis at 200 V for 2 h at 4°C in a non-denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel with 0.5X Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) as the running buffer. Gels were dried and imaged on a STORM 840 phosphorimager (GE Healthcare).</p>

<title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays</title>
<p>Chip assays were performed essentially as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref040">40</xref>] using approximately 2 x 10<sup>7</sup> SNU-719 and Sal cells grown in 15-cm dishes. Cells were incubated for 24 h with 200 μM DFO (+) or PBS (-) in medium as indicated. Protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked by incubation with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was quenched by addition of glycine to 0.125 M. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and snap frozen until lysed. Following lysis, nuclei were isolated by centrifugation, and chromatin was sheared by sonication to approximately 500-bp size. After centrifugation to pellet debris, chromatin was divided into aliquots incubated overnight at 4°C with 2 μg of mouse anti-HIF-1α (#ab8366; Abcam) or anti-IgG (#sc-2025; Santa Cruz) antibody as a negative control. Antibody-conjugated protein-DNA complexes were precipitated by addition of protein A Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz), the immunoprecipitates were eluted, and the cross-links were reversed. The resulting DNAs were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kits (Qiagen) and analyzed by qPCR using iTaq universal SYBR green supermix (Biorad) and the Applied Biosystems prism real-time PCR system with the following primer pairs: BZLF1: <italic>FWD</italic>, 5′-GGCTGTCTATTTTTGACACCAGC-3′, and <italic>REV</italic>, 5-AAGGTGCAATGTTTAGTGAGTTACC -3′; and 4.8-kbps upstream of Zp transcription initiation site (negative control); <italic>FWD</italic>, 5′-AGAAGGGAGACACATCTG-3′, and <italic>REV</italic>, 5′-AACTTGGACGTTTTTGGG-3’. A standard curve was generated from the threshold cycle (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>T</italic></sub>) of the input DNA diluted to 5%, 1%, and 0.2% with distilled water containing 100 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA (Ambion), with percent input bound calculated relative to this standard curve.

<title>Construction of EBV mutant genomes</title>
<p>The 3-bp substitution mutations, HRE mt2 and HRE mt4, were introduced into the Zp HRE element in the EBV-containing BAC p2089 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref036">36</xref>] by two-step, phage λ Red-mediated recombination essentially as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref080">80</xref>]. In brief, the I-SceI-Kan cassette present in pEPkan-S2 was PCR-amplified using the following primer pairs: HRE mt2: <italic>FWD</italic> 5’- <underline>AGGCATTGCTAATGTACCTCATAGACACACCTAAATTTAG</underline><bold><italic>gct</italic></bold><underline>GTCCCAAACCATGACATCACTAGGGATAACAGGGTAATCGATTT</underline>-3’ and <italic>REV</italic> 5’-<underline>CCAAGGCACCAGCCTCCTCTGTGATGTCATGGTTTGGGAC</underline><bold><italic>agc</italic></bold><underline>CTAAATTTAGGTGTGTCTATGCCAGTGTTACAACCAATTAACC</underline>-3’; HRE mt4: <italic>FWD</italic> 5’-<underline>AGGCATTGCTAATGTACCTCATAGACACACCTAAATTTAG</underline><bold><italic>att</italic></bold><underline>GTCCCAAACCATGACATCACTAGGGATAACAGGGTAATCGATTT</underline>-3’ and <italic>REV</italic> 5’-<underline>CCAAGGCACCAGCCTCCTCTGTGATGTCATGGTTTGGGAC</underline><bold><italic>aat</italic></bold><underline>CTAAATTTAGGTGTGTCTATGCCAGTGTTACAACCAATTAA</underline>-3’. The Zp sequence in these primers is underlined, with the base substitutions indicated in bold italicized small letters. These PCR products were electroporated into <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain GS1783 into which BAC p2089 had been previously introduced, and inserted into p2089 by homologous recombination. Induction of the I-SceI activity encoded by GS1783 led to cleavage at the unique SceI site within the BAC. Intra-molecular recombination between the two copies of Zp resulted in precise removal of the inserted pEPkan-2 sequences, leaving behind one copy of Zp. Clones containing the desired HRE mutant BACs were initially identified by PCR screening and, subsequently, by DNA sequence analysis of the Zp and Zta-coding regions of the BAC. The mutant variants of p2089 were then thoroughly checked for absence of large deletions, insertions and rearrangements by analysis of multiple restriction enzyme fragment patterns as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref081">81</xref>] and for extraneous base-pair substitution mutations by high throughput sequence analysis as described below after recovery of the DNAs from mutant-infected 293T cell lines.</p>

By 3-to-4 weeks post-transfection, all of the colonies of cells were GFP-positive. These clones were picked, grown up, and stored in liquid nitrogen.

<title>Sequence analysis of EBV HRE mutants</title>
<p>We recovered the BAC DNAs from the HRE mutant-infected 293T cell lines by Hirt extraction as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref043">43</xref>] and introduced them into <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain GS500 by electroporation. Two independent colonies obtained from each of the two mutant BACs were grown, and the BAC DNAs were isolated by alkaline lysis as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref043">43</xref>]. After purification through two cycles of centrifugation in CsCl<sub>2</sub>, the highly purified BAC DNAs were sequenced using an Ion Torrent PGM (Life Technologies). We aligned the sequencing reads to the B95.8 reference strain of EBV (V01555) with Bowtie2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref082">82</xref>] using default alignment parameters and removing non-aligned reads. The resulting alignments were sorted using Samtools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref083">83</xref>]. The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) Unified Genotyper (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/article?id=6201" xlink:type="simple">https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/article?id=6201</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref084">84</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref086">86</xref>] was used to detect genetic variations compared to the EBV reference. Since regions of repetitive DNA produce incorrect alignments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref087">87</xref>] which can manifest in downstream analyses as apparent mutations, we further investigated called mutations which occurred in the repetitive regions of the EBV genome (TRs, FRs, IR2, and IR3). A program termed EasyVariant was written and used to parse each alignment and its CIGAR string [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006404.ref083">83</xref>] that allowed both position-specific coverage depth to be calculated and percentage of each of the four nucleotides to be called at each position. Any position in which 50% or more reads indicated a mutation was treated as valid unless it occurred in a repeat region where it was likely due to an incorrect alignment. We achieved sequence coverage depth of 15 or more reads over 93% and 97% of the unique regions of the genome for HRE mt2 and mt4, respectively. The expected mutations in the HRE (mt2 and mt4) were called as such in 100% of sequence reads, and the consensus base calls within the unique regions of the genome matched the reference genome. We also performed conventional Sanger sequencing at four locations where some reads (but still less than 50%) indicated a possible frameshift mutation; in each of these cases, no mutation was found.</p>
