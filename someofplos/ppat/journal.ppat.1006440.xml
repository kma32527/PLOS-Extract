<abstract>
<p><italic>Streptococcus gallolyticus</italic> subsp. <italic>gallolyticus</italic> (<italic>Sg</italic>) has long been known to have a strong association with colorectal cancer (CRC). This knowledge has important clinical implications, and yet little is known about the role of <italic>Sg</italic> in the development of CRC. Here we demonstrate that <italic>Sg</italic> promotes human colon cancer cell proliferation in a manner that depends on cell context, bacterial growth phase and direct contact between bacteria and colon cancer cells. In addition, we observed increased level of β-catenin, c-Myc and PCNA in colon cancer cells following incubation with <italic>Sg</italic>. Knockdown or inhibition of β-catenin abolished the effect of <italic>Sg</italic>. Furthermore, mice administered with <italic>Sg</italic> had significantly more tumors, higher tumor burden and dysplasia grade, and increased cell proliferation and β-catenin staining in colonic crypts compared to mice receiving control bacteria. Finally, we showed that <italic>Sg</italic> is present in the majority of CRC patients and is preferentially associated with tumor compared to normal tissues obtained from CRC patients. These results taken together establish for the first time a tumor-promoting role of <italic>Sg</italic> that involves specific bacterial and host factors and have important clinical implications.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death. The recognition that microbial agents can contribute to the development of CRC raises hope for improving CRC diagnosis and treatment by incorporating both microbial and patient characteristics into clinical strategies. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>gallolyticus</italic> subsp. <italic>gallolyticus</italic> (<italic>Sg</italic>) has been implicated in CRC for decades. Patients with <italic>Sg</italic> infections display a much higher risk of having CRC compared to the general population. Despite this, the precise role of <italic>Sg</italic> in the development of CRC—<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., whether this organism plays an active role in the development of tumor or its presence is merely a consequence of the tumor environment being favorable for its colonization of the colon—was unknown. Here using <italic>in vitro</italic> cell cultures and mouse models of CRC, we demonstrate that <italic>Sg</italic> actively promotes colon cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth, suggesting that it is not an innocent “passenger”. These results represent a major step forward in understanding the relationship between <italic>Sg</italic> and CRC. This combined with the prevalence of <italic>Sg</italic> in CRC patients highlight <italic>Sg</italic> as being both clinically relevant and functionally important for CRC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second to third most common cancer and a leading cause of cancer-related death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref002">2</xref>]. The human gut is normally exposed to ~ 10<sup>14</sup> microorganisms, which are increasingly recognized as being intimately involved in the health and disease status of the gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref003">3</xref>]. The identification of specific microbes driving colon tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref009">9</xref>] raises hope that we may exploit knowledge about specific tumor-promoting microbes to improve cancer diagnosis, prevention and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Streptococcus gallolyticus</italic> subsp. <italic>gallolyticus</italic> (<italic>Sg</italic>) belongs to the <italic>Streptococcus bovis</italic>/<italic>Streptococcus equinus</italic> complex (SBSEC) and was previously known as <italic>S</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> biotype I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref017">17</xref>]. This is a Gram-positive, opportunistic pathogen that causes bacteremia and endocarditis in humans. Patients with bacteremia/endocarditis due to <italic>Sg</italic> display a strong association with CRC as shown in numerous case reports and case series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref029">29</xref>]. A meta-analysis of case reports and case series published between 1970 and 2010 found that patients with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> infections had ~60% chance of having concomitant colon adenomas/carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref030">30</xref>], much higher than that in the general population. The SBSEC group includes a number of closely related species such as <italic>Sg</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>pasteurianus</italic>, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>macedonicus</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>infantarius</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref031">31</xref>]. Among these different species, <italic>Sg</italic> infection has the strongest association with CRC (~ 7 fold higher risk compared to infections caused by the other species), suggesting the existence of a <italic>Sg</italic>-specific mechanism(s) that promotes the association between the pathogen and CRC. Other similar studies consistently revealed elevated risks of colorectal adenoma/carcinoma for patients with <italic>Sg</italic> infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref032">32</xref>]. These epidemiological studies clearly show a strong association between <italic>Sg</italic> bacteremia/endocarditis and CRC. Due to the overwhelming clinical association, it is recommended that patients with <italic>Sg</italic> infections undergo thorough colon examination. In addition, recent prospective studies followed patients with endocarditis due to <italic>Sg</italic> or other pathogens for several years and found that a significantly higher percentage of <italic>Sg</italic> endocarditis patients developed new colonic neoplasm during the follow-up period, compared to patients with endocarditis caused by other pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref034">34</xref>]. This suggests that <italic>Sg</italic> plays a role in the early stages of tumor development. On the other hand, CRC patients may be colonized with <italic>Sg</italic> in their colon with no signs of bacteremia or endocarditis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref036">36</xref>], although the prevalence of <italic>Sg</italic> in CRC patients is not as well defined as the risk for CRC in patients with active <italic>Sg</italic> infections.</p>
<p>Despite a strong clinical association between <italic>Sg</italic> and CRC, the role of <italic>Sg</italic> in CRC development, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. whether it drives colon tumorigenesis or merely colonizes the colon tumor environment, was unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of <italic>Sg</italic> on colon tumor development using <italic>in vitro</italic> cultured human colon cancer cells and mouse models of CRC. We demonstrated that <italic>Sg</italic> promoted colon cancer cell proliferation in a manner that depends on the specific cell context, bacterial growth phase, and direct contact between bacteria and colon cancer cells. In addition, we showed that <italic>Sg</italic> promoted cell proliferation by up-regulating β-catenin, a central signaling molecule in colon tumorigenesis. Exposure to <italic>Sg</italic> also resulted in larger tumors in a xenograft model. In an azoxymethane (AOM)-induced mouse model of CRC, mice given <italic>Sg</italic> had significantly higher tumor burden, higher average dysplasia grade, increased cell proliferation and β-catenin level in colon crypts compared to control mice. Lastly, we analyzed tumors and adjacent normal tissues from CRC patients. The results indicate that <italic>Sg</italic> is present in the majority of CRC patients and preferentially associates with tumor tissues. These results demonstrate a tumor-promoting role of <italic>Sg</italic> and have important implications with respect to microbial contributions to CRC as well as clinical practices to combat CRC.</p>

<title><italic>Sg</italic> promotes colon cancer cell proliferation</title>
<p>The overall effect of <italic>Sg</italic> on cell growth and proliferation was examined using a variety of cell lines. Human colon cancer cell lines HCT116, HT29, LoVo, SW480, SW1116, normal human colon epithelial cell lines FHC and CCD 841 CoN, human kidney epithelial cell HEK293 and human lung cancer cell line A549 were co-cultured with <italic>Sg</italic> strains TX20005 and TX20030, and <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> MG1363 (used as a negative control bacterial strain). The number of viable cells was counted after 24 and 48 hours of incubation. We found that, in the presence of the <italic>Sg</italic> strains, HCT116, HT29 and LoVo had significantly more viable cells than colon cancer cells cultured in the presence of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic> or no bacteria (~ 50–60% more at 24 hours and ~ 20–30% more at 48 hours) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006440.g001">Fig 1A–1C</xref>). Interestingly, we did not observe any increase in cell numbers for the other cell lines tested including SW480, SW1116, A549, HEK293, CCD841 CoN, and FHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006440.g001">Fig 1D–1I</xref>).

<p>The increased number of viable cells after co-culture with <italic>Sg</italic> could be due to increased proliferation, reduced apoptosis, or both.

<p>Bacterial growth under co-culture conditions were determined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006440.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). There was no significant difference in the growth curve between the different strains as analyzed by ANOVA. TX20026 showed virtually the same growth curve as TX20005. For TX20012, TX20027 and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic>, the bacterial counts were lower than TX20005 at 6 hours. However, there was no significant difference in the bacterial counts between these strains and TX20005 after 6 hours.</p>
<p>In the co-culture experiments described above, the bacteria added to the wells were from stationary phase cultures. We examined the effect of exponential phase cultures of TX20005, TX20030 and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic> on HT29 and HCT116 cells. In contrast to stationary phase bacteria, exponential phase TX20005 or TX20030 did not cause any significant increase in HT29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006440.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) or HCT116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006440.g003">Fig 3E</xref>) cell numbers at 24 hours compared to the no bacteria controls. Thus, the results suggest that the ability of <italic>Sg</italic> to promote cell proliferation is growth phase-dependent.</p>
<p>We next examined whether secreted bacterial factors or bacterial metabolites in the culture supernatant were sufficient to promote colon cancer cell growth. Supernatants from stationary phase cultures of TX20005, TX20030 and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> were collected and filtered to remove any residual bacteria. HT29 and HCT116 cells were cultured in media only or media supplemented with the culture supernatants. Bacterial culture supernatants were insufficient to promote cell proliferation in HT29 and HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006440.s006">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>). The inability of <italic>Sg</italic> culture supernatants to stimulate host cell proliferation could be due to the possibility that the proliferation-promoting effect of <italic>Sg</italic> required bacteria to directly contact host cells. It could also be due to that the factors/metabolites in the culture supernatants were unstable and required a continuous presence of live bacteria in the culture. To distinguish these two possibilities, we used a transwell system in which bacteria were cultured in inserts with permeable membranes of 0.4 μm pore size. This pore size allows the passage of secreted bacterial factors and metabolites but not bacteria. Culturing <italic>Sg</italic> bacteria in transwells resulted in a complete loss of the proliferation-promoting effect of TX20005 on both HT29 and HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006440.g003">Fig 3C and 3F</xref>). HT29 cells were also incubated with either heat-killed bacteria or bacterial lysates, prepared from stationary phase culture. We did not observe any increase in the cell number compared to the control group under either treatment conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006440.s007">S7 Fig</xref>), suggesting that live bacteria are necessary to produce the observed effect on proliferation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006440.g001">Fig 1</xref>.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that the proliferation-promoting effect of <italic>Sg</italic> is dependent on <italic>Sg</italic>-specific factors, bacterial growth phase and direct contact between live bacteria and responsive cells.</p>

<title>Adherence of <italic>Sg</italic> to both responsive and unresponsive cells</title>
<p>Since direct contact between bacteria and cancer cells is required to promote cell proliferation, we investigated the ability of <italic>Sg</italic> to adhere to responsive and unresponsive cell lines. The results showed that both TX20005 and TX20030 adhered to HCT116, HT29, and A549 cells at a similar level (~ 20% of the initial inoculum) and slightly higher to SW1116 and SW480 (~ 30% of the initial inoculum). Adherence to CCD 841 CoN colonic epithelial cells was significantly lower than to the colon cancer cell lines (~15% of the initial inoculum) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006440.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). The ability of <italic>Sg</italic> strains to invade these cells was also investigated using gentamicin protection assay. Hardly any intracellular bacteria were detected, suggesting that the two <italic>Sg</italic> strains are poorly or non-invasive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006440.s008">S8B Fig</xref>). We further investigated the adherence ability of stationary and exponential phase TX20005 and TX20030. Exponential phase TX20005 and TX20030 adhered to HCT116 cells significantly less than stationary phase bacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006440.s008">S8C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Together these results suggest that the ability of <italic>Sg</italic> to adhere to responsive cells is also growth phase-dependent, consistent with the growth phase-dependency observed in cell proliferation assays. On the other hand, <italic>Sg</italic> strains are able to adhere to unresponsive cells as well as to responsive cells, suggesting there may be multiple interactions between <italic>Sg</italic> and different cell lines.</p>

We examined the level of nuclear β-catenin.

To further confirm this, we used a β-catenin responsive transcription (CRT) inhibitor iCRT3, which disrupts β-catenin-TCF4 interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref042">42</xref>].

We next examined the effect of TX20005 on the level of c-Myc and PCNA in the presence of iCRT3.

To determine if β-catenin knockdown or iCRT3 treatment affected bacterial adherence to HT29 cells, we performed adherence assays.

<p>H&amp;E stained colon sections were evaluated. Colons from <italic>Sg</italic>-treated mice showed a significantly higher average dysplasia grade compared to those from <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic>-treated or saline control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006440.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Adenocarcinomas were observed in <italic>Sg</italic>-treated mice but not in the control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006440.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). We next examined cell proliferation and apoptosis in mouse colonic crypt cells. <italic>Sg</italic>-treated mice had a significantly higher percentage of proliferating cells (BrdU<sup>+</sup>) in the colonic crypts compared to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis-</italic> or saline-treated control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006440.g007">Fig 7D and 7E</xref>). In addition, <italic>Sg</italic>-treated mice had higher levels of β-catenin in the colon epithelium as compared to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic>-treated or saline controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006440.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). In contrast, we did not observe any significant difference in the percentage of apoptotic cells between the different treatment groups as determined by TUNEL assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006440.g007">Fig 7G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006440.s012">S12 Fig</xref>). These results are consistent with the observations from our <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture assays.</p>
<p>Inflammation in the colon of mice was also scored. Both <italic>Sg</italic>- and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic>-treated groups displayed significantly higher average inflammation scores compared to the saline group. However, overall inflammation in these groups was mild and there was no apparent difference between the <italic>Sg</italic>- and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic>-treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006440.g007">Fig 7H</xref>). We further measured the level of cytokines TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, IL23 and Cox-2 in tumor and normal tissues collected from the mouse colon using RT-qPCR. There was no significant difference between TX20005 and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic> treated groups in any of the cytokines tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006440.s013">S13 Fig</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>Sg</italic> and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic> trigger similar inflammatory responses.</p>
<p>We further tested the effect of <italic>Sg</italic> on tumor development using a different shorter procedure, in which mice were treated with four doses of AOM and gavaged with bacteria for 12 weeks. Similar to the results from the first longer procedure, a significant increase in tumor numbers was observed in <italic>Sg</italic>-treated mice compared to the saline control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006440.s014">S14A Fig</xref>). When compared to the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic> group, mice gavaged with TX20005 also had more tumors; however, the difference was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.08). Tumor burden also displayed a similar trend as that observed in the longer procedure, in which <italic>Sg</italic>-treated mice had a higher average tumor burden than the other two groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006440.s014">S14B Fig</xref>). In the shorter procedure, however, the difference was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.06 vs. <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic>-treated mice) perhaps due to reduced duration, less bacterial gavage or more AOM injections in this second procedure. Overall, results from the two procedures show a consistent trend pointing towards <italic>Sg</italic> acting as a promotional agent for tumor development in the mouse colon.</p>
<p>To determine whether the abundance of TX20005 in the colon correlates with tumor number or burden in the mice, we collected fecal material from mice at the end of the 12-week gavage experiment. Relative abundance of <italic>Sg</italic> was determined by qPCR using <italic>Sg</italic> specific primers. We observed positive and statistically significant correlations between the relative abundance of TX20005, tumor number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006440.g008">Fig 8A</xref>, Pearson’s r = 0.77, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), and tumor burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006440.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, Pearson’s r = 0.60, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02), respectively. We further stained colon sections from mice treated with <italic>Sg</italic> or saline with anti-<italic>Sg</italic> antiserum. The antiserum was tested against strains of closely related species in SBSEC, as well as <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic>. The antiserum specifically recognized <italic>Sg</italic> but not the other strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006440.s015">S15 Fig</xref>). In colon sections, we observed positive staining in <italic>Sg</italic>-treated mice but not in the saline control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006440.g008">Fig 8C and 8D</xref>), further indicating that the antiserum was specific. <italic>Sg</italic> bacteria were found within tumor tissues. The presence of <italic>Sg</italic> around normal-looking crypts was observed only occasionally, suggesting a preferential association of <italic>Sg</italic> with tumor tissues. Taken together, the results described above suggest that <italic>Sg</italic> promotes colon tumor development in the AOM-induced mouse model of CRC and this promotion involves up-regulation of β-catenin and increased colonic crypt cell proliferation.</p>

<title><italic>S</italic>. <italic>gallolyticus</italic> is present in the majority of CRC patients and preferentially associates with tumor tissues</title>
<p>While the association between patients with bacteremia/endocarditis caused by <italic>Sg</italic> and CRC is well documented, this population only represents a small proportion of CRC patients. Previous studies indicated that CRC patients might be “silently” infected with <italic>Sg</italic> in their colon with no symptoms of bacteremia or endocarditis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref036">36</xref>]. However, the prevalence of <italic>Sg</italic> in CRC patients has not been extensively studied. We analyzed 148 tumors and 128 adjacent matched normal tissues from CRC patients by qPCR using <italic>Sg</italic>-specific primers. Overall, we found that ~74% of tumor tissues and ~47% of the normal tissues were positive for <italic>Sg</italic> (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, tumor vs. normal, Fisher’s exact test), suggesting that <italic>Sg</italic> is present in the majority of CRC patients and preferentially associates with tumor tissues. We further divided the positive samples into those with relatively high or low abundance of <italic>Sg</italic>. More tumor tissues were highly enriched with <italic>Sg</italic> (26%) than normal tissues (9%) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0025, Fisher’s exact test), indicating a higher bacterial abundance in the tumor tissues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006440.t001">Table 1</xref>). <italic>Streptococcus pasterianus</italic> (<italic>Sp</italic>), previously <italic>S</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> biotype II, is closely related to <italic>Sg</italic> however; patients with bacteremia or endocarditis due to <italic>Sp</italic> did not display a strong association to CRC as that reported for <italic>Sg</italic> in epidemiological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref044">44</xref>]. The prevalence of <italic>Sp</italic> in CRC patients with no signs of bacteremia or endocarditis is unknown. We examined a small subset of randomly selected tumor and matched normal tissues using <italic>Sp</italic>-specific primers. The results showed that only 11% of tumor tissues (n = 27) and 7% of normal tissues (n = 27) were <italic>Sp</italic> positive, significantly lower than that of <italic>Sg</italic> (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Fisher’s exact test) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006440.t002">Table 2</xref>). Thus the high prevalence in CRC patients is observed for <italic>Sg</italic> but not for a closely related organism. Taken together, these results suggest that <italic>Sg</italic> is present in the majority of CRC patients and preferentially associates with tumor tissues.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CRC is the second to third most common cancer and a leading cause of cancer death in the world. Annually, over a million people are diagnosed with CRC and ~700,000 die due to CRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref045">45</xref>]. In recent years, the role of microbial agents in the development of CRC has gained increasing recognition, raising hope that we may be able to exploit the knowledge on how microbes modulate the development of CRC to improve CRC diagnosis, prevention and treatment. To achieve this goal, a clear understanding of how precisely microbes exert their influence on tumor development is important. <italic>Sg</italic> infections have long been known to display a strong association with CRC, and yet virtually nothing was known about the nature of this association—<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., whether this organism plays an active role in tumor development or its presence is merely a consequence of the tumor environment being favorable for its colonization—was unknown. The results described in this study demonstrate a tumor-promoting role of <italic>Sg</italic> that is dependent on cell context, specific bacterial factors, direct contact with colon cancer cells, and β-catenin signaling. We further show that <italic>Sg</italic> is present in the majority of CRC patients and preferentially associates with tumor tissues. Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of <italic>Sg</italic> in the development of CRC that extends far beyond previous recognitions.</p>
<p>That <italic>Sg</italic> promotes cell proliferation in responsive cells is based on the following results. Responsive cells co-cutlured with <italic>Sg</italic> had significantly higher number of viable cells, higher percentage of cells in S phase, higher level of PCNA, β-catenin (both total and nuclear), c-Myc and cyclin D1, compared to cells cultured in media only or with negative control bacteria. <italic>Sg</italic> did not affect the level of β-catenin or c-Myc in unresponsive cells. In addition, <italic>Sg</italic> did not affect cell apoptosis, as shown by a lack of sigficannt difference in annexin V staining or the level of cleaved caspase 3 between cells co-cultured with <italic>Sg</italic> and those with media only or with negative control bacteria.</p>
<p>Our results also provide evidence indicating that β-catenin is functionally important for <italic>Sg</italic> stimulated cell proliferation. Knockdown of β-catenin in responsive cells by two independent shRNA abolished <italic>Sg</italic>’s effect on cell proliferation. Treatment of cells with a β-catenin inhibitor iCRT3, which blocks the interaction between β-catenin and its partner transcriptional factor, also abolished <italic>Sg</italic>’s effect on cell proliferation, c-Myc and PCNA. Thus, <italic>Sg</italic> promotes the proliferation of responsive cells in a β-catenin dependent manner. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway regulates cell proliferation and cell fate. Dysregulation of this pathway plays a central role in the development of CRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref046">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref050">50</xref>]. It is highly pertinent, therefore, that <italic>Sg</italic> also targets this critical pathway. The upstream events leading to the activation of β-catenin signaling upon exposure to <italic>Sg</italic> are unknown and are the focus of on-going studies in our laboratory. Studies on other tumor-promoting bacteria indicate that diverse strategies are used to influence β-catenin signaling. For example, <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> modulates β-catenin signaling by binding to E-cadherin through its FadA adhesin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref005">5</xref>]. <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic> secretes a zinc-dependent metalloprotease toxin that cleaves E-cadherin, leading to nuclear translocation of β-catenin, increased c-Myc expression and cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref051">51</xref>]. <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, which is an important cause for gastric cancer, activates β-catenin signaling in multiple ways including affecting the expression of Wnt ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref052">52</xref>], activating Wnt receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref053">53</xref>], suppressing GSK3β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref055">55</xref>], interfering with β-catenin/TCF4 complex by downregulating the gastric tumor suppressor <italic>Runx3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref056">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref058">58</xref>], and interacting with E-cadherin to disrupt the E-cadherin/β-catenin complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref059">59</xref>]. In addition, there have been numerous studies in recent years linking microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation to CRC (recent reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref060">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref064">64</xref>]). Evidence suggests that microbes (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>, <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic>, and human papillomavirus (HPV)) can regulate β-catenin signaling and cell proliferation by affecting certain miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref065">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref067">67</xref>]. However, <italic>Sg</italic> does not appear to encode any homologs to any bacterial factor known to modulate β-catenin or cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref068">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref071">71</xref>], suggesting the involvement of a potentially novel mechanism.</p>
<p>The observation that some colon cancer cell lines (SW480 and SW1116) as well as a lung cancer cell line A549 are not responsive to the effect of <italic>Sg</italic> suggests that <italic>Sg</italic> functions by engaging host factors specific to the responsive cells. All five of the colon cancer cell lines we tested contain mutations in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway; HT29, LoVo, SW480 and SW1116 have mutations in APC whereas HCT116 contains a mutated version of β-catenin that results in increased protein stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref072">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref073">73</xref>]. <italic>Sg</italic> further increases β-catenin level in HT29, HCT116, and LoVo, but not in SW480 and SW1116 cells. It is possible that <italic>Sg</italic> up-regulates β-catenin at a more upstream level or by affecting factors outside the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The fact that TX20005 adheres to unresponsive colon cancer cells as well as, or even better than, responsive cells suggests that the differential effects of <italic>Sg</italic> on responsive and unresponsive cells are not due to differences in the amount of bacteria adhering to these cells. Rather, whether or how the signal is transduced from the cell surface where <italic>Sg</italic> is attached is likely to be responsible for the difference. It is also possible that <italic>Sg</italic> adheres to different receptors on responsive and unresponsive cells. Overall, our results suggest that the effect of <italic>Sg</italic> depends on specific cell context. This implies that not everyone colonized by <italic>Sg</italic> may be equally affected; some individuals with certain genetic or epigenetic makeup may be more susceptible to the tumor-promoting effect of <italic>Sg</italic> than others. Identifying host factors that render cells responsive to <italic>Sg</italic> will be important.</p>
<p>The observation that bacterial species closely related to <italic>Sg</italic> failed to stimulate cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> suggests the involvement of <italic>Sg</italic>-specific factors in this process. This finding is consistent with previous clinical observations that among the closely related species in the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> group, <italic>Sg</italic> displays a particularly strong association with CRC. Our results also suggest that direct contact between <italic>Sg</italic> and responsive cells is required for <italic>Sg</italic>’s effect on cell proliferation. We observed that <italic>Sg</italic> culture supernatants or <italic>Sg</italic> cultured in transwell inserts were unable to stimulate cell proliferation. Furthermore, heat-killed <italic>Sg</italic> or <italic>Sg</italic> lysates had no effect on the proliferation of responsive cells. These results suggest that direct contact or close proximity of live <italic>Sg</italic> to host target cells is required for its stimulation of cell proliferation. We do need to point out that with respect to the requirement of live <italic>Sg</italic>, we cannot exclude the possibility that the relevant <italic>Sg</italic> factor(s) is inactivated during the heating or bacterial lysis process. The results also show that both adherence to responsive cells and promotion of cell proliferation by <italic>Sg</italic> depend on bacterial growth phase. Taken together, these results suggest several possibilities. Firstly, it is possible that adherence and promotion of cell proliferation is mediated by the same <italic>Sg</italic> surface factor(s) up-regulated in bacterial stationary phase. Secondly, it is possible that adherence brings <italic>Sg</italic> close to the surface of responsive cells. Subsequent actions by other <italic>Sg</italic> surface or secreted factors then promote cell proliferation. A third possibility is that adherence of <italic>Sg</italic> to responsive cells results in the up-regulation or activation of other <italic>Sg</italic> surface or secreted factors, which in turn stimulate cell proliferation. Studies are on-going to identify <italic>Sg</italic> factors involved in cell adherence and stimulation of cell proliferation. It was reported previously that an <italic>Sg</italic> mutant deficient of the Pil3 pilus was significantly impaired in the ability to adhere to mucus-producing cells and to colonize mouse distal colon compared to a Pil3 overexpressing <italic>Sg</italic> variant strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref074">74</xref>]. The Pil3 pilus has been shown to bind intestinal mucins and fibrinogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref075">75</xref>]. <italic>Sg</italic> also expresses a collagen binding protein Acb that mediates binding to collagen I, IV and V [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref070">70</xref>]. The genome of <italic>Sg</italic> encodes proteins with homology to fibrinogen/fibronectin binding proteins and major cell surface adhesion <italic>pac</italic>, as well as additional pilus operons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref068">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref069">69</xref>]. These surface proteins can potentially play a role in <italic>Sg</italic> adherence to host target cells and/or colonization of the mouse colon.</p>
<p>The results from mouse models suggest that <italic>Sg</italic> promotes tumor development. <italic>Sg</italic>-treated responsive cells developed larger tumors in a mouse xenograft model than cells treated with control bacteria <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic>. Higher levels of β-catenin, c-Myc and PCNA were also observed in <italic>Sg</italic>-treated xenografts compared to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic>-treated ones. In the AOM CRC model, mice treated with <italic>Sg</italic> had more tumors and higher tumor burden compared to <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic> or saline-treated mice. This was confirmed using two different experimental procedures. In addition, <italic>Sg</italic>-treated mice had a higher percentage of proliferating cells and stronger β-catenin staining in colonic crypts compared to the control mice. Apoptosis in colon epithelial cells of <italic>Sg</italic>-treated mice was similar to that in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic>-treated mice. These findings are consistent with the results from cell culture assays. Furthermore, we observed a significant and positive correlation between <italic>Sg</italic> bacterial burden in the mouse colon and tumor number and burden, respectively, suggesting a dose effect. Finally, <italic>Sg</italic> bacteria were detected within tumor tissues from the AOM CRC model and were seen directly associated with tumor tissues from CRC patients. These results are consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> finding and suggest that <italic>Sg</italic> promotes tumor development by adhering to or in close proximity with tumor.</p>
<p>The observation that <italic>Sg</italic> and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic> induced similar levels of inflammatory responses suggests that <italic>Sg</italic>-induced immune responses may not play a major role in <italic>Sg</italic>-mediated tumor promotion. However, this does not exclude the possibility that <italic>Sg</italic> may induce specific types of immune reactions that favor tumor development or <italic>Sg</italic>’s promotion of tumor development requires a certain component of the immune system. In addition, the role of microbiota in <italic>Sg</italic>-mediated tumor promotion remains unclear. The results here suggest a direct effect of <italic>Sg</italic> on colon epithelial cells. However, whether <italic>Sg</italic> functions in concert with other microbial agents in the gut or elicits specific responses when mixed with certain other microbes is unknown. It is also unclear whether <italic>Sg</italic> plays a role in tumor initiation, since all mice were treated with AOM. Further studies are needed to clarify these issues. Overall, the results presented here support a model in which <italic>Sg</italic> actively promotes colon tumor growth. This promotion appears to involve up-regulation of β-catenin by <italic>Sg</italic>, resulting in increased cell proliferation.</p>
<p>Previous epidemiology studies have primarily focused on CRC risks for patients with bacteremia/endocarditis due to <italic>Sg</italic>. These patients only constitute a small proportion of CRC patients. Limited information was available on the prevalence of <italic>Sg</italic> in CRC patients with no signs of infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref036">36</xref>]. Abdulamir <italic>et al</italic>. studied 52 CRC patients without symptoms of bacteremia and found that approximately 33% of tumors and 23% of matched normal colon tissues were <italic>Sg</italic>-positive when a conventional PCR method was used for the detection of <italic>Sg</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref036">36</xref>]. A recent study investigated the presence of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> group organisms in the colonic suction fluid from individuals who underwent colonoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref035">35</xref>]. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> was isolated from each of the 17 patients diagnosed with malignant tumors. However, it was not clear if the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> isolates were <italic>Sg</italic> or other species within the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> group. Here we analyzed 148 tumor and 128 matched adjacent normal tissues from CRC patients and showed that ~ 74% of CRC patients were <italic>Sg</italic> positive and that <italic>Sg</italic> preferentially associates with tumor tissues. The difference in <italic>Sg</italic> prevalence between this study and others could be due to the different detection methods used, patient characteristics and/or the fact that samples were collected from different geographical regions (Malaysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref036">36</xref>], Israel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref035">35</xref>], and United States (this study), respectively). Despite the difference, these studies appear to have a common theme–<italic>Sg</italic> is present in a much larger proportion of CRC patients than previously recognized and preferentially associates with tumor tissues. More extensive epidemiology studies are needed to further define the prevalence of <italic>Sg</italic> in CRC patients and its correlation with clinical, pathological and molecular characteristics of CRC. Overall, the results taken together indicate that a large proportion of CRC patients are “silently” infected with <italic>Sg</italic>. This information combined with our finding that <italic>Sg</italic> actively promotes tumor growth further highlights the clinical importance of this organism.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> or <italic>Sg</italic> was isolated from fecal cultures in approximately 10% of healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref036">36</xref>]. The factors that affect <italic>Sg</italic> abundance in healthy individuals are unclear. It is plausible that host factors, gut microbiome composition and antibiotics usage can all have an impact. The prevalence of <italic>Sg</italic> in healthy individuals is lower than that in CRC patients. It was found that metabolites produced by colon cancer cells facilitate <italic>Sg</italic> outgrowth, resulting in a significant growth advantage of <italic>Sg</italic> over other bacteria in a simulated colon tumor microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref076">76</xref>]. This could be a possible explanation for the higher prevalence of <italic>Sg</italic> in CRC patients. It is also possible that as tumors develop in the colon, changes in the inflammatory status and microbiome composition creates a colon environment that favors <italic>Sg</italic> survival and growth. Altered expression of surface proteins on tumor cells may also facilitate <italic>Sg</italic> adherence to the cells and colonization of the colon tissue.</p>
<p>In summary, this is the first report demonstrating a tumor-promoting role of <italic>Sg</italic>. The findings here have important clinical implications. Going forward, identifying the <italic>Sg</italic> factor(s) responsible for promoting cell proliferation and tumor development, and host factors targeted by <italic>Sg</italic>, will be critical for understanding how <italic>Sg</italic> functions as a tumor-promoting agent and for developing optimized strategies based on both bacterial and host characteristics to better diagnose and treat CRC.</p>

<p>Cells were seeded onto the wells of 6-well plates at 1x10<sup>4</sup> cells per well and incubated for 12 hours. Exponential or stationery phase bacteria were washed with sterile phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS), resuspended in the appropriate cell culture media, added to the wells at 1x10<sup>2</sup> cfu/well, and incubated for 24 or 48 hours. Antibiotic trimethoprim was added at 50 μg/ml final concentration after 24 hours of incubation to prevent media acidification due to bacterial growth. Trimethoprim is generally bacteriostatic for Gram-positive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref077">77</xref>]. We have also confirmed that at the concentration we used, trimethoprim is bacteriostatic and does not kill <italic>Sg</italic>. Cells were detached by trypsin treatment, stained with trypan blue and counted in a Cellometer<sup>®</sup> Mini automated cell counter (Nexcelome Biosciences, Lawrence, MA). Transwell experiments were performed as described above except that bacteria were cultured in Transwell inserts (Corning) with 0.4 μm pore size, which allows the passage of secreted factors and soluble metabolites but not bacteria. Each experiment was performed in duplicate and repeated at least three times. Treatment of cells with iCRT3 was based on a protocol previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006440.ref078">78</xref>]. Briefly, 25 μM of iCRT3 (Sigma) was added to the cells 1 hour before the addition of bacteria. Fresh inhibitor was added every 4 hours subsequently until the end of the experiment. iCRT3 has no effect on the growth of <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic> or <italic>Sg</italic>. To determine the effect of bacterial culture supernatants, stationary phase cultures grown in BHI were centrifuged and supernatants collected and filtered through a 0.2 μm filter to remove residual bacteria. 0.5 ml of a supernatant was added to each well in a 6-well culture plate.</p>
<p>To prepared heat killed bacteria, bacterial cells from stationary phase were incubated at 95°C for 30 mins.

Methcarn-fixed paraffin embedded colon sections (5 μm) from mice treated with two weekly injections of AOM and 24 weeks of oral gavage with bacteria were used to detect <italic>Sg</italic>. Human colon tissue sections were obtained from US Biomax. Briefly, sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated in an ethanol gradient. The slides were incubated in a citrate buffer at 95°C for 15 min, cooled to room temperature (RT), rinsed with PBS and incubated in blocking buffer (PBS containing 1% Saponin and 20% BSA) for 30 min. The slides were then incubated with rabbit anti-<italic>Sg</italic> serum (1:250 dilution) at 4°C overnight, washed with PBS, and incubated with donkey-anti-rabbit Alexa 594 (1:500 dilution in PBS) for 1 hr at RT. The slides were washed again, stained with DAPI, mounted and examined in a DeltaVision Elite microscope (GE Healthcare).</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Comparisons of multiple groups were done by two-tailed one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) test. Comparison between two groups of data was done by unpaired, two-tailed t test. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to determine the correlation between <italic>Sg</italic> burden and tumor number and burden, respectively. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the qPCR data from human tissues. Analyses were carried out using the Graphpad Prism 6 software.</p>
