<abstract>
<p><italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic>) is an anaerobic gram-positive pathogen that is the leading cause of nosocomial bacterial infection globally. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> infection (CDI) typically occurs after ingestion of infectious spores by a patient that has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. While CDI is a toxin-mediated disease, transmission and pathogenesis are dependent on the ability to produce viable spores. These spores must become metabolically active (germinate) in order to cause disease. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> spore germination occurs when spores encounter bile salts and other co-germinants within the small intestine, however, the germination signaling cascade is unclear. Here we describe a signaling role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> spore germination and provide direct evidence that intestinal Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordinates with bile salts to stimulate germination. Endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> (released from within the spore) and a putative AAA+ ATPase, encoded by <italic>Cd630_32980</italic>, are both essential for taurocholate-glycine induced germination in the absence of exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, environmental Ca<sup>2+</sup> replaces glycine as a co-germinant and circumvents the need for endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes. <italic>Cd630_32980</italic> is dispensable for colonization in a murine model of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> infection and <italic>ex vivo</italic> germination in mouse ileal contents. Calcium-depletion of the ileal contents prevented mutant spore germination and reduced WT spore germination by 90%, indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> present within the gastrointestinal tract plays a critical role in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination, colonization, and pathogenesis. These data provide a biological mechanism that may explain why individuals with inefficient intestinal calcium absorption (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., vitamin D deficiency, proton pump inhibitor use) are more prone to CDI and suggest that modulating free intestinal calcium is a potential strategy to curb the incidence of CDI.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic>) is a prominent pathogen in hospitals worldwide and the leading cause of nosocomial diarrhea. Numerous risk factors are associated with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> infections (CDIs) including: antibiotics, advanced age, vitamin D deficiency, and proton pump inhibitors. Antibiotic use disrupts the intestinal microbiota allowing for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> to colonize, however, why these other risk factors increase CDI incidence is unclear. Notably, deficient intestinal calcium absorption (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., increased calcium levels) is associated with these risk factors. In this work, we investigate the role of calcium in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> spore germination. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> spores are the infectious particles and they must become metabolically active (germinate) to cause disease. Here, we show that calcium is required for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination, specifically activating the key step of cortex hydrolysis, and that this calcium can be derived from either within the spore or the environment. We also demonstrate that intestinal calcium is required for efficient spore germination <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting that intestinal concentrations of other co-germinants are insufficient to induce <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination. Collectively, these data provide a mechanism that explains the strong clinical correlations between increased intestinal calcium levels and risk of CDI.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The anaerobic spore-forming pathogen <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic>) is the leading cause of infectious nosocomial diarrhea, with 500,000 infections and 29,000 deaths in the U.S. annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref001">1</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> infection (CDI) typically occurs after antibiotic therapy disrupts the indigenous gut microbiota, allowing <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> colonization. Symptoms of CDI include diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, and toxic megacolon. Two <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> toxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (Tcd) are the primary cause of these pathologies causing epithelial cell death and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref002">2</xref>]. While CDI symptoms are toxin-mediated, transmission and initiation of disease depend on the production of viable, metabolically dormant spores. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> spores have a dehydrated core that contains cytoplasmic macromolecules (e.g. DNA, ribosomes) and 0.8-1M calcium-dipicolinic acid (Ca-DPA), which is biosynthesized during sporulation and required for the heat resistance of bacterial spores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref004">4</xref>]. The spore core is surrounded by an inner membrane, a thick cortex of modified peptidoglycan, an outer membrane, a proteinaceous coat, and an outermost exosporium layer of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref005">5</xref>]. Collectively, these layers protect spores from harsh environmental conditions such as acidic pH, extreme temperature, and desiccation.</p>
<p>Bacterial spores become metabolically active, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., germinate, upon sensing specific small molecules, called germinants, in the environment. In the related <italic>Bacillus spp</italic>., spores contain numerous well-characterized germinant receptors on the inner membrane. These receptors interact with combinations of germinants including nucleotides and amino acids to initiate germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref006">6</xref>]. This process has been extensively studied in <italic>Bacillus</italic>, however, all sequenced <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> genomes lack the germinant receptors found in other spore-forming bacteria suggesting that the mechanism of germination in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> is unique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref007">7</xref>]. It is known that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germinates in response to co-germinants that include a combination of amino acids and bile salts; glycine and taurocholate (Tc) are the most efficient germinant combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref009">9</xref>]. It has been shown that Tc binds to CspC during germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref011">11</xref>], however, the receptors involved in the recognition of glycine or other amino acids have not been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>In <italic>Bacillus spp</italic>., germinant-receptor interactions induce slight hydration of the core causing a rapid release of monovalent cations (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref013">13</xref>], followed by the release of Ca-DPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref014">14</xref>], and subsequent activation of cortex lytic enzymes (CLEs). CLEs degrade the cortex, initiating full core hydration and outgrowth of the vegetative bacteria. In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic>, SleC is the sole CLE that is essential for germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref015">15</xref>]. It is expressed as a zymogen that is activated by the subtilisin-like protease, CspB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref017">17</xref>]. It is not known how CspC binding to Tc leads to the activation of CspB. CspC may directly interact with CspB, however, Tc-CspC interactions might also facilitate access of co-germinants to their receptors to initiate signaling to activate CspB. The mechanism by which co-germinants permeate the spore coat is not currently known, since the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> genome does not contain homologues to the GerP proteins that perform this function in <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref018">18</xref>]. Therefore, the signaling cascade leading to CspB activation is an important gap in the current knowledge of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination. In this work, we provide direct evidence that calcium ions are a germination signal to activate CspB and can be derived from either endogenous or exogenous sources. We demonstrate that intestinal calcium is a key molecule for efficient germination in a murine model. This study provides novel insight into the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways controlling <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination and a biological mechanism that may help explain why inefficient intestinal Ca<sup>2+</sup> absorption increases susceptibility to CDI.</p>

<title>Exogenous calcium circumvents the glycine requirement for efficient <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination</title>
<p>The germination signal leading to CspB activation and cortex hydrolysis by SleC is currently unknown. In <italic>Bacillus spp</italic>., Ca-DPA released from the core functions as the germination signal to activate cortex hydrolysis. The addition of exogenous Ca-DPA induces spore germination by direct activation of the CLE CwlJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref019">19</xref>], circumventing the need for germinants or germinant receptors. To determine if exogenous Ca-DPA can induce <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> spore germination, spores of three toxigenic <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> strains were incubated with 60mM Ca-DPA. While none germinated in Ca-DPA alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref020">20</xref>], all three strains germinated efficiently (measured by loss of OD<sub>600</sub>) in Ca-DPA supplemented with 0.2% Tc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g001">Fig 1A–1C</xref>). All three strains also germinated as expected in response to our positive control, Tc-Gly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g001">Fig 1D–1F</xref>). However, two recent studies have demonstrated that cortex hydrolysis occurs prior to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref021">21</xref>] or in the absence of DPA release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref022">22</xref>], indicating that DPA is not essential for CLE activation. This led to our hypothesis that calcium ions serve as a germination signal in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic>. To test this hypothesis, Cd630 spores were incubated with Tc and either CaCl<sub>2</sub>, DPA, or Ca-DPA. As before, Tc-CaDPA induced full germination of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> spores, however, Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub> also induced full germination of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> spores in the absence of exogenous DPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Additionally, Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub>-treated spores lost heat resistance properties of dormant spores and released internal stores of DPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g001">Fig 1I and 1J</xref>). In contrast, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>anthracis</italic> spores germinated as expected in response to Ca-DPA but were unable to germinate in response to CaCl<sub>2</sub> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). We hypothesized that exogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> (or Ca-DPA) initiates cortex hydrolysis through SleC activation. To test this hypothesis, SleC activation was determined by western blot following incubation of Cd630 spores in PBS plus Tc, glycine, Tc-Gly, CaCl<sub>2</sub>, Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub>, DPA, Ca-DPA, or Tc-CaDPA. While pro-SleC was present in all samples, activated SleC was only detected in samples incubated with Tc-Gly, Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub>, or Tc-CaDPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g001">Fig 1K</xref>). These results indicate that SleC activation requires both Tc and an additional signal (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. glycine, calcium, or exogenous Ca-DPA) and that calcium induces germination through SleC activation. Since exogenous Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub> induced germination in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic>, and spores have large stores of internal calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref023">23</xref>], these data suggest that calcium functions as a co-germinant, and can come from either exogenous or endogenous sources. Because both PBS only (untreated) and Tc only treated spores have identical germination phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g001">Fig 1D–1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g001">1I and 1K</xref>), Tc alone treatment was used as a negative control for remaining experiments.</p>

<title>Calcium released from <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> spores is essential for germination in the absence of environmental Ca<sup>2+</sup></title>
<p>Since exogenous calcium is sufficient to induce germination (in the presence of Tc), we sought to understand the role of endogenous calcium in this process. To determine if endogenous calcium is required for Tc-Gly induced germination, Cd630 spores were incubated with Tc, glycine, and the calcium-specific chelator EGTA. EGTA inhibited Tc-Gly induced germination at all concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), but was restored to wildtype levels with the addition of excess CaCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). These data show that endogenous calcium is essential for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination in the presence of the co-germinants, Tc-Gly. We hypothesize that calcium is functioning as an enzymatic cofactor for CspB and EGTA treatment will inhibit the activation of SleC. To test this hypothesis, Cd630 spores were incubated with Tc, Tc-Gly, or Tc-Gly-EGTA. As expected, no SleC processing was observed with Tc alone and SleC activation was observed in Tc-Gly treated spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). However, EGTA completely inhibited SleC activation. These data support the hypothesis that calcium is functioning as signal to activate CspB, possibly by functioning as an enzymatic cofactor.</p>

<p>Since EGTA treatment inhibited Tc-Gly germination at concentrations as low as 50 μM, we hypothesized that spores may have Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the spore coat/cortex layers. In order to test this hypothesis, we first chelex-treated Tc, glycine, and PBS to ensure there is no contaminating calcium, and then pretreated Cd630 spores with 1mM EGTA. These spores were washed 3 times with chelex-treated PBS and then incubated with chelex-treated Tc-Gly. EGTA pre-treated spores displayed ~20 min delay in germination as compared to untreated spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). These data suggest that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> spore outer layers contain small amounts of calcium (&lt;50 μM) that when removed, delay germination until enough calcium is released from the spore core to activate SleC.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that endogenous calcium is transported out of the spore core and initiates cortex hydrolysis through the actions of calcium-dependent enzymes. In order to test this hypothesis, Cd630 spores were incubated with either 1mM Phenamil, an ion channel inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref024">24</xref>], or 0.5mM Chlorpromazine (CPZ), an inhibitor of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-enzyme interactions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref025">25</xref>] and either Tc-Gly or Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Phenamil-inhibited Tc-Gly-induced germination (~60% reduction) but not Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub>-induced germination (&gt;95% germination) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006443.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). These data suggest that Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub> induces germination independent of endogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> while Tc-Gly-induced germination requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux from the core. CPZ delayed both Tc-Gly and Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub> induced germination with an overall reduction of 30–50% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006443.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), indicating that calcium-dependent enzyme activation is required for efficient <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination. While the concentrations of CPZ and Phenamil are similar to that of other known spore inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref024">24</xref>], we interpret these data cautiously given that they are higher than those used to inhibit eukaryotic cell targets. This difference in effective concentration could be due to low spore permeation.</p>

<title>Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub> induces germination through a similar pathway as Tc-Gly</title>
<p>Since Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub> induced germination through the activation of SleC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g001">Fig 1K</xref>), we hypothesized that this germinant combination signals through a similar pathway as Tc-Gly. To test this hypothesis, clean, unmarked deletions of genes essential for Tc-Gly-induced germination (<italic>cspC</italic>, <italic>cspB</italic>, <italic>gerS</italic>, <italic>sleC</italic>) were generated and germination kinetics were measured in response to Tc alone, Tc-Gly, or Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g003">Fig 3</xref>).

As expected, zymogen processing of SleC was detected in Cd630 spores incubated with 1% Tc and all concentrations of either glycine or CaCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). In contrast to a previous report (<italic>14</italic>), only minimal SleC activation was observed in Δ<italic>gerS</italic> spores incubated with either Tc-Gly or Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>).

<title>Cd630_32980 is required for Tc-Gly but not Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub> induced germination</title>
<p>Thus far we have shown that both Tc-Gly and Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub> induce germination through activation of SleC and that endogenous calcium transport is required for Tc-Gly germination but not Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub>. We next sought to identify the step in the germination pathway where these mechanisms diverge. <italic>Cd630_32980</italic> is a gene identified as being highly expressed during sporulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref026">26</xref>] and predicted to be essential for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> sporulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref027">27</xref>]. Our independent bioinformatics analysis of these data comparing the transposon depth of coverage of dormant spores to that of vegetative cells after germination suggested that this gene might also be essential for Tc-Gly germination. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a clean, unmarked deletion (Δ<italic>32980</italic>) and purified spores (albeit at a lower yield than Cd630). We next tested Δ<italic>32980</italic> spores for germination in 0.2% Tc with increasing concentrations of either glycine (0-50mM) or CaCl<sub>2</sub> (0-60mM). Cd630 spores germinated in a dose-dependent manner in response to Tc-Gly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) but Δ<italic>32980</italic> spores did not germinate, regardless of the glycine concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In contrast, Δ<italic>32980</italic> spores germinated in a dose-dependent manner in response to Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub>, albeit at somewhat lower efficiencies than Cd630 at calcium concentrations ≤30mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). Germination in Δ<italic>32980</italic> spores was restored by complementation of Cd630_32980 <italic>in trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006443.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Spores lacking Cd630_32980 exhibited minimal SleC activation in response to Tc-Gly, while retaining full Cd630 levels in response to Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). These results suggest that Cd630_32980 is vital for Tc-Gly induced germination but not Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p><italic>Cd630_32980</italic> expression occurs in the mother cell and is controlled by the sporulation sigma factor SigE. <italic>Cd630_32980</italic> encodes a AAA+ ATPase that is associated with a putative type-4 secretion system predicted to be essential for sporulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref027">27</xref>]. We hypothesized that Cd630_32980 may be involved in transport of nutrients (including DPA) from the mother cell, across the outer forespore membrane into the spore during sporulation. To test this hypothesis, we measured the total amount of DPA that had been packaged into mature spores using a terbium fluorescence assay following a 30-minute boiling step to release internal stores of DPA. Δ<italic>32980</italic> spores contained &lt;1% of the DPA content found in Cd630 spores but was rescued by expressing <italic>Cd630_32980 in trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006443.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). These data indicate that Cd630_32980 is essential for the proper packaging of DPA in the spore. In addition, these data may explain why spore yields were low, as spores low in DPA are less dense and do not pellet readily during spore purification in 50% histodenz (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">methods</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that Ca<sup>2+</sup> and DPA are packaged in a 1:1 ratio and spores with less DPA have less internal stores of calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref028">28</xref>]. To measure levels of calcium in mature spores we used a calcium colorimetric assay following a 30-minute boiling step to release internal stores of calcium. Δ<italic>32980</italic> spores contained ~5 μM calcium compared to ~250 μM calcium in either Cd630 or <italic>Cd630_32980</italic> complemented spores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006443.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).

<title>Calcium and glycine synergize with bile salts to induce <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination</title>
<p>Since Tc, glycine, and calcium are present within the host intestine we hypothesize that they function together to induce <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination. To test this hypothesis, we treated Cd630 spores with suboptimal concentrations of Tc (0.05%), glycine (5mM), or calcium (5mM). At these concentrations, Cd630 spores do not germinate in response to Tc-Gly or Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub>. However, they germinated (~30% drop in OD) in response to the combination of Tc, glycine, and calcium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006443.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), indicating that glycine and calcium can synergize to induce <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination in the presence of Tc. Because complex growth media (e.g., BHIS, etc.) are commonly used as a germination media, and they typically contain both amino acids and calcium, we hypothesized that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination in BHIS+Tc is due to the synergy between calcium and glycine. To test this hypothesis, we measured the concentration of calcium present in BHIS (0.4mM), calcium-depleted BHIS (CDP; 0mM), and calcium-replete BHIS (CRP; 1mM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006443.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) prior to measuring Cd630 or <italic>B</italic>. <italic>anthracis</italic> Sterne 34F<sub>2</sub> spore germination in each medium. Cd630 spores germinated in BHIS+Tc and CRP+Tc but did not germinate in CDP+Tc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006443.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). This indicates that the amino acid concentrations found in BHIS are insufficient for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination in the absence of calcium. In addition, the concentration of calcium in BHIS (0.4mM) is insufficient to induce germination on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) suggesting that germination in BHIS+Tc is due to calcium-glycine synergy. In contrast, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>anthracis</italic> spores germinated fully in both BHIS and CDP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006443.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). These data indicate that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination in BHIS is due to the combination of available amino acids and calcium while <italic>B</italic>. <italic>anthracis</italic> (which is not responsive to calcium, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g001">Fig 1H</xref>) germinates in response to amino acids and other nutrients available.

This indicates that calcium present in BHIS is sufficient to induce slight germination in a strain that is lacking DPA as also reported by Donney et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref022">22</xref>].

These data, in combination with our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, suggest that intestinal calcium plays a role in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination bypassing the requirement for glycine. To directly test if intestinal calcium plays a role in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> spore germination, ileal contents were collected from antibiotic-treated, non-infected mice, calcium was depleted, and <italic>ex vivo</italic> germination assays were performed. In mouse ileal contents, that were found to contain ~15mM calcium, 100% of both Cd630 and Δ<italic>32980</italic> spores germinated within one hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). However, when calcium levels were depleted using chelex resin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), only 10% of WT and no Δ<italic>32980</italic> spores germinated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Complete germination was restored through the addition of supplemental calcium (~15mM), for both Cd630 and Δ<italic>32980</italic> spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). These data indicate that calcium in the intestines is required for efficient <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> spore germination. Taken together, these data show that intestinal calcium is a key molecule involved in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination and imply that modulation of intestinal calcium represents a means to decrease germination, colonization, and pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The unconventional mechanism of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> spore germination has remained elusive due to the absence of known germinant receptor orthologues. In this work, we describe a central role for calcium ions in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination. Our data shows that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> spores germinate in response to a combination of bile salts and intestinal calcium. Amino acid concentrations within the mouse gastrointestinal tract are inadequate to support high levels of germination independent of intestinal calcium. This is the first report of intestinal calcium playing a vital role in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> spore germination. We also provide evidence that endogenous calcium ions released from the spore core in response to Tc-Gly can serve as a germination signal by activating cortex hydrolysis. The putative AAA+ ATPase encoded by <italic>Cd630_32980</italic> is essential for proper packaging of DPA during sporulation as well as germination in response to Tc-Gly (but not Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub>). Despite the lack of glycine-induced germination, Δ<italic>32980</italic> spores retain the ability to germinate in <italic>ex vivo</italic> ileal contents and colonize the mouse gastrointestinal tract to levels identical to that of Cd630. In calcium-depleted ileal contents, no mutant spores germinated and Cd630 spores had a 90% reduction in germination. Our data supports the hypothesis that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination <italic>in vivo</italic> occurs due to synergistic effects between bile salts, glycine, and calcium. The data presented here suggest that the role of glycine in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination is to facilitate calcium release from the spore core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g006">Fig 6</xref>) and that this mechanism can be circumvented with the addition of exogenous calcium. In short, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> spore germination requires calcium that can be provided by either environmental or endogenous sources. Collectively, these data suggest that restricting free intestinal calcium in susceptible patients is a potential prophylactic treatment to inhibit human CDI.</p>

<title>Proposed model for the role of calcium in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination.</title>
<p>Tc binds to CspC (A) facilitating movement of glycine or calcium through the spore coat and outer membrane (B). Glycine then interacts with an unknown receptor (C) inducing the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the spore core (D). Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the environment or the spore core activates CspB (E), which processes pro-SleC (F) subsequently initiating cortex hydrolysis (G). This leads to full core rehydration (H), complete release of DPA (I) and spore outgrowth.</p>

<p>While recent studies have begun to elucidate <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination, the mechanisms responsible for initiating these critical events are not completely understood. The subtilisin-like CspBAC family of proteases, a novel lipoprotein regulator GerS, and the cortex lytic enzyme SleC have been identified as key regulators in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref016">16</xref>]. Each of these proteins are essential for germination in response to Tc-Gly and, as described here, Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The identical role for these proteins in both germination mechanisms indicates that Tc-CaCl<sub>2</sub> triggers germination upstream of CspB and downstream of the unidentified glycine receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). In our proposed model, Tc binds to CspC, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) allowing environmental calcium and/or amino acids to penetrate the spore coat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). While there are two hypotheses for the function of CspC—directly activating CspB or facilitating germinant entry into the spore—we prefer the latter explanation but do not want to discount the possibility that CspC functions to activate CspB. Our data support the hypothesis that glycine interacts with an unknown receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g006">Fig 6C</xref>) and induces the release of calcium ions from the spore core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Calcium released from within the spore, and/or calcium from the environment, then activates the subtilisin protease, CspB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g006">Fig 6E</xref>), which induces SleC zymogen processing and activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). Activated SleC then hydrolyzes the spore cortex, leading to full-core rehydration, DPA release through SpoVA channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref022">22</xref>], and spore outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g006">Fig 6H and 6I</xref>).</p>
<p>Since exogenous CaCl<sub>2</sub> initiates cortex hydrolysis through CspB and SleC activation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g001">1K</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g003">3D</xref>), and EGTA treatment inhibits SleC activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), we hypothesize that calcium is a necessary cofactor for CspB activity. Calcium and the activity of calcium dependent enzymes are required for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination as demonstrated by EGTA calcium chelation and CPZ treatment studies (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g002">2A–2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006443.s002">S2C and S2D</xref>) demonstrating a requirement for calcium. EGTA pre-treatment and Phenamil treatment studies indicate that calcium efflux from the spore core is required for Tc-Gly induced germination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006443.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). Exogenous Tc-calcium induced germination at a maximal rate of 5.2% germination/min and the concentration of calcium required to reach half of the maximal germination rate is 12.6mM (extrapolated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref032">32</xref>] from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006443.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The concentration of exogenous calcium required to induce germination then is much higher than the concentration of EGTA (50 μM) needed to chelate endogenous calcium and inhibit Tc-Gly germination. This discrepancy could be partially explained by low permeability of the spore coat to exogenous calcium thus, greater concentrations of exogenous calcium are required. We also speculate that endogenous calcium, following release from the spore core, could participate in a positive feedback loop inducing release of more calcium until a threshold concentration is achieved and CspB is activated. Very low concentrations of EGTA could interrupt this positive feedback loop. These data support our model that calcium is vital for SleC activation and thus <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination.</p>
<p>Clinical and epidemiological studies have demonstrated a correlation between risk of CDI and patients who have defects in calcium absorption. For example, patients taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have an elevated risk of contracting CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref036">36</xref>]. PPIs are commonly prescribed to ICU patients for numerous reasons (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., peptic ulcer diseases, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, stress ulcer prophylaxis), many of these patients may also be on antibiotics. A known side effect of this treatment is decreased calcium absorption in the small intestine resulting in increased luminal concentrations of calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref038">38</xref>]. In light of our results, it is possible that elevated levels of intestinal Ca<sup>2+</sup> in these individuals allows for more efficient germination of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> in the small intestines and therefore increased risk of infection. Additionally, a potential correlation between age, dietary calcium, and CDI exists as elderly individuals exhibit decreased absorption of calcium and have a significantly higher incidence and severity of CDI. Finally, patients deficient in vitamin D, which is required for calcium absorption from the gut, are five times more likely to contract CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref040">40</xref>]. While the classical role of vitamin D is to facilitate calcium absorption in the small intestines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref042">42</xref>], it also plays a role in innate immunity and the regulation of mucosal immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref044">44</xref>]. A deficiency in vitamin D could increase the risk of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> colonization through elevated levels of available germinant (calcium) in the intestines and an inefficient immune response leading to severe disease.</p>
<p>The <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> germination mechanism presented here, together with clinical correlations regarding calcium absorption, suggests an exploitable target for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Decreasing intestinal calcium levels in at-risk patients (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., by vitamin D supplementation to improve calcium absorption, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006443.ref040">40</xref>]) represents a novel prophylactic approach for influencing establishment, outcome, or recurrence of CDIs. In contrast, increasing intestinal calcium levels during CDI treatment could facilitate germination of resident spores, rendering them susceptible to antibiotic treatment, and thus decreasing both spore dissemination and incidence of recurrent CDI. In light of our findings, future studies are warranted to determine the clinical benefits of modulating intestinal calcium levels to improve CDI outcomes.</p>
