<abstract>
<p>Eukaryotic cells respond to environmental stimuli when cell surface receptors are bound by environmental ligands. The binding initiates a signal transduction cascade that results in the appropriate intracellular responses. Studies have shown that endocytosis is critical for receptor internalization and signaling activation. In the rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, a non-canonical G-protein coupled receptor, Pth11, and membrane sensors MoMsb2 and MoSho1 are thought to function upstream of G-protein/cAMP signaling and the Pmk1 MAPK pathway to regulate appressorium formation and pathogenesis. However, little is known about how these receptors or sensors are internalized and transported into intracellular compartments. We found that the MoEnd3 protein is important for endocytic transport and that the Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> mutant exhibited defects in efficient internalization of Pth11 and MoSho1. The Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> mutant was also defective in Pmk1 phosphorylation, autophagy, appressorium formation and function. Intriguingly, restoring Pmk1 phosphorylation levels in Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> suppressed most of these defects. Moreover, we demonstrated that MoEnd3 is subject to regulation by MoArk1 through protein phosphorylation. We also found that MoEnd3 has additional functions in facilitating the secretion of effectors, including Avr-Pia and AvrPiz-t that suppress rice immunity. Taken together, our findings suggest that MoEnd3 plays a critical role in mediating receptor endocytosis that is critical for the signal transduction-regulated development and virulence of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>During the interaction between the rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> and the host, the pathogen employs a series of receptors and sensors at the plasma membrane to recognize host surface cues and to activate signal transduction pathways required for appressorium formation and pathogenicity. We found that MoEnd3-mediated endocytosis is responsible for internalization of non-canonical GPCR Pth11 and the sensor MoSho1 to endosomal compartments. This is important for activating the downstream Pmk1 MAPK pathway to control appressorium formation and penetration. MoEnd3 is regulated through phosphorylation by the actin-regulating kinase MoArk1. In addition, MoEnd3 has a role in establishing effector secretion required for suppressing rice immunity. Our studies provide evidence that endocytosis is required for normal signaling and virulence in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> produces an infectious structure called the appressorium that enables it to penetrate host plant cells and initiate infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref001">1</xref>]. During the interaction between the pathogen and the host, the fungus secretes numerous effectors into the host that suppress plant immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref005">5</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that G-protein/cAMP signaling is important in the perception of host surface cues by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and during invasion of host tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref007">7</xref>]. <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> contains three distinct Gα subunit proteins: MagA, MagB and MagC as well as a highly conserved cAMP-dependent signaling pathway, which consists of the adenylate cyclase Mac1, the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A Sum1, and the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A cPKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref008">8</xref>]. cPKA activation is responsible for appressorium differentiation. In addition, the non-canonical G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) Pth11 is known to function upstream of G-protein/cAMP signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref010">10</xref>]. Moreover, the MAP kinase cascade comprised of Mst11 (MAPKKK), Mst7 (MAPKK), and Pmk1 (MAPK) is also involved in the regulation of appressorium formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref011">11</xref>]. Furthermore, MoMsb2 and MoSho1 function as two upstream sensors of the MAP kinase cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref012">12</xref>]. Deletion of either <italic>MoMSB2</italic> or/and <italic>MoSHO1</italic> resulted in a significant reduction in appressorium formation. Intriguingly, the expression of a dominant active <italic>MST7</italic> allele partially suppressed the defects exhibited by the Δ<italic>Momsb2</italic> mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Recently, endosomal compartments were discovered to function as signaling platforms by anchoring the components of G-protein/cAMP signaling. The various signaling components then interact within the endosomal compartments for sustaining signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref013">13</xref>]. Endosomal compartments contain early and late endosomes. Proteins internalized from the cell surface target early endosomes to undergo a sorting process, by which they are either recycled back to the plasma membrane or sent to late endosomes for degradation. Previous studies have shown that disruption of phosphoinositide PI3P synthesis on the endosomal membrane or inhibition of the conversion of early endosomes into late endosomes by <italic>MoVPS39</italic> gene deletion disrupts the endosomal localization of Pth11, MagA, Mac1 proteins, and a regulator of G protein signaling MoRgs1 thereby leading to an inhibition in appressorium formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref013">13</xref>]. However, despite these important findings, the mechanism by which Pth11 or other receptors proteins enter intracellular compartments to activate signal transduction in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> is still unclear.</p>
<p>Endocytosis is a conserved intracellular transport process in which membrane proteins, lipids, or other macromolecules are transported to endosomal compartments. During endocytosis, endocytic proteins are recruited to endocytic sites and interact with actin cytoskeleton to drive vesicle maturation and scission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref014">14</xref>]. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the Eps15 homolog (EH) domain-containing proteins Pan1p and End3p are important members of endocytic proteins and depletion of Pan1p or End3p severely impairs endocytosis and actin organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref017">17</xref>]. When vesicles are mature, endocytic proteins and actin components simultaneously dissociate from the vesicle membrane, thereby promoting efficient endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref018">18</xref>]. The Ark1p/Prk1p actin-regulating kinases are implicated in this dissociation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref020">20</xref>]. Ark1p/Prk1p phosphorylates Pan1p and other proteins to promote their dissociation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref021">21</xref>]. Deletion of Ark1p and Prk1p results in aggregation of endocytic proteins and actin cytoskeleton in the cytoplasm, which prevents endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>We previously found that MoArk1 has conserved functions in regulating endocytosis and that MoArk1 is required for appressorium turgor generation and penetration in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>. This study suggested that endocytosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the rice blast fungus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref023">23</xref>]. Here we continued to investigate the mechanism that links MoArk1-regulated endocytosis to fungal pathogenesis. We identified a MoArk1-interacting protein MoEnd3 by mass spectrometry analysis and characterized its function. We found that MoEnd3 is an endocytic protein and mediates the endocytic transport of GPCR Pth11 and sensor MoSho1. This transport could trigger downstream Pmk1 phosphorylation for autophagy, appressorium formation and penetration. In addition, we identified that MoEnd3 function is regulated by MoArk1-dependent phosphorylation at Ser-222. Finally, we demonstrated that secretion of the MoEnd3-regulated effectors is directly linked to host immunity suppression.</p>

<title>Identification of MoEnd3 as a MoArk1-interacting protein</title>
<p>MoArk1 is an actin-regulating kinase homolog required for endocytosis, growth, development, and full virulence of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref023">23</xref>]. To explore the mechanism by which MoArk1 regulates these processes, we employed protein co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) to identify putative MoArk1-interacting proteins. By expressing the <italic>MoARK1</italic>:<italic>FLAG</italic> construct and using FLAG beads to isolate MoArk1:FLAG-interacting proteins followed by mass spectrometry analysis, we found several proteins potentially important for endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton, including homologues of the clathrin heavy chain, amylase-binding protein AbpA, Arp2/3 complex subunit proteins, endocytosis and cytoskeletal organization proteins, vesicular integral-membrane protein Vip36, and F-actin-capping proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006449.s011">S1 Table</xref>). Additional proteins co-precipitated with MoArk1 also include the dynamin-A homologue MoDnm1 that regulates peroxisomal and mitochondrial fission through interactions with MoFis1 and MoMdv1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>We identified MGG_06180.6 as an endocytic protein homolog to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> End3p (30% amino acid sequence identity) and characterized its function. To confirm the interaction between MoEnd3 and MoArk1, we employed the yeast two-hybrid assay that demonstrated the interaction.

In addition, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> protein binding and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays that further substantiated the MoEnd3 and MoArk1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>).

<p>To characterize MoEnd3 functions, a Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> mutant was obtained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006449.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) and characterized. No significant differences were observed between the Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> mutant and the wild-type Guy11 strain in colony diameter (on CM, MM, SDC and OM medium plates) or conidia production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006449.s012">S2 Table</xref>).

<p>To examine whether MoEnd3 is required for endocytosis, we stained the cells with the lipophilic dye FM4-64 and observed its internalization. After 1 min of staining, the dye appeared in the cytoplasm of hyphal tips in Guy11 and the complemented strain, but the dye remained at the plasma membrane of the Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

The fluorescence intensity of the dye was quantified using the ImageJ software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), and this quantification is consistent in suggesting that MoEnd3 is required for normal endocytosis.</p>

<title>MoEnd3 is involved in F-actin assembly</title>
<p>Since the End3 endocytic protein regulates endocytosis through the coordination of the F-actin assembly at endocytic sites in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref025">25</xref>], we examined whether <italic>MoEND3</italic> deletion impairs F-actin organization using the Lifeact:RFP marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref026">26</xref>]. A toroidal-shaped F-actin network could be observed in 80.4% of the mature appressoria produced by wild-type Guy11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). By comparison, Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> displayed an aberrant distribution of F-actin in 98.8% of appressoria, as demonstrated by a line-scan analysis. It is known that the actin patch that associates with plasma membrane corresponds to endocytic sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref027">27</xref>]. In the conidia of Guy11, a lot of punctae-like cortical actin patches were observed in the cytoplasm of conidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). However, aggregated, instead of punctae-like, actin structures were observed in nearly 96.3% of Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> conidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). In addition, many actin patches displayed polarized distributions at the hyphal tip regions of Guy11, whereas they were rarely seen at the hyphal tip region of Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>To further examine whether MoEnd3 is associated with F-actin, the MoEnd3:GFP fusion protein and Lifeact:RFP were co-expressed in the Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> mutant and localizations of the GFP and RFP fusion proteins were observed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. We found that MoEnd3:GFP co-localized with the F-actin network in appressoria after 6 and 12 h of incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). In conidia and the hyphal tips, MoEnd3:GFP patches were found at the plasma membrane and were co-localized with actin patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). However, we still observed some regions only showed MoEnd3:GFP or Lifeact:RFP, likely due to that End3 protein arrives endocytic sites or disassembles from there earlier than F-actin, as suggested in studies involving <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> End3p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref027">27</xref>].</p>

<p>We further observed translocation and degradation of glycogen and lipid required for turgor generation during conidia germination and appressoria development. Iodine solution and Nile red were used to stain the glycogen and lipid bodies, respectively. At 0 h, the glycogen and lipids were abundant in conidia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006449.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In Guy11, the glycogen and lipids were translocated from conidia to nascent appressoria and were rapidly degraded in conidia after 6 h. They were completely degraded in over 60% of conidia after 12 h and in 90% of the mature appressoria after 24 h. In Δ<italic>Moend3</italic>, the degradation of glycogen in conidia and its translocation to appressoria occurred more slowly, and this was coupled with the delayed appressorium formation. After 12 h, glycogen and lipids in conidia were not translocated or degraded. After 24 h, they remained in almost 50% of conidia. These results suggested that MoEnd3 is required for an efficient translocation and breakdown of glycogen and lipids.</p>
<p>To further test the role of MoEnd3 in pathogenesis, conidial suspensions were sprayed onto susceptible rice seedlings (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> cv. CO-39). After 7 days of inoculation, Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> produced significantly fewer lesions than control strains. The lesions produced by Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> were also smaller and less expansive, in contrast to the fully expanded necrotic lesions produced by Guy11 and the complemented strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Similar results were obtained in barley leaf infection assay after 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). To further validate the reduction in virulence of Δ<italic>Moend3</italic>, we performed penetration assays using detached barley leaf. By observing 100 appressoria for each strain at 24 hpi and classifying their invasive hyphae (IH) into 4 types (type 1, no hyphal penetration; type 2, IH with one or two branch; type 3, IH with at least three branch, but the IH are short and less extended; type 4, IH that has numerous branches and fully occupies a plant cell), we found that in Guy11 and the complemented strain, nearly 80% of appressoria were type 3, in contrast to that 52.3% were type 1 and 38.1% were type 2 in Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006449.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). In the penetration assays using rice tissues, 90.2% of appressoria of Guy11 and the complemented strain displayed extended IH growth, whereas less than 10% of Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> appressoria formed IH, which were arrested in individual rice cells and did not extend to neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). These results indicated that MoEnd3 is required for full virulence.</p>
<p>Pth11 is a non-canonical GPCR that functions upstream of the G-protein/cAMP pathway for surface sensing in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref009">9</xref>]. Once proper surface clues were sensed by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>, Pth11 and cAMP signaling components, such as MagA and MoRgs1, are anchored on the endosomal compartments to sustain the transduction of cAMP signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref013">13</xref>]. In addition, membrane sensors MoMsb2 and MoSho1 are responsible for recognition of surface signals and activation of the downstream MAPK cascade consisting of Mst11-Mst7-Pmk1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref012">12</xref>]. Both the cAMP pathway and the Pmk1-MAPK cascade are known to regulate appressorium formation and penetration.</p>
<p>In mammalian cells, endocytosis transports membrane receptors or sensors to endosomes so that these receptors and sensors interact with signaling proteins to activate and amplify signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref029">29</xref>]. We examined whether Pth11, MoMsb2, and MoSho1 are transported by endocytosis. We expressed Pth11:GFP, MoMsb2:GFP, and MoSho1:GFP in Guy11 and observed their co-localization with FM4-64 in germ tubes following conidia incubation on hydrophobic surfaces for 3 h. This stage is crucial for pathogen to sense surface clues and initiate appressorium development. We observed that signal of Pth11:GFP and MoSho1:GFP, but not MoMsb2:GFP, was primarily accumulated in regions also labeled by FM4-64 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g004">Fig 4A, 4B and 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>Rab5 GTPase and Rab7 GTPase are known to bind with early endosomes and late endosomes, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref030">30</xref>]. To determine whether FM4-64 stained regions in germ tubes are endosomes or vacuoles, co-localizations of FM4-64 with GFP:Rab5 or GFP:Rab7 and vacuole marker CMAC were observed in germ tubes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006449.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). We found that most of FM4-64 was localized to GFP:Rab5 labeled regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006449.s005">S5A Fig</xref>) and rarely co-localized with GFP:Rab7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006449.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). In addition, CMAC-marked vacuoles did not appear in the germ tubes but only in the conidia. These observations revealed that internalized FM4-64 localizations in germ tube are likely to be early endosomes. Considering our finding that Pth11:GFP and MoSho1:GFP were co-localized with FM4-64, we proposed that most of Pth11 and MoSho1 are localized to early endosomes of the germ tubes.</p>
<p>To further demonstrate that Pth11 and MoSho1 are internalized by endocytosis, we used actin inhibitor Latrunculin B (LatB) that inhibits endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref014">14</xref>] and determined the effect of LatB on Pth11 and MoSho1. We found that LatB inhibited Pth11:GFP and MoSho1:GFP internalization and enriched them at plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). In addition, exposure to Lat B for 30 min resulted in 91.5% of germinated conidia being unable to form appressorium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g004">Fig 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>Next we determined the role of MoEnd3 in endocytosis of Pth11:GFP and MoSho1:GFP. We found that most of the Pth11:GFP and MoSho1:GFP signals remained at the plasma membrane of the germ tubes in Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g004">Fig 4G and 4H</xref>), and this pattern is similar to that of Pth11:GFP and MoSho1:GFP in Guy11 treated with LatB. We further compared Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> and Guy11 in the endocytosis rate of Pth11 and MoSho1 by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), a technique that measures the mobility of fluorescent proteins. We intended to bleach fluorescence from the regions where Pth11:GFP or MoSho1:GFP were accumulated in germ tubes and the recovery of fluorescence can reflect the rate of endocytosis. Considering newly synthesized proteins can be delivered from Golgi to endosomes, we treated germinated conidia (3 h) with cycloheximide to inhibit protein biosynthesis, which may prevent Golgi resident Pth11:GFP or MoSho1:GFP from entering endosomes. We also treated germinated conidia with benomyl for 10 min to inhibit endosomes trafficking via microtubule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref032">32</xref>]. In the FRAP assay, we bleached 90% of fluorescence of a region using 488 nm light. For Pth11:GFP, 72.7 ± 4% of fluorescence was recovered at post-photobleach 35 s in Guy11, compared with 16.1 ± 0.8% in Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g004">Fig 4I and 4J</xref>). In addition, the recovery level of MoSho1:GFP in Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> (27.5 ± 3.1%) was significantly lower than that in Guy11 (78.8 ± 7.9%) at post-photobleach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g004">Fig 4K and 4L</xref>). Collectively, these results suggested that MoEnd3 is important for endocytosis of Pth11 and MoSho1.</p>

By using the phosphor-MAPK antibody, Pmk1 phosphorylation was detected at all stages except conidia in Guy11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g003">Fig 3H</xref> bottom panel). However, a reduced Pmk1 phosphorylation level was detected in the Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> appressoria following 16 h of incubation. This finding suggested that MoEnd3 affects Pmk1 phosphorylation during appressorium development.</p>
<p>Previous studies showed that the constitutively activated <italic>MST7</italic><sup>S212D T216E</sup> allele restores normal Pmk1 phosphorylation and appressorium formation in the Δ<italic>mst11</italic> and Δ<italic>mst7</italic> mutant strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref011">11</xref>]. To confirm that MoEnd3 affects Pmk1 phosphorylation, we introduced the <italic>MST7</italic><sup>S212D T216E</sup> allele into Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> and found that it too suppressed the defect of Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> in appressorium formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g003">Fig 3H</xref> upper panel). Interestingly, 50% of conidia of the Δ<italic>Moend3</italic>/<italic>MST7</italic><sup>S212D T216E</sup> strain appeared to form appressoria after 6 h of incubation on hydrophobic surfaces, whereas no appressoria were formed in Δ<italic>Moend3</italic>. There were no significant differences in the formation rate between Guy11 and the Δ<italic>Moend3</italic>/<italic>MST7</italic><sup>S212D T216E</sup> strain after 10 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g003">Fig 3I and 3J</xref>). Moreover, Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> only formed a small number of lesions on rice leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g003">Fig 3K and 3L</xref>). In contrast, the Δ<italic>Moend3</italic>/<italic>MST7</italic><sup>S212D T216E</sup> strain produced many typical lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g003">Fig 3K and 3L</xref>). Further, penetration assays using rice tissues were conducted by observing 100 appressoria for each strain and classifying their IH into 4 types (type 1, no hyphal penetration; type 2, IH with less than two branches; type 3, IH with at least two branches, but the IH are short and less extended; type 4, IH that fully occupies a plant cell and moves into neighboring cells). We found that 84.2% of appressoria from the Δ<italic>Moend3</italic>/<italic>MST7</italic><sup>S212D T216E</sup> strain could penetrate the rice cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g003">Fig 3M</xref>). In contrast, less than 10% of appressoria from Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> could penetrate the host. These results suggested a function link between MoEnd3 and Pmk1 by showing that elevating Pmk1 phosphorylation level could significantly suppress the defect of Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> in appressorium formation and infection.</p>

<title>MoEnd3 is important for autophagy</title>
<p>Nuclear degradation in conidia is essential for appressorium development and penetration, which is also the consequence of autophagy following mitosis and nuclear migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref033">33</xref>]. To test if MoEnd3 has a role in autophagy, an RFP-labeled H1 histone protein (H1:RFP) was expressed in both Guy11 and the Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> mutant, and nuclei were visualized following conidia germination on the hydrophobic surface. Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> displayed successive nuclear divisions, with no breakdown of nuclei in conidia or germ tubes at 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

<p>We then determined whether deletion of <italic>MoEND3</italic> affects autophagy by culturing mycelia in liquid minimal medium with reduced nitrogen (MM-N) in the presence of the proteinase B inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) for 4 h and observing hyphal vacuoles under a electron microscope. Autophagosomes were observed in the vacuoles of Guy11 but not Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The <italic>GFP</italic>:<italic>MoATG8</italic> construct can be used as a functional marker for monitoring the delivery of vesicles to vacuoles and the breakdown of autophagosomes, and normal autophagy cannot easily hydrolyze free GFP protein cleaved from GFP:MoAtg8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref035">35</xref>]. We monitored autophagy using GFP: MoAtg8 in both Guy11 and the Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> mutant. GFP was observed in 76.7% of vacuoles of Guy11, but 15.2% in Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the expression of the <italic>MST7</italic><sup>S212D S216E</sup> allele promoted GFP:MoAtg8 to enter the 68.3% of vacuoles in Δ<italic>Moend3</italic>. This phenomenon was further examined by the GFP:MoAtg8 proteolysis assay. Total proteins were extracted from strains expressing GFP:MoAtg8 following 0, 2 and 5 h of nitrogen starvation. The full-length GFP:MoAtg8 (41-kDa) and cleaved free GFP were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). In Guy11, the level of full-length GFP:MoAtg8 decreased as the time of nitrogen starvation increases. This was not observed in the Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> mutant. Meanwhile, the expression of the <italic>MoMST7</italic><sup>S212D S216E</sup> allele accelerated the breakdown of GFP:MoAtg8 in Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Based on these results, we concluded that MoEnd3 is important for autophagy, and autophagy defect in Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> is possibly caused by a defect in Pmk1 phosphorylation.</p>

<p>Given that MoEnd3 interacts with MoArk1, a serine/threonine protein kinase, we tested whether the activity of MoEnd3 is regulated by MoArk1 through protein phosphorylation.

<p>Additionally, mass spectrometry was used to identify potential phosphorylated site(s) in MoEnd3. In the strain expressing <italic>MoARK1</italic>, one MoEnd3 peptide containing a phosphorylated Ser-222 was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), in contrast to none found in the <italic>MoARK1</italic> deletion strain. We expressed the MoEnd3 Ser-222 to Ala allele linked to GFP in Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> and examined the phosphorylation level of MoEnd3<sup>S222A</sup>:GFP protein using Mn<sup>2+</sup>-Phos-tag SDS PAGE. The result showed that the band of MoEnd3<sup>S222A</sup>:GFP migrated as fast as the band of MoEnd3:GFP extracted from the Δ<italic>Moark1</italic>/<italic>MoEND3</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), suggesting that MoEnd3<sup>S222A</sup>:GFP is a unphosphorylated protein and MoEnd3 Ser-222 is a specific site for MoArk1-mediated phosphorylation.</p>
<p>In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, Ark1p/Prk1p kinases initiate phosphorylation to inhibit endocytic protein functions and promote disassembly of endocytic proteins at the late stage of endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref019">19</xref>]. To further determine whether MoEnd3 function is regulated by MoArk1-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-222, the constructs of the constitutively unphosphorylated MoEnd3 S222A and phosphomimetic MoEnd3 S222D mutants were introduced into Δ<italic>Moend3</italic>, Δ<italic>Moark1</italic>, and Guy11, respectively. Endocytosis was observed following 5 min of hyphal exposure to FM4-64.

But the <italic>MoEND3</italic><sup>S222D</sup> expression impaired endocytosis in Guy11, and showed no rescue effect on endocytosis in Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> and Δ<italic>Moark1</italic>, suggesting the constitutively phosphorylated MoEnd3 interferes with normal MoEnd3 function.</p>
<p>We further extracted proteins from appressoria or germinated conidia incubated for 8 h expressing <italic>MoEND3</italic><sup>S222A</sup> and <italic>MoEND3</italic><sup>S222D</sup> and performed Western blot analysis using the phosphor-Pmk1 antibody.

In addition, the appressorium formation assay showed the Δ<italic>Moend3</italic>/<italic>MoEND3</italic><sup>S222A</sup> strain, but not the Δ<italic>Moend3</italic>/<italic>MobEND3</italic><sup>S222D</sup> strain, had a higher appressorium formation rate than Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> after 10 and 16 h of incubation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006449.s006">S6 Fig</xref>).

<title>MoEnd3 has a role in suppressing rice innate immunity</title>
<p>Plants protect themselves against pathogens by evolving multiple layers of innate immunity, which is often associated with the hypersensitive response (HR), reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and the induction of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref038">38</xref>].

<p>To test other effectors that are not contained in Guy11, such as Avr-Pia and AvrPiz-t, constructs containing genes encoding Avr-Pia and AvrPiz-t were introduced into Guy11 and Δ<italic>Moend3</italic>. Conidial suspensions of Guy11/<italic>Avr</italic>-<italic>Pia</italic> and Δ<italic>Moend3</italic>/<italic>Avr</italic>-<italic>Pia</italic> were sprayed onto LTH and LTH-Pia (LTH harboring resistant gene <italic>Pia</italic>).

<p>Avr-Pia and AvrPiz-t are cytoplasmic effectors that are preferentially accumulated in the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC) and translocated to the rice cell cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref045">45</xref>]. We fused Avr-Pia and AvrPiz-t with GFP, expressed them in Guy11 and Δ<italic>Moend3</italic>, and observed their localizations at the early stage of infection.

<p>To further demonstrate the requirement of MoEnd3 for secretion of Avr-Pia and AvrPiz-t, but not AvrPib and AvrPi9, we observed effector secretion with the strains co-expressing Avr-Pia:GFP and AvrPiz-t:GFP with AvrPib:RFP or AvrPi9:RFP.

<title>A proposed model for MoEnd3 function.</title>
<p>During germ tube development, GPCR Pth11 and membrane sensor MoSho1 are regulated by MoEnd3-mediated endocytosis. MoEnd3 function in endocytosis is negatively regulated by MoArk1-initiated phosphorylation, leading to an efficient endocytosis. Following transport to endosomal systems by endocytic vesicles, Pth11 and MoSho1 can trigger a downstream MAPK cascade, consisting of Mst11, Mst7, Pmk1 and adaptor Mst50. The MAPK cascade facilitates successful nuclear degradation/autophagy, appressorium formation, penetration and pathogenicity. In addition, MoEnd3 is also involved in an endocytosis/exocytosis coupling pathway to facilitate effector secretion and biotrophic growth.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Endocytosis is employed by eukaryotic cells to constitutively internalize plasma membrane-associated proteins, lipids, and other molecules for regulating many key cellular functions. In <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>, this process is closely linked to fungal physiology and pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref047">47</xref>]. Our current studies provide evidence further supporting this conclusion. Our results show that in addition to having an important role in mating and virulence, MoEnd3-mediated endocytosis is also important for transport of the GPCR Pth11 and the membrane sensor MoSho1. Significantly, <italic>MoEND3</italic> deletion delayed endocytosis of Pth11 and MoSho1, resulting in delayed appressorium development. Similar to phenotypes in the strains lacking <italic>cPKA</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref048">48</xref>], the appressoria produced by Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> strains showed impaired turgor pressure, inefficient mobilization of glycogen and lipids, and a defect in host penetration. Additionally, we found that MoEnd3 function affects the Pmk1 MAPK signaling pathway. Collectively, our findings support that endocytosis is required for receptor-mediated signaling, development and pathogenesis in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>orzae</italic>.</p>
<p>Our findings are consistent with observations in other model organisms. For example, in mammalian cells, activation of plasma membrane receptors including receptor tyrosine kinases and GPCR by external agonists is followed by the endocytic receptor transport to the endosome. In the endosome the internalized receptors can interact with key components of various signaling pathways to activate specific signal transduction pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref050">50</xref>]. Furthermore, in the biotrophic plant pathogen <italic>Ustilago maydis</italic>, studies of tSNARE Yup1 revealed that endocytosis controls GPCR Pra1-mediated signaling. Yup1 is co-localized with Rab5-marked early endosomes. A temperature-sensitive mutation of <italic>yup1</italic> blocked the fusion of endocytic vesicles with early endosomes and the endocytic recycling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref051">51</xref>]. These defects result in depletion of the pheromone receptor Pra1 from the plasma membrane and disruption in pheromone-mediated signal transmission to downstream effectors that would normally trigger pathogenic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref051">51</xref>].</p>
<p>Autophagic cell death in the conidium is necessary for appressorium formation and infection. Previous studies have shown that a Δ<italic>pmk1</italic> mutant is blocked in autophagic nuclear degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref033">33</xref>]. We found that constitutively activated Mst7 could accelerate autophagy in the Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> mutant. This supports the hypothesis that the severely delayed nuclear degradation and autophagy in Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> was caused by a defect in Pmk1-MAPK signaling. This is in agreement with several other studies that also found that MAPK signaling is involved in the autophagic process. In mammalian cells, members of the MAPK family including MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK8/JNK, MAPK14/p38a and MAPK15 are involved in the control of autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref054">54</xref>]. In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, the Slt2-MAPK and Hog1-MAPK signaling pathways were found to be required for mitophagy and pexophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref055">55</xref>].</p>
<p>Additionally, mammalian and yeast Ark1p/Prk1p serine/threonine kinases initiate phosphorylation of endocytic and actin cytoskeleton components to control endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref019">19</xref>]. We previously reported that MoArk1 regulates endocytosis and pathogenicity and is localized to actin patches in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref023">23</xref>]. Here, we demonstrated that MoEnd3 function is regulated by MoArk1 through protein phosphorylation. We further found that neither of the constitutively phosphorylated nor unphosphorylated form of MoEnd3 could properly function in endocytosis, Pmk1 phosphorylation or virulence. Strikingly, the unphosphorylated MoEnd3 could still function to partially suppress the defects of Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> and Δ<italic>Moark1</italic>. This is in contrast to the constitutively phosphorylated MoEnd3, which was completely inactive.</p>
<p><italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> secretes effectors, such as Slp1, into rice cells to suppress host immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref056">56</xref>]. IH growth of Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> was found to be arrested suggesting that it was inhibited by a robust host immune response. This could be due to Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> being unable to secrete effector molecules. Indeed, we found that the secretion of Avr-Pia and AvrPiz-t was impaired in Δ<italic>Moend3</italic>. This finding is in accordance with our earlier studies in which we found that Qc-SNARE MoSyn8 is required for Avr-Pia and AvrPiz-t secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref045">45</xref>]. However, the secretion of AvrPib and AvrPi9 was not affected in Δ<italic>Moend3</italic>, suggesting that secretion of these effectors may involve mechanisms independent of MoEnd3. Moreover, when Pmk1 phosphorylation was activated by expressing the <italic>MST7</italic><sup>S212D T216E</sup> allele in Δ<italic>Moend3</italic>, the secretion of Avr-Pia and AvrPiz-t was still impaired, suggesting that these mechanisms are also independent of Pmk1 signaling. It would be interesting to identify such mechanisms in future studies.</p>
<p>Previous studies indicated that there are two distinct effector secretion systems functioning in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref002">2</xref>]. The cytoplasmic effectors such as Pwl2 are preferentially accumulated in BIC, and their secretion depends on the t-SNARE protein MoSso1 and exocyst components MoExo70 and MoSec5. The secretion of apoplastic effectors, such as Bas4, follows the Golgi-dependent secretion pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref002">2</xref>]. Some studies also indicated that endocytosis and exocytosis/secretion are obligatorily coupled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref058">58</xref>]. In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, the perturbation of She4p affects endocytosis and defects in endocytosis result in a slow motion of exocytic vesicles during polarity establishment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref059">59</xref>]. This decreased exocytosis could reflect in defects in endocytic recycling of components required for membrane fusion, including certain SNARE proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref059">59</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that MoEnd3-mediated endocytosis affects secretion of certain effector proteins and that delayed endocytosis in Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> could also affect movement of certain exocytic vesicles required for transporting effector proteins. Ultimately, inhibition of effector secretion could attenuate <italic>M</italic>. <italic>orzae</italic> pathogenicity.</p>
<p>In summary, our studies demonstrate that the endocytic protein MoEnd3 is required for blast fungus growth and development, endocytic transport of pathogenic GPCRs, interaction with the rice host, and pathogenicity. Together with MoArk1, MoEnd3 exhibits a regulatory function for multiple processes, including appressorium development and function, autophagy, Pmk1 MAPK transduction, and signaling and regeneration of Pth11 and MoSho1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006449.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Given that endocytosis is closely coupled with exocytosis, MoEnd3 could have additional roles in facilitating effector secretion to suppress host defenses.</p>

Mobile Fraction was calculated as the following formula: Mf = (F<sub>end</sub> − F<sub>0</sub>)/(F<sub>pre</sub> − F<sub>0</sub>), where F<sub>end</sub> is the stable fluorescent intensity of the punctae after sufficient recovery, F<sub>0</sub> is the fluorescent intensity immediately after bleaching, and F<sub>pre</sub> is the fluorescent intensity before bleaching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref065">65</xref>].</p>

<title>Phosphorylation analysis with phos-tag gel</title>
<p>The <italic>MoEND3</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic> fusion construct was introduced into Δ<italic>Moend3</italic> and Δ<italic>Moark1</italic> mutants, respectively. The proteins extracted from mycelium were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels prepared with 50 μM acrylamide-dependent Phos-tag ligand and 100 μM MnCl<sub>2</sub> as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006449.ref036">36</xref>]. Gel electrophoresis was run at 80 V for 3–6 h. Prior to transfer, gels were equilibrated in transfer buffer containing 5 mM EDTA for 20 min two times and then in transfer buffer without EDTA for 10 min. Protein transfer from the Mn<sup>2+</sup>-phos-tag acrylamide gel to the PVDF membrane was performed overnight at 80 V at 4°C, and then the membrane was analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-GFP antibody.</p>

<title>Mass spectrometric analysis</title>
<p>To identify phosphorylation sites of targeted proteins, samples were separated on 10% SDS PAGE. The gel bands corresponding to the targeted protein were excised from the gel, reduced with 10 mM of DTT and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide. In gel digestion was carried out with the trypsin/lys-c mix (Promega, USA) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 37°C overnight. The peptides were extracted using ultrasonic processing with 50% acetonitrile aqueous solution for 5 min and with 100% acetonitrile for 5 min. The extractions were then centrifuged in a speed to reduce the volume. A liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) system consisting of a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nano-LC system (nano UHPLC, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), connected to a linear quadrupole ion trap Orbitrap (LTQ Orbitrap XL) mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron, Bremen, Germany), and equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source was used for our analysis. For LC separation, an Acclaim PepMap 100 column (C18.3 μm, 100 Å) (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) capillary with a 15 cm bed length was used with a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Two solvents, A (0.1% formic acid) and B (aqueous 90% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid), were used to elute the peptides from the nanocolumn. The gradient went from 5% to 40% B in 80 min and from 40% to 95% B in 5 min, with a total run time of 120 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode so as to automatically switch between Orbitrap-MS and LTQ-MS/MS acquisition. Survey full scan MS spectra (from m/z 350 to 1800) were acquired in the Orbitrap with a resolution r = 60,000 at m/z 400, allowing the sequential isolation of the top ten ions, depending on signal intensity. The fragmentation on the linear ion trap used collision-induced dissociation at a collision energy of 35 V. Protein identification and database construction were processed using Proteome Discoverer software (1.2 version, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with the SEQUEST model. MS/MS-based peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability, as specified by the Peptide prophet algorithm.</p>
