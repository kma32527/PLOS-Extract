<abstract>
<p>The repeat region of the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is a major vaccine antigen because it can be targeted by parasite neutralizing antibodies; however, little is known about this interaction. We used isothermal titration calorimetry, X-ray crystallography and mutagenesis-validated modeling to analyze the binding of a murine neutralizing antibody to <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> CSP. Strikingly, we found that the repeat region of CSP is bound by multiple antibodies. This repeating pattern allows multiple weak interactions of single F<sub>AB</sub> domains to accumulate and yield a complex with a dissociation constant in the low nM range. Because the CSP protein can potentially cross-link multiple B cell receptors (BCRs) we hypothesized that the B cell response might be T cell independent. However, while there was a modest response in mice deficient in T cell help, the bulk of the response was T cell dependent. By sequencing the BCRs of CSP-repeat specific B cells in inbred mice we found that these cells underwent somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation indicative of a T-dependent response. Last, we found that the BCR repertoire of responding B cells was limited suggesting that the structural simplicity of the repeat may limit the breadth of the immune response.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Vaccines aim to protect by inducing the immune system to make molecules called antibodies that can recognize molecules on the surface of invading pathogens. In the case of malaria, our most advanced vaccine candidates aim to promote the production of antibodies that recognize the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) molecule on the surface of the invasive parasite stage called the sporozoite. In this report we use X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of CSP-binding antibodies at the atomic level. We use other techniques such as isothermal titration calorimetry and structural modeling to examine how this antibody interacts with the CSP molecule. Strikingly, we found that each CSP molecule could bind 6 antibodies. This finding has implications for the immune response and may explain why high titers of antibody are needed for protection. Moreover, because the structure of the CSP repeat is quite simple we determined that the number of different kinds of antibodies that could bind this molecule are quite small. However a high avidity interaction between those antibodies and CSP can result from a process called affinity maturation that allows the body to learn how to make improved antibodies specific for pathogen molecules. These data show that while it is challenging for the immune system to recognize and neutralize CSP, it should be possible to generate viable vaccines targeting this molecule.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Malaria caused by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> causes the deaths of around 430,000 people each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref001">1</xref>]. The most advanced vaccine candidate for malaria is the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine which consists of a truncated version of the sporozoite-surface circumsporozoite protein (CSP), packaged in a Hepatitis C core virus-like particle delivered in AS01—a proprietary liposome based adjuvant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref002">2</xref>]. Phase II and Phase III clinical trials have repeatedly demonstrated that the vaccine gives around 50% protection against clinical malaria in field settings for the first year following vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref003">3</xref>]. The bulk of protection is attributed to antibodies targeting the CSP repeat epitope included within the vaccine, with some contribution from CD4+ T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref004">4</xref>]. It is still unclear why the antibody response to CSP is only partially protective. We lack structural information about how neutralizing antibodies bind to CSP and knowledge on the breadth and nature of the B cell response elicited.</p>
<p>Antibodies to CSP were first identified as potential mediators of protection following seminal studies that showed that immunization with irradiated sporozoites could induce sterile protection against live parasite challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref006">6</xref>]. In the early 1980s, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from mice immunized with sporozoites were found to be capable of blocking invasion of hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref007">7</xref>] and directly neutralizing parasites by precipitating the surface protein coat (a process known as the circumsporozoite reaction) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref008">8</xref>]. These antibodies were then used to clone CSP, one of the first malaria antigens identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref009">9</xref>]. The N- and C-terminal domains of CSP from all <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species are separated by a repeat region, which was the target of the original mAbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref011">11</xref>]. In the 3D7 reference strain of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>, the CSP repeat has 38 repeats: 34 asparagine-alanine-asparagine-proline (NANP)-repeats interspersed with 4 asparagine-valine-aspartate-proline (NVDP) repeats that are concentrated towards the N-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref012">12</xref>] though different isolates can contain slightly different numbers of repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref013">13</xref>]. One of the most effective <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> sporozoite neutralizing antibodies identified in these early studies was 2A10 which can block sporozoite infectivity <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref007">7</xref>] and in <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse models utilizing rodent <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> parasites expressing the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> CSP repeat region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>While CSP binding antibodies have been shown to be able to neutralize sporozoites and block infection, it has also been proposed that CSP is an immunological “decoy” that induces a suboptimal, but broad, T-independent immune response due to the CSP repeat cross-linking multiple B cell receptors (BCRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref016">16</xref>]. However, it remains unknown if the repetitive regions of CSP can cross-link multiple BCRs as they are not as large as typical type-II T-independent antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref017">17</xref>]. Moreover, the ability to induce a T-independent response does not preclude a T-dependent component to immunity as well: various oligomeric viral surface proteins can induce both short-lived T-independent responses and subsequent affinity matured IgG responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref019">19</xref>]. Furthermore, the very little published data on the sequences of CSP binding antibodies does not convincingly support activation of a broad B cell repertoire: a small study of five <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> CSP mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) identified some shared sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref020">20</xref>]. In humans, a study that generated mAbs from three individuals who received RTS,S found that the three antibodies studied had distinct sequences though these all used similar heavy chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>We therefore set out to test the hypothesis that the CSP repeat can bind multiple antibodies or BCRs and drive a T-independent immune response. To do this we undertook a comprehensive biophysical characterization of the 2A10 sporozoite-neutralizing antibody that binds to the CSP repeat. We found that this antibody binds with an avidity in the nano-molar range which was unexpected as previous studies using competition ELISAs with peptides predicted a micro-molar affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref023">23</xref>]. Strikingly, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), structural analyses, and mutagenesis-validated modeling revealed that the CSP repeat can be bound by around six antibodies suggesting that the repeat may potentially crosslink multiple BCRs on the surface of a B cell. However, analysis of CSP-specific B cells revealed that CSP-specific B cells can enter Germinal Centers (GCs) and undergo affinity maturation contradicting the notion that the response to CSP is largely T-independent. Moreover, we found that the BCR repertoire of CSP-binding B cells is quite limited which may restrict the size and effectiveness of the immune response.</p>

<title>Characterization of the thermodynamics of 2A10-antigen binding</title>
<p>We began our analysis by performing isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to understand the interaction between 2A10 and CSP. For ease of expression we used a recombinant CSP (rCSP) construct described previously which was slightly truncated with 27 repeats compared to 38 in the 3D7 reference strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref024">24</xref>]. ITC experiments were run on the purified 2A10 antibody and the purified 2A10 antigen-binding fragment (F<sub>AB</sub>) fragment to test the thermodynamic basis of the affinity of 2A10 F<sub>AB</sub> towards CSP. Experiments were also performed on the 2A10 F<sub>AB</sub> fragment with the synthetic peptide antigen (NANP)<sub>6</sub>, which is a short segment of the antigenic NANP-repeat region of CSP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006469.t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The binding free energies (ΔG) and dissociation constants (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) were found to be -49.0 kJ/mol and 2.7 nM for the full 2A10 antibody with CSP, -40 kJ/mol and 94 nM for the 2A10 F<sub>AB</sub> with CSP, and -36.4 kJ/mol and 420 nM for the 2A10 F<sub>AB</sub> with the (NANP)<sub>6</sub> peptide.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, we did not observe a typical 1:1 antibody/F<sub>AB</sub> domain:antigen binding stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006469.t001">Table 1</xref>). We found that each (NANP)<sub>6</sub> peptide was bound to by ~2 F<sub>AB</sub> fragments (2.8 repeats per F<sub>AB</sub> domain). With the rCSP protein we observed that ~11 F<sub>AB</sub> fragments could bind to each rCSP molecule, (2.5 repeats per F<sub>AB</sub> domain. Finally, when the single-domain F<sub>AB</sub> fragment is replaced by the full 2A10 antibody (which has two F<sub>AB</sub> domains), we observe binding of 5.8 antibodies per rCSP molecule (4.7 repeats per antibody). Therefore all complexes exhibit approximately the same binding stoichiometry of two F<sub>AB</sub> fragments/domains per ~5 repeat units. These results suggest that the antigenic region of CSP constitutes a multivalent antigen and that repeating, essentially identical, epitopes must be available for the binding of multiple F<sub>AB</sub> domains.</p>
<p>It is not possible to separate affinity from avidity in this system, although it is apparent that there is a substantial benefit to the overall strength of binding between the antibody and antigen through the binding of multiple F<sub>AB</sub> domains. The F<sub>AB</sub>:rCSP complex and the 2A10:rCSP complex had similar enthalpy and entropy of binding (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006469.t001">Table 1</xref>), but the 2A10:rCSP complex had a lower overall ΔG binding, corresponding to a lower dissociation constant (2.7 nM <italic>vs</italic>. 94 nM for F<sub>AB</sub>:rCSP). The observation that this antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) interaction is primarily enthalpically driven is consistent with the general mechanism of Ab-Ag interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref025">25</xref>]. It is clear that the dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) of a single F<sub>AB</sub> domain to the (NANP)<sub>6</sub> peptide is substantially higher (420 nM), and that the avidity, the accumulated strength of the multiple binding events between the F<sub>AB</sub> domains of the antibody and the CSP repeat, is the basis for the lower <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value observed in the 2A10:rCSP complex. Thus, the characteristic repeating pattern of the epitope on the CSP antigen allows multiple weak interactions with 2A10 F<sub>AB</sub> domains to accumulate, which yields a complex with a high avidity dissociation constant in the low nM range.</p>

<title>Structural analysis of the (NANP)-repeat region and the 2A10 F<sub>AB</sub></title>
<p>To better understand the molecular basis of the multivalent interaction between 2A10 and rCSP, we performed structural analysis of the components. Previous work indicated that the NANP-repeat region of CSP adopts a flexible rod-like structure with a regular repeating helical motif that provides significant separation between the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref026">26</xref>]. Here, we performed far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to investigate the structure of the (NANP)<sub>6</sub> peptide. These results were inconsistent with a disordered random coil structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006469.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Rather, the absorption maximum around 185 nm, minimum around 202 nm and shoulder between 215 and 240 nm, is characteristic of intrinsically disordered proteins that can adopt a spectrum of states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>The lowest energy structures of the (NANP)<sub>6</sub> repeat were predicted using the PEP-FOLD <italic>de novo</italic> peptide structure prediction algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref028">28</xref>]. The only extended state among the lowest energy structures that was consistent with the reported spacing of the N-and C-terminal domains of CSP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref026">26</xref>], and which presented multiple structurally similar epitopes was a linear, quasi-helical structure, which formed a regularly repeating arrangement of proline turns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The theoretical CD spectrum of this conformation was calculated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006469.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), qualitatively matching the experimental spectra: the maximum was at 188 nm, the minimum at 203 nm and there was a broad shoulder between 215 and 240 nm. To investigate the stability of this conformation, we performed a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation on this peptide, which showed that this helical structure could unfold, and refold, on timescales of tens of nanoseconds, supporting the idea that it is a low-energy, frequently sampled, configuration in solution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006469.s007">S1 Movie</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006469.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). We also observed the same characteristic hydrogen bonds between a carbonyl following the proline and the amide nitrogen of the alanine, and the carbonyl group of an asparagine and a backbone amide of asparagine three residues earlier, that are observed in the crystal structure of the NPNA fragment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref029">29</xref>]. Thus, this configuration, which is consistent with previously published experimental data, is a regular, repeating, extended conformation that would allow binding of multiple F<sub>AB</sub> domains to several structurally similar epitopes.</p>

<p>To better understand the interaction between the 2A10 and the (NANP)-repeat region, we solved the crystal structure of the 2A10 F<sub>AB</sub> fragment in two conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006469.s009">S1 Table</xref>), yielding structures that diffracted to 2.5 Å and 3.0 Å. All of the polypeptide chains were modeled in good quality electron density maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), except for residues 134–137 of the light chain. This loop is located at the opposite end of the F<sub>AB</sub> fragment to the variable region and not directly relevant to antigen binding. The 2.5 Å structure contained a single polypeptide in the asymmetric unit, whereas the 3.0 Å structure contained three essentially identical chains. Superposition of the four unique F<sub>AB</sub> fragments from the two structures revealed that the variable antigen binding region is structurally homogeneous, suggesting that this region might be relatively pre-organized in the 2A10 F<sub>AB</sub>. This is consistent with the observation that antibodies typically undergo relatively limited conformational change upon epitope binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref025">25</xref>]. Indeed, a recent survey of 49 Ab-Ag complexes revealed that within the binding site, the heavy chain Complementarity Determining Region (CDR)-3 was the only element that showed significant conformational change upon antigen binding and even this was only observed in one third of the antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Attempts to obtain a crystal structure of a complex between 2A10 F<sub>AB</sub> and the (NANP)<sub>6</sub> peptide were unsuccessful; unlike binary Ab-Ag interactions, in which the Ab will bind to a single epitope on an antigen and produce a population of structurally homogeneous complexes that can be crystallized, in this interaction we are dealing with an intrinsically-disordered peptide, the presence of multiple binding sites on the peptide, and the possibility that more than one 2A10 F<sub>AB</sub> domain can bind the peptide. Therefore it is difficult to obtain a homogeneous population of complexes, which is a prerequisite for crystallization. Attempts to soak the (NANP)<sub>6</sub> peptide into the high-solvent form of 2A10 F<sub>AB</sub>, in which there were no crystal packing interactions with the binding-loops, caused the crystals to dissolve, again suggesting that the heterogeneity of the peptide and the presence of multiple epitopes produces disorder that is incompatible with crystal formation.</p>

<title>Modeling the interaction of the 2A10 F<sub>AB</sub> with the NANP-repeat region and testing the model through site-directed mutagenesis</title>
<p>Although it was not possible to obtain a crystal structure of the 2A10-(NANP)<sub>6</sub> peptide complex, the accurate structures of the 2A10 F<sub>AB</sub> fragment, the (NANP)<sub>6</sub> peptide, and the knowledge that antibodies seldom undergo significant conformational changes upon antigen binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref030">30</xref>], allowed us to model the interaction, which we tested using site directed mutagenesis. Computational modeling of Ab-Ag interactions has advanced considerably in recent years and several examples of complexes with close to atomic accuracy have been reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref031">31</xref>]. Using the SnugDock protein-protein docking algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref031">31</xref>], we obtained an initial model for binding of the peptide to the CDR region of the 2A10 F<sub>AB</sub> fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). We then performed, in triplicate, three 50 ns MD simulations on this complex to investigate whether the interaction was stable over such a time period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006469.s008">S2 Movie</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006469.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). These simulations confirmed that the binding mode that was modeled is stable, suggesting that it is a reasonable approximation of the interaction between these molecules. To experimentally verify whether our model of the 2A10 F<sub>AB</sub>:(NANP)<sub>6</sub> peptide interaction was plausible, we performed site directed mutagenesis of residues predicted to be important for binding. Our model predicted that the interaction with (NANP)<sub>6</sub> would be mainly between CDR2 and CDR3 of the light chain and CDR2 and CDR3 of the heavy chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>In the light chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>), Y38 is predicted to be one of the most important residues in the interaction; it contributes to the formation of a hydrophobic pocket that buries a proline residue and is within hydrogen bonding distance, <italic>via</italic> its hydroxyl group, to a number of backbone and side-chain groups of the peptide. Loss of this side-chain abolished binding. Y56 also forms part of the same proline-binding pocket as Y38, and loss of this side-chain also resulted in an almost complete loss of binding. R109 forms a hydrogen bond to an asparagine residue on the side of the helix; mutation of this residue to alanine results in a partial loss of binding. Y116 is located at the center of the second proline-binding pocket; since loss of the entire side-chain through an alanine mutation would lead to general structural disruption of the F<sub>AB</sub> fragment, we mutated this to a phenylalanine (removing the hydroxyl group), which led to a significant reduction in binding. Finally, S36A was selected as a control: the model indicated that it was outside the binding site, and the ELISA data indicated that had no effect on (NANP)<sub>n</sub> binding.</p>

<p>Within the heavy chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>), mutation of N57 to alanine led to complete loss of binding, which is consistent with it forming a hydrogen bond to a side-chain asparagine but also being part of a relatively well packed region of the binding site that is mostly buried upon binding. T66 is located on the edge of the binding site and appears to provide hydrophobic contacts through its methyl group with the methyl side-chain of an alanine of the peptide; mutation of this residue resulted in a partial loss of binding. Interestingly, mutation of E64, which is location in an appropriate position to form some hydrogen bonds to the peptide resulted in a slight increase in binding, although charged residues on the edge of protein:protein interfaces are known to contribute primarily to specificity rather than affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref032">32</xref>]. Specifically, the cost of desolvating charged residues such as glutamate is not compensated for by the hydrogen bonds that may be formed with the binding partner. Y37 is located outside the direct binding site in the apo-crystal structure; the loss of affinity could arise from long-range effects, such as destabilization of the position of nearby loops. In general, the effects of the mutations are consistent with the model of the interaction.</p>

<title>The multivalency of the CSP repeat region</title>
<p>The binding mode of the F<sub>AB</sub> fragment to the (NANP)<sub>6</sub> peptide is centered on two proline residues from two non-adjacent NANP-repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g003">Fig 3A and 3C</xref>). These cyclic side-chains are hydrophobic in character and are buried deeply in the core of the F<sub>AB</sub> antigen binding site, into hydrophobic pockets formed by Y38 and Y56 of the light chain and the interface between the two chains. In contrast, the polar asparagine residues on the sides of the helix are involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with a number of polar residues on the edge of the binding site, such as N57 of the heavy chain. Due to the twisting of the (NANP)<sub>6</sub> repeat, the binding epitope of the peptide is 2.5–3 alternate NANP repeats, with a symmetrical epitope available for binding on the opposite face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Thus, this binding mode is consistent with the stoichiometry of the binding observed in the ITC measurements, where we observed a stoichiometry of two 2A10 F<sub>AB</sub> fragments per (NANP)<sub>6</sub> peptide. To investigate whether this binding mode was also compatible with the indication from ITC that ~10.7 2A10 F<sub>AB</sub> fragments, or six antibodies (containing 12 F<sub>AB</sub> domains) could bind the CSP protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006469.t001">Table 1</xref>), we extended the peptide to its full length. It is notable that the slight twist in the NANP helix results in the epitope being offset along the length of the repeat region, thereby allowing binding of ten 2A10 F<sub>AB</sub> fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Six 2A10 antibodies can bind if two antibodies interact by a single F<sub>AB</sub> domain and the other four interact with both F<sub>AB</sub> domains. The observation that the F<sub>AB</sub> fragments bind sufficiently close to each other to form hydrogen bonds also explains the observation from the ITC that the complexes with rCSP, which allow adjacent F<sub>AB</sub> fragment binding, have more favorable binding enthalpy, i.e. the additional bonds formed between adjacent F<sub>AB</sub> fragments further stabilize the complex and lead to greater affinity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006469.t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the initially surprising stoichiometry that we observe through ITC appears to be quite feasible based on the structure of the NANP-repeat region of the rCSP protein and the nature of the rCSP-2A10 complex. It is also clear that the effect of antibody binding to this region would be to prevent the linker flexing between the N- and C-terminal domains and maintaining normal physiological function, explaining the neutralizing effect of the antibodies.</p>

<title>Identification of endogenous (NANP)<sub>n</sub> specific B cells to determine the BCR repertoire</title>
<p>We next set out to determine the implications of our structure for the B cell response to CSP. Because the CSP protein could conceivably cross-link multiple B cell receptors (BCRs) we hypothesized that the B cell response might be T-independent. As a tool to test this hypothesis we used (NANP)<sub>n</sub>-based tetramers to identify and phenotype antigen specific B cells in mice immunized with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> sporozoites expressing the repeat region of the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> CSP (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> CS<sup>Pf</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref015">15</xref>]. The tetramers are formed by the binding of 4 biotinylated (NANP)<sub>9</sub> repeats with streptavidin conjugated phycoerythrin (PE) or allophycocyanin (APC). To validate our tetramer approach, mice were immunized with either <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> CS<sup>Pf</sup> or another line of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> with a mutant CSP (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> CS<sup>5M</sup>) that contains the endogenous (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic>) repeat region, which has a distinct repeat sequence (PPPPNPND)<sub>n</sub>. (NANP)<sub>n</sub>-specific cells were identified with two tetramer probes bound to different conjugates to exclude B cells that are specific for the PE or APC components of the tetramers which are numerous in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref033">33</xref>]. We found that mice immunized with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> CS<sup>Pf</sup> sporozoites developed large tetramer double positive populations, which had class switched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). In contrast, the number of tetramer double positive cells in mice receiving control parasites was the same as in unimmunized mice; moreover these cells were not class switched and appeared to be naïve precursors indicating that our tetramers are identifying bona-fide (NANP)<sub>n</sub>-specific cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). Further analysis of the different populations of B cells showed that most B cells present at this time-point were GL7<sup>+</sup> CD38<sup>-</sup> indicating that they are GC B cells in agreement with results from a recent publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref034">34</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g005">Fig 5B and 5D</xref>). Given that T cells are required to sustain GC formation beyond ~3 days these data indicate that a T-dependent response can develop to CSP following sporozoite immunization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref035">35</xref>].</p>

<title>The B cell response to the (NANP)<sub>n</sub> repeat has both T-independent and T-dependent components</title>
<p>Our previous data showing GC formation among (NANP)<sub>n</sub> specific B cells was indicative of a T-dependent response. To determine whether there might also be a T-independent component to the B cell response we immunized CD28<sup>-/-</sup> mice as well as C57BL/6 controls with <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> CS<sup>Pf</sup> radiation attenuated sporozoites (RAS) and measured serum (NANP)<sub>n</sub> specific antibody by ELISA and the B cell response using our Tetramers. CD28<sup>-/-</sup> mice have CD4+ T cells but they are unable to provide help to B cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref036">36</xref>]. Interestingly 4 days post immunization there were comparable IgM and IgG anti-(NANP)<sub>n</sub> responses in the CD28<sup>-/-</sup> mice and control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), indicative of a T-independent component to immunity. However by day 27 post immunization there was no detectable IgM or IgG antibody specific for (NANP)<sub>n</sub> in the CD28<sup>-/-</sup> mice suggesting the T-independent response is short-lived. We further analyzed (NANP)<sub>n</sub> specific B cell responses using our tetramers, in particular examining the number and phenotype (plasmablast vs GC B cell) of activated IgD<sup>-</sup> Tetramer<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). In agreement with our antibody data, similar numbers of antigen specific B cells were seen at 4 days post immunization in the CD28<sup>-/-</sup> and control mice and most of these cells were plasmablasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). However by 7 days post immunization the number of antigen specific cells declines in the CD28<sup>-/-</sup> mice as the T dependent GC reaction begins to predominate. Thus CSP on the surface of sporozoites is able to induce short-lived T-independent B cell response, but subsequently T-dependent responses predominate.</p>

<p>We wanted to know if to induce a T-independent response it was necessary for CSP to be presented on the surface of the sporozoite or if free rCSP was sufficient. We found that indeed rCSP could induce a T-independent response as evidenced by similar IgM and IgG levels and IgD<sup>-</sup>Tetramer<sup>+</sup> responses 4 days post immunization in control and CD28<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>). Finally we were concerned that there may be some residual CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell help in the CD28<sup>-/-</sup> mice so we performed experiments in which we used the antibody GK1.5 to deplete CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref037">37</xref>]. In agreement with our previous data we found that sporozoites (live or RAS) and rCSP induced IgM responses in CD4 depleted mice, though we were unable to detect a significant IgG response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006469.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

Overall our data with GK1.5 depleted mice support our results in the CD28<sup>-/-</sup> model.</p>

<title>A restricted repertoire of BCRs can bind to the (NANP)<sub>n</sub> repeat</title>
<p>Our ability to identify and sort (NANP)<sub>n</sub> specific B cells with our tetramers also allows us to examine the repertoire of antibodies that can bind the (NANP)<sub>n</sub> by sequencing the BCRs of the identified cells. While the repeat structure of CSP has been hypothesized to induce a broad polyclonal response based on data that the CSP repeat can absorb most of the sporozoite binding activity of human sera from immune individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref038">38</xref>], an alternative hypothesis is that the antigenically simple structure of the repeat epitope might only be recognized by a small number of naïve B cells. We therefore sorted (NANP)<sub>n</sub>-specific cells 35 days post immunization of BALB/C mice with sporozoites. We performed this analysis in BALB/C mice as this is the background of mice from which the 2A10 antibody was derived. We then prepared cDNA from the cells and amplified the heavy and kappa chain sequences using degenerate primers as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref040">40</xref>]. Heavy and kappa chain libraries were prepared from 4 immunized mice as well as from 3 naïve mice from which we bulk sorted B cells as controls. We obtained usable sequences from 3 of the 4 mice for both the heavy chain and kappa chain. Analysis of the heavy chain revealed that in each mouse 3 or 4 V regions dominated the immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). The V regions identified (IGHV1-20; IGHV1-26; IGHV1-34 and IGHV5-9) were generally shared among the mice. As a formal measure of the diversity of our V region usage in the (NANP)<sub>n</sub> specific cells and the bulk B cells from naïve mice we calculated the Shannon entropy for these populations. This analysis formally demonstrated that the diversity of the antigen specific B cells was significantly lower than the diversity of the repertoire in naïve mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). We further found that each V region was typically associated with the same D and J sequences even in different mice. For example, IGHV1-20 was typically associated with J4, IGHV5-9 with J4 while in different mice IGHV1-34 was variously paired with J1 or J4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Similar results were obtained for the kappa chain with the response dominated by IGKV1-135; IGKV5-43/45; IGKV1-110; IGKV1-117 and IGKV14-111 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g007">Fig 7D and 7E</xref>). The V regions were typically paired with the same J regions even in different mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g007">Fig 7F</xref>), for example IGKV5.43/45 was typically paired with IGKJ5 or IGKJ2 and IGKV1-110 was typically paired with IGKJ5, although IGKV1-135 was typically more promiscuous. One limitation of our high throughput sequencing approach is that the degenerate primers only amplified ~70% of the known IGHV and IGKV sequences in naïve mice, suggesting that we may not capture the full diversity of the response. However, comparison with the 5 published antibody sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006469.s010">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006469.s011">S3</xref> Tables) that include IGHV-1-20, IGKV5-45 and IGKV1-110 reveals that we are likely capturing the bulk of the antibody diversity. Together these data suggest that the number of B cell clones responding to CSP may be limited, potentially reducing the ability of the immune system to generate effective neutralizing antibodies.</p>

<title>CSP-binding antibodies undergo somatic hypermutation to improve affinity</title>
<p>Finally we were interested in knowing if the GC reaction we could see following sporozoite immunization was inducing higher affinity antibodies. We therefore examined our deep sequencing data to determine if CSP-specific antibodies had undergone somatic hypermutation (SHM) that would be indicative of B cells specific for CSP entering the GC. Taking advantage of the fact that our kappa chain primers capture the entire V-J sequences of the antibodies we sequenced we asked: 1) if the kappa chains shared between immune animals differed from the germline (providing evidence of SHM) and 2) if the mutations were conserved between different mice indicative of directed selection. Analysis of the reads from the kappa chains of the three immune mice showed that these had a much higher degree of mutation than bulk B cells from naïve mice, demonstrating SHM in the CSP-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). We further examined each specific common kappa chain in turn (IGVK1-110; IGKV1-135; IGVK5-43/45) comparing the sequences obtained from naïve B cells and (NANP)<sub>n</sub> specific cells in immune mice. This analysis showed that while, as expected, sequences from naïve mice contained few mutations, the sequences from immune mice had much higher levels of SHM. Importantly mutations were found to be concentrated in the CDR loops, and were frequently shared by immunized mice providing strong circumstantial evidence for affinity maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g008">Fig 8B</xref>; data for IGVK1-110 only shown).</p>

<p>To directly test if CSP-binding antibodies undergo affinity maturation we expressed the predicted germline precursor to the 2A10 antibody (2A10 gAb) in HEK293T cells. We identified the predicted germline precursors of the 2A10 heavy and light chains using the program V-quest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref041">41</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006469.s005">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006469.s006">S6</xref> Figs). This analysis identified the heavy chain as IGHV9-3; IGHD1-3; IGHJ4 and the light chain as IGKV10-94;IGKJ2, with the monoclonal antibody carrying 6 mutations in the heavy chain and 7 in the light chain. The 2A10 gAb had considerably lower binding in ELISA assays compared to the 2A10 mAb itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g008">Fig 8C</xref>), indicative that affinity maturation had taken place in this antibody. To determine the relative contribution of mutations in the heavy and light chain to enhancing binding we also made hybrid antibodies consisting of the mAb heavy chain and the gAb light chain and vice versa. Interestingly mutations in the light chain were almost entirely sufficient to explain the enhanced binding by the mAb compared to the gAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g008">Fig 8C</xref>).</p>
<p>To identify the specific mutations that were important we introduced the mutations individually into the gAb light chain construct. We prioritized mutations that were shared with the 27E antibody which has previously been found to be clonally related to 2A10 having been isolated from the same mouse and which shares the same germline heavy and light chains as the 2A10 mAb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref020">20</xref>]. We found that two mutations (L114F and T117V) in the CDR3 of the light chain appeared to account for most of the gain in binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). The effect of these antibodies appeared to be additive rather than synergistic as revealed by experiments in which we introduced these mutations simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). A further mutation close to the light chain CDR2 (H68Y) also caused a modest increase in binding. As expected mutations in the heavy chains appeared generally less important for increasing binding though M39I, N59I and T67F all gave modest increases in binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006469.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). Collectively our data suggest that CSP repeat antibodies can undergo SHM in GCs resulting in affinity maturation, however the antibody response may be limited by the number of naïve B cells that can recognize and respond to this antigen.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we provide an analysis of the structure of a <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> sporozoite-neutralizing antibody (2A10). Having obtained this structure we further modeled the binding 2A10 with its antigen target, the repeat region of CSP, and provide a thermodynamic characterization of this interaction. Finally, we used novel tetramer probes to identify and sort antigen specific B cells responding to sporozoite immunization in order to measure the diversity and maturation of the antibody response. We found that the avidity of 2A10 for the rCSP molecule was in the nanomolar range, which was much higher than the affinity previously predicted from competition ELISAs with small peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref023">23</xref>]. This affinity is a consequence of the multivalent nature of the interaction, with up to 6 antibodies being able to bind to each rCSP molecule. Our model suggests that to spatially accommodate this binding the antibodies must surround CSP in an off-set manner, which is possible due to the slight twist in the helical structure that CSP can adopt. It is notable that the twisted, repeating arrangement of the CSP linker is the only structure that would allow binding in the stoichiometry observed through the ITC. We further found that the diversity of the antibody repertoire to the CSP repeat was limited, perhaps due to the relative simplicity of the target epitope. However, these antibodies have undergone affinity maturation to improve affinity, potentially allowing protective immune responses to develop.</p>
<p>Using ITC we determined the dissociation constant of 2A10 for rCSP to be 2.7 nM, which is not unusual for a mouse mAb. However it is a tighter interaction than that predicted from competition ELISAs, which predicted a micro-molar affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref023">23</xref>]. However, these competition ELISAs were performed with short peptides rather than rCSP. Indeed, when we performed ITC with a short peptide and F<sub>AB</sub> fragments we too obtained a dissociation constant in the micro-molar range (0.42 μM). The difference between the F<sub>AB</sub> binding to the peptide and the tight interaction of the antibody binding to full length CSP appears to be driven by a high avidity, multivalent interaction. There is also additional enthalpic stabilization (per F<sub>AB</sub> domain) in the 2A10:CSP complex, although this is partially offset by the increased entropic cost associated with combining a large number of separate molecules into a single complex. One caveat of these data is that we used a slightly truncated repeat in our recombinant CSP, however it is likely that longer repeats will have further stabilization of the interaction that could result in even higher affinity interaction between CSP and binding antibodies.</p>
<p>The mechanism of sporozoite neutralization remains unclear, however our structural data may provide some insights. Repeat specific antibodies can directly neutralize sporozoites (without complement or other cell mediators) in the circumsporozoite reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref042">42</xref>]. Morevoer F<sub>AB</sub> fragments alone are sufficient to block invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref043">43</xref>]. However, it is well established that activation of complement and cell mediated immunity is important for the action of blood stage-specific antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref045">45</xref>]. It has also been suggested that the CSP repeat might act as a hinge allowing the N-terminal domain to mask the C-terminal domain which is believed to be important for binding to and invading hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref010">10</xref>]. Cleavage of this N-terminal domain is therefore required to expose the C-terminal domain and facilitate invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref010">10</xref>]. Antibody binding as observed here may disrupt this process in several ways, either by opening the hinge to induce the premature exposure of the C-terminal domain. Alternatively since the repeat region is directly adjacent to the proteolytic cleavage site, anti-repeat antibodies might function by sterically hindering access of the protease to CSP, thus preventing sporozoite invasion of the hepatocyte. One possible consequence of the requirement for mutivalency to increase the avidity of the antibody, is that antibodies with different binding modes may interfere with each other limiting their effectiveness.</p>
<p>Our results uncovering how neutralizing antibodies bind to CSP has several implications for understanding the development of the immune response to CSP. Notably the finding that the CSP molecule can be bound by multiple antibodies/B cell receptors raises the possibility that this molecule can indeed crosslink multiple BCRs and potentially act as a type-II T independent antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref017">17</xref>]. We find that indeed there is a T-independent component to the response to CSP, though T cells are required to sustain the immune response beyond day 7. As such the response to CSP appears follow a similar process to that seen for several oligomeric viral entry proteins, which induce a mix of T-independent and T-dependent responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref019">19</xref>]. It maybe that T-independent responses are driven by the density of CSP molecules on the sporozoite surface; however, rCSP can also induce a small T-independent response. This suggests that the CSP protein alone is sufficient to crosslink multiple BCRs on the B cell surface which is consistent with our structural model. Interestingly, the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine based on that contains 18 CSP repeats and does appear to induce high titers of anti-CSP antibodies which initially decline rapidly and are then more stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref046">46</xref>]. This may be consistent with the induction of a short-lived a type-II T-independent plasmablast response (accounting for the initial burst of antibodies), followed by a T-dependent response (which may be the basis of the more sustained antibody titers). The relative contributions of short-lived antibody production and long-term B cell memory to protection is an area for future investigation.</p>
<p>The finding of a limited repertoire in the BCR sequences specific for the (NANP)<sub>n</sub> repeat contradicts previous suggestions that the response to CSP might be broad and polyclonal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref038">38</xref>]. One explanation for this limited antibody diversity is that the antigenic simplicity of the CSP repeat region limits the range of antibodies that are capable of responding. A prior example of this is the antibodies to the Rhesus (Rh) D antigen. The RhD antigen differs from RhC by only 35–36 amino acids, resulting in the creation of a minimal B cell epitope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref047">47</xref>]. The repertoire of antibodies that can bind this epitope are accordingly limited and mainly based on the VH3-33 gene family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref048">48</xref>]. Another potential explanation for a limited antibody repertoire could be that the (NANP)<sub>n</sub> repeat shares structural similarity with a self-antigen as is speculated to happen with meningococcus type B antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref049">49</xref>], however it is not clear what this self-antigen might be. One potential outcome of this finding is that if each B cell clone has a finite burst size this may limit the magnitude of the overall B cell response.</p>
<p>One area for future investigation is to determine the binding modes and sporozoite neutralizing capacities of other antibodies in the response. It is clear that not all CSP-repeat binding antibodies have the same capacity for sporozoite neutralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref007">7</xref>]. As such the finding of a limited repertoire of responding B cells may lead to the possibility that some people have holes in their antibody repertoires limiting their ability to make neutralizing antibodies. This may explain why, while there is a broad correlation between ELISA tires of antibodies to the CSP repeat and protection following RTS,S vaccination, there is no clear threshold for protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>While our work has been performed with mouse antibodies, there are major similarities between mouse and human antibody loop structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref050">50</xref>]. The main difference between the two species is the considerably more diverse heavy chain CDR3 regions that are found in human antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref051">51</xref>]. Consequently, this leads to a much larger number of unique clones found in humans compared to mice. However, the number of different V, D and J genes and the recombination that follows are relatively similar between humans and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref052">52</xref>]. From our data it can be observed that while the BCR repertoire was restricted in the V gene usage, these different V gene populations were represented in multiple unique clones, suggesting that increasing the number of clones is unlikely to substantially increase V-region usage. Our analysis was performed on inbred mice which may also limit repertoire diversity, however studies on the human IGHV locus reveal that in any given individual ~80% V region genes are identical between the maternal and paternal allele i.e. heterozygosity is not a major driver of human V region diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref054">54</xref>]. It is notable that all 4 human monoclonal antibodies described to date from different volunteers share the use of the IGHV3-30 gene family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006469.ref022">22</xref>], suggesting that in humans as well as mice there may indeed be a constrained repertoire of responding B cells.</p>
<p>Overall our data provide important insights into how the antibody response to CSP develops. Our results also help explain why relatively large amounts of antibodies are required for sporozoite neutralization and suggest that the ability to generate an effective B cell response may be limited by the very simplicity of the repeat epitope. These data support previous suggestions that CSP may be a suboptimal target for vaccination. However, we also find that CSP binding antibodies can undergo somatic hypermutation and reach high affinities. This suggests if we can develop vaccination strategies to diversify the repertoire of responding B cells and favor the GC response it may be possible to generate long-term protective immunity targeting this major vaccine candidate antigen.</p>

<p>Statistical analysis was performed using Prism6 (GraphPad) for simple T tests and one-way ANOVAs from single experiments. Where data were pooled from multiple experiments, analysis was performed using linear mixed models in R version 3.3.3 (R foundation for Statistical Computing). Linear mixed models are a regression analysis model containing both fixed and random effects: fixed effects being the variable/treatment under examination, whilst random effects are unintended factors that may influence the variable being measured. If significance was found from running a linear mixed model, pair-wise comparisons of the least significant differences of means (LSD) was undertaken to determine at which level interactions were occurring. Statistical significance was assumed if the <italic>p</italic>-value was &lt; 0.05 for a tested difference.

<title>Cluster analysis for MD simulations of (NANP)<sub>6</sub> peptide.</title>
<p>Conformations were clustered by concatenating the trajectory and performing a Jarvis-Patrick analysis. The clusters are sorted by their RMSD from the first cluster (starting geometry). As shown, Run 2 is stable in the starting geometry for several ns, while Run 3 diverged, then reconverged to the starting geometry, where it was stable for several ns. These data suggest the quasi-helical structure observed from the ab initio calculations is stable, and can be spontaneously sampled, on a timescale of several ns.</p>
