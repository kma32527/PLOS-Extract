<abstract>
<p>Diverse enteropathogen exposures associate with childhood malnutrition. To elucidate mechanistic pathways whereby enteric microbes interact during malnutrition, we used protein deficiency in mice to develop a new model of co-enteropathogen enteropathy. Focusing on common enteropathogens in malnourished children, <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> and enteroaggregative <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EAEC), we provide new insights into intersecting pathogen-specific mechanisms that enhance malnutrition. We show for the first time that during protein malnutrition, the intestinal microbiota permits persistent <italic>Giardia</italic> colonization and simultaneously contributes to growth impairment. Despite signals of intestinal injury, such as IL1α, <italic>Giardia</italic>-infected mice lack pro-inflammatory intestinal responses, similar to endemic pediatric <italic>Giardia</italic> infections. Rather, <italic>Giardia</italic> perturbs microbial host co-metabolites of proteolysis during growth impairment, whereas host nicotinamide utilization adaptations that correspond with growth recovery increase. EAEC promotes intestinal inflammation and markers of myeloid cell activation. During co-infection, intestinal inflammatory signaling and cellular recruitment responses to EAEC are preserved together with a <italic>Giardia</italic>-mediated diminishment in myeloid cell activation. Conversely, EAEC extinguishes markers of host energy expenditure regulatory responses to <italic>Giardia</italic>, as host metabolic adaptations appear exhausted. Integrating immunologic and metabolic profiles during co-pathogen infection and malnutrition, we develop a working mechanistic model of how cumulative diet-induced and pathogen-triggered microbial perturbations result in an increasingly wasted host.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Malnourished children are exposed to multiple sequential, and oftentimes, persistent enteropathogens. Intestinal microbial disruption and inflammation are known to contribute to the pathogenesis of malnutrition, but how co-pathogens interact with each other, with the resident microbiota, or with the host to alter these pathways is unknown. Using a new model of enteric co-infection with <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> and enteroaggregative <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> in mice fed a protein deficient diet, we identify host growth and intestinal immune responses that are differentially mediated by pathogen-microbe interactions, including parasite-mediated changes in intestinal microbial host co-metabolism, and altered immune responses during co-infection. Our data model how early life cumulative enteropathogen exposures progressively disrupt intestinal immunity and host metabolism during crucial developmental periods. Furthermore, studies in this co-infection model reveal new insights into environmental and microbial determinants of pathogenicity for presently common, but poorly understood enteropathogens like <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic>, that may not conform to existing paradigms of microbial pathogenesis based on single pathogen-designed models.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Childhood malnutrition and its resultant host developmental, metabolic, and immunologic sequelae continue to affect 156 million children less than five years of age worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref001">1</xref>]. Impaired child growth attainment is epidemiologically associated with 1) alterations in resident intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref002">2</xref>]; 2) increased susceptibility to multiple concurrent and recurrent enteric pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref004">4</xref>]; 3) intestinal dysfunction together with markers of increased intestinal myeloid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref005">5</xref>] and T-cell activation (termed Environmental Enteropathy (EE))[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref006">6</xref>]; and 4) perturbations in gut microbial-host co-metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref007">7</xref>]. Emerging data from the Malnutrition and Enteric Diseases (Mal-ED) multisite international study has revealed that cumulative pathogen exposures confer a high associated risk for poor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref008">8</xref>].

Elucidating mechanistic pathways by which these diverse microbial triggers interact to potentiate the malnourished condition could improve restorative interventions for malnourished children. Indeed, data from randomized control therapeutic trials expose knowledge gaps in our biological understanding of microbial drivers of malnutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref015">15</xref>]. Inconsistent or only partial benefits are achieved from interventions that target a single component of this pathogenesis such as nutrient supplementation alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref011">11</xref>] or in combination with broad-spectrum antibacterials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref013">13</xref>], anti-parasitic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref014">14</xref>], or anti-inflammatory agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref015">15</xref>]. Furthermore, field studies of endemic pediatric <italic>Giardia</italic> have associated <italic>Giardia</italic> with decreased risk of severe diarrhea and inflammatory biomarkers of EE, yet increased risk for growth impairment, suggesting that for some pathogens, novel pathways may contribute to impaired child development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Using murine models of malnutrition that result in diet-dependent changes in the microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref016">16</xref>] we have published that challenge with the human EAEC isolate (strain 042) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref017">17</xref>] or <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lamblia</italic> (assemblage B, strain H3, cysts) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref018">18</xref>] is sufficient to impair growth and disrupt mucosal architecture, but with unique intestinal pathologies. We have not previously investigated whether and how these individual pathogens interact with the resident microbiota or with one another, in part due to the use of antimicrobial mediated microbiota depletion to support human pathogen colonization in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref021">21</xref>]. Also, although xenotransplantation of feces from discordant healthy and malnourished children into gnotobiotic murine recipients demonstrate the functional ability of human-derived microbial communities to selectively recapitulate phenotypes of undernutrition, dysbiosis, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref022">22</xref>], and disrupted metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref023">23</xref>], these studies are only beginning to examine the influence of enteropathogenic bacteria accompanying the dysbiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref023">23</xref>] and have yet to uncouple these effects from direct or residual influences of intestinal eukaryotes also present in donor feces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref001">1</xref>]. Thus, while existing murine models provide insight into individual nutritional and microbial triggers that influence gut function, metabolism, and host growth, none to date have intentionally examined the integrated effects of dysbiosis with sequential and diverse pathogen exposures common in malnourished children.</p>
<p>To address how gut microbial adaptations to undernutrition combine with cumulative enteropathogen burdens to influence host growth, mucosal immune responses, and metabolism, we developed a new integrated model of protein-malnutrition induced microbial disruption and multi-pathogen enteropathy. <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lamblia</italic> and EAEC, pathogens commonly detected in malnourished children, were selected as pathogens of interest. In addition to identifying new pathogen-specific pathways that contribute to malnutrition, we demonstrate co-modulation of mucosal immune and metabolic responses that converge to worsen host growth. Furthermore, gut microbial-mediated proteolysis was amplified in the increasingly wasted host along with exhaustion of co-metabolic adaptations in energy regulatory and compensatory metabolic pathways.</p>

<title><italic>Giardia</italic> overcomes microbiota-mediated pathogen clearance during protein malnutrition, and combines with protein malnutrition to promote growth impairment, small intestinal 16S abundance, and altered mucosal immunity</title>
<p>Murine intestinal microbiota can differentially prevent prolonged <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> colonization, even in T and B-cell deficient hosts.

But unlike clearance following <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lamblia</italic> (Assemblage A, strain WB trophozoites) challenge, <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lamblia</italic> H3 shedding increases by ~ 2 logs after day 9 and remains consistent through 4–6 weeks together with small intestinal trophozoite colonization (persistent infection) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref018">18</xref>]. To test the hypothesis that the disrupted intestinal 16S community during protein malnutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref016">16</xref>] would functionally impair microbiota-mediated colonization resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref024">24</xref>], we eliminated Abx from the model. Weaned mice were fed either a protein deficient (2% protein) diet (PD) or an isocaloric but protein sufficient (20% protein) control diet (CD) for 15 days prior to challenge with 10<sup>6</sup> <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lamblia</italic> H3 (Assemblage B) cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).

<p>Similar to what we observed previously in abx-treated mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref018">18</xref>], protein deficiency combined with <italic>Giardia</italic> to impair host growth (P&lt;0.05 PD-<italic>Giardia</italic> vs uninfected CD-fed control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). <italic>Giardia</italic> infection in mice fed a PD diet also had greater duodenal bacterial abundance, measured by both universal 16S rRNA qPCR/gram tissue and V3-V4 specific amplicon product, than infected mice fed CD (P&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). Consistent with several features of microbial alterations in both malnourished children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref025">25</xref>] and protein-deficient diet fed mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref026">26</xref>], the duodenal 16S rRNA composition in mice fed PD demonstrated an increased Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006471.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) that was mainly driven by an increase in the abundance of Clostridiales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). <italic>Giardia</italic> tended to enhance this skew towards Firmicutes together with a reduction in Bacteroidetes from 12%—7% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). Thus, rather than excluding <italic>Giardia</italic>, the small intestinal microbiota in mice fed the protein deficient diet permitted persistent <italic>Giardia</italic> infection whereas abx were necessary for prolonged parasite detection in mice fed the CD diet.</p>
<p>To examine whether PD in this model had interfered with protective mucosal responses against <italic>Giardia</italic> we performed flow cytometry on upper small intestinal lamina propria in the same mice. Regardless of infection, mice fed PD demonstrated a skew toward increased myeloid cells (CD11b<sup>+</sup>) with reciprocal reductions in T-cells (CD3ε<sup>+</sup>) among CD45<sup>+</sup> cells analyzed compared with mice fed the CD-diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g001">Fig 1I</xref>).

Concurrently, we analyzed mucosal production of key cytokines that promote <italic>Giardia</italic> clearance, such as IL-6 and IL-17A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref028">28</xref>], compared with those that resembled the profile of prolonged infections in children (increased IL-4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref028">28</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g001">Fig 1J</xref>). Corresponding to persistent infection, mice fed PD demonstrated a trend toward decreased IL-6, IL-17A, and IL12p40, with a significant increase in IL-4 (P&lt;0.05 for IL-4), irrespective of <italic>Giardia</italic> infection.</p>

Calprotectin (Cp), another marker of myeloid cell activation, was elevated only in EAEC042 mono-infected animals, but was decreased in any <italic>Giardia</italic> infected group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Lipocalin-2 (LCN), a marker of either neutrophil or epithelial cell activation was elevated only in <italic>Giardia-</italic>infected mice regardless of EAEC co-infection.</p>
<p>Immune responses in the mucosal compartment were also altered in persistent <italic>Giardia</italic> infected mice later challenged with EAEC. EAEC infection led to significant increases in myeloid lineage (CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells) in the ileum at 17 dpi <italic>Giardia</italic> challenge and 3 dpi EAEC challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). The increased proportion of lymphocytes (both CD3ε<sup>+</sup> and B220<sup>+</sup> cells) at 28 dpi <italic>Giardia</italic> challenge and 14 dpi EAEC challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g003">Fig 3H</xref>) was similar in either EAEC mono-infected or co-infected mice. In contrast, total LPLs, particularly lymphocytes (CD3ε+ and B220+ cells) were decreased during persistent (17 dpi) <italic>Giardia</italic> infection compared with uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006471.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Using a broad-based luminex 32-plex panel we performed an unbiased analysis of cytokine and chemokine responses on all protein deficient diet fed mice at 17 dpi <italic>Giardia</italic> challenge and 3 dpi EAEC challenge. We detected 28 of 32 targets in at least 2 mice in each group that are shown as fold change relative to uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g003">Fig 3I</xref>). Both pathogens modulated the cytokine/chemokine response alone and during co-infection. In all conditions, IL1α, a pro-inflammatory alarmin that is released by enterocytes during intestinal injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref030">30</xref>], was elevated in all groups and reached significance in <italic>Giardia</italic> infected mice (~30-fold) and robustly increased in co-infection (~80-fold). IL-9 was significantly elevated in <italic>Giardia</italic> mono-infected and by ~20-fold in co-infected mice, together with a tendency towards greater IL-4 and IL-13. Each group demonstrated a decrease in IFNγ, that was significant in EAEC mono-infected mice. CCL5 was elevated (~2 fold) in EAEC infected and co-infected mice. Consistent with the early expansion of myeloid cells in EAEC infected mice, CXCL8 (IL-8/KC) was also elevated in EAEC and co-infected mice (~1.6 fold). CCL11 (eotaxin) was uniquely elevated (~6-fold) only in co-infected mice. This change corresponded to a trend toward increased eosinophils (CD45<sup>+</sup>SiglecF<sup>+</sup>) among myeloid cells in co-infected compared with EAEC mono-infected mice (52% vs 39%, ns) at later timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). Changes in select cytokines and chemokines in <italic>Giardia</italic> mono-infected mice from early (5 dpi) to persistent (17 dpi) timepoints compared with uninfected controls revealed alterations in mucosal immune responses during persistent <italic>Giardia</italic> infection. <italic>Giardia</italic> lead to progressive increases in IL-1α (P&lt;0.05) and IL-2 (P&lt;0.05) as well as IL-4 and IL-13, but IFNγ progressively decreased (P&lt;0.05) in persistently infected mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006471.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) coefficient plots identified a range of urinary metabolic perturbations induced by <italic>Giardia</italic> infection on both day 7 and day 13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) (Q<sup>2</sup>Y = 0.40; P = 0.02 vs uninfected PBS controls) many of which were also elevated in co-infected compared with EAEC mono-infected mice (Q<sup>2</sup>Y = 0.82; p = 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). We observed no significant difference in the OPLS-DA metabolic profiles of <italic>Giardia</italic> infected mice between day 7 or 13 days post-challenge (Q<sup>2</sup>Y = 0.33 R<sup>2</sup>X = 0.24, P = 0.12). Significantly altered metabolites are summarized in a heat map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g004">Fig 4E</xref> along with their correlation to class membership. Focusing first on metabolites unique to <italic>Giardia</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g004">Fig 4E</xref>), consistent with <italic>Giardia</italic> trophozoite reliance upon on host-derived lipids for membrane synthesis and optimal growth (ie. lecithin, gylcocholic and taurocholic bile) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref031">31</xref>], <italic>Giardia</italic>-infected mice demonstrated increased excretion of bile acid constituents, phosphatidylcholine (PC) coupled with choline breakdown metabolites methylamine (MA) and dimethylamine (DMA) and the taurine metabolite isethionate. These indicators of bile acid deconjugation and lipid breakdown were present on both day 7 and day 13 post-<italic>Giardia</italic> challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Increases in MA and DMA occurred independent of a concurrent increase in the microbial-dependent precursor trimethylamine (TMA) or its hepatic oxidized metabolite TMAO, a biochemical pattern resembling that observed with Kwashiorkor-type malnutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref001">1</xref>], and were thus suggestive of increased choline availability in the small intestine rather than downstream gut microbial-dependent choline breakdown. Alanine, a by-product of <italic>Giardia</italic> glucose fermentation, was elevated at day 13 post-<italic>Giardia</italic> challenge in mono-infected mice, while pipecolic acid, one of the most abundant amino acid byproducts of <italic>Giardia</italic> metabolism <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref032">32</xref>] was identified in <italic>Giardia-</italic>infected mice at both timepoints, regardless of co-infection. <italic>Giardia</italic> also enhanced gut microbial-host co-metabolites of aromatic amino acids including tyrosine (4-cresol glucuronide (4-CG) and 4-cresyl sulfate (4-CS) and 4-hydroxyphenylacetyl (4-HPA) sulfate), tryptophan (3-indoxyl sulfate (3-IS) and indole-3-acetylglycine (IAG)), and phenylalanine (phenylacetylglycine (PAG)). Increases in urinary β-oxidation metabolites, accumulation of the early tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate <italic>cis</italic>-aconitate, and changes in muscle metabolites creatine and creatinine indicated altered host energy utilization in <italic>Giardia</italic>-infected mice. In addition, methylated nicotinamide derivatives capable of regulating energy expenditure (<italic>N</italic>-methylnicotinamide (NMND) and nicotinamide-N-oxide (NAO)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref023">23</xref>] were increased in <italic>Giardia</italic> infected mice. Consistent with the finding that increased urinary NMND predicts catch-up growth in undernourished children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref007">7</xref>], persistently <italic>Giardia-</italic>infected mice fed the protein deficient diet developed ‘overshoot’ growth gains compared with uninfected age and diet-matched controls upon re-nourishment (switched from the PD to the CD diet on 42 dpi) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006471.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>Giardia-</italic>induced changes in gut microbial host co-metabolites of proteolysis either persisted (4-HPA sulfate, IAG) or overlapped (PAG, 4-CG, 4-CS) with those seen during EAEC infection alone, and these metabolites were even further magnified in co-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). However, EAEC-mediated increases in TMA and TMAO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g004">Fig 4E</xref>), indicative of microbial-dependent choline breakdown, were reversed in <italic>Giardia</italic> co-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g004">Fig 4E</xref>), and resembled the metabolic perturbation in choline metabolism of <italic>Giardia</italic> infection alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Similarly, elevated taurine excretion in <italic>Giardia-</italic> infected mice persisted through co-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Whereas either infection increased lipid oxidation evident in increased β-oxidation breakdown products (hexanoylglycine, butyrylglycine, and isovalarylglycine) along with the β-oxidation pathway precursor acetyl-carnitine, metabolism during co-infection shifted away from β-oxidation as indicated by a decrease in acetyl-carnitine and downstream β-oxidation metabolites. Concurrently, co-infection led to an inversion of creatine:creatinine ratios, suggesting altered muscle metabolism compared with either infection alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Finally, host energy expenditure adaptations via the nicotinamide pathway (NMND and NAO) during <italic>Giardia</italic> infection alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g004">Fig 4E</xref>) were extinguished following EAEC co-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g004">Fig 4E</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Multiple and diverse pathogen exposures are hypothesized to cause intestinal dysfunction, also termed Environmental Enteropathy (EE), in malnourished children. In the present study, we modeled co-infection with two of the most commonly isolated pathogens in malnourished children, <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> and enteroaggregative <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EAEC). We used protein deficiency in weaned mice to investigate how microbial-specific pathways intersect to impair host growth, mucosal inflammation, and metabolism during malnutrition. Our integrated nutritional, microbial, immunological, and metabolic observations add insight into how changes in resident microbiota combine with cumulative enteropathogen exposures to interfere with host growth and metabolic adaptations to protein malnutrition. For the first time we demonstrate that a resident microbiota that is permissive to enteropathogen colonization also simultaneously promotes growth impairment during persistent <italic>Giardia</italic> infection. Although <italic>Giardia</italic> was insufficient to induce intestinal inflammation characteristic of EE-like changes, despite evidence of mucosal injury (IL1α), the parasite had a profound effect on gut microbial-host co-metabolism. EAEC, on the other hand, promoted robust expansion of lamina propria cells coupled with secretion of myeloid (CXCL8 (IL-8)) and lymphoid (CCL5) chemokines. Together, these pathogens synergistically increased signals of intestinal injury, IL1α, and CCL11. EAEC-dependent increases in myeloid cells were preserved in co-infected mice; however, persistent <italic>Giardia</italic> infection resulted in diminished myeloid cell specific activation markers (Cp and to a lesser degree MPO) consistent with parasite-mediated alterations in host immune pro-inflammatory responses. Strikingly, these non-invasive co-pathogens resulted in an increasingly proteolytic microbiota that dominated the co-metabolic profile (specifically leading to increased tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine co-metabolites), despite relatively restricted changes in the 16S rRNA composition. Simultaneously, host metabolic adaptation to protein deficiency progressively declined, eventually resulting in the loss of host-mediated nicotinamide-pathway energy regulation, and disrupting lipid oxidation up-regulation and muscle metabolism in the increasingly malnourished host. A working model of these specific pathogen-mediated microbial, immunologic, and metabolic alterations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g005">Fig 5</xref>.</p>

<title>Co-enteropathogens co-modulate host immune and metabolic responses during protein deficiency that converge to worsen malnutrition.</title>
<p>Integrated studies identified that protein deficiency (Column A) results in an increase (red) in microbial host co-metabolites of tryptophan (3-indoxyl sulfate, 3-IS) as well as choline (dimethylamine, DMA; trimethylamine, TMA; and trimethylamine oxide, TMAO) whereas endogenous choline and taurine excretion were decreased (blue). Host metabolism indicated increased carbohydrate metabolism through the tricarboxyclic acid cycle (TCA) and decreased β-oxidation metabolites. Methylation of nicotinamide was increased leading to increased N-methyl nicotinamide (NMND). The intestinal microbiota during protein deficiency are ‘immature’ and result in increased pathogen susceptibility. This microbiota restructuring is accompanied by proportionally increased myeloid cells in the lamina propria, but decreased lymphocytes and a Th2&gt;Th1 skew. During <italic>Giardia</italic> infection (light orange) (Column B), there are unique metabolites (such as pipecolic acid and alanine). Additional increases in metabolites of tryptophan (indole-3-acetylglycine), phenylalanine (phenylacetylglycine, PAG; 4-hydroxyphenylacetyl (4-HPA) sulfate), and tyrosine (4-cresyl sulfate, 4-CS, and 4-cresolglucuronide 4-CG) indicate further microbial-mediated proteolysis, whereas increased choline, posphatidylcholine (PC), MA and DMA suggest increased choline absorption and decreased TMA indicates limited microbial choline breakdown. These metabolic changes occur despite little perturbation in the intestinal microbial composition. Host metabolism through TCA is shutdown, limiting production of NAD(H), however, NMND excretion is further increased, suggesting generation of nicotinamide through alternative pathways such as tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase (TDO). <italic>Giardia</italic> further depletes lymphocytes in the intestinal mucosa while enhancing the Th2&gt;Th1 skew, despite signals of intestinal injury IL1α and lipocalin-2 (LCN-2). EAEC infection (dark orange) (Column D) similarly enhances microbial proteolytic metabolites, though tryptophan is broken down to 3-IS rather than IAG. Increased intestinal microbial choline metabolism leads to increases in TMA and TMAO, opposite to <italic>Giardia</italic> infection. Although host TCA metabolism is diminished as occurs during <italic>Giardia</italic> infection, NMND is not increased. Rather, cellular expansion of lymphocytes in response to EAEC and the broadly acting chemokine CCL5 limits alternative nicotinamide generation pathways through the actions of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO). EAEC also enhances myeloid cell recruitment with concurrent increases in IL-8. During co-infection (rust) (Column C) the microbial host co-metabolites resemble those occurring during <italic>Giardia</italic> infection alone, however, host metabolic compensatory responses are lost. Unique metabolic products of <italic>Giardia</italic> metabolism, such as pipecolic acid, are detectable. Inflammatory cell recruitment resembles EAEC infection, but with a <italic>Giardia</italic>-mediated altered immune response profile, with the unique elevation of CCL11. Fecal markers of myeloid activation that are diminished during <italic>Giardia</italic> infection are also attenuated during co-infection, implicating either parasite- or metabolite-induced changes in myeloid cell phenotypes. <sup><underline>1</underline></sup><underline>Mayneris-Perxachs, et al. 2016</underline> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref016">16</xref>] <sup>2</sup> <underline>Bartelt, et al. 2015</underline> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref035">35</xref>].</p>

<p>Our findings support that an ability to better compete for restricted resources in the intestinal environment is one mechanism whereby enteropathogens may more successfully infect malnourished hosts. For example, the protein deficient diet contains 0.34% rather than the 3.4% arginine contained in the 20% protein sufficient control diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref016">16</xref>]. In weaned mice, this protein deficient diet recapitulates several dysbiotic features described in malnourished children: altered maturation of the fecal intestinal microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref033">33</xref>], increased susceptibility to <italic>Giardia</italic> and EAEC, and increased microbial-mediated tryptophan breakdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref016">16</xref>]. In the present study we also observed an altered Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio in the protein deficient diet-fed mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref025">25</xref>], that was modestly increased at early timepoints after <italic>Giardia</italic> infection. In contrast arginine-supplementation has been shown to increase the abundance of Bacteroidetes relative to Firmicutes in the small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref034">34</xref>]. Since <italic>Giardia</italic> is a microaerophilic protozoan that can utilize either glucose or arginine for growth and replication, we speculate that a diet-dependent decrease in Bacteroidetes reduced bacterial competition for arginine. A limitation of 1H-NMR profiling is an inability to directly detect arginine metabolites (ornithine, citrulline), and thus we could not determine whether <italic>Giardia</italic> infection was sufficient to further magnify host arginine deficiency. However, consistent with <italic>Giardia</italic> use of arginine in order to evade host immune defenses through arginine-deiminase (ADI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref035">35</xref>], the continued decline in IFNγ in mice infected with <italic>Giardia</italic> could be a result of the actions of <italic>Giardia</italic> ADI to skew dendritic cell TLR-responses away from pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref036">36</xref>]. Furthermore, a reduction in B-cells as seen in <italic>Giardia</italic> infected mice, is similar to other models of arginine deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref037">37</xref>]. Also, unlike arginine-mediated increases in Bacteroidetes that can enhance TLR-dependent mucosal immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref038">38</xref>] similar to some specific <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> that facilitate <italic>Giardia</italic> clearance in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref034">34</xref>], the protein deficient diet led to decreases in pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with <italic>Giardia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref040">40</xref>] or EAEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref041">41</xref>] clearance: namely IL-6, IL-17A, and IFNγ. Rather, reciprocal increases in IL-4, a correlate of prolonged duration of <italic>Giardia</italic> shedding in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref042">42</xref>] were seen. Interestingly, like the arrested maturation of the microbiota during protein deficient conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref016">16</xref>], this relative shift toward a predominately Th2-type cytokine mileu also resembles that of the neonatal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref043">43</xref>]. This Th2-type cytokine shift can also be differentially induced via upregulation of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in response to Firmicutes-rich altered Schaedler flora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref044">44</xref>]. These collective findings suggest that the isolated protein deficiency in this model establishes a threshold nutrient deficiency that is sufficient to disrupt microbiota-mediated pathogen exclusion, and adds insights into why postnatal <italic>Giardia</italic> acquisition (up to 6 months of age) may be such a vulnerable period for longitudinal growth impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref045">45</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite variation among reports, many epidemiologic studies in malnourished children reveal that early and persistent <italic>Giardia</italic> associates with impaired growth attainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref045">45</xref>] despite inversely decreased stool markers of EE-like inflammation myeloperoxidase (MPO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref007">7</xref>] and the T-cell activation marker neopterin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref046">46</xref>]. Also, there is an apparent decreased risk for acute diarrhea and diminished markers of systemic inflammation in children infected with <italic>Giardia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref047">47</xref>] that may be abolished following multi-nutrient supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref048">48</xref>]. It was critical, therefore, to examine how <italic>Giardia</italic> interacted alone and during co-infection. Previous findings have shown that bacteria cultivated from jejunal aspirates of patients with symptomatic giardiasis elicit more inflammation in germ free mice than axenized <italic>Giardia</italic> trophozoites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref049">49</xref>], and that <italic>Giardia</italic> increased bacterial mucosal translocation, even after parasite clearance in some animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref051">51</xref>]. This led us to hypothesize that bacteria may similarly influence growth outcomes during giardiasis. Using continuous antibiotic exposures, we show for the first time that these interactions are crucial for host growth attainment. However, unlike the same antibiotic cocktail that led to reduced CD8<sup>+</sup>T-cell activation and consequently, decreased host-mediated immunopathogenesis in another <italic>Giardia</italic> model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref052">52</xref>], we did not see significant inflammation in the mucosa of protein deficient diet fed infected mice. Therefore, the primary driver of growth impairment in this model appears to be a <italic>Giardia</italic>-mediated disruption in microbial-host metabolism. These data support that one mechanism of <italic>Giardia</italic>-mediated growth faltering is through an altered intestinal ecology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref053">53</xref>]. For example, pipecolic acid, a byproduct of lysine degradation that is significantly increased in <italic>Giardia</italic> spent media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref032">32</xref>], was uniquely detected only in <italic>Giardia-</italic>infected or co-infected mice, and could represent a pathway whereby intestinal parasites limit luminal availability of essential amino acids in the undernourished host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref016">16</xref>]. Our findings of increased phosphatidylcholine (PC), choline, and taurine/isothionate in <italic>Giardia</italic> infected mice, may also indicate disrupted lipid metabolism through the parasite’s consumption of bile salts (independent of known expression of bile-salt hydrolases) and acquisition/turnover of exogenous lipids in the small intestine via phospholipid-transporting transmembrane proteins (such as flipases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref032">32</xref>], as well as choline kinases and phosphatidylcholine synthases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref032">32</xref>]. These perturbations in bile acid and/or lipid homoestasis could have implications for growth in malnourished children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref054">54</xref>]. Finally, urinary alanine, a unique byproduct of <italic>Giardia</italic> glucose fermentation under low-oxygen tension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref055">55</xref>], was elevated together with relative increases in fecal Clostridiales, suggesting an increased anaerobic environment in the <italic>Giardia</italic> infected mice on a protein deficient diet. Other microbial-dependent urinary metabolites that are altered during <italic>Giardia</italic> infection are not known to be direct products of <italic>Giardia</italic> metabolism: such as MA, DMA, and TMA as well as metabolites of aromatic amino acid breakdown (ie. PAG (phenylalanine), 4-CS/4-CG (tyrosine), and 3-IS/3-IAG (tryptophan)). Also, since EAEC alone also fueled microbial-dependent proteolysis of aromatic amino acids with the exception of 4-HPA sulfate, a breakdown product of tyramine that may be another unique metabolite of <italic>Giardia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref032">32</xref>], we suspect these markers of amino acid catabolism indicate products of bacterial metabolism. Since decreases in the dietary constituents sucrose and tartrate in either <italic>Giardia</italic> or EAEC infected mice suggested reduced exogenous protein intake, this metabolic shift could have resulted from microbial degradation of host derived proteins, potentially released from injured or sloughted epithelial cells or leakage across disrupted tight-junctions. Furthermore, since these same proteolytic metabolites have been identified in undernourished children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref007">7</xref>], and were present together with an uncoupling of TCA intermediates in Kwashiorkor-associated dysbiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref001">1</xref>] our findings raise the need to elucidate the role of <italic>Giardia</italic> and EAEC in metabolic-based studies in human infections. Also, follow-up integrated proteomic and metabolomics analyses across various <italic>Giardia</italic> and EAEC strains could greatly expand the presently limited systems biology databases of these and other enteropathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref056">56</xref>].</p>
<p>Our data raise important considerations for host mucosal immune consequences of multi-enteropathogen infections in malnourished children. The lack of intestinal inflammation seen in these protein deficient diet fed mice during persistent <italic>Giardia</italic> infection is reminiscent of the majority of intestinal biopsies in children with <italic>Giardia</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref009">9</xref>]. This is in contrast to the persistent inflammation seen in symptomatic chronic giardiasis in adult humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref057">57</xref>] as we previously reported in Abx-treated otherwise healthy nourished chronically infected mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref018">18</xref>]. Rather, our findings that <italic>Giardia</italic> potentiated signals of intestinal injury (mucosal IL1α and CCL11 and luminal LCN-2), but dampened markers of myeloid activation (MPO and Calprotectin) during EAEC co-infection suggests the <italic>Giardia</italic>-mediated mucosal immune modulation may have led to inappropriate and deleterious responses to bacterial co-infection. Notably, these findings in a persistent <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lamblia</italic> assemblage B infection model demonstrate a potentially different mechanism of <italic>Giardia</italic>-induced immune modulation compared to prior reports of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lamblia</italic> assemblage A-dependent cathepsin-B mediated cleavage of IL-8 that led to reduced myeloid cell chemotactic responses described by Cotton, et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref021">21</xref>]. Rather, prior <italic>Giardia</italic> infection resulted in greater IL-4 and IL-13 and increased IL-9, a potential marker of mast cell activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref058">58</xref>]. The elevated CCL11 but reduced calprotectin together with an increase in Th2-type cytokines, could be consistent with the presence of intermediate-type macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref059">59</xref>] that were recently found to expand following <italic>Giardia</italic> challenge in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref060">60</xref>]. Additional studies inclusive of more stringent flow cytometry characterization are needed to investigate the mechanisms driving this altered response. Future mechanistic studies, for example, are planned to determine whether this phenotype is the result of potential taurine-dependent inhibition of NFκB signaling in host macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref061">61</xref>].</p>
<p>Integrating metabolic data with altered mucosal immune responses, we identify putative microbial-mediated mechanisms driving the severity of malnutrition with cumulative pathogen exposures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006471.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Tryptophan, for example is required for protein synthesis and optimal host growth, but its fate is highly influenced by intestinal microbial metabolism as well as competing host tissue-compartmentalized metabolic and immune stressors. During cytokine-mediated chronic inflammation, tryptophan is metabolized in the kynurenine pathway via upregulation of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) that promotes local T-cell proliferation, switching from Th17 to T- regulatory phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref062">62</xref>] and IL-22 mediated homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref063">63</xref>]. Alternatively, tryptophan is an important route of nicotinamide synthesis via hepatic tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase (TDO). This production of nicotinamide increases available nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>), an essential co-factor for tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) metabolism and preservation of oxidative phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref064">64</xref>]. Low serum tryptophan levels as well as increases in tryptophan degradation via IDO in the kynurenine pathway have been documented in malnourished children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref065">65</xref>], whereas urinary excretion of <italic>N-</italic>methly-nicotinamide (NMND) predicts catch-up growth in undernourished children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref007">7</xref>]. In this regard, in uninfected mice fed a protein deficient diet, increased carbohydrate metabolism through the TCA cycle occurred together with increased excretion of NMND [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref016">16</xref>], suggesting increased methylation of the NAD(H) generated during the TCA cycle to NMND via the irreversible actions of nicotinamide <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase (NMNT). Although NMND excretion was also increased during <italic>Giardia</italic> infection, the TCA cycle activity was not. Instead, during <italic>Giardia</italic> infection, there was an accumulation of <italic>cis</italic>-aconitate, a precursor to the irreversible first NAD-requiring enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) in the TCA cycle. This finding is compatible with an overall NAD<sup>+</sup> pool deficit as a potential consequence of hypermethylation of available nicotinamide via NMNT, a potential feature of catabolic states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref066">66</xref>]. The ability of NMNT to regulate energy expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref007">7</xref>] may ultimately be an advantageous adaptation during malnutrition. As in undernourished children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref067">67</xref>], <italic>Giardia-</italic>infected mice in this model corresponded with increased ‘catch-up’ growth potential after refeeding. During EAEC infection, however, inflammatory cells likely competed for tryptophan via cytokine-mediated upregulation of IDO in the intestinal mucosa. As a result, not only was TCA activity decreased, but increased NMND was also lost during co-infection. In addition to the enhanced EAEC-mediated intestinal inflammation, when combined with <italic>Giardia</italic> infection, there was further evidence of microbial-mediated tryptophan breakdown. The consequences of these two intersecting pathways may have ultimately led to an insurmountable exogenous tryptophan deficit, that together with increased IL1α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref068">68</xref>], further fueled muscle catabolism (increased creatine excretion) and exhausted cellular aerobic respiration including the loss of compensatory increases in lipid metabolism (hexanoylglycine, butyrylglycine, and isovalarylglycine and decreased acetyl-carnitine).</p>
<p>Although we used carefully age, sex, diet, and vendor-source matched controls to address potential biological variability when studying outcomes dependent upon intestinal microbiota, one inherent limitation of these studies performed in a specific pathogen free (SPF) environment is the inability to directly determine which microbe-microbe interactions were most consequential for pathogenesis. We speculate, therefore, that the correlation between <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> burden and growth impairment during giardiasis and potentially enhanced EAEC virulence may be mediated through a shared <italic>Giardia</italic>-dependent metabolic perturbation. Recently, cultivation of a laboratory strain <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> in <italic>Giardia-</italic>spent media led to conversion from a commensal to a pathogenic phenotype in a nematode infection model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref069">69</xref>] as well as decreased taurine-receptor gene expression in the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> grown in <italic>Giardia</italic>-spent media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref069">69</xref>]. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> data that <italic>Giardia</italic> leads to increased taurine excretion, even during EAEC co-infection, may similarly indicate decreased bacterial taurine metabolism. More rigorous co-association studies in gnotobiotic conditions are needed to differentiate <italic>Giardia</italic>-mediated interactions with select resident or pathogenic <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>. Also, contrasting deleterious microbial interactions with microbes associated with health, such as <italic>Bifidobacterium pseudolongum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref025">25</xref>] or <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref022">22</xref>] that were variably reduced across groups in this model, are needed to unravel how these intriguing intestinal ecological interactions influence malnutrition.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this murine model of protein malnutrition and microbial disruptions using common enteropathogen challenges in malnourished children provides important insights into microbial interactions and metabolic mechanisms that contribute to undernutrition. These collective integrated studies raise important considerations for ongoing longitudinal studies of childhood malnutrition that rely upon immune and metabolic biomarkers as surrogates for small intestinal pathology. As in this model, correlating specific enteropathogen exposures with these metabolic perturbations and immune biomarkers may help to define appropriate (physiological) from maladaptive (pathological) responses, and identify critical windows of optimal and potentially individualized interventions. For example, children who excrete NMND despite enteropathogen infection, like <italic>Giardia</italic>-infected mice in this model, may be primed to ‘catch-up’ and thus respond to targeted nutrient therapy, whereas the lack of NMND excretion during <italic>Giardia</italic> infection may signify a need to identify and treat a co-existing enteropathogen such as EAEC or another trigger of intestinal inflammation. Similarly, although fecal MPO may indicate environmental enteropathy predictive of poor growth, an inappropriately suppressed MPO in the setting of an immune-modulating co-infection may be an alarm for ensuing host immune and metabolic exhaustion and morbidity. Indeed, translating integrated findings in experimental models such as those presented in this study may not only help to identify novel interventions that disrupt a vicious cycle of microbial-mediated enteric failure, but may better leverage combinations of existing interventions to restore microbial-host mutualism and promote mucosal restitution.</p>

To prepare OTU data for relative abundance comparisons, samples with fewer than 311 reads were excluded and OTUs were filtered by two criteria: being present in at least two samples and having 0.5% relative abundance in at least one sample. Using the remaining OTUs and their relative abundances, the DESeq2 package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref078">78</xref>] was used, as implemented in QIIME, to determine differentially abundant OTUs. OTUs with a multiple-testing corrected p value &lt;0.05 were considered differentially abundant.</p>
<p>For duodenal tissues there was a high degree of unassigned taxa. We therefore restricted the V3-V4 pipeline analysis to only those OTUs with at least 10,000 reads (“high-abundance”). This restriction resulted in 541,910 retained high quality reads in the duodenum (mean 15,483 reads/sample). 50–98% of otherwise unassigned taxa were successfully eliminated from these groups.</p>

<title>Urine metabonomoics <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy-based metabonomic analysis</title>
<p>Urine samples were on individual mice at each timepoint indicated. Sample collections occurred regularly at 2 pm on each collection data. Urines were placed immediately on ice, and stored at -80°C before shipping on dry ice to JMP and JS. Urines were then analyzed individually by <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Each sample was prepared by combining 30 μl of urine with 30 μl of phosphate buffer (pH 7.4; 100% D<sub>2</sub>O) containing 1 mM of the internal standard, 3-trimethylsilyl-1-[2,2,3,3-<sup>2</sup>H4] propionate (TSP). Samples were mixed by vortex and spun (10,000 <italic>g</italic>) for 10 minutes before transfer to a 1.7 mm NMR tube. Spectroscopic analysis was carried out on a 700 MHz Bruker NMR spectrometer equipped with a cryo-probe. Standard one-dimensional <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of the urine samples were acquired with water peak suppression using a standard pulse sequence. For each sample, 8 dummy scans were followed by 128 scans and collected in 64K data points. A recycle delay of 2 s, a mixing time of 10 μs and an acquisition time of 3.8 s was used. The spectral width was set at 20 ppm. Chemical shifts in the spectra were referenced to the TSP singlet at δ 0.0. Spectra were manually phased and corrected for baseline distortions. <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra (δ 0.2–10.0) were digitized into consecutive integrated spectral regions (~20,000) of equal width (0.00055 ppm). The regions between δ 4.50–5.00 were removed in order to minimize the effect of baseline effects caused by imperfect water suppression. Each spectrum was then normalized to unit area. Multivariate modeling was performed in Matlab using in-house scripts. This included principal components analysis (PCA) using pareto scaling and orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) constructed using unit variance scaling. OPLS-DA models were constructed to assist model interpretation. Here, <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopic profiles were used as the descriptor matrix and class membership (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. Giardia, EAEC, uninfected) was used as the response variable. The predictive performance (Q<sup>2</sup>Y) of the model was calculated using a 7-fold cross validation approach and model validity was established by permutation testing (1000 permutations) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref016">16</xref>]. Metabolites associated with a series of pair-wise OPLS-DA models were identified by the correlation coefficient (<italic>R</italic>) with the class membership and summarized in a heat map.</p>

<title>Flow cytometry for lamina propria cells and luminex for cytokine and chemokine profiles</title>
<p>Flow cytometry of lamina propria cells was performed according to our previously published protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref018">18</xref>]. For isolation of cells from ileum segments, suspensions of small intestinal lamina propria cells were prepared from 4 cm segments of distal small intestine beginning 1 cm from the ileocecal valve. After segments were PBS-flushed and cleaned of gross debris and mucus, they were incubated at 37°C in HBSS buffer containing 50mM EDTA and 1mM DTT for 30 minutes in a shaking incubator at 250 rpm in order to remove epithelial-layer cells. The digested tissue was passed through a 100-μm filter and the filtrate centrifuged as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref017">17</xref>]. For lamina propria cell isolations, the tissue pieces were minced and suspended in 10 ml RPMI media with 4% FBS containing 1.2 mg/ml collagenase Type IV, 1.0 mg/ml dispase, and 25–40 U/ml DNase I enzyme solution for 30 minutes at 37°C in a shaking incubator and strained through a 40-μm filter. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 1% BSA-PBS buffer. Fluorophore-conjugated purified mAbs used in flow cytometry were purchased from BD Biosciences (CD4-PE-Cy7, CD3ε-BV421, CD45-V500, and CD11b-APC-Cy7 (clone M1/70)) and Biolegend (B220 [CD45R]-PerCP), and cell surface staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All samples were acquired on a CyAn ADP LX analyzer (BD Biosciences and Cytek Development). The leukocyte population was gated based on forward/side scatter, the threshold was set at 50 FSC and single cells isolated via pulse width. All gates were applied universally to all samples within each batch. Data is represented as number positive per normalized total events (i.e., 500,000) or frequency within a specified gate. This methodology was used to elucidate the proportional leukocyte changes in equal amounts of tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref080">80</xref>]. Cell analysis was performed using FlowJo version 9.3.3 software (Tree Star).</p>
<p>For mucosal cytokine and chemokine responses, 0.5–1.0 cm of ileum were immediately placed in liquid nitrogen at the time of euthanasia and stored at -80°C until use. Protein was collected from ileum lysates, which were made using a lysis buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, and Halt protease inhibitor on ice and homogenized in Zirconia beads (Biospec) using a Mini-Beadbeater (Biospec) for 60 seconds. Clarified supernatants were stored at -80°C. Multiplex protein quantification was performed using Luminex 100 IS System at the University of Virginia Biomolecular Core facility.</p>

<title>Cecal/Fecal inflammatory marker measurement</title>
<p>Markers of inflammation were measured in the cecal contents or stool using methods described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006471.ref016">16</xref>]. Briefly, stool or cecal contents were collected when cecal and other intestinal tissue was harvested and stored at -20°C until measurement. At the time of analysis specimens were allowed to thaw at room temperature and were diluted 7-fold in buffer with protease inhibitors (RIPA, radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer). The samples were vortexed, centrifuged and the supernatants used to measure the biomarkers. The fecal myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lipocalin-2 concentrations were measured using commercially available kits that employed polyclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods, from R&amp;D systems (Minneapolis, USA) according the manufacturer’s instructions. Cecal calprotectin was quantified by ELISA (Hycult Biotech) according to manufacturer's instructions using 1:1000 dilution of cecal contents based on optimization using pooled cecal samples. Measured protein levels were normalized to total lysate protein for respective specimens as determined by bicinchoninic assay (BCA) (Thermoscientific) at 562nm absorbance (Biotek ELISA plate reader) after 30 minutes incubation of sample with reagent at room temperature. Total protein of each sample was assayed using the BCA Protein Assay Kit from Pierce (Pittsburgh, PA). The absorption was measured using an Epoch plate reader, Bio-tek Instruments, Inc. (USA). Units were expressed as pg/mg of total protein.</p>
