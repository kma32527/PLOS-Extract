<abstract>
<p>The unusual cell cycles of Apicomplexa parasites are remarkably flexible with the ability to complete cytokinesis and karyokinesis coordinately or postpone cytokinesis for several rounds of chromosome replication, and are well recognized. Despite this surprising biology, the molecular machinery required to achieve this flexibility is largely unknown. In this study, we provide comprehensive experimental evidence that apicomplexan parasites utilize multiple Cdk-related kinases (Crks) to coordinate cell division. We determined that <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> encodes seven atypical P-, H-, Y- and L- type cyclins and ten Crks to regulate cellular processes. We generated and analyzed conditional tet-OFF mutants for seven TgCrks and four TgCyclins that are expressed in the tachyzoite stage. These experiments demonstrated that TgCrk1, TgCrk2, TgCrk4 and TgCrk6, were required or essential for tachyzoite growth revealing a remarkable number of Crk factors that are necessary for parasite replication. G1 phase arrest resulted from the loss of cytoplasmic TgCrk2 that interacted with a P-type cyclin demonstrating that an atypical mechanism controls half the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> cell cycle. We showed that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> employs at least three TgCrks to complete mitosis. Novel kinases, TgCrk6 and TgCrk4 were required for spindle function and centrosome duplication, respectively, while TgCrk1 and its partner TgCycL were essential for daughter bud assembly. Intriguingly, mitotic kinases TgCrk4 and TgCrk6 did not interact with any cyclin tested and were instead dynamically expressed during mitosis indicating they may not require a cyclin timing mechanism. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that apicomplexan parasites utilize distinctive and complex mechanisms to coordinate their novel replicative cycles.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Apicomplexan parasites are unicellular eukaryotes that replicate in unusual ways different from their multicellular hosts. From a single infection, different apicomplexans can produce as few as two or up to many hundreds of progeny. How these flexible division cycles are regulated is poorly understood. In the current study we have defined the major mechanisms controlling the growth of the <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> acute pathogenic stage called the tachyzoite. We show that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> tachyzoites require not only multiple protein kinases to coordinate chromosome replication and the assembly of new daughter parasites, but also each kinase has unique responsibilities. By contrast, the mammalian cell that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> infects requires far fewer kinase regulators to complete cell division, which suggests that these parasites have unique vulnerabilities. The increased complexity in parasite cell cycle controls likely evolved from the need to adapt to different hosts and the need to construct the specialized invasion apparatus in order to invade those hosts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Obligate intracellular parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa are responsible for many important diseases in humans and animals, including malaria, toxoplasmosis and cryptosporidiosis. Severity of the disease is tightly linked to parasite burden, and currently, the most successful therapies block parasite proliferation. Apicomplexan parasites use flexible mechanisms to replicate that are different than those of their hosts. In endodyogeny each round of duplication is completed with assembly of two internal daughters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref001">1</xref>]. Alternatively, multiple buds can be formed inside of the mother or emerge from its surface in the processes called, endopolygeny and schizogony, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref002">2</xref>]. <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> undergoes endodyogeny in intermediate host stages, but replicates by endopolygeny in the definitive feline host. Fundamental differences between division modes are embedded in the features of the apicomplexan cell cycle comprised of two chromosome cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref003">3</xref>]. During nuclear cycles, chromosomes are replicated and segregated without budding, while each round of chromosome replication in the budding cycle leads to production of the daughter parasites. Ultimately, the number of nuclear cycles determines the scale of the parasite progeny. We recently showed that the ability to switch between chromosome cycles is partially linked to the unique bipartite structure of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> centrosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref003">3</xref>]. Weakening or separation of the outer centrosomal core that controls budding favors the nuclear cycle, while the strong association of the outer core with the inner core promotes cytokinesis and the budding cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Endodyogeny of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> tachyzoites represents one the simplest modes of replication and important cell cycle transition points where potential checkpoints may operate have been defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref019">19</xref>]. The G1 phase of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> endodyogeny comprises half of the division cycle, and like other eukaryotes, canonical housekeeping tasks preparing for S phase commitment are performed in the apicomplexan G1 period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref019">19</xref>]. Evidence also indicates that cell cycle exit to form dormant developmental stages as well as drug-induced dormancy is controlled by mechanisms acting at the transition from M/C into early G1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref021">21</xref>]. Duplication of the centrosome marks the transition from G1 to S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref017">17</xref>], and we have defined some of the components of this critical transition in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> that should be targets of a G1/S checkpoint mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref017">17</xref>]. A peculiar feature of apicomplexan replication is the short (or absent) G2 phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref002">2</xref>] that is thought to be marked by natural S phase populations that possess partially duplicated genomes (1.7–1.8N DNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref013">13</xref>]. Resolving the molecular basis for this important transition should help solve the mystery of these unusual DNA distributions. During the apicomplexan mitosis numerous specialized structures are replicated, built or converted in precise order to produce healthy infectious daughters (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref022">22</xref>]). Our previous work and the studies of others have established that duplication of the bipartite centrosome is coordinated with division of the centrocone that holds the mitotic spindle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref023">23</xref>], and also with the replication and segregation of the bundled centromeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref024">24</xref>], which in turn, is synchronized with assembly of the basal and apical complexes of the future daughter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref028">28</xref>]. The temporal-spatial coordination of these overlapping processes likely requires similarly complex regulatory machinery, for which the molecular basis is still largely unknown.</p>
<p>In eukaryotes, cell cycle progression is governed by the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) and their regulatory cofactors, cyclins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref030">30</xref>]; dynamic expression of the latter provides clockwise control of Cdk function. Cdk4/6-cyclin D complexes support the progression of G1 phase, and Cdk2 complexes with cyclins E, A and B govern the progression and fidelity of DNA replication in S phase and chromosome segregation in mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref031">31</xref>]. Cdks functions were originally thought to be restricted to cell cycle regulation, however, today we understand that activated Cdk-cyclin complexes are master regulators of such major biological processes as transcription, RNA processing, translation and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref030">30</xref>]. Extrapolating current models of cell cycle checkpoints that involve Cdk-cyclins to eukaryotes in general is challenging, as there are many branches of the eukaryotic tree where cell division is quite unusual and the molecular controls are likely to be different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref029">29</xref>]. This includes the large group of obligate intracellular parasites from the phylum Apicomplexa. Mining the initial genomes of important disease causing apicomplexans has revealed major differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref034">34</xref>] characterized by the reduction of components and also the complete absence of the key regulatory elements, including canonical cyclins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref035">35</xref>], major cell cycle Cdks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref034">34</xref>] and their immediate downstream effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref001">1</xref>]. The lack of conserved cell cycle factors of higher eukaryotes indicates there are significant changes in the cell cycle molecular machinery of these ancient protozoa. Here we describe the first comprehensive study of Cdk-related kinases (Crks) and cyclins in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic>. Using genetic approaches, we have analyzed the function of seven TgCrks and four TgCyclins and uncovered major cell cycle TgCrks controlling the replication of the tachyzoite stage of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic>. Our results demonstrate that, unlike the traditional eukaryotic cell cycle, the intricate division of apicomplexan parasites is regulated by multiple essential Crks acting independently at several critical transitions and in unusual spatial contexts.</p>

<title><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> possesses multiple divergent Cdk-related kinases</title>
<p>To determine the core Cdk-cyclin complexes that regulate division in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic>, we systematically searched the parasite genome and identified ten genes encoding a kinase domain that included a cyclin-binding sequence (C-helix) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s002">S1 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref030">30</xref>]. Following standard convention, we named these factors Cdk-related kinases (Crks) until cyclin-dependent activation of the kinase can be established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref037">37</xref>]. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> Crks (TgCrks) were a diverse group of proteins ranging from 34 to 212kDa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s002">S1A Fig</xref>) that also varied in mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s002">S1B Fig</xref>). <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> transcriptome data (ToxoDB) indicated that eight TgCrks were expressed in tachyzoites and/or bradyzoites, and mRNA profiles for two kinases, TgCrk2-L1 and TgCrk5-L1 indicated they were restricted to the definitive or environmental life cycle stages; merozoite and/or sporozoite (ToxoDB). The profiles of TgCrk4, TgCrk5 and TgCrk6 mRNAs were cyclical in tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s002">S1B Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref004">4</xref>], which was confirmed at the protein level for TgCrk4<sup>HA</sup> and TgCrk6<sup>HA</sup> by endogenous epitope tagging (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). The dynamic cell cycle regulation of the three TgCrk factors differs significantly from the typical constitutive expression of Cdks of studied model eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>Phylogenetic analysis of TgCrks defined the general Cdk families present in the Apicomplexa phylum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref034">34</xref>].

The analysis sorted ten TgCrks into eight general phylogenetic clades with five groups restricted to the superphylum Alveolata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g001">Fig 1</xref>, pink shade): TgCrk5 and TgCrk5-L1 were apicomplexan adaptations. Kinases in three other clades were shared with a recognizable higher eukaryotic counterpart that included several kinases known to regulate cell cycle and gene expression. Specifically, TgCrk1 grouped with the Cdk11 family kinases that regulate mRNA synthesis and maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g001">Fig 1</xref>, green shade), while TgCrk7 was similar to the Cdk-activating kinase (CAK), HmCdk7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g001">Fig 1</xref>, yellow shade).

<title>Conditional knockdown of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> Cdk-related kinases</title>
<p>To define the function of TgCrks, we constructed tet-OFF conditional knockdown mutants by replacing the native promoter with a tetracycline-regulatable promoter in the Tati-RHΔ<italic>ku80</italic> strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref040">40</xref>]. Each kinase was concurrently tagged with a 3xHA-epitope fused to the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s002">S1D Fig</xref>, diagram). We successfully generated tet-OFF mutants for seven TgCrks demonstrating that promoter replacement and N-terminal HA-tagging were remarkably tolerated in the tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s002">S1F Fig</xref>). The only other TgCrk factor expressed in tachyzoites is TgCrk5, which is the subject of another project and was not studied here (Naumov and White, personal communication). Immunofluorescence assays (IFA) of <sup>HA</sup>TgCrks determined that most of these kinases were predominantly nuclear in tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g002">Fig 2</xref>, -ATc conditions) with the exception of <sup>HA</sup>TgCrk2, which was expressed throughout the cell, and <sup>HA</sup>TgCrk4, which was exclusively localized to the cytoplasm. Despite sharing the same tet-OFF promoter, individual <sup>HA</sup>TgCrks showed a wide range of protein abundance that closely matched the expression level of the factors regulated by their native promoters, indicating there are major post-transcriptional mechanisms controlling TgCrk levels in tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s002">S1E Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>The upper schematic illustrates anhydrotetracycline (ATc) mediated control of gene expression in the tet-OFF system. In the absence of ATc the tetracycline transactivator (tTA) binds to the tet-operator (tetO) maintaining the active transcription of the gene of interest (GOI). Downregulation of the GOI product is achieved by transcriptional repression with ATc that prevents tTA binding to tet-operators incorporated into the tet-OFF promoter of the GOI. IFA images on the left show predominant localization of the epitope-tagged kinases (α-HA, green) relative to nuclear staining (DAPI, blue) and IMC compartment (IMC1, red). Downregulation of TgCrk expression after 24 h treatment with 1μg/ml ATc was verified for seven kinases by IFA and Western Blot analysis (α-Tubulin A staining was used as a loading control). The essentiality of each kinase was tested by the ability of TgCrk tet-OFF mutant parasites to form plaques after 6 days with 1μg/ml ATc (representative DIC images on the right). Parent Tati-RHΔ<italic>Ku80</italic> strain was included as positive control (top DIC image). Percentage number indicated below each DIC image represents the number of plaques relative to the -ATc condition for each tet-OFF mutant. All analyzed kinases were either essential or required for tachyzoite growth, with the exception of TgCrk8. Downregulation of TgCrk2, resulted in growth arrest of morphologically normal looking parasites, while knockdown of TgCrk1, TgCrk4 and TgCrk6 led to major morphological abnormalities that are indicated in the IFA images and quantified in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s003">S2 Fig</xref>.</p>

Exploiting the ATc-induced conditional knockdown, we determined by plaque growth assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g002">Fig 2</xref>) that four TgCrks were essential, two were required for tachyzoite growth and only TgCrk8 was dispensable. Quantitative growth rates (24 h) for the TgCrk4 and TgCrk6 tet-OFF mutants with or without ATc treatment confirmed that TgCrk4 was required and TgCrk6 was essential for tachyzoite growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s002">S1F Fig</xref>).

Based on parasite morphology, the loss of TgCrk2 appeared to block tachyzoites in the G1 phase and knockdown of TgCrk1, TgCrk4 or TgCrk6 resulted in extensive mitotic and cytoskeletal defects, consistent with growth arrest in the S/M/C half of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s003">S2A Fig</xref>).

<title>Determining the function of cyclins in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic></title>
<p>In general cyclins are poorly conserved, although the presence of a cyclin box and one or more destruction motifs permits these genes to be identified by genome mining.

To determine expression and localization of TgCyclins in tachyzoites, we epitope tagged the C-terminus of TgCycH, TgCycL, TgCycY with a 3xHA-epitope by genetic knock-in. IFA analysis showed that TgCycH<sup>HA</sup>, TgCycL<sup>HA</sup> and TgCycY<sup>HA</sup>, were moderately expressed and localized to the nucleus in tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), and remarkably, TgCycY<sup>HA</sup> was the only oscillating cyclin with peak expression in the G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). To visualize the lower abundant cyclin, TgPHO80, we engineered transgenic parasites ectopically expressing TgPHO80 that was N-terminally tagged with a 3xmyc epitope fused to a FKBP destabilization domain (DD<sup>myc</sup>), which permits conditional expression using the small molecule Shield 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref044">44</xref>].

<p>Utilizing a similar knockdown approach as was used for the TgCrks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s002">S1D Fig</xref>), we successfully converted by genetic knock-in four TgCyclin genes to tet-OFF mutant alleles: TgPHO80, TgCycH, TgCycL and TgCycY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, Western Blot analysis). ATc-knockdown of TgPHO80 slowed the rate of replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s005">S4C Fig</xref>) and increased the fraction of parasites with a single centrosome (76.5% ± 9.8 vacuoles after 48 h with 1μg/ml ATc compared to 49% ± 1 vacuoles in -ATc conditions) indicating the G1 phase was lengthened by the loss of TgPHO80. The ATc-induced depletion of nuclear cyclins, TgCycL and TgCycH, caused tachyzoite growth arrest. TgCycL deficiency led to mitotic death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s003">S2A Fig</xref>) and knockdown of TgCycH resulted in a quick non-specific growth arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g003">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s003">S2B Fig</xref>).

<title>TgCrk2 and P-type cyclin regulate the tachyzoite G1 phase</title>
<p>The conditional knockdown of the tet-OFF TgCrk2 mutant appeared to cause a cell cycle arrest in G1, which we confirmed by analyzing centrosome duplication.

To more precisely define the TgCrk1-loss phenotype, we focused on the early mitotic steps just prior to daughter bud formation. The MORN1 protein associates with two compartments that are duplicated in mitosis, the spindle compartment (centrocone) and basal complex referred to here as the MORN-ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, image a) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref028">28</xref>].

Deficiency of the basal complex became more evident when newly produced alveolar sacs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>, image f) accumulated near fragmented MORN-rings in the late stages of mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref> image e). In addition, the normal coordination of mitosis with cytokinesis failed and the IMC compartment appeared as an unstructured mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>, image h). In addition, TgCrk1 deficiency affected the structural integrity of the tachyzoite apical end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Following ATc treatment the robust cone-shaped apical cap (ISP1 staining) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref046">46</xref>] became a weak rod-like or lopsided structure that caps a deformed IMC1-positive mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Despite severe defects in mitosis caused by the loss of TgCrk1, the duplication and segregation of centromeres, centrosomes and the plastid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s006">S5A Fig</xref>) and nuclear division were evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, image i).

During normal mitosis depicted in the –ATc images, membrane protein MORN1 localizes to the mother basal complex, intranuclear spindle compartment centrocone, and to the attached MORN rings (image a). Downregulation of TgCrk1 with 1 μg/ml ATc for 16 h resulted in incomplete assembly (image c) or fragmentation (image e) of the MORN rings and associated accumulation of IMC sacs (image f). Fully arrested vacuoles shown in the bottom panel (24 h +ATc) exhibit a catastrophic phenotype; the chaotic daughter cytoskeletal mass (image h) disconnected from parasite cytoplasm. (B) Vacuoles undergoing proper budding (normal buds) or containing parasites displaying cytological defects depicted in the images c-f (piled IMC1/MORN1), or in the images g and h (cytological defects) were quantified in the TgCrk1 tet-OFF populations grown with or without 1 μg/ml ATc for 24 h.

ATc-downregulation of TgCrk6 disrupted the usual dynamics of kinetochores visualized by co-staining of the kinetochore complex component, TgNdc80<sup>myc</sup>, and acetylated Tubulin A that labels active sites of the microtubule assembly including spindle and internal daughters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref024">24</xref>]. In normal parasites, the TgNdc80<sup>myc</sup> signal largely disappeared at mid-bud development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, -ATc image e). By contrast, TgCrk6 deficient parasites (+ATc) retained single assembled kinetochores well into the budding process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, image g). Longer term ATc incubations (&gt;24 h) amplified the loss of coordination between cytokinesis and karyokinesis leading to the catastrophic phenotype of severe DNA mis-segregation and assembly of buds lacking DNA shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g002">Fig 2</xref>. These results combined with the observed accumulation of the nuclear TgCrk6<sup>HA</sup> in the centromeric region during peak expression in S/M phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s004">S3D Fig</xref>) supported a key role for TgCrk6 in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> spindle regulation.

<title>Nuclear TgCrk6 regulates spindle biology in tachyzoites.</title>
<p>(A) TgCrk6 tet-OFF mutant parasites were grown in the absence (upper row) or presence of 1 μg/ml ATc for 16 h (bottom row) and analyzed by IFA using α-MORN1 (red, centrocone and basal complex) and α-IMC1 (green, parasite shape and internal buds) antibody. Chromosome dynamics was detected by DAPI staining (blue). Downregulation of TgCrk6 (+ATc) led to an inability of the centrocone compartment to duplicate during mitosis. The guide panel includes a cartoon and a description of the analyzed structures and observed deficiencies. Single (red) and duplicated (blue) centrocones (α-MORN1) were quantified in 25–50 randomly selected budding vacuoles (α-IMC1) (for raw data, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s001">S1 Table</xref>) revealing a significantly larger number of the vacuoles with a single centrocone when TgCrk6 tet-OFF mutant was treated with ATc for 24 h (+ATc). P-value ≤ 0.0001 (***) was calculated using unpaired two-tail t-test. (B) Kinetochore dynamics were analyzed in the TgCrk6 tet-OFF mutant parasites co-expressing TgNdc80<sup>myc</sup> using α-myc antibody. To identify vacuoles in cytokinesis, microtubules of the growing internal buds were stained with antibody against acetylated Tubulin A (green). Kinetochore dynamics in TgCrk6 tet-OFF mutant after 24 h treatment with or without 1μg/ml ATc is summarized in the guide panel on the right.

<p>Similar to TgCrk6, knockdown of TgCrk4 caused defects in mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g002">Fig 2</xref>), although TgCrk4 differed from TgCrk6 in being localized to the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s004">S3B versus S3D Fig</xref>). This difference led us to examine the role of TgCrk4 in regulating the cytoplasmic components of the mitotic machinery. Asexual stages of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> divide by enclosed mitosis (as do most apicomplexans) that coordinates attachment of nuclear centromeres to kinetochores/spindle and to a unique centrosome containing two independent functioning core structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref022">22</xref>]. Consistent with a role in controlling mitosis through cytoplasmic structures, down regulation of TgCrk4 with 1μg/ml ATc led to defective duplication of both centrosomal cores (Centrin1/outer core and CEP250<sup>myc</sup>/inner core), but did not affect centromere duplication/segregation (CenH3 marker) or nuclear division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Interesting, plastid segregation, which is controlled by the centrosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref050">50</xref>], was also defective in parasites lacking TgCrk4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, TgAtrx1 marker). Although TgCrk4-deficient parasites showed abnormal centrosome replication (under and over reduplication) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>), we did not observe uncoupling of the centrosome cores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g007">Fig 7C</xref>) as we have documented in some temperature sensitive mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref003">3</xref>]. Moreover, we found that centrosome re-duplication occurred around assembled kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g007">Fig 7D</xref>) despite the disruption in normal centrosome stoichiometry. The proper ratios of centrosome to kinetochore observed in a regular tachyzoite mitosis are established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g007">Fig 7D</xref>, -ATc; 2:1 images a, b; 2:2 images c, d; 2:0 images e, f). By contrast, down regulation of TgCrk4 led to abnormal stoichiometry of 4 centrosomes to 2 assembled kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g007">Fig 7D</xref>, +ATc, images g, h). Further examination revealed that only one of the reduplicated centrosomes remained associated with the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, inset), which may explain why the loss of TgCrk4 did not lead to unregulated karyokinesis. Altogether, our results support the role of TgCrk4 kinase in the regulation of centrosome duplication and segregation during mitosis within the context of other essential mitotic regulatory controls such as TgCrk6 above.</p>

<title>Loss of cytoplasmic TgCrk4 leads to abnormal centrosome duplication.</title>
<p>(A) TgCrk4 deficiency affected duplication of the structures localized in the cytoplasm. TgCrk4 tet-OFF mutant parasites were treated with 1μg/ml ATc for 24 h and stained with α-IMC1 (surface), DAPI (DNA) and the markers of the following structures: centromere (α-TgCenH3), outer core of the centrosome (α-Centrin1) and apicoplast (α-TgAtrx1). To visualize inner core of centrosome, we introduced recombinant TgCEP250<sup>myc</sup> protein on the fosmid in TgCrk4 tet-OFF mutant and stained parasites with α-myc antibody. Dynamics of organelles and structures are indicated with red arrows and summarized in the Guide panel. General deficiencies caused by the loss of TgCrk4 are indicated with white arrows. (B) Quantification of the morphologically abnormal vacuoles (blue, determined by α-IMC1 and DAPI co-staining) containing under-duplicated (green) or over-duplicated (red) centrosomes (visualized by α-Centrin1 staining) in the TgCrk4 tet-OFF mutant grown without or with ATc for 20 h is shown on the bar graph (for raw data see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Significant difference between two indicated conditions was verified by unpaired t-test that returned the p-value 0.02 (*). Note that centrosome re-duplication is a predominant defect and together with centrosome under-duplication affected about 30% of the TgCrk4 deficient population. (C) The reduplicated centrosome of TgCrk4-deficient parasites preserved internal integrity. TgCrk4 tet-OFF mutant parasites co-expressing TgCEP250<sup>myc</sup> were stained with α-Centrin1 (outer centrosomal core) and α-myc (TgCEP250<sup>myc</sup>, inner centrosomal core) after 16 h growth with or without 1μg/ml ATc. White arrows indicate re-duplication of both centrosome cores in TgCrk4 deficient parasite. The enlarged merged image shows that only one of the centrosomes remains connected to the nucleus. (D) Reduplicated centrosomes are associated with assembled kinetochores in TgCrk4 deficient parasites. Transgenic TgCrk4 tet-OFF mutant expressing kinetochore marker TgNdc80<sup>myc</sup> was grown with or without 1μg/ml ATc for 16 h and co-stained with α-Centrin1 (centrosome), α-myc (TgNdc80<sup>myc</sup>, kinetochore), and DAPI. In mitotic cells expressing TgCrk4 (-ATc), centrosome duplication and kinetochore assembly occurs once per chromosome cycle. Kinetochores are assembled after centrosome segregation (2 centrosomes:1 kinetochore, images a, b), duplicated after the spindle break (2 centrosomes: 2 kinetochores, images c, d) and segregated/disassembled early in the budding (2 centrosomes: 0 kinetochores, images e, f). Lower panel (+ATc) shows vacuole of four TgCrk4-deficient parasites with three cells (white arrows) containing reduplicated centrosomes associated with assembled kinetochores (4 centrosomes: 2 kinetochores, images g, h). Number of structures per parasite is shown in each insert. Parasite shapes are outlined in the merge panel.</p>

<p>Interestingly, TgCrk4 and TgCrk6 were cyclically expressed during tachyzoite replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s004">S3 Fig</xref>) with the peak expression in S/M phase consistent with functions in regulating mitotic processes. In higher eukaryotes, mitotic Cdk activity is typically controlled by an oscillating cyclin partner, while the Cdk protein is constitutive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref039">39</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The molecular basis of cell cycle regulation in eukaryotes has been mainly shaped by studies in one branch of eukaryotes, Unikonta that includes the clades animalia, fungi and amoebas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref029">29</xref>]. This is a significant deficiency because the replication biology of eukaryotes from the Bikonta branch, comprised of the three supergroups, the Excavata, SAR (<underline>S</underline>tramenopiles, <underline>A</underline>lveolates and <underline>R</underline>hizaria) and Archaeplastida, is quite extraordinary, if also beyond our reach experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref053">53</xref>]. From this point of view, our genetic analysis of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> Cdk-related kinases and cyclins provides much needed insight into the cell cycle regulation of an ancient protozoan from the SAR supergroup. One of the core findings of this study is the surprising complexity and unusual regulation of cell cycle controls that are essential for Apicomplexa cell division. The results of multiple gene knockouts in higher eukaryotes reveals that a single active Cdk (Cdk1/2 family) is sufficient to sustain basic chromosome segregation in the somatic cells of both multicellular and unicellular eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref054">54</xref>]. By contrast, this study and a second project in progress (TgCrk5 studies, Naumov and White, personal communication) have established that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> requires five Crks to successfully regulate the peculiar parasite cell cycle called endodyogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Two Crks regulate centrosome duplication (TgCrk4) and organization of the daughter bud cytoskeleton (TgCrk1) during interwoven S, M and C phases. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> has also evolved independent controls for the restriction or START checkpoint in G1 (TgCrk2), the DNA licensing checkpoint in S phase (TgCrk5, Naumov and White, personal communication) and the spindle assembly checkpoint (TgCrk6) acting at the metaphase to anaphase transition in mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g008">Fig 8</xref>). A Recently published study of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> CRK4 confirms that cell cycle checkpoints are regulated by the related kinases across Apicomplexa phylum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref049">49</xref>]. Similar to TgCrk6, nuclear PfCRK4 was dynamically expressed in S/M phase (late trophozoite to schizont during blood stage) and upon downregulation parasites lost the ability to split the spindle and, consequently properly segregate chromosomes (Fig 2b, f and g in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref049">49</xref>]). The high number of the putative cell cycle checkpoints was unexpected and this favors a model of much tighter cell cycle regulation in the Apicomplexa than previously thought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref001">1</xref>]. In fact, the lack of reversible and abundant catastrophic phenotypes observed in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> cell cycle mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref009">9</xref>], which was often interpreted as a lack of cell cycle controls, is likely a consequence of the complexity of this system. We propose that apicomplexan parasites evolved separate Crks for individual cell cycle stages to facilitate switches between flexible division modes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref003">3</xref>]. During the chromosome cycle of schizogony or endopolygeny, the G1 phase is completed only once and is uncoupled from the multiple rounds of the S/M phase, which are, in turn, uncoupled from the budding process until the very last unified S/M/C phase. Therefore, evolution of multiple Crks offers independent control of the segments, permitting modular regulation of the complex cell cycles, yet, leaving an open question of the master regulator(s) of the switch.</p>

<title>A roadmap of putative checkpoints of the tachyzoite cell cycle.</title>
<p>Cartoon summaries findings of the current study. The tachyzoite cell cycle consists of G1, S-phase, and mitosis that overlaps and is coordinated with cytokinesis (Black and white circle). Binary division of tachyzoites continues for 5–6 rounds within the same vacuole, and then, parasites lyse the host cell and egress. We identified several potential stopping points (checkpoints) regulated by Cdk-related kinases of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic>. Red hexagons indicate the timing of the synchronized growth arrest or retardation caused by dis-regulation of the major cellular pathway. It appears that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> retained three conserved stop points in the cell cycle. The restriction point in G1 that is related to cell differentiation and dormancy and is regulated by TgCrk2 kinase in complex with TgPHO80 cyclin (orange arrow). Licensing of DNA replication is likely under control of atypical TgCrk5 (blue arrow) (Naumov and White, personal communication), while novel TgCrk6 (dark green arrow) might operate the spindle assembly checkpoint in metaphase. Specialized mitosis of apicomplexan parasites seems to acquire two additional points of cell cycle control. We showed that coccidian-specific kinase TgCrk4 was required to maintain proper stoichiometry of the novel bipartite centrosome (light green arrow). And distantly related to higher eukaryotic Cdk11, TgCrk1 appears to control a vital parasite-specific process of the zoite assembly (purple arrow).</p>

<p>Analyzing the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> cell cycle we noticed multiple parallels in topology of the cell cycle regulation between apicomplexans and a few studied Bikonta models, particularly, plants. First, similar to plants, mitosis in apicomplexans is regulated by clade-specific Cdks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g001">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref055">55</xref>]. Second, mitotic TgCrk4, TgCrk5 (Naumov and White, personal communication), TgCrk6 and PfCRK4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref049">49</xref>] are dynamically expressed (protein and mRNA), which is a distinctive feature of the CDKB family kinases in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref056">56</xref>]. Third, similar to most Archaeplastida members, apicomplexan parasites do not possess or encode a highly diverged Cdc25 phosphatase ortholog (EupathDB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref057">57</xref>], which primary function is to activate mitotic Cdks. Interestingly, based on the functional parallels between <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> CDKB1;1 and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Cdc25, plant biologists proposed that the Cdc25-controlled onset of mitosis may have been evolutionary replaced by plant-specific B-type Cdk pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref057">57</xref>]. Whether the similar scenario had taken place in Apicomplexa evolution will require further studies, involving broader analysis of the Bikonta organisms. Unfortunately, the current limitation of the bikont studies also does not permit us to make a definitive conclusion of whether the plant-like features of the Apicomplexan cell cycle were inherited at the time of the Unikonta and Bikonta diversion or were the result of a secondary symbiosis of the Chromoalveolata and red algae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref058">58</xref>].</p>
<p>The majority of characterized cell cycle cyclin-Cdk complexes are composed of constitutive and dynamic subunits with the cyclin generally the oscillating partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref038">38</xref>]. Consistent with the concept that functional topology is more important than the conservation of individual parts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref059">59</xref>], we found that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> cyclins differed from their high eukaryotic counterparts in being pre-dominantly constitutively expressed. Intriguingly, a single oscillating cyclin, TgCycY, was not essential for tachyzoite division nor did it interact with the seven TgCrks we analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s005">S4D Fig</xref>) and, therefore, a possible Cdk-independent role will need to be explored in future studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref060">60</xref>]. In fact, only two cell cycle complexes, TgCrk2-TgPHO80 and TgCrk1-TgCycL, were detected in which both subunits seem to be constitutively expressed in tachyzoites, suggesting mechanisms other then cyclin-binding that regulate cell cycle activity of TgCrk1 and TgCrk2. On the contrary, mitotic TgCrk4 and TgCrk6 are rare examples where Cdk-related kinases are dynamically expressed and not found in the complex with TgCyclins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s005">S4D Fig</xref>). Given that the role of cyclin is to provide a temporal context to Cdk function, it is possible that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> no longer needs cycling partners for TgCrk4 and TgCrk6. There is reason to speculate that constitutively expressing mitotic kinases might not be ideal given the complexity of the apicomplexan mitosis that is associated with the extensive <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis of the motility and invasion apparatus of daughter parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref004">4</xref>]. Delivering the master conductors "just-in-time" would avoid accidentally triggering the cascade of mechanisms that unfold during mitosis and cytokinesis before the parasite is ready to egress. This hypothesis, however, cannot explain the absence of cyclin interaction with the constitutively expressed TgCrk3 and TgCrk8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s005">S4D Fig</xref>). Interestingly, our study revealed that the only <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> Crks that have orthologs in other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g001">Fig 1</xref>, TgCrk1, TgCrk2 and TgCrk7) interacted with conventional cyclins that were also expressed in other eukaryotes (TgCycL, TgPHO80 and TgCycH). Since all the novel TgCrks were orphan, it is tempting to suggest that a non-cyclin factor may have co-evolved that acts as an oscillating component in the complexes with novel TgCrks. Alternatively, these unusual TgCrks may function without a cyclin partner. Future unbiased approaches will be needed to sort out these possibilities, and identify if there are other protein co-factors that have replaced the traditional cyclin partner.</p>
<p>Another core finding was the strong molecular support for the remarkable physical partitioning of Apicomplexan cell division functions. Similar to other apicomplexans, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> divides by enclosed mitosis where a set of tethered structures localized in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm must be constructed/deconstructed (kinetochores, spindle microtubules and striated fibers), duplicated/segregated (bipartite centrosome and centrocone) or assembled (buds) in a timely manner to produce infectious progeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref008">8</xref>]. Moreover, in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref003">3</xref>], we demonstrated that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> has divided the regulatory responsibility for karyokinesis and cytokinesis between two unique centrosome cores that have fixed orientation to nuclear and cytoplasmic biosynthetic events. Results of our study here largely support this nuclear/cytoplasmic organization, which was likely needed to overcome limitations of enclosed mitosis. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> has evolved the nuclear TgCrk6 mechanism to control events requiring the intranuclear spindle, while cytoplasmic TgCrk4 regulates centrosome duplication and associated plastid segregation. While proper assembly of the nuclear spindle and cytoplasmic daughter bud were essential processes, reduplication of the centrosome in TgCrk4-deficient parasites only partially affected tachyzoite survival. We believe that apicomplexans may have relaxed the control of centrosome reduplication in order to more easily adapt cell division to the scale needed in different hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref022">22</xref>]. It should be noted that dissolution of the nuclear membrane during open mitosis in higher eukaryotes is a key difference with apicomplexan cell division that may permit extensive re-arrangements of the nuclear (e. g. kinetochore, spindle) and cytoplasmic (e. g. centrosome) structures by a single Cdk.</p>
<p>A possible exception to the nuclear/cytoplasmic functional organization is the assembly of the cytoplasmic daughter buds that was unexpectedly controlled by the nuclear TgCrk1-TgCycL complex. Initiation of the daughter buds near the centrocone, spindle pole, which continues to grow with the progression of mitosis, is a specialized event occurring in the budding cycle of Apicomplexa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref025">25</xref>]. How does the nuclear TgCrk1 regulate assembly of a cytoplasmic structure? Recent studies of eukaryotic splicing kinase Cdk11 discovered an unexpected role for this kinase in mitotic progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref061">61</xref>]. It has been shown that activity of Cdk11 is required to regulate sister chromatid cohesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref062">62</xref>]. Since knockdown of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> TgCrk1 did not affect DNA segregation, it is possible that the role of TgCrk1 was re-adapted to regulate splicing of mRNAs whose products will be required to control assembly of the daughter buds. Our hypothesis is supported by the fact that many components of the cytoskeleton are delivered “just-in-time” during cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref004">4</xref>]. In future studies, the analysis of transcriptome changes caused by TgCrk1 deficiency will help determine whether this kinase operates primarily as a regulator of mRNA expression.</p>
<p>Transmission stages are formed at the end of each apicomplexan life cycle, that are, in most species, specialized G1/G0 states. For example, mature bradyzoites and sporozoites of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> remain growth arrested until appropriate external signals from the same or new host trigger recrudescence or de-differentiation, respectively, resulting in re-entry into G1 phase of the asexual proliferative cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g008">Fig 8</xref>). In higher eukaryotes, Cdk4/6-Cyclin D complexes are responsible for the cell fate decision to divide or differentiate (restriction checkpoint) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref064">64</xref>], which are factors not present in the Apicomplexa. Here we showed that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> parasites have replaced the canonical G1 machinery of higher eukaryotes with a novel complex of TgCrk2 (Cdk5 family) and TgPHO80 cyclin to regulate progression through the tachyzoite G1 phase. Recent studies in kinetoplastids and another apicomplexan, <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>, determined that a related G1 Crk and a P-type cyclin regulate developmental stages in these protozoans, which is similar to our discoveries of TgCrk2 function in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006483.g008">Fig 8</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref065">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref066">66</xref>]. It is also worth noting that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> possesses paralogs of TgCrk2 and TgPHO80 cyclin that are developmentally regulated (ToxoDB, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s002">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006483.s005">S4</xref> Figs) opening the possibility that the TgCrk2-TgPHO80 pathway has diverse functions in development and could also be involved in the regulation of drug-induced dormancy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the systematic approach we have used to analyze the cell cycle machinery in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> has opened the way into learning how cell division is regulated in apicomplexan parasites. Our study has also evoked important issues that still need to be addressed. For example, greater numbers of TgCrks requires greater coordination; so is there a master regulator after all? Can the complexity of mitosis coupled to cytokinesis in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> division explain a rise of multiple mitotic Crks? What are the mechanisms responsible for periodic Crks, and how are these mechanisms controlled? Does the lessons learned here translate to the exotic mitotic mechanisms in related alveolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006483.ref052">52</xref>]? Clearly, there is still much to be done to understand the molecular basis of apicomplexan cell division, fortunately, we now have important new genetic tools to go forward.</p>

The conserved protein kinase domain (red block) of a few TgCrks contains one or more inserts shown as breaks in the structure.

Note that with exception of TgCrk5-L1, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> Crks retained conservative threonine in the T-loop that becomes phosphorylated upon binding of a cognitive cyclin. (D) Schematics of recombination event establishing a tet-OFF model. Targeting construct contains 3’ fragment of the gene of interest (GOI) and is cloned in-frame with 3xHA epitope tag under Sag4 promoter fused with tetracycline operators (tetO). A recombination event replaces the GOI promoter with a tetracycline-regulatable (tet-OFF) promoter in a parent expressing a tetracycline transactivator (tTA). (E) Comparative expression of HA-tagged TgCrks in corresponding tet-OFF mutants (image a) and in transgenic strains expressing endogenously tagged TgCrks (image b). To enhance TgCrk4<sup>HA</sup> signal, a section of the image b (dotted box) was overexposed and is shown below. The total lysates of the transgenic parasites grown under permissive conditions for 30–32 h (tet-OFF mutants) were analyzed by Western blotting with α-HA antibody. Loading control was provided by probing samples with α-TubulinA antibody. Note that under alternative regulation (tet-OFF versus native promoter) protein expression levels of the TgCrks remained relatively similar and they nearly matched the steady-state levels of the corresponding mRNAs shown in the panel B, suggesting a minimal role of the transcription initiation. (F) Division rate of TgCrk4 and TgCrk6 tet-OFF mutants were measured after 24 hours growth in the presence (red) or absence (blue) of 1μg/ml ATc and compared to the growth rates of the transgenic strains expressing corresponding kinases from native promoters (green). The average of parasites per 50 vacuoles was quantified in 3 biological replicates and shown on the graph. Error bars represent the standard deviation of each sample and significant difference (P&lt;0.05) indicated by asterisks. Unlike the essential TgCrk6, downregulation of TgCrk4 resulted in insignificant (ns) difference in growth rates between –ATc and +ATc conditions. Replacement of the endogenous with the tet-OFF promoter did not significantly affected division rates of transgenic parasites and it was slightly beneficial possibly due to alternative tagging of TgCrks at the N-terminus.</p>

TgCrk1 is distantly related to Cdk11 kinase known to regulate gene expression and splicing in higher eukaryotes. We co-expressed TgCrk1<sup>HA</sup> and a subunit of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II complex, DD<sup>myc</sup>TgRBP4 (α-myc), which was localized to nascent particles concentrated in multiple nuclear foci of the tachyzoite. Like the other nuclear sub-compartments examined, the DD<sup>myc</sup>TgRBP4 structures were also not associated with the nuclear structure defined by the TgCrk1-TgCycL complex. Nuclear compartments and a major cluster of the nascent particles (TgRPB4) are indicated with arrows. Parasites are outlined with gray. The small image on the bottom shows location of each compartment in the nucleus (DAPI, blue).</p>
