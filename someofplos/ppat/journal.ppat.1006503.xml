<abstract>
<p>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are expanded in tumor microenvironments, including that of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The link between MDSC expansion and EBV infection in NPC is unclear. Here, we show that EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) promotes MDSC expansion in the tumor microenvironment by promoting extra-mitochondrial glycolysis in malignant cells, which is a scenario for immune escape initially suggested by the frequent, concomitant detection of abundant LMP1, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and CD33<sup>+</sup> MDSCs in tumor sections. The full process has been reconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic>. LMP1 promotes the expression of multiple glycolytic genes, including GLUT1. This metabolic reprogramming results in increased expression of the Nod-like receptor family protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, COX-2 and P-p65 and, consequently, increased production of IL-1β, IL-6 and GM-CSF. Finally, these changes in the environment of malignant cells result in enhanced NPC-derived MDSC induction. One key step is the physical interaction of LMP1 with GLUT1 to stabilize the GLUT1 protein by blocking its K48-ubiquitination and p62-dependent autolysosomal degradation. This work indicates that LMP1-mediated glycolysis regulates IL-1β, IL-6 and GM-CSF production through the NLRP3 inflammasome, COX-2 and P-p65 signaling pathways to enhance tumor-associated MDSC expansion, which leads to tumor immunosuppression in NPC.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The expression of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) oncogenic protein denoted latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) varies in patients with NPC and is linked to tumorigenesis and tumor immunosuppression, but the molecular mechanism through which LMP1 leads to tumor immune escape remains unknown. Work to date suggests that the expansion of tumor-associated myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) is the main cause of tumor immunosuppression such as that found in NPC. Here, we found that tumor LMP1 expression is correlated with glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) levels, CD33<sup>+</sup> MDSC number and unfavorable survival in patients with NPC. Based on the results of our <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis, LMP1 promotes GLUT1-dependent glycolysis in NPC cells, resulting in activation of the Nod-like receptor family protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, COX-2 and P-p65 signaling pathways and subsequently increased IL-1β, IL-6 and GM-CSF production. Importantly, LMP1 interacts with GLUT1 to stabilize the GLUT1 protein by disrupting its K48-linked ubiquitination and autolysosomal degradation in a p62-dependent manner and up-regulating the GLUT1 mRNA and protein levels by inducing p65 activation. Therefore, we determined that GLUT1-dependent glycolysis is required for tumor-induced MDSC differentiation and that this process is associated with LMP1 expression. Based on our findings, LMP1-mediated glycolysis is a key process involved in controlling tumor immunosuppression and directly contributes to oncogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ninety-five percent of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cases in South China are of the undifferentiated histological type (WHO type III), which is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. A type II latency program, which includes the expression of latent membrane proteins 1 and 2 (LMP1 and LMP2), EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and EBV-encoded RNAs (EBERs), is often operating in EBV-infected NPC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref001">1</xref>]. Among these latent type II antigens, LMP1 has been identified as an oncoprotein and is essential for the maintenance of latent infection and EBV-mediated malignant transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref003">3</xref>]. It enhances the production of angiogenic factors and the <italic>in vivo</italic> formation of the neovasculature for rapid tumor cell invasion and metastasis. LMP1 also has a strong impact on genes linked to inflammation and antigen presentation. These modifications might have opposite consequences. On the one hand, they might facilitate tumor progression; on the other hand, they can favor immune exposure and tumor rejection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref005">5</xref>]. Overall, the role of LMP1 in the interaction of NPC tumors with the immune system requires additional investigations that consider all types of immune cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).</p>
<p>Oxidative phosphorylation and extra-mitochondrial glycolysis are the two major energy-producing pathways in a cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref006">6</xref>]. In cancers, most cells exhibit increased rates of extra-mitochondrial glycolysis and use this metabolic pathway for ATP synthesis instead of oxidative phosphorylation, even in the presence of oxygen, which is a process known as the Warburg effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref007">7</xref>]. The high rate of extra-mitochondrial glycolysis not only causes malignant cells to be more prone to resist hypoxia but also contributes to cell proliferation and survival by affecting signaling pathways and enhancing the production of various macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref009">9</xref>]. Recent studies have suggested that EBV LMP1 may mediate energy metabolism reprogramming in EBV-infected cancer cells, including alterations in aerobic glycolysis, by activating the expression of specific metabolic enzymes, such as hexokinase 2 (HK2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref012">12</xref>]. Several reports have shown that this metabolic reprogramming has major consequences for oncogenesis and responses to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref013">13</xref>]. Its impact on the tumor microenvironment, particularly on the interaction between malignant and immune cells, also deserves attention. For example, a link between metabolic reprogramming in malignant cells and the expansion of intra-tumor MDSCs has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref014">14</xref>]. MDSCs are key regulatory cells that have a physiological role in the control of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref015">15</xref>]. They are also known to favor tumor immune escape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref021">21</xref>]. According to many reports, the MDSC subset is expanded in the tumor microenvironment in a wide range of malignancies, including NPC.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the role of metabolic reprogramming as a missing link between LMP1 expression in malignant cells and the accumulation of MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment. An initial clue supporting this hypothesis was provided by immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses of tumor sections; the abundance of CD33<sup>+</sup> MDSCs was correlated to the level of LMP1 and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression in malignant epithelial cells. The next step was to confirm that aerobic extra-mitochondrial glycolysis was increased by LMP1 through up-regulation of several glycolytic genes, including GLUT1. Then, we showed that MDSC expansion <italic>in vitro</italic> was facilitated by the expression of exogenous LMP1 in neighboring NPC cells. Mechanistic analyses indicated that LMP1-mediated glycolysis was GLUT1-dependent. The increase in extra-mitochondrial glycolysis resulted in enhanced COX-2 expression and the phosphorylation of p65 in the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Increased extra-mitochondrial glycolysis also triggered Nod-like receptor family protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activity, with increasing NLRP3 expression and self-cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1β. The activation of the above-mentioned signaling pathways resulted in greater levels of extracellular IL-1β, IL-6 and GM-CSF release. Moreover, we determined that GLUT1-dependent glycolysis was required for MDSC differentiation, which was associated with LMP1 expression. Importantly, we observed that LMP1 interacted with GLUT1 to stabilize the GLUT1 protein by disrupting its K48-linked ubiquitination and autolysosomal degradation in a p62-dependent manner in addition to up-regulating GLUT1 mRNA and protein expression through p65 activation.

<title>Correlation of LMP1 and GLUT1 expression with the abundance of CD33<sup>+</sup> MDSCs in patients with NPC</title>
<p>Striking inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity in LMP1 expression has been observed in NPC tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref023">23</xref>]. To understand the possible relationship between LMP1 expression in malignant cells, the Warburg effect and immune alterations in the tumor microenvironment, our first approach was based on IHC analyses of tumor tissue sections from 112 patients with NPC. The expression of LMP1 and GLUT1 in malignant cells was assessed in combination with counting the number of infiltrating immune cells, particularly MDSCs. We found a positive correlation between 3 parameters: the abundance of LMP1 proteins in malignant cells, the abundance of GLUT1 proteins in malignant cells and the number of CD33<sup>+</sup> MDSCs in the tissue sections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref018">18</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g001">Fig 1A–1D</xref>, P &lt; 0.05). Importantly, high levels of LMP1 or GLUT1 in tumors were associated with a poorer disease-free survival (DFS) of patients with NPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006503.s009">S2 Table</xref>). A high density of tumor-infiltrating CD33<sup>+</sup> cells was also indicative of a poor prognosis, as shown in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref018">18</xref>].</p>

<title>LMP1 enhances aerobic glycolysis and the expression of glycolysis-related genes in NPC cells</title>
<p>To identify a formal link between LMP1 expression and metabolic reprogramming, we investigated the impact of exogenous LMP1 expression on glucose metabolism in the EBV-negative NPC cell line CNE2 and in TW03 cells. We found that GLUT1 expression was induced by LMP1 expression in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). We then measured glucose consumption and lactate production based on the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) using an extracellular metabolic flux analyzer to assess the differences in glycolytic activity among CNE2-LMP1, TW03-LMP1, CNE2-vector and TW03-vector cells, as described in the Methods. CNE2-LMP1 and TW03-LMP1 cells showed significantly increased ECARs following the addition of glucose compared with those of CNE2-vector and TW03-vector cells. These results suggest that in the presence of LMP1, the added glucose was almost entirely degraded in the extra-mitochondrial glycolytic pathway, which resulted in the abundant release of lactic acid, thus providing evidence of a high glycolytic capacity. Then, oligomycin was added to block mitochondrial ATP production and induce maximal rates of extra-mitochondrial glycolysis. Importantly, CNE2-LMP1 and TW03-LMP1 cells each showed robust increases in their ECAR following oligomycin treatment, which was in contrast to the minimal changes observed in the control cells. These observations suggest that in the presence of LMP1, the shortage of ATP resulting from oligomycin treatment was compensated for by more intense extra-mitochondrial glycolysis and a more abundant extra-mitochondrial release of lactate, which provides evidence of a high glycolytic reserve. Finally, as expected, ECARs were dramatically reduced in all cell lines following the administration of the glycolytic pathway inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In conclusion, the glycolytic capacity and glycolytic reserve were both substantially increased in CNE2-LMP1 and TW03-LMP1 cells in comparison with these parameters in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Consistently, we found major changes in the expression of several genes encoding the transmembrane carrier GLUT1 and key enzymes involved in extra-mitochondrial glycolysis. The expression levels of GLUT1, HK2, glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI), and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2 and 3 (PFKFB2 and 3) were dramatically elevated in CNE2-LMP1 and TW03-LMP1 cells compared with the levels in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>

<title>LMP1 promotes the expression of MDSC-related molecules and cytokines leading to the induction of NPC-associated MDSCs <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>In previous reports, the expression of the LMP1 protein in tumor cells has been associated with immune tolerance in EBV-associated cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref024">24</xref>]. To investigate the role of EBV-LMP1 in the differentiation of tumor-associated MDSCs in NPC, we first measured the mRNA expression of genes related to MDSC differentiation as described in previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref026">26</xref>]. NLRP3 inflammasome molecules (NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment (CARD) domain [ASC], caspase-1 and IL-1β), COX-2, arginase 1 (Arg-1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which are related to MDSC differentiation, were investigated in LMP1-positive and LMP1-negative CNE2 and TW03 cells. We observed increased mRNA expression for NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1β, COX-2, Arg-1 and iNOS in CNE2-LMP1 and TW03-LMP1 cells compared to expression in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).

<title>GLUT1-dependent glycolysis is essential for LMP1-mediated MDSC induction</title>
<p>As mentioned in the Introduction, the metabolic reprogramming of malignant cells, which results in the enhancement of extra-mitochondrial glycolysis, can be sufficient for the induction of neighboring MDSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref014">14</xref>]. To investigate whether the impact of LMP1 on MDSCs was dependent on enhanced extra-mitochondrial glycolysis, we blocked GLUT1, which is upstream of all glycolytic pathways. The GLUT1 protein belongs to the solute carrier 2A (SLC2A) family of glucose transporter molecules and is a key regulator of glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref027">27</xref>]. Here, the glucose consumption and lactate production rates were substantially decreased when endogenous GLUT1 expression was knocked down with siRNA targeting GLUT1 in CNE2-LMP1 and TW03-LMP1 cells, as shown by ECAR measurements, and the effects included changes in the glycolytic capacity and glycolytic reserve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>). In addition, GLUT1 knockdown decreased the expression of glycolysis-related genes, including HK2, GPI, and PFKFB2 and 3, in CNE2-LMP1 and TW03-LMP1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006503.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). Interestingly, the mRNA levels of MDSC differentiation-related genes, including NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1β, and COX-2, were decreased in CNE2-LMP1 and TW03-LMP1 cells after blockade of endogenous GLUT1 expression (P &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). In addition, the expression of the P-p65, NLRP3, pro-caspase-1 and pro-IL-β proteins and the self-cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1β were increased in CNE2-LMP1 and TW03-LMP1 cells compared with control cells; however, the increased expression of P-p65, NLRP3, pro-caspase-1 and pro-IL-β and the self-cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1β were reversed after GLUT1 blockade in CNE2-LMP1 and TW03-LMP1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Subsequently, the secretion of the cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and GM-CSF was significantly decreased in CNE2-LMP1 and TW03-LMP1 cells following treatment with siGLUT1, and IL-6 and GM-CSF levels were significantly decreased after treatment with 2-DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g004">Fig 4F</xref>).</p>

<p>Importantly, the level of HLA-DR<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD33<sup>+</sup> MDSC induction mediated by CNE2-LMP1 and TW03-LMP1 cells was sharply decreased following treatment with siGLUT1 and 2-DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g004">Fig 4G</xref>, P &lt; 0.05).

<title>NLRP3 inflammasome activation contributes to LMP1-mediated MDSC expansion</title>
<p>Because GLUT1-dependent glycolysis activated the phosphorylation of p65 (NF-κB) and the NLRP3 inflammasome, we knocked down NLRP3 in CNE2-LMP1 and TW03-LMP1 cells using siRNA specific for NLRP3. The expression of EBV-LMP1, GLUT1 and P-p65 in CNE2-LMP1 and TW03-LMP1 cells was not affected by the siNLRP3 treatment, whereas the levels of pro-IL-1β and pro-caspase-1 were dramatically decreased once endogenous NLRP3 expression was blocked, without any effect on the self-cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

<title>LMP1 interacts with GLUT1 to disrupt GLUT1 p62-dependent autolysosomal degradation</title>
<p>We observed that EBV-LMP1 colocalized and interacted with GLUT1 in the cytoplasm and membranes of NPC-LMP1 cells using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and fluorescence immunostaining assays <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Importantly, we discovered that the half-life of GLUT1 was longer in CNE2-LMP1 and TW03-LMP1 cells than in control cells in the cycloheximide (CHX) ‘‘chase” assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). This mechanism contributed to the higher cellular concentration of GLUT1 and the up-regulation of GLUT1 mRNA expression, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g002">Fig 2D</xref>. To date, at least three systems of protein degradation, including the proteasome, lysosome, and autolysosome pathways, have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref030">30</xref>]. According to the results from the mechanistic analysis, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 increased the half-life of GLUT1 in both CNE2-LMP1 and TW03-LMP1 cells and in CNE2-vector and TW03-vector cells, whereas the autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) increased the half-life of GLUT1in CNE2-vector and TW03-vector cells but not in CNE2-LMP1 and TW03-LMP1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g006">Fig 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006503.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). We further discovered that GLUT1 levels were higher in p62KD-293T cells than in 293T cells, whereas GLUT1 levels were increased in 293T cells with forced LMP1 expression but not in p62KD-293T cells with forced LMP1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Moreover, approximately the same amount of GLUT1 protein was pulled down by Flag-p62 in the co-IP analysis as in the CNE2-vector and CNE2-LMP1 cells transfected with Flag-p62 plasmids, although GLUT1 levels were increased in CNE2-LMP1 cells compared with CNE2-vector cells, as determined by an immunoblotting analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006503.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). These data suggest that LMP1 inhibits GLUT1 autophagic degradation in a p62-dependent manner by disrupting the interaction of GLUT1 with the autophagic cargo receptor p62. In addition, a dramatic decrease in ubiquitinated GLUT1 was observed in CNE2-LMP1 cells compared to that in CNE2-vector cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). Meanwhile, the expression levels of GLUT1 in CNE2-LMP1 cells were much higher than the levels in CNE2 cells, suggesting that LMP1 might affect GLUT1 K48-linked ubiquitination. To confirm this hypothesis, we employed ubiquitin mutant plasmids (as described in the Methods section) pHA-Ub-K48R (only K48 affected), pHA-Ub-K63R (only K63 affected), pHA-Ub-K48 (only K48 retained) or pHA-Ub-K63 (only K63 retained). Transfection with pHA-Ub-K48R resulted in the same level of ubiquitinated GLUT1 in the CNE2-LMP1 and CNE2-vector cell lines, whereas transfection with pHA-Ub-K48 resulted in a lower level of ubiquitinated GLUT1 in CNE2-LMP1 cells than in CNE2-vector cells. Transfection with pHA-Ub-K63R did not result in the expression of ubiquitinated GLUT1 in CNE2-LMP1 and CNE2-vector cells, while transfection with pHA-Ub-K63 resulted in a reduction in ubiquitinated GLUT1 in CNE2-LMP1 cells compared to that in CNE2-vector cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that LMP1 disrupts the K48-linked ubiquitination of GLUT1 and the binding of GLUT1 and the autophagic cargo receptor p62 to delay the autolysosomal degradation of the GLUT1 protein.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The differentiation and expansion of MDSCs has been described in various cancers, including NPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref032">32</xref>]. Several oncogenic viruses, including HIV and HCV, have been associated with MDSC expansion in virus-associated cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref034">34</xref>]. However, researchers have not determined whether viral genes are involved in MDSC differentiation to induce anti-tumor immune suppression in EBV-associated NPC, and its molecular mechanism is largely unknown. For the first time, we have shown a triple positive correlation between the expression of LMP1 and GLUT1 in malignant cells and the abundance of CD33<sup>+</sup> MDSCs in the stroma of NPC tumors. We showed that LMP1 reprograms GLUT1-dependent extra-mitochondrial glycolysis in NPC cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. This metabolic reprogramming resulted in increased expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome, COX-2 and P-p65 and a subsequent increase in IL-1β, IL-6 and GM-CSF production. Finally, these changes in the environment of malignant cells results in enhanced MDSC induction. One key step is the physical interaction of LMP1 with GLUT1, which blocks its K48-ubiquitination and p62-dependent autolysosomal degradation.</p>
<p>One merit of our report is that we provide an integrated view of the relationship between the expression of LMP1, metabolic reprogramming and the expansion of intra-tumor MDSCs. Previous publications, including one of our reports, have pointed out the pejorative prognostic value of abundant LMP1 and GLUT1 expression, as well as the abundant infiltration of CD33<sup>+</sup> MDSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref018">18</xref>]. LMP1 is associated with poorer survival in EBV-associated cancers, including NPC, EBV<sup>+</sup> B-cell lymphoma and NK/T lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref037">37</xref>]. Similarly, the expression of GLUT1 is correlated with shorter survival times in different types of solid tumors and in Hodgkin’s lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref041">41</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that in malignant NPC cells, EBV-encoded LMP1 increases extra-mitochondrial glycolysis through the up-regulation of HK2 or the repression of the HoxC8 gene. These metabolic changes were shown to promote tumor progression and resistance to radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref042">42</xref>]. Our results are consistent with these previous findings but also go beyond them by showing the correlation between LMP1/GLUT1 expression and CD33<sup>+</sup> MDSC infiltration, their negative prognostic value and their causal relationship.</p>
<p>Notably, the induction of glycolysis by LMP1 was attenuated following the blockade of endogenous GLUT1 expression or the inhibition of glucose consumption by 2-DG. Many studies have linked the abundance of GLUT proteins in the cell membrane and the activity of intracellular enzymes such as HKs, which results in the concomitant intracellular accumulation of glucose and alterations in glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref045">45</xref>]. We consistently observed a decrease in the expression of various glycolytic genes, including HK2 and PFKB2 and 3, in GLUT1-knockdown CNE2-LMP1 and TW03-LMP1 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006503.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). Interestingly, we discovered that LMP1 not only induces GLUT1 mRNA expression but also increases the protein level of GLUT1 by interacting with GLUT1 to disrupt GLUT1 K48-ubiquitination and p62-dependent autolysosomal degradation, which results in GLUT1 protein stabilization and glucose import to increase the rate of glycolysis. This result is consistent with the findings of another study of B-cell lymphoma that showed that LMP1 promoted GLUT1 plasma membrane localization via IKKβ expression and activation of the NF-κΒ signaling pathway, which promoted EBV-infected B-cell lymphoma proliferation and apoptosis resistance by driving glucose import and increasing glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref046">46</xref>]. In addition, LMP1 has been shown to promote GLUT1 mRNA and protein expression in NPC cells through activation of the p65 subunit of the NF-κB pathway. In this study, the C-terminal activating region 2 (CTAR2) of LMP1 appears to be the key domain involved in activating mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and NF-κB, mainly through inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK)-mediated phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) at Ser93 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref047">47</xref>]. This finding is consistent with our observations that pharmacological NF-κB inhibition in NPC-LMP1 cells decreased the level of P-p65 and the GLUT1 mRNA and protein levels. Simultaneously, this treatment induced a decrease in IL-1β and IL-6 secretion and NPC-induced MDSC differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006503.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Moreover, LMP1 promoted an increase in GLUT1 protein levels by directly binding to GLUT1 through amino acids (aas) 230–322 of LMP1, which is located between CTAR1 and CTAR2 (maybe in CTAR3 aas275-330), thus leading to the inhibition of K48-ubiquitination of GLUT1 and p62-dependent lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006503.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The consequence of these multiple modifications is a higher rate of glycolysis in LMP1-positive than in LMP1-negative cells. The contribution of LMP1 to modulating immune responses in EBV<sup>+</sup> tumors remains controversial. Some studies suggest that the immune evasion signals mediated via LMP1 may shield an EBV-infected cell from host immune monitoring in the latent infection phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref048">48</xref>]. In contrast, LMP1 is suspected to enhance antigen processing and presentation through the up-regulation of TAP and MHC class I in Burkitt lymphoma cells. This is probably very important for the host-virus relationship of healthy EBV carriers in which the elimination of EBV-infected B cells expressing the transforming latency III (growth) program is crucial. LMP1 expression in these cells might facilitate their immune recognition and elimination, which is essential for the survival of the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref051">51</xref>]. In contrast, we provide one the first demonstrations of the immunosuppressive action of LMP1 in an EBV-related malignancy with a detailed account of the underlying molecular and cellular steps. MDSCs are the precursors of immune cells of myeloid origin, including macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils, and are correlated with the suppression of anti-tumor immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref052">52</xref>]. Their differentiation and the stabilization of their phenotype requires the action of a series of cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6 and GM-CSF. We show that the induction of these cytokines by LMP1 involves COX-2, Arg-1, iNOS and the NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3, caspase-1 and IL-1β). LMP1 expression promotes the phosphorylation of p65 and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in IL-1β, IL-6 and GM-CSF production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006503.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Strikingly, the production of these cytokines is decreased by the blockade of GLUT1 or the administration of 2-DG, followed by a decrease in glycolysis in NPC cells. To our knowledge, previous reports on the link between glycolysis and the differentiation of tumor-infiltrating MDSCs were not as clear. One study showed that glycolytic activation through the mTOR-hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) pathway promoted the late differentiation of MDSCs into M1 type macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref014">14</xref>], whereas other studies confirmed that enhancing glycolysis is required for MDSC differentiation from precursor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref054">54</xref>]. Here, our <italic>in vitro</italic> data show that GLUT1-dependent glycolysis, which was promoted by LMP1, is required for LMP1-mediated tumor-associated MDSC differentiation. The attenuation of glycolysis by siLGUT1, 2-DG or the pharmaceutical drug metformin decreased the extent of NPC-LMP1-induced MDSC differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006503.s002">S2D Fig</xref>), whereas low pH medium increased CNE2-derived MDSC differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006503.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). These findings might inspire novel strategies for treating patients with NPC. In particular, metformin could be used to prevent and treat cancer, based on its different mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref055">55</xref>].</p>
<p>The inflammasome is a protein complex comprising an intracellular sensor (typically a Nod-like receptor such as NLRP3), the precursor pro-caspase-1 and the adaptor ASC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref056">56</xref>]. Physiologically, NLRP3 is activated by various danger signals, including those produced by bacterial species such as <italic>Salmonella</italic>, which results in the maturation of caspase-1 and the processing of its substrates, IL-1β and IL-18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref056">56</xref>]. Disruption of glycolysis and decreased ATP production have been reported to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, and the activation of NLRP3 has an important effect on the differentiation and function of innate immune cells, such as macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref058">58</xref>]. Recently, one report found that PKM2-dependent glycolysis promotes NLRP3 and AIM inflammasome activation in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref059">59</xref>]. In the present study, our results confirm that LMP1-GLUT1-dependent glycolysis triggers the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which was associated with the production of IL-1β from NPC cells. The suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activity by siNLRP3 or the caspase-1 inhibitor VX765 significantly attenuated LMP1-mediated MDSC induction <italic>in vitro</italic>. Other groups have found that in NLRP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice, the number of tumor-associated MDSCs was significantly decreased, and the mice displayed a better response to dendritic cell vaccination against melanoma than wild-type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref060">60</xref>]. Furthermore, the chemotherapeutic agents gemcitabine (Gem) and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) have been confirmed to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in MDSCs to curtail anticancer immunity, and Gem and 5FU exert greater anti-tumor effects when tumors are established in NLRP3<sup>-/-</sup> or casp1<sup>-/-</sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref061">61</xref>]. Overall, these data indicate that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has an important role in functional tumor-associated MDSC induction. However, several studies have shown that EBV infection can induce the NLRP3 inflammasome to produce IL-1β and IL-18, leading to the growth and activation of anti-apoptosis mechanisms of EBV-infected tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref062">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref064">64</xref>]. In the present study, we showed for the first time that LMP1 can induce NLRP3 expression and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in NPC cells through GLUT1-dependent glycolysis. In addition, our data reveal that LMP1 up-regulates COX-2 expression and the NF-κB pathway (P-p65), which induced IL-6 and GM-CSF secretion, as previously reported by our group and other researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref065">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref066">66</xref>]. Therefore, LMP1-mediated MDSC expansion is dependent on GLUT1-dependent glycolysis to activate multiple signaling pathways.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of tumor-induced MDSC expansion and immune evasion in EBV-associated NPC. In terms of clinical and pathological observations, we report a positive correlation between LMP1/GLUT1 expression in malignant cells and the abundance of CD33<sup>+</sup> MDSCs in the NPC tumor microenvironment. In terms of molecular and cellular mechanisms, we show that LMP1 interacts with GLUT1 to delay GLUT1 p62-dependent autolysosomal degradation and increase GLUT1-dependent glycolysis <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover this effect on p62-dependent autolysosomal degradation contributes to LMP1-mediated MDSC induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006503.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Increased glycolysis promotes tumor-associated MDSC expansion in the NPC microenvironment by triggering the activation of p65 and the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway, which leads to the production of IL-1β, IL6 and GM-CSF by malignant NPC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006503.g007">Fig 7</xref>). These findings indicate an important role for the EBV antigen LMP1 in immuno-metabolism and immune evasion and will guide the future development of therapeutic strategies for treating NPC.</p>

The samples were scored with IHC values of 0, 1, 2, or 3 when the following percentages of cells were LMP1 or GLUT1 positive: &lt; 5% (0); ≥ 5% but &lt; 10% (1); ≥ 10% but &lt; 50% (2); or ≥ 50% (3). Mouse IgG1 (DAKO) and normal goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) negative control staining was performed and evaluated.</p>

<p>CNE2-LMP1 and CNE2-vector cells in a 60 mm-diameter dish were cotransfected with the indicated plasmids, including pHA-Ub, pHA-Ub-K48R, pHA-Ub-K63R (lysine at position 48 or 63 was replaced with arginine), pHA-Ub-K48 and pHA-Ub-K63 (all lysines, with the exception of lysines 48 or 63, were replaced with arginine) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For the detection of GLUT1 ubiquitination, at 36 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 at a final concentration of 20 μM for 6 h and then washed twice with PBS and lysed with ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]). The supernatants were divided into two aliquots. One aliquot (5%) was prepared for WB. The second aliquot (95%) was sonicated five times to shear the DNA. The soluble lysates were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody, followed by three washes with RIPA buffer. HA-tagged proteins were resolved via SDS-PAGE and sequentially blotted with the indicated antibodies.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Parametric statistics were applied for <italic>in vitro</italic> data, Student’s t-tests were used for comparisons between experimental treatment groups and control groups. The relationships among LMP1, GLUT1, CD33 values and the clinical pathological features were tested using Pearson’s chi-square tests. Nonparametric data were analyzed using Mann–Whitney U tests. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate patient survival, and survival differences were estimated using log-rank tests; the cutoff value for each IHC variant was estimated using X-Tile software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006503.ref067">67</xref>]. The values are presented as the means ± standard errors of the means (SEM). P was considered statistically significant when &lt; 0.05.
