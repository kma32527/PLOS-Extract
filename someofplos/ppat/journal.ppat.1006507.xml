<abstract>
<p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes a persistent, lifelong infection. CMV persists in a latent state and undergoes intermittent subclinical viral reactivation that is quelled by ongoing T cell responses. While T cells are critical to maintain control of infection, the immunological factors that promote CMV persistence remain unclear. Here, we investigated the role of regulatory T cells (Treg) in a mouse model of latent CMV infection using Foxp3-diphtheria toxin receptor (Foxp3-DTR) mice. Eight months after infection, MCMV had established latency in the spleen, salivary gland, lung, and pancreas, which was accompanied by an increased frequency of Treg. Administration of diphtheria toxin (DT) after establishment of latency efficiently depleted Treg and drove a significant increase in the numbers of functional MCMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Strikingly, Treg depletion decreased the number of animals with reactivatable latent MCMV in the spleen. Unexpectedly, in the same animals, ablation of Treg drove a significant increase in viral reactivation in the salivary gland that was accompanied with augmented local IL-10 production by Foxp3-CD4+T cells. Further, neutralization of IL-10 after Treg depletion significantly decreased viral load in the salivary gland. Combined, these data show that Treg have divergent control of MCMV infection depending upon the tissue. In the spleen, Treg antagonize CD8+ effector function and promote viral persistence while in the salivary gland Treg prevent IL-10 production and limit viral reactivation and replication. These data provide new insights into the organ-specific roles of Treg in controlling the reactivation of latent MCMV infection.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in both mice and humans is normally initially contained by a vigorous adaptive immune response that drives the virus into latency in multiple tissues. However, the immunologic mechanisms that control latency are not well understood. In this report, we have examined the role of regulatory T cells (Treg) in a mouse model of CMV infection. Interestingly, depletion of regulatory T cells had profound consequences on MCMV latent infection, depending upon the tissue. In the spleen, Treg depletion enhanced CD8+ T cell responses and reduced reactivatable latent infection from the spleen. In striking contrast, in the salivary gland, Treg depletion enhanced the production of IL-10 from CD4+ T cells as well as viral reactivation. Thus, Treg play divergent and tissue specific roles in controlling MCMV reactivation from latency.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The immune system has evolved multiple innate and adaptive strategies to control pathogens[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref001">1</xref>]. Likewise, in order to ensure their persistence, pathogens have developed sophisticated and elaborate mechanisms to avoid the host immune system establishing latent infections that are never cleared from the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref007">7</xref>]. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and its murine homolog (MCMV) are well-studied examples of pathogens that have developed multiple means to establish latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref010">10</xref>]. MCMV is a reasonable model for HCMV as it shares multiple biological characteristics and significant homology to the genome of HCMV[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref011">11</xref>]. A large number of HCMV and MCMV genes are involved in modulating innate and adaptive host immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref015">15</xref>]. During primary infection, these viruses vigorously replicate and disseminate by infecting many cell types, including epithelial, endothelial, smooth muscle, and connective tissue cells, as well as specialized parenchymal cells in multiple tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Primary CMV infection is well controlled by a robust early NK cell response followed by CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses that ultimately results in control of virus replication, although the virus is not eliminated and persists for the lifetime of the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref020">20</xref>]. Interestingly, prior work shows that the control of lytic virus in different tissues requires distinct immune cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref025">25</xref>]. In the spleen, epitope-specific CD8+ T cells are sufficient to control acute MCMV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref026">26</xref>]. Whereas in the salivary gland (SG), CD4+ T cells and, in particular their production of IFN-γ, are crucial for terminating lytic viral replication. Further, IL-10R blockade or the absence of CD4+ cell-derived IL-10 enhanced the accumulation of IFN-γ–producing CD4+ T cells and inhibited MCMV persistence in the SG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref029">29</xref>]. This role of CD4+ T cells in the SG is critical, as there appears to be a reservoir of MCMV in non-hematopoietic cells within the SG that downregulate MHC class I and become resistant to CD8+ T cell killing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref022">22</xref>]. However, recent work showed that CD8+ T cells can play a role in controlling MCMV in the SG after local re-infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref030">30</xref>]. The likely explanation for this differential role of CD8+ T cells during re-infection is because of the higher expression of class I MHC in acutely infected cells in contrast to cells harboring latent virus. Regulatory T cells (Treg) have also been shown to contribute to immune-mediated control of acute MCMV infection. <italic>In vitro</italic>, Treg were shown to suppress the function of MCMV-specific CD8+T cells via secretion of TGF-ß [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref031">31</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic>, during acute MCMV, Treg depletion resulted in enhanced MCMV-specific T cell responses and decreased viral load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref032">32</xref>]. Nonetheless, following the termination of lytic infection, the virus persists in a latent state in which viral genomes are present in the absence of replicating virus.</p>
<p>MCMV establishes latency in a number of tissues similar to HCMV, including the spleen, lungs, and bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref036">36</xref>]. This latent form of HCMV drives a substantial amount of morbidity when it reactivates in immune suppressed individuals (e.g. aged individuals, persons with HIV infection, transplant patients) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref039">39</xref>]. During latent infection, HCMV persists in CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells as well as more committed myeloid lineage progenitor cells, monocytes, and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref044">44</xref>]. Both myeloid lineage cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref045">45</xref>], as well as non-hematopoietic cells such as endothelial cells in many organs are considered cellular sites of latent infection for MCMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref047">47</xref>].While a fair amount is known regarding immune mechanisms controlling acute MCMV infection, significantly less is known about immune mechanisms contributing to the control of latent MCMV infection. It has been reported that once latency is established, the cooperative function of lymphocytes including NK, CD4+, CD8+ T cells and CMV-specific antibodies prevent the production of lytic virus from latent pools in the spleen and lungs and SG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref048">48</xref>]. In most visceral organs, CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in preventing the emergence of lytic viral replication. For example, CD8+ T cells maintain latency by epitope-specific sensing of transcriptional reactivation in the lungs and killing these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref049">49</xref>]. Similar to their role in controlling acute infection in the SG, CD4+ T cell production of IFN-γ is critical to prevent lytic virus production from latently infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref051">51</xref>].</p>
<p>During latency, there is substantial epigenetic suppression of viral immediate-early genes that must be overcome by cellular signals to exit from latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref052">52</xref>]. Two models have been proposed for MCMV reactivation during latency. First, a two-step model proposed by Hummel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref053">53</xref>] in which an inflammatory immune response can drive the activation of the major immediate-early (MIE) gene, initiating reactivation from latency. The second step requires an immune-suppressive environment, such as that which occurs during γ-irradiation or immune-deficiency. This immune-suppressive environment allows the virus to actively replicate, facilitating the production of lytic virus. In one example of this two-step scenario, the production of inflammatory mediators like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) following allogeneic transplantation of kidneys in mice initiated IE gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref054">54</xref>]. However, full lytic reactivation of MCMV was only found in immune-deficient recipients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref055">55</xref>]. Similarly, in human transplant patients, HCMV reactivation correlated with increased inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref057">57</xref>]. A second model focusing on latency and reactivation in the lung suggests that virus is reactivating frequently in immunocompetent hosts as shown by detectable levels of the immediate-early ie1/ie3 transcripts but that checkpoints exist which prevent full production of infectious virus following transcriptional activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref060">60</xref>]. Increased TNF-α levels were not enough to fully reactivate virus, although five-fold higher levels of IE transcripts were detected. Presumably memory T cells, specific for the IE proteins, lyse the reactivating cells before virus is produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref061">61</xref>]. Multiple immune cells such as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and other factors such as antibody and IFN-γ have also been shown to be important for maintaining latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref062">62</xref>]. However, the immune cells and molecular factors that control viral latency and whether these cells and factors are the same between different tissues remains unclear.</p>
<p>In recent work, recurrent virus reactivation was accompanied by a concomitant increase in Treg frequency and suppressive functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref063">63</xref>]. Thus, while Treg have been associated with viral reactivation, a causative role in control of latent CMV/MCMV has not been established. Here, we investigated the role of Treg in controlling latent MCMV infection. Strikingly, we found that Treg had opposing effects in distinct tissues harboring latent virus. In the spleen, Treg promoted viral persistence and suppressed local MCMV-specific effector T cell responses, while in the SG Treg were required to prevent viral reactivation/replication and IL-10 production by Foxp3- CD4+ T cells. These data show that Treg play divergent and tissue-specific roles in controlling viral reactivation from latency depending upon the type of T cells (effector or regulatory) they inhibit.</p>

<title>Activated Treg are increased in the spleen during latent MCMV</title>
<p>Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) can suppress effector T cells and promote MCMV replication in the spleen and salivary gland (SG) during acute MCMV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref032">32</xref>]. However, there are no studies examining the role of Treg during latent MCMV infection. To investigate the role of regulatory T cells (Treg) during latent MCMV infection, we infected cohorts of C57BL/6 and Foxp3-DTR mice with MCMV and waited for 8 months. Notably, in the C57BL/6 background, low level virus replication continues in the SG and spleen for months longer than is observed in mice on a BALB/c background. Thus, it took 7 to 8 months following infection for the establishment of latency, as measured by the inability to detect replicating virus in multiple tissues, including spleen, lung, liver, pancreas, and SG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006507.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Next, we examined the levels and activation status of Treg in the spleen of latently infected mice. Interestingly, compared to uninfected mice of the same age, the frequency of Treg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006507.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>), and in particular “effector” Treg (as assessed by CD69 expression) were significantly increased in MCMV infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006507.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>), although the total number of these cells was not different (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006507.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). Thus, latent MCMV infection favors the preferential accrual of activated Treg in the spleen.</p>

<title>Treg inhibit effector T cell responses and promote latent MCMV infection in the spleen</title>
<p>Next, we determined the role of Treg in latent MCMV infection using Foxp3-DTR mice, which allows the specific depletion of Treg using diphtheria toxin (DT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref064">64</xref>]. Before DT administration the levels of MCMV-specific T cells were not significantly different between WT and Foxp3-DTR mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006507.s004">S2A Fig</xref>). After DT administration, the frequency and total numbers of Treg were substantially reduced relative to DT-treated controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006507.s004">S2B Fig</xref>). As MCMV-specific T cells control viral replication, we determined the role of Treg in suppressing MCMV-specific T cell responses during latent infection. Treg depletion resulted in a significant increase in MCMV-specific CD8+ T and CD4+ T cells, relative to control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006507.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). MCMV-specific CD8+ T cells in Treg depleted mice expressed markers of differentiation (KLRG-1) and proliferation (Ki67) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006507.s004">S2C and S2D Fig</xref>).

Similarly, CD107α expressing MCMV-specific CD8+ T cells were significantly increased after Treg depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006507.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).

<p>Given the differences in effector T cell responses following Treg depletion, it was important to evaluate if loss of Treg would modulate the latent MCMV viral load. Seven days after initial DT treatment there was no actively replicating virus in the spleen in either controls or Foxp3-DTR mice as assessed by plaque assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006507.s002">S2 Table</xref>). Using a spleen explant assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref065">65</xref>], we examined the impact of Treg on the latent viral pool. The spleen explant assay provides a functional assay to assess reactivation from latency, and thus, indirectly provide information on viral load levels since a lower latent viral load is expected to be less efficient at reactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref065">65</xref>]. As detected in the explant assay, for the WT control mice, 6 out of 9 mice had evidence of viral reactivation by 28 days post explant culture, whereas MCMV reactivated only in 3 out of 9 Foxp3-DTR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006507.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Further, titers of reactivating virus in WT mice were significantly higher in the first two weeks than those detected in the few Treg-depleted mice that had reactivated MCMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006507.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). To further evaluate whether reduced virus reactivation from the spleen also correlated with reduced levels of viral DNA following Treg depletion, we performed qPCR on total splenic DNA to quantify viral genomes. Although there was variation from one experiment to the next, we saw a consistent decrease in viral genome levels in spleens from Foxp3-DTR mice relative to C57BL/6 controls across four independent experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006507.s005">S3 Fig</xref>, average percent decrease of 62.72% +/- 9.4; p&lt;0.007). Thus, Treg are critical to maintain the reactivatable latent pool of MCMV in the spleen. However, the increase in overall spleen cellularity (and hence DNA content) following Treg depletion could also contribute to a decreased detection of viral load.</p>

<title>Treg are required to prevent MCMV reactivation and MCMV-specific CD4+ T cells in the SG</title>
<p>Given the role of Treg in promoting viral persistence in the spleen, we next determined the role of Treg in the control of latent MCMV infection in the SG. Similar to the spleen, latency in the SG was established by 8 months as evidenced by the lack of replicating virus prior to DT administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006507.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). However, in stark contrast to the reduction in viral load in the spleen upon Treg depletion at day 7, Treg depleted mice had detectable replicating virus in the SG. While 3 out of 11 WT mice had a barely detectable viral reactivation, 9 out of 10 DT-treated Foxp3-DTR mice had a significant increase in viral reactivation and viral titers in the SG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006507.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). Indeed, in several experiments, virus was not detected in the WT SG whereas actively replicating virus was consistently detected in the SG of the Foxp3-DTR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006507.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). Additionally, reactivation occurred as early as day 4 after Treg depletion with evidence of increased, albeit low, viral titers in reactivating mice observed at that time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006507.s006">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>).

<title>Treg suppress CD4+ Foxp3- IL-10+ cells in the SG and IL-10 is critical for limiting viral load in the SG after Treg depletion</title>
<p>Prior work showed that IL-10 is critical for promoting viral replication in the SG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref028">28</xref>]. Indeed, we found that depletion of Treg drove a significant increase in SG IL-10 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006507.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Given the increase in CD4+ T cell responses in the SG, we next examined the potential cellular sources of IL-10. Importantly, CD4+Foxp3-cells were the predominant source for IL-10 production compared to CD8+ T cells and non–T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006507.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Combined, these data show that Treg suppress a population of CD4+ Foxp3- IL-10+ cells, consistent with a potential role of these cells in MCMV replication in the SG. As the effects of Treg depletion on viral reactivation/latency were quite different in the SG compared to the spleen, we examined IL-10 levels in the spleen as reduced IL-10 could potentially explain the different viral loads. Similar to the SG, IL-10-producing Foxp3- CD4+ T cells were increased in the spleen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006507.s008">S6A Fig</xref>).

Our ability to assess the role of Treg in latent MCMV infection was greatly facilitated by two essential tools. First, Foxp3-DTR mice, which express diphtheria toxin receptor under the Foxp3 promoter allowed for depletion of Treg upon DT administration[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref064">64</xref>]. Second, the use of a sensitive tissue explant assay and qPCR allowed us to assess the reactivatable latent viral pool in mice with Treg depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref065">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref067">67</xref>]. Herein, we found that depletion of Treg during latent MCMV infection had profound consequences. In the spleen, Treg restrained MCMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and promoted the latent viral pool. In stark contrast, in the SG, Treg were essential to limit viral reactivation because they prevented the emergence of IL-10- secreting Foxp3- CD4+ T cells. Thus, we demonstrate unique tissue-specific functions of Treg in control of latent MCMV infection.</p>
<p>During latent MCMV infection, we found a significant increase in activated Treg in the spleen. We speculate that the increase in Treg maybe a direct consequence of the chronic stimulation due to the periodic low-level viral reactivation during latency. In agreement, in other chronic infections like Leishmaniasis, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Treg frequency was substantially increased in the spleen and other tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref068">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref070">70</xref>]. Interestingly, human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) infection, another herpes virus closely related to HCMV, induces virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ regulatory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref071">71</xref>]. Thus, chronic infections appear to promote their own persistence by driving Treg accrual.</p>
<p>Strikingly, Treg depletion resulted in markedly reduced latent virus in the spleen as measured by two assays. Some mice had undetectable viral DNA levels in the spleen, suggesting that viral load had been reduced to levels that were below the limit of detection in our assay. We acknowledge that the increase in spleen size and cellularity could contribute to the observed reduction in latent viral load. However, in Treg-depleted mice where viral DNA load was undetectable, the spleen size and cellularity was similar to mice with detectable levels of viral DNA. Nonetheless, future experiments will investigate this in more detail, examining the number of cells harboring latent virus and the levels of virus within such cells. The spleen explant assay allowed us to assess one aspect of latent MCMV infection, the ability to reactivate from latency as a measure of whether reactivatable latent viral loads in the spleen were affected by Treg depletion. In our hands, if virus is replicating in the spleen at the time of isolation, this is detected by seven days post explants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref065">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref072">72</xref>]. However, if virus is latent in the tissue at the time of isolation, it takes longer for the virus to be detected in the explant assay, usually by day 14, and then rapidly spreads and replicates within the culture. Although this assay is not quantitative per se, we recently demonstrated that a mutant virus was unable to reactivate from the spleen by explant culture and had reduced levels of viral DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref065">65</xref>], (Cardin, manuscript in preparation). Here, our results show that the Foxp3-DTR mice were less efficient at reactivation in this assay, suggesting lower levels of latent virus in the spleen. Importantly, we found that both the number of Foxp3-DTR mice with reactivating virus and also the levels of virus replication per mouse in the spleen explant cultures were reduced. Decreased reactivation from the spleen was highly reproducible between studies, and indeed, qPCR analysis of viral DNA in the spleen could indicate lower levels of latent virus in mice depleted of Treg, with the caveat of spleen size as mentioned earlier. Alternatively, we cannot rule out that the increased numbers of virus-specific T cells in the Treg-depleted spleens are functional after placement into the explant culture and thus elimination of latently-infected cells could also occur <italic>in vitro</italic>; however, these T cells likely have a very limited survival <italic>in vitro</italic>. It is important to note that we were unable to carry out long-term Treg depletion (greater than 14 days), because of the rampant and lethal autoimmunity that ensues with long-term Treg depletion in these mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref064">64</xref>]. Further, the impact of Treg depletion on latent viral genomes likely only impacted those genomes that underwent a reactivation event and became detectable by the immune system due to viral antigen expression. Given that Treg depletion was accompanied by a substantial increase in cytotoxic MCMV-specific CD8+ T cells in the spleen, it is likely that Treg depletion led to the reactivation of some viral genomes, which was likely quickly quelled in the spleen by an MCMV-specific CD8+ T cell response, possibly even before lytic virus was produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref049">49</xref>]. Additional studies are needed to address this further.</p>
<p>One important question raised by our study is the mechanism(s) by which Treg suppress CD8+ T cell responses to MCMV. Prior <italic>in vitro</italic> work suggested that Treg utilize TGF-β to suppress MCMV- specific T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref031">31</xref>], although CTLA-4 and IL-10 may also have a regulatory role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref073">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref074">74</xref>]. In a chronic Friend virus (FV) infection model, FV-specific CD8+ T cells were also partially restrained by Treg, although the mechanism(s) appear to be independent of PD-1 and Tim-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref075">75</xref>]. Interestingly, our previously published data show that Treg from aged mice have significantly increased levels of IL-35p19, suggesting that IL-35 may contribute to suppression of MCMV-specific CD8+ T cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref076">76</xref>]. However, a recent paper showed that IL-35 produced by NK cells during acute MCMV infection promotes, rather than inhibits IL-10 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref077">77</xref>]. Nonetheless, further studies are required to determine the mechanism by which Treg restrain MCMV-specific CD8+ T cell effector functions and thus promote latent infections.</p>
<p>It was very surprising that, while the depletion of Treg resulted in reduction in viral load in the spleen, it was accompanied by an augmented reactivation and/or replication of the latent viral pool in the SG. We envision three major potential mechanisms that may explain these results. First, it is possible that under chronic infection such as that observed in MCMV infected SG, Treg could lose immunosuppressive abilities and acquire the phenotype of a more pathogenic or anti-viral Treg. There is precedence for Treg metamorphosis in tumor models and under chronic inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref078">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref081">81</xref>]. This makes teleological sense as chronic inflammation may favor Treg with more effector function to replace exhausted effector T cells. However, we looked for Treg expression of pathogenic markers (i.e. T-bet, RORγt) on SG Treg and failed to find expression of these markers. Second, it is possible that the kinetics of latency establishment between the two tissues explains the differential effects on latent virus (clearance &amp; reactivation) in the two tissues. For example, because the virus established latency in the spleen after three months but was latent in the SG after 7 months, perhaps clearance was easier to achieve in the spleen due to a lower level of latent viral load. However, we performed several experiments examining Treg depletion 2–5 months after primary infection and found that, similar to 8 months after infection, that loss of Treg drove significant decrease in MCMV replication in the spleen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006507.s009">S7 Fig</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the tissue microenvironment rather than the timing controls the tissue-specific role of Treg. Third, it is possible that Treg maintain their suppressive capacity and instead of their “classical” role of inhibiting pro-inflammatory T cells, it is possible that they similarly control anti-inflammatory T cells. If so, the result of suppressing anti-inflammatory cells would be the promotion of an immune-suppressive environment which is permissive for viral reactivation/replication. Our data are most consistent with this latter possibility. In this regard, CD4+ T cell production of IL-10 was increased in both the spleen and SG after Treg depletion. One obvious question is why didn’t this increase in IL-10 drive viral reactivation in the spleen? One likely explanation is that, in the spleen, where CD8+ T cells are critical to prevent lytic virus production, their levels of IL-10R are significantly decreased, making them insensitive to IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref082">82</xref>].</p>
<p>Our data also show that Treg depletion drives viral reactivation in the SG and implicates IL-10 in the process. However, current data in the literature suggest that IL-10 contributes more to viral replication than outright reactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref083">83</xref>]. Indeed, prior work has shown that the specific production of IL-10 from Foxp3- CD4+ cells attenuates acute antiviral immune-responses and leads to persistent viral replication in the SG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref027">27</xref>]. Thus, while our data clearly show that inhibition of IL-10R signaling restored viral control, more work is required to conclusively determine whether IL-10 promotes outright reactivation or promotes viral replication. However, in our study, we initiated IL-10R antibody treatment following the initiation of Treg depletion, thus, if virus had started to reactivate, it could have been effectively controlled. The effect of IL-10 on viral control could be direct or indirect. IL-10 can directly affect CD4+ T cell production of effector cytokines like IFN-γ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref084">84</xref>]. Indeed, IFN-γ is indispensable for the control of viral load in the SG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref085">85</xref>]. However, there was no diminution in IFN-γ production upon Treg depletion, instead IFN-γ production was actually increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006507.s010">S8 Fig</xref>). Alternatively, IL-10 can indirectly compromise CD4+ T cell responses in the SG by interfering with the responsiveness of APC to IFN-γ. For example, it is well known that IL-10 inhibits the effect of IFN-γ by interfering with IFN-γinduced genes, preventing the phosphorylation of STAT-1 molecules and activation of monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref086">86</xref>]. Thus, while our data clearly show a role for IL-10, more work is required to determine the cellular targets of IL-10 that regulate reactivation/replication. Notably, the cellular site(s) of MCMV latency in host tissues is a long debated issue. Like HCMV, MCMV can establish a latent infection in cells of the myeloid lineage and these cells are able to respond to IL-10. However, other, non-hematopoietic targets, like endothelial cells cannot be excluded.</p>
<p>This divergent and tissue-specific role in controlling MCMV viral latency by Treg raises the question as to whether Treg manipulation is a useful therapy in latent HCMV infection. In HCMV, manipulating Treg is viewed as a promising therapeutic approach to control latent viral reactivation in immune-compromised hosts like organ transplant patients. In a prior study, the use of immune-suppressive drugs like daclizumab (anti-CD25), steroids and calcineurin inhibitors in CMV sero-positive renal transplant patients, led to reduction of Treg levels that correlated with enhanced levels of CMV-specific effector T cells, suggesting that modulation of Treg favors maintenance of CMV-specific immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006507.ref087">87</xref>]. However, Treg depletion may also promote viral reactivation in sites such as SG that are not assessed in treated patients. Thus, manipulating Treg could be a double-edged sword. Treg in CMV infection might exert different functional activity depending on their localization within the infected host and the T-cell responses that they regulate. Our data, suggesting that Treg could regulate another suppressor CD4+Foxp3-IL-10+ cells in the SG and limit viral reactivation opposed to their conventional role in regulating effector T cells as observed in the spleen, is a novel concept. It is unclear whether the mechanisms employed by Treg to inhibit effector T cell responses vs. other regulatory cell populations are distinct. Understanding such mechanisms might be crucial however to enhance the suppressive effects of Treg on other immune suppressive cell populations in some instances (chronic infections) or block the suppressive effect of Treg on others (i.e. autoimmunity).</p>
