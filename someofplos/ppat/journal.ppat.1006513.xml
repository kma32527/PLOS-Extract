<abstract>
<p>The disease severity of <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> infection ranges from asymptomatic to life-threatening. Recent human and animal data implicate the gut microbiome as a modifier of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> virulence. Here we have explored the association of the microbiome with susceptibility to amebiasis in infants and in the mouse model of amebic colitis. Dysbiosis occurred symptomatic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> infection in children, as evidenced by a lower Shannon diversity index of the gut microbiota. To test if dysbiosis was a cause of susceptibility, wild type C57BL/6 mice (which are innately resistant to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histiolytica</italic> infection) were treated with antibiotics prior to cecal challenge with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>. Compared with untreated mice, antibiotic pre-treated mice had more severe colitis and delayed clearance of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>. Gut IL-25 and mucus protein Muc2, both shown to provide innate immunity in the mouse model of amebic colitis, were lower in antibiotic pre-treated mice. Moreover, dysbiotic mice had fewer cecal neutrophils and myeloperoxidase activity. Paradoxically, the neutrophil chemoattractant chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2, as well as IL-1β, were higher in the colon of mice with antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. Neutrophils from antibiotic pre-treated mice had diminished surface expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR2, potentially explaining their inability to migrate to the site of infection. Blockade of CXCR2 increased susceptibility of control non-antibiotic treated mice to amebiasis. In conclusion, dysbiosis increased the severity of amebic colitis due to decreased neutrophil recruitment to the gut, which was due in part to decreased surface expression on neutrophils of CXCR2.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Amebiasis, caused by intestinal infection of <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic>, is one of the leading causes of parasite infection-related mortality and morbidity around the world. However, pathogenesis, such as determinant factors of infection outcome, is still unclear although recent data indicate that the gut microbiome plays an important role. In the present study, we firstly found that dysbiosis, which was represented by a lower Shannon diversity index of the gut microbiota, occurred symptomatic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> infection in children living in endemic area. In mouse model, we demonstrated that dysbiosis induced by antibiotic pre-treatment increased the severity of amebic colitis due to decreased neutrophil activity as well as decreased IL-25 associated mucosal defense in the gut. Moreover, we demonstrated surface expression on neutrophils of CXCR2 was diminished in mice with dysbiosis, which resulted in decreased neutrophil recruitment to the gut. This study is of fundamental importance in amebiasis research for the discovery of a mechanism of microbiome-mediated resistance to amebiasis via neutrophil trafficking to the gut. The work is importantly of broad interest in infectious diseases and immunology for the discovery that neutrophil mediated protection can be disturbed by dysbiosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Amebiasis, caused by intestinal infection of <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic>, is one of the leading causes of parasite infection-related mortality and morbidity around the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref001">1</xref>]. Although disease severity ranges from self-limited mild abdominal symptoms to life-threatening systemic disease, determinant factors of infection outcome are still undefined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref002">2</xref>]. Even in the same patient, invasive symptomatic disease can develop after long-term asymptomatic colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref005">5</xref>], and conversely patients with amebic liver abscess after medical treatment can be asymptomatic cyst passers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref006">6</xref>]. These results suggest that not only the genetics of host and pathogen are important for determining clinical symptoms of infected individuals, but also the gut environment surrounding <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>. In fact, recent human and animal data indicate that the gut microbiome plays an important role in the pathogenesis of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> infection. Our group reported that the presence of <italic>Prevotella copri</italic> in gut flora is associated with susceptibility of children to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> induced diarrheal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref007">7</xref>]. Also, in an animal model, we demonstrated gut colonization with segmented filamentous bacterium exerts a protective effect via enhancing the induction of IL-23 in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref009">9</xref>]. It is of interest to us to better understand the impact of the gut microbiome on the severity of amebic colitis, potentially by its modulation of intestinal mucosal immunity.</p>
<p>Neutrophils are important in protecting the host from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> tissue invasion into intestine and liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref016">16</xref>]. Neutrophils kill <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> in vitro in the presence of TNF-α and IFN-γ mainly via oxygen free radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref017">17</xref>]. Antibody-depletion of neutrophils in vivo promoted tissue invasion by <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref016">16</xref>], and neutrophil chemotaxis toward leptin plays an important role in protecting host from intestinal tissue invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Dysbiosis is known to affect neutrophil function. For example, in an animal model it has been shown that the severity of sickle cell disease is relieved under antibiotic induced dysbiosis, due to a decrease in the number of activated aged neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref018">18</xref>].

<p>Here we demonstrate the impact of dysbiosis on disease severity of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> infection in humans and in a mouse model of amebic colitis. We go on to demonstrate that one mechanism by which dysbiosis increases susceptibility is by blockading neutrophil recruitment to the gut via down-regulation of CXCR2.</p>

<title>Decreased gut microbiota diversity in children who developed amebic colitis</title>
<p>In order to assess the impact of dysbiosis on outcome of intestinal infection of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>, we collected stool samples from children cohorts followed from birth in an urban slum, Mirpur in Dhaka Bangladesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref020">20</xref>].

<title>Severity of amebic colitis in antibiotic pre-treated mice</title>
<p>We used the murine model of amebic colitis to assess whether prior dysbiosis with decreased microbiome diversity has an impact on disease severity of amebic colitis. Wild type C57BL/6 mice were treated with an antibiotic cocktail consisting of ampicillin, neomycin, metronidazole and vancomycin for 2 weeks prior to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> challenge (antibiotic pre-treated mice). We confirmed the microbiome diversity was decreased by antibiotic pre-treatment before <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006513.g002">Fig 2a</xref>).

<p>Next, we checked the mucosal barrier upon <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> challenge. The gut mucosal barrier is the first host defense against intestinal infection by <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>, as previously shown in MUC-2-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref023">23</xref>].

<p>Next, we measured IL-1β level by ELISA, in order to assess the recognition of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> by the intestinal epithelial cells and innate immune system.

<title>Neutrophil number in the gut and expression of CXCR2 were lower upon <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> infection in antibiotic pretreated mice</title>
<p>As presented above, neutrophil activation was suppressed despite tissue invasion by <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> in antibiotic treated mice. These mice also paradoxically expressed higher neutrophil chemoattractant chemokines. We hypothesized that inhibition of CXCR2 expression on neutrophils, which is the main receptor for the chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2, could explain the relative lack of gut neutrophil abundance. In order to assess this hypothesis, we checked the number and expression of surface markers of the Ly6G high neutrophil population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006513.g003">Fig 3j</xref>) in the blood and cecal lamina propria of mice at 24 hours after <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> challenge by flow cytometry. As expected, gut but not systemic neutrophil numbers were depressed in antibiotic treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006513.g004">Fig 4e &amp; 4f</xref>). In addition, CXCR2 expression on neutrophils was lower both in blood and cecum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006513.g004">Fig 4g</xref>), whereas expression of the other surface molecules were either not different or higher in antibiotic pre-treated mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006513.s005">S5c &amp; S5d Fig</xref>).

We confirmed mucosal thickness was not different between 2 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006513.g004">Fig 4i</xref>), then compared the frequency of Ly6G positive neutrophils in the mucosa (cells per 10 crypts) and submucosal tissue (cells per unit area). Neutrophils in the mucosa were lower in antibiotic pre-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006513.g004">Fig 4j</xref>) whereas neutrophil number in submucosal tissue was not different between the 2 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006513.g004">Fig 4k</xref>), suggesting that efficient neutrophil migration from submucosal tissue to the site of infection, which plays an important role in protection from tissue invasion of microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref031">31</xref>], was disturbed in antibiotic pre-treated mice.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The most important finding of this study is that gut microbiome dysbiosis increases susceptibility to amebic colitis in humans and in the mouse model, and that one mechanism of this increased susceptibility is downregulated neutrophil recruitment to the gut. In children who developed symptomatic colitis by <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic>, the gut microbiota had lower diversity than those in children who showed colonization. Moreover, we found that children developing amebic colitis had lower microbiome diversity in the month preceding amebic colitis than those without <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> infection, although these data came from 2 different cohort studies at the same location. We extended these studies in the mouse model of amebic colitis, demonstrating that mechanisms of dysbiosis-mediated increased susceptibility were downregulation of neutrophil CXCR2 and attendant failure of neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection. Although changes in gut microbiota can induce or conversely reduce gut inflammation, dysbiosis (represented by lower microbiota diversity) in this case reduced the neutrophil activation in the gut, allowing more severe intestinal damage by <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006513.g006">Fig 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Antibiotic use is pervasive in children in low and middle income countries and a likely cause of dysbiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref033">33</xref>]. In fact, we found that antibiotics were frequently used in participants of PROVIDE study in Bangladesh with an average of 25.5 new prescriptions over first 2 years of life, although such data was not available in NIH birth cohort. It is also known in mouse studies that the gut microbiome is essential not only for the development of the immune system but also for maintenance of homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref035">35</xref>]. In the present study, we sought to mimic our cohort observation in mice by administration of an antibiotic cocktail (ampicillin, neomycin, vancomycin and metronidazole) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref040">40</xref>]. Strikingly, C57BL/6 mice, which are naturally resistant to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref041">41</xref>], had increased susceptibility after antibiotic induced dysbiosis. We confirmed that mucus secretion was disturbed with decreased IL-25 level at the site of infection in antibiotic pre-treated mice, which might allow more severe tissue invasion of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref042">42</xref>]. Interestingly, neutrophil number and activation at the site of infection were suppressed as assessed by fecal lipocalin-2, myeloperoxidase activity and neutrophil number despite more tissue damage by <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> in antibiotic pre-treated mice. We concluded that insufficient neutrophil recruitment as well as suppressed mucus secretion at the site of infection allowed <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> tissue invasion at 24 hours after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006513.g003">Fig 3</xref>), which were followed by more aggressive colitis with more severe weight loss and delayed clearance of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> from stool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006513.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Upon intestinal damage by infection, DAMPs and PAMPs from damaged tissue and pathogen respectively are recognized by intestinal epithelial cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs). This is followed by the production of neutrophil chemoattractant chemokines including CXCL1 and CXCL2 mainly produced by activated tissue residential macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref043">43</xref>], which in turn induce neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref044">44</xref>]. However, CXCL1 and CXCL2 as well as IL-1β upon <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> infection were significantly higher in antibiotic pre-treated mice compared to untreated control mice, indicating that increased susceptibility to infection was not due to poor recognition of PAMPs nor DAMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref029">29</xref>] but instead due to failure of neutrophil response to chemokines.</p>
<p>We checked the expression of CXCR2, which is the main chemokine receptor on neutrophils for CXCL1 and CXCL2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref045">45</xref>], because expression of CXCR2 is critically important for neutrophil associated protection against various infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref046">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref048">48</xref>]. We found that CXCR2 expression on neutrophils both in blood and cecum after <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> challenge was lower in antibiotic pre-treated mice than that in untreated control mice. Finally, we confirmed that anti-CXCR2 pre-treated mice showed significantly higher <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> burden than untreated control mice at 24 hours after <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> challenge. From these results, we concluded that down-regulation of CXCR2 is an important but not sole mechanism by which dysbiosis diminished neutrophil mediated protection. Furthermore, our results indicate that dysbiosis might affect the susceptibility to infection by other organisms or inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref046">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref048">48</xref>] by altering neutrophil recruitment or function, by suppressing CXCR2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref049">49</xref>]. On the other hand, our results was contradict with the previous paper reported by Houpt et al. which demonstrated that C57BL/6 mice remained resistant to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> infection after depletion of neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref014">14</xref>]. Although this might be explained by the fact that Houpt et al. did not disrupt the microbiome with antibiotics prior to infection of C57BL/6 mice with antibiotics, further investigations for elucidating the impact of microbiota on neutrophil function, including not only recruitment of neutrophils but also amebicidal activity, will be needed in future study.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to be considered. First, our results in Bangladeshi children have not been generalized to children in other countries, although they do represent two different cohorts (PROVIDE study and NIH birth cohort) performed at the same district (Mirpur, Dhaka, Bangladesh). Second, we created dysbiosis in the murine model by administering a broad spectrum antibiotic cocktail. However, the composition of the gut microbiome is different between human and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref050">50</xref>]. The bacterial species which influence disease severity of amebiasis are therefore yet to be fully identified although one paper has shown the relationship between the presence of <italic>Prevotella copri</italic> and disease severity of amebic colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref007">7</xref>]. A third limitation is that we do not understand the mechanism of microbiota-mediated changes in CXCR2 expression on neutrophils upon <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> infection. Fourth we have not assessed amebicidal activities of neutrophils although our results suggested that they are suppressed during antibiotic induced dysbiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006513.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In the future the colonization of mice by specific bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref051">51</xref>] and assessing amebicidal activity of their neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref017">17</xref>] may be used to identify the bacteria responsible for resistance and to elucidate mechanisms of protection. Finally, we could not assess neutrophil CXCR2 in the bloodstream of the children with <italic>E</italic>. <italic>histolytica</italic> infection to test the extent that it was downregulated as in the mouse model. Future work should assess dynamically the impact of antibiotic use on neutrophil function during amebic infection in a human cohort.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that antibiotic-induced dysbiosis mediated susceptibility to amebic colitis through decreased neutrophil recruitment to the gut, at least partially due to decreased surface expression of neutrophil CXCR2. Demonstration that antibiotics can impair neutrophil chemotaxis to a site of infection may be of broader importance than just amebiasis for the insight that it provides into gut microbiome regulation of the immune system.</p>

In brief, the PROVIDE study was performed at a peri-urban slum of Mirpur in Dhaka and included 700 infants enrolled at the first week of their age, and followed up at least until 53 weeks (2 year) of age. NIH birth cohort is also prospective cohort study of enteric infections in infants from the same study site as PROVIDE. In both studies, written informed consents were provided by parents or guardian on behalf of all infant participants at enrollment. Field workers visited the child’s household twice weekly to capture any diarrhea event and collected stool samples from these as well as a monthly surveillance stool sample. The diagnosis of amebic colitis was confirmed by qPCR assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006513.ref007">7</xref>].
