<abstract>
<p>The establishment of polarity is a critical process in pathogenic fungi, mediating infection-related morphogenesis and host tissue invasion. Here, we report the identification of <italic>TPC1</italic> (Transcription factor for Polarity Control 1), which regulates invasive polarized growth in the rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>. <italic>TPC1</italic> encodes a putative transcription factor of the fungal Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> family, exclusive to filamentous fungi. Tpc1-deficient mutants show severe defects in conidiogenesis, infection-associated autophagy, glycogen and lipid metabolism, and plant tissue colonisation. By tracking actin-binding proteins, septin-5 and autophagosome components, we show that Tpc1 regulates cytoskeletal dynamics and infection-associated autophagy during appressorium-mediated plant penetration. We found that Tpc1 interacts with Mst12 and modulates its DNA-binding activity, while Tpc1 nuclear localisation also depends on the MAP kinase Pmk1, consistent with the involvement of Tpc1 in this signalling pathway, which is critical for appressorium development. Importantly, Tpc1 directly regulates <italic>NOXD</italic> expression, the p22<sup>phox</sup> subunit of the fungal NADPH oxidase complex via an interaction with Mst12. Tpc1 therefore controls spatial and temporal regulation of cortical F-actin through regulation of the NADPH oxidase complex during appressorium re-polarisation. Consequently, Tpc1 is a core developmental regulator in filamentous fungi, linking the regulated synthesis of reactive oxygen species and the Pmk1 pathway, with polarity control during host invasion.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Cellular polarity is an intrinsic feature of filamentous fungal growth and pathogenesis. In this study, we identified a gene required for fungal polar growth and virulence in the rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>. This gene has been named <italic>TPC1</italic> (<underline>T</underline>ranscription factor for <underline>P</underline>olarity <underline>C</underline>ontrol <underline>1</underline>). The Tpc1 protein belongs to the fungal Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> binuclear cluster family. This DNA-binding motif is present exclusively in the fungal kingdom. We have characterised defects associated with lack of Tpc1 in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>. We show that Tpc1 is involved in polarised growth and virulence. The <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> Δ<italic>tpc1</italic> mutant shows a delay in glycogen and lipid metabolism, and infection-associated autophagy–processes that regulate appressorium-mediated <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> plant infection. The saprophytic fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> contains a Tpc1 homolog (NcTpc1) involved in vegetative growth and sustained tip elongation, suggesting that Tpc1-like proteins act as core regulators of polarised growth and development in filamentous fungi. A comparative transcriptome analysis has allowed us to identify genes regulated by Tpc1 in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> including NoxD, an important component of the fungal NADPH complex. Significantly, Tpc1 interacts with Mst12, a component of the Pmk1 signalling pathway essential for appressorium development, and modulates Mst12 binding affinity to <italic>NOXD</italic> promoter region. We conclude that Tpc1 is a key regulator of polarity in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> that regulates growth, autophagy and septin-mediated reorientation of the F-actin cytoskeleton to facilitate plant cell invasion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Rice blast disease is one of the most serious diseases of cultivated rice worldwide and is caused by the filamentous, ascomycete fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref002">2</xref>]. The disease is initiated when a conidium lands on the rice leaf surface. Here it germinates to produce a single germ tube that differentiates at its tip to develop a specialised infection structure called an appressorium[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref003">3</xref>]. During the initial stages of appressorium formation, a septum defines the developing appressorium from the rest of the germ tube following a single mitotic division in the germ tube[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref004">4</xref>]. When the appressorium matures, the three conidial cells and germ tube collapse due to infection-associated autophagy and are no longer viable after 24h[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref004">4</xref>]. Subsequently, a penetration peg emerges from the base of the appressorium and ruptures the leaf cuticle. A toroidal filamentous actin network forms at the base of the appressorium pore, scaffolded by septin GTPases[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref005">5</xref>]. Assembly of the four core septin GTPases is regulated by the Nox2 NADPH oxidase complex, which is required for re-modelling of the F-actin cytoskeleton and assembling the exocyst at the appressorium pore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref008">8</xref>]. F-actin ring formation is necessary for penetration peg emergence and re-establishment of polarized growth at the point of plant penetration. After penetration, the fungal peg grows as a narrow, short primary invasive hypha[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref009">9</xref>], before differentiating into bulbous invasive hyphae during colonisation of the first invaded host cell[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref010">10</xref>].

<p>In this study, we report the identification of a novel Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> transcriptional regulator involved in the early stages of plant infection by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>. The Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> binuclear cluster domain (IPR001138, PF00172) is exclusively found in the fungal kingdom[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref014">14</xref>]. The six cysteine residues bind two zinc atoms, which coordinate folding of the domain involved in DNA-binding. Most Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> proteins have been studied in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus</italic> species[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref016">16</xref>]. Typically, the Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> proteins are pathway-specific activators under the control of major regulators[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref018">18</xref>]. The regulator of galactose catabolism in yeast, Gal4p[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref019">19</xref>], and the regulators of acetate assimilation FacB[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref020">20</xref>] and the aflatoxin cluster AflR[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref021">21</xref>] in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic>, are among the best studied examples. Several Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> transcriptional regulators have been studied in the rice blast fungus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006516.s009">S1 Table</xref>). Of the 175 members of the Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> binuclear cluster family present in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006516.s010">S2 Table</xref>), only nine of them (MoCod1, MoCod2, Pig1, Tra1, Tdg3, Xlr1, Ara1, Far1 and Far2) have been examined in any detail[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref027">27</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006516.s009">S1 Table</xref>). A high-throughput gene knockout approach of 104 Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> proteins in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> revealed large variation in their biological functions, and reported seven additional Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> proteins to be required for plant infection, including Gpf1 and Cln2[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref028">28</xref>]. However, despite this information, the mechanistic insights into how the Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> proteins govern <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> cellular processes are largely unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, we characterize a novel mutant of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> that shows defects in pathogenicity and vegetative growth following its selection from a <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> T-DNA insertional library. The T-DNA insertion is located within a gene (MGG_01285) encoding a Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> binuclear cluster protein, which we name <italic>TPC1</italic>. This gene was not included in the large-scale gene knockout analysis of 104 Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref028">28</xref>], although a global gene expression analysis of transcription factors revealed that <italic>TPC1</italic> is overexpressed during development (conidiation, germination and appressorium formation), oxidative stress (methyl viologen treatment) and carbon starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref029">29</xref>]. Here, we reveal the involvement of this transcriptional regulator in polarized growth, cell patterning and virulence in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>. Among the genes regulated by Tpc1 we found <italic>NOXD</italic>, an important component of the fungal NADPH complex. Significantly, Tpc1 interacts with Mst12 and mis-localises in the Δ<italic>pmk1</italic> background, linking Tpc1 to this pathogenicity-associated MAPK signalling pathway. We provide mechanistic insight into the role of Tpc1, a key regulator of polarity in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> that controls growth, autophagy and septin-mediated reorientation of the F-actin cytoskeleton to facilitate plant colonisation.</p>

<p>The insertion site of the T-DNA within M1422 was located 0.9 kb downstream of the start codon of locus MGG_01285 in the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006516.s001">S1B Fig</xref>).

<p>A single T-DNA insertion in M1422 genome was detected by Southern blot hybridisation using the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene as a probe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006516.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). We also generated a second mutant in <italic>TPC1</italic> by targeted gene replacement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006516.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). We complemented both M1422 and Δ<italic>tpc1</italic> with a C-terminal <italic>TPC1</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic> gene fusion under control of its native promoter. The complemented mutants recovered normal mycelial growth, colonial morphology and full virulence on rice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006516.s001">S1D, S1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006516.s002">S2C</xref> Figs). We conclude that mutants M1422 and Δ<italic>tpc1</italic> are impaired in <italic>TPC1</italic> function.</p>
<p>Two striking characteristics of M1422 and Δ<italic>tpc1</italic> were their impaired hyphal growth and colony morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006516.s001">S1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006516.s002">S2C</xref> Figs). Vegetative growth of Tpc1-lacking strains was severely compromised in both complete (CM) and minimal (MM) medium (p &lt; 0.01), and showed compact colonies and non-invasive colony morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006516.s001">S1E, S1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006516.s002">S2D</xref> Figs). In <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, a class of mutants with polarity defects also exhibited this type of colony morphology[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>To analyse integrity of the cell wall, development of M1422 was evaluated in the presence of the anionic dyes, Congo Red (CR) and Calcofluor White (CFW), which interfere with fungal cell wall assembly by binding to β-1,4-glucan and chitin, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref032">32</xref>]. Additive growth defects were observed on M1422 development in the presence of CR but not in CFW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). In addition, mycelial growth was affected by NaCl-induced hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). High concentrations of NaCl (0.6M - 1.0M) changed the growth ratio in colonial size between wild-type and M1422, leading to an increase in the relative growth rate of M1422 compared to wild-type. Therefore, the lack of Tpc1 affected plant virulence, vegetative growth, colony morphology and hyperosmotic stress adaptation.</p>

Wild-type conidia were uniformly pyriform, three-celled spores. By contrast, in M1422, although the majority of conidia were three-celled (80%), a significant percentage of two-celled conidia (17%), single-celled (2%) and four-celled conidia (1%) were observed. Up to 26% of spores showed abnormal morphology in contrast to wild-type where less than 4% were misshapen (n&gt; 300). We also found that appressorium development was affected in M1422 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). On hydrophobic coverslips, wild-type conidia germinated to form one germ tube that emerged from the apical cell and formed an appressorium within 4h-8h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). In M1422, 40% of conidia germinated from two cells. This percentage increased to 50%-60% with extended incubation time (4h-8h). Formation of two appressoria was rarely observed in wild-type conidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).

<title>Polarity is coupled to autophagy and glycogen/lipid degradation in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic></title>
<p>The impairment of appressorium-mediated plant infection by <italic>TPC1</italic> mutants suggested that it might play a critical role in penetration peg development[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref033">33</xref>]. Appressorium function is known to depend on autophagic cell death of conidia, prior to appressorium maturation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref034">34</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated whether infection-associated autophagy proceeded normally and if conidia underwent autophagic cell death. A <italic>GFP</italic>:<italic>MoATG8</italic> construct was introduced into M1422 to determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). <italic>MoATG8</italic> encodes an autophagic, ubiquitin-like protein involved in autophagosome function and has been shown to be a reliable marker for autophagy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref034">34</xref>].

In both strains, the number of conidial autophagosomes decreased during germination, appressorium maturation and at the onset of spore cell death and was significantly lower in M1422 conidia and germ tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). However, autophagosome numbers increased significantly during appressorium maturation (8h; 16.1±4.9) and dropped considerably after conidial death (24h; 5.0±1.8) in wild-type, whereas autophagosome number remained relatively constant in M1422 during appressorium maturation (8.4±4.1) and even after conidial cell death (7.5±3.3).</p>

<p>Appressorium development is accompanied by rapid degradation of glycogen from conidia during germination and from appressoria during turgor generation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref036">36</xref>]. We therefore determined glycogen levels during appressorium development using potassium iodide (KI). Comparative analysis of KI staining between wild-type Guy11 and M1422 showed differences during the onset and later stages of conidial cell death (8h and 24h; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In Guy11 glycogen depletion was observed (no staining) within both conidial cells and appressoria during development. In the M1422 mutant, conidial cells were also depleted of glycogen although the appressorium still contained high levels of glycogen (95%) during maturation. We also looked at lipid metabolism, which is an additional driver of turgor generation in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>. The triacylglycerol lipase degrades lipid bodies that move to the appressorium during development[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref037">37</xref>]. Accordingly, we followed lipid body distribution during appressorium maturation in Δ<italic>tpc1</italic> using Nile red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). We consistently visualised delayed degradation of lipid bodies in conidia and germ tubes in Δ<italic>tpc1</italic>, which were evident at 9h and 12h after germination on coverslips. Using a cytorrhysis assay, in which hyperosmotic concentrations of a solute are applied to collapse appressoria, we estimated the internal solute concentration and turgor of appressoria of the two strains. We observed that Δ<italic>tpc1</italic> appressoria clearly collapsed at higher rates than the WT at 1M concentration of glycerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). This suggests decreased in turgor within Δ<italic>tpc1</italic> appressoria, consistent with the observed delayed degradation of glycogen and lipid bodies. When considered together, these observations point that autophagy, and glycogen/lipid metabolisms are delayed during appressorium development in Tpc1-lacking strains.</p>

<title>Tpc1 is required for re-establishment of polarity during appressorium-mediated plant infection</title>
<p>Following maturation of the appressorium, a penetration peg emerges from the appressorial pore to penetrate the plant cuticle and successfully colonise the plant host. To assess whether repolarization was impaired in the M1422 mutant, a penetration assay was performed on onion epidermis and rice leaf sheath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). After 24h, 91% of wild-type conidia formed an appressorium effectively, penetrated and invaded onion epidermal cells. The majority of M1422 conidia (60%) germinated and produced an appressorium, but failed to penetrate and invade onion cells. Only 40% of M1422 appressoria formed a penetration peg, but were not able to invade the onion epidermal cells and spread away from the point of penetration. Similarly, on rice leaf sheath preparations 81% of wild-type conidia penetrated successfully compared to 21% of Δ<italic>tpc1</italic> mutant spores, which managed to develop a penetration peg but hardly ever spread to adjacent cells.</p>

<p>To examine how formation of the germ tube and penetration peg was compromised, we investigated cellular organization of the F-actin cytoskeleton[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref038">38</xref>], using the actin-binding protein fimbrin tagged with GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006516.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Once wild-type conidia attached to the surface, fimbrin:GFP spots were observed at the periphery of the germinating cells (0h). However, conidia harvested from M1422 instead localised F-actin randomly at the periphery of the three cells of conidia and not preferentially in the germinating cell (white arrowheads, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006516.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).

Fimbrin was localised in discrete puncta at the periphery of Guy11 appressoria, but in contrast was dispersed within appressoria of the mutant (6h). Furthermore, the F-actin network was more diffuse and several pores were observed in M1422 mature appressoria (white arrowheads, 24h). These results suggest that re-polarization of the appressorium is adversely affected in the M1422 mutant. To confirm this, we also tracked gelsolin:GFP and Sep5:GFP in Δ<italic>tpc1</italic> mutant. The use of gelsolin:GFP and Sep5:GFP to follow actin reorganization has helped to understand cytoskeleton dynamics during infection-related development[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref006">6</xref>]. The disorganisation of the appressorial cytoskeleton and actin ring was evident in Δ<italic>tpc1</italic>. Sep5 was mis-localised in all mutant appressoria and only 26% of mutant appressoria formed an intact actin ring with a central pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).

<p>To investigate whether <italic>TPC1</italic> is associated with specific or multiple regulatory networks, <italic>TPC1</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic> localisation was observed in conidia of different mutant backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). In the Δ<italic>pmk1</italic> MAPK mutant[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref039">39</xref>], Tpc1:GFP was observed within the cytoplasm but not in nuclei. By contrast, strong GFP fluorescence was visualised in conidial nuclei of the autophagy-defective Δ<italic>atg1</italic> and Δ<italic>atg8</italic> mutants, compared to the fluorescence observed in M1422 complemented with <italic>TPC1</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic> or Guy11 expressing <italic>TPC1</italic>:<italic>GFP</italic>. These results suggest that Tpc1 activity is associated with the Pmk1 MAP kinase signalling pathway, which regulates appressorium formation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref039">39</xref>], and the control of autophagy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>We further analysed the link with between Tpc1 and the Pmk1 pathway by looking at the ability of Tpc1 to interact with components of this pathway in a yeast two-hybrid system. Strikingly, we observed that Tpc1 interacted with Mst12, a transcription factor that functions downstream of Pmk1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref040">40</xref>], although Tpc1 did not interact with Pmk1 itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).

Based on this tree, Tpc1 is a single copy gene and has not been subject to paralogous duplications.

<title>Oxidation-reduction processes are significantly affected in the Δ<italic>tpc1</italic> mutant</title>
<p>Tpc1 contains a Zn(II)<sub>2</sub>Cys<sub>6</sub> binuclear cluster DNA binding domain, which is found only in fungal proteins considered bonafide transcription regulators[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref014">14</xref>]. We carried out a comparative transcriptome analysis using the wild-type strain and the <italic>TPC1</italic> deletion mutant to identify the biological processes and genes regulated by Tpc1. For this experiment, RNA was extracted from fungal material grown on cellophane on top of CM agar plates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006516.s002">S2D Fig</xref>). We considered it to be an optimal condition since fungal hypha is able to penetrate the cellophane, i.e. a change in polar growth occurs under these conditions, and allow us to obtain enough amount of RNA for subsequent microarray analysis. We identified 215 down-regulated genes and 185 genes to be up-regulated with at least a two-fold change in expression level in the Δ<italic>tpc1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006516.s011">S3 Table</xref>). We classified all the genes that were up- and down-regulated into four functional groups according to potential roles in signalling (13 genes), cell wall biosynthesis or modulation of plant response (secreted proteins; 140 genes), metabolism (127 genes) and other functions (54 genes). Sixty-six genes encoded proteins that lacked any known domain. Remarkably, two gene ontology (GO) terms were found significantly enriched among these differentially expressed genes, the oxidation-reduction process (GO:0055114; 57 genes; p&lt;0.001) and the oxidoreductase activity (GO:0016491; 58 genes; p&lt;0.001).</p>
<p>Within the signalling functional group, two down-regulated genes encoded <underline>p</underline>hosphatidyl <underline>e</underline>thanolamine-<underline>b</underline>inding proteins (PEBP) that have been shown to regulate protein kinase A (PKA) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref045">45</xref>]. Amongst the up-regulated genes, eight of them encoded transcriptional regulators, which suggests a link between the gene networks controlled by these transcriptional regulators and Tpc1.</p>
<p>The largest group of mis-regulated genes comprised 140 genes coding for secreted or cell wall-related proteins. Within this group, more than half of the members (74 genes) had no matches in databases. However, twenty-four genes were potentially involved in cell wall remodeling, and encompassed different types of glycosyl hydrolases (GH10, GH18, GH32, GH43, GH61 and GH81), seventeen proteases and two secreted phospholipases A2. Three Mas3/Gas1 paralogues and several effector proteins such as a Bas2-like, Bas113 and avrPi54 were also found[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref049">49</xref>]. The up-down regulation of two CFEM G-protein coupled receptors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref050">50</xref>], including <italic>PTH11</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref051">51</xref>], suggested an alteration in the ability of the Δ<italic>tpc1</italic> mutant to perceive external signals.</p>
<p>The second largest group of genes with altered expression levels encoded proteins related with primary and secondary metabolism (127 genes). We found a significant number of them participating in oxidation-reduction processes (46%) and transport (9%). Alteration in nitrogen and glycerol metabolism was evidenced by the expression changes of four NmrA-like regulatory proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref052">52</xref>], enzymes involved in amino acid biosynthesis, a glycerol kinase and the glycerol dehydrogenase Gcy1, an enzyme also associated with redox regulation in yeast[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref053">53</xref>]. Down-regulation of an α-glucosidase supported the glycogen degradation delay of Tpc1-lacking strains.</p>
<p>The last functional group included 54 genes encoding proteins that carry a wide range of biochemical roles. The reduced expression of the autophagy gene <italic>ATG22</italic> and the up-regulation of three small chaperones Hsp20-like suggested the unbalanced signals for survival and cell death existent in Δ<italic>tpc1</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref054">54</xref>]. Microtubule-dependent vesicle trafficking and cell cycle were also affected in the mutant as inferred from the misregulation of two dynamins, one kinesin light chain, one Marvel protein, two cyclins and the Cdc26 subunit. Genes involved in silencing pathways, spliceosomal snRNP assembly, tRNA processing, RNA-mediated heterochromatin silencing and translational arrest were also misregulated in Δ<italic>tpc1</italic>, highlighting alterations in other cellular processes that regulate gene expression.</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> Superoxide production is significantly affected in the mutants as shown by nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) staining and quantification of pixel intensities in hyphal tips (mean±SD; n = 10). Both Δ<italic>noxD</italic> and Δ<italic>nox1</italic>Δ<italic>nox2</italic> produced less ROS in appressoria but higher amounts of ROS in hyphal tips compared to WT; Δ<italic>tpc1</italic> generated higher amounts of ROS in hyphal tips and appressoria. Addition of diphenylene iodonium (DPI) before NBT treatment abolishes the formation of dark precipitates associated with sites of superoxide generation. Values to calculate mean pixel intensity were for white 0 and black for 100. <bold>(B)</bold> A yeast two-hybrid screen reveals that NoxD interacts with Nox1. A yeast colony co-transformed simultaneous with the pGBK-NOX1 (bait Nox1) and pGAD-NOXD (prey NoxD) vectors grows in high stringency media (-His/-Ade/-Leu/-Trp/+X-α-Gal).

<title>NoxD is required for septin ring assembly at the appressorial pore</title>
<p>The Nox2-NoxR complex is essential for septin-mediated cytoskeletal reorientation, whereas Nox1 is dispensable although may have important roles to play in maintenance and elongation of the penetration peg[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref006">6</xref>]. To test if NoxD was also involved in this process, we expressed the acting-binding protein gelsolin:GFP and Sep5:GFP in Δ<italic>noxD</italic>. In the wild-type, both a septin and gelsolin ring was present at the appressorium pore[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref006">6</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g007">Fig 7D</xref>).

Gelsolin:GFP rings in Δ<italic>noxD</italic> also possessed distorted pores. Considering that gelsolin colocalizes with F-actin at the appressorial pore[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref006">6</xref>], the altered fluorescence pattern of gelsolin:GFP revealed that the toroidal F-actin ring was disorganized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g007">Fig 7D</xref>).

<title>NOXD expression is regulated by Tpc1 and the Pmk1 pathway</title>
<p>The down-regulation of <italic>NOXD</italic> in Δ<italic>tpc1</italic> suggested that this gene may be directly regulated by Tpc1. To investigate this idea, we carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>). We observed that the promoter region of <italic>NOXD</italic> comprising the NOXD1, NOXD2 and NOXD3 fragments immunoprecipitated with Tpc1:GFP, which indicated that <italic>NOXD</italic> expression is regulated <italic>in vivo</italic> by this transcription factor. In addition, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> Tpc1 and Mst12 since both proteins can interact in yeast two-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). We found that Mst12 strongly recognised the probe 1 located between -1120 and -643 upstream of the start codon of the <italic>NOXD</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Mst12 also recognized probes 2 and 3, but less strongly. Mst12 bound to the probes produced multiple bands, possibly due to the presence of several protein molecules on the biotinylated DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Intriguingly, Tpc1 itself was not capable of recognizing any of the three probes under the conditions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). However, the addition of Tpc1 to Mst12 increased its DNA-binding capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g008">Fig 8E</xref>), which is consistent with both, the ability of these proteins to interact, and with Tpc1 as modulator of Mst12 DNA-binding affinity. Increasing amounts of Tpc1 did not alter significantly Mst12affinity. Importantly, the promoter regions tested using these <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA-binding assays correlated perfectly with the enriched fragments obtained in the ChIP analysis, which supports that Mst12 and Tpc1 are part of a complex that coordinately regulate NoxD expression. To further confirm these results, we checked <italic>NOXD</italic> expression levels in the Δ<italic>mst12</italic> mutant and corroborated that they were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g008">Fig 8F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To cause disease in rice, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> forms a specialised cell called an appressorium, the development of which involves transitions from polarised to isotropic cellular growth, followed by rapid turgor-driven polarisation to penetrate the leaf surface. Understanding how these cellular transitions occur is critical to controlling the disease at an early stage, prior to entering the plant. In this study, we have identified a transcription factor, Tpc1 that plays a key role in regulating plant infection, due to its role in polarity control. We have also identified one putative mechanism by which it acts, via the regulated synthesis of reactive oxygen species and control of the NADPH oxidase complex, which regulates septin assembly and F-actin re-modelling at the base of the appressorium. Furthermore, we have found that Tpc1 directly participates in the Pmk1 pathway and is required for infection-associated autophagy, which are both essential pre-requisites for appressorium formation and function.</p>
<p>We observed that the <italic>TPC1</italic> mutants formed compact colonies, which resembled the colony morphology shared by a class of mutants with polarity defects in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>crassa</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref031">31</xref>]. Conidial germination, and growth of vegetative hyphae were severely impaired in the two mutants lacking functional Tpc1, supporting defects in sustained tip elongation and establishment of polarity in apically-growing hyphae. Autophagy plays a major role in supplying amino acids, fatty acids, and glucose to maintain cellular functions during stress and starvation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref067">67</xref>]. The absence of Tpc1 function altered the onset of infection-associated autophagy which occurs during appressorium development[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref068">68</xref>]. Conidial cell death is necessary to initiate appressorium penetration and it is regulated by the Pmk1 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref033">33</xref>]. Although M1422 conidia appeared able to undergo conidial cell death, the cellular localization of autophagosomes and glycogen/lipid deposits suggested that the process was delayed. Consistent with this observation, Tpc1:GFP was also highly expressed in <italic>Δatg1</italic> and <italic>Δatg8</italic> mutants impaired in autophagy, suggesting that the expression of <italic>TPC1</italic> is de-repressed as a consequence of the inability to carry out autophagy and may therefore be an upstream positive regulator of infection-associated autophagy during appressorium maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g009">Fig 9</xref>).</p>

<title>Polar growth and associated processes that take place during appressorium maturation in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and model of Tpc1-mediated plant penetration.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> Polarity factors regulate the emergence and elongation of the germ tube and the penetration peg required for appressorium development and function. Polarity is concomitant with autophagic cell death and glycogen/lipid degradation–cellular processes that also control appressorium function. <bold>(B)</bold> During germination, environmental signals trigger the Pmk1 kinase cascade and the control of autophagy to activate Tpc1 function. Nuclear-localised Tpc1 in turn activates transcription of genes required for polar growth, autophagy, and glycogen degradation. Tpc1 interacts with Mst12 and this complex is required for regulation of the expression of several genes, including NoxD. Polarity is associated with cytoskeletal dynamics that is controlled by Tpc1 through the Nox1 and Nox2 NADPH oxidase complexes. NoxD interacts with Nox1 and maybe with Nox2 indirectly. Interactions of NoxR and Pls1 with Nox1 and/or Nox2 need to be confirmed. To initiate plant infection Nox1/Nox2 NADPH oxidases regulate the formation of the F-actin network at the appressorium pore, which leads to penetration peg emergence and subsequent elongation. Mutant strains used in this study are highlighted in black.</p>

<p>Autophagic cell death is linked with appressorium function and penetration in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref004">4</xref>], and mutants lacking Tpc1 are also penetration defective. The formation of a penetration peg at the base of the appressorial pore is a cellular process intrinsically linked to polar growth[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref069">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref070">70</xref>]. The F-actin cytoskeleton plays a crucial role during germ tube re-polarisation and penetration peg emergence. We therefore investigated cytoskeletal dynamics during appressorium maturation in the mutant background. The network of F-actin observed with fimbrin:GFP in mature wild-type appressoria (8h-24h) delineated the appressorial pore, which was strikingly absent in M1422. This result together with the mis-localization of Sep5:GFP and gelsolin:GFP in Δ<italic>tpc1</italic> indicated that the F-actin network is disturbed in Tpc1-lacking strains.</p>
<p>The microarray analysis helped us to identify gene expression changes due to the lack of Tpc1, which correlated with the observed involvement of this protein in glycogen metabolism, autophagy and polar growth. Oxidation-reduction processes were also significantly affected in Δ<italic>tpc1</italic> including superoxide production pathways, likely due in part to the down-regulation of the fungal homologue of the p22<sup>phox</sup> NADPH subunit, the <italic>NOXD</italic> gene[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref064">64</xref>]. The <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> Δ<italic>noxD</italic> mutant was unable to infect rice leaves and roots. We established an interaction of NoxD with Nox1, but not with NoxR or Nox2, and confirmed the requirement of NoxD for superoxide generation and sexual reproduction in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>, consistent with NoxD functions in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cinerea</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>anserina</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref064">64</xref>]. We also identified Δ<italic>noxD</italic> defects in repolarization of the F-actin cytoskeleton during infection-related development, supporting the previous role described for the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> NADPH oxidase complex[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref006">6</xref>]. Remarkably, the disorganization pattern of gelsolin:GFP and Sep5:GFP in Δ<italic>noxD</italic> was similar to that observed in Δ<italic>nox2</italic> and Δ<italic>noxR</italic> mutants, whereas Δ<italic>nox1</italic> formed nearly intact ring shapes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref006">6</xref>]. This result suggests that Nox1 and NoxD participate differently in septin-mediated cytoskeleton organization despite their interaction, and strengthens the view of the fungal NADPH oxidase as a dynamic complex[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref071">71</xref>]. It seems likely that a Nox2-dependent process initiates septin ring formation, while Nox1 is necessary for maintenance of this conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g009">Fig 9</xref>). NoxD may therefore be associated at a relatively early stage in recruiting Nox1 to the appressorium pore, perhaps explaining why its absence results in a more severe phenotype with respect to actin and septin assembly at the pore. The role of NoxD, however, highlights that the Nox1 and Nox2 complexes are both necessary for penetration peg elaboration and extensive polar growth. It is worth noting that the tetraspanin <italic>PLS1</italic> deletion mutants exhibit the same phenotype as Δ<italic>nox2</italic> in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>anserina</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref072">72</xref>], suggesting that Pls1 may act as the missing link between Nox2 and NoxD subunits of the fungal NADPH oxidase complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006516.g009">Fig 9</xref>). The recent discovery in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cinerea</italic> of the RasGAP protein homologue IQGAP and its interaction with NoxD also points to IQGAP as a scaffold protein of the fungal NADPH complex[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref073">73</xref>]. In mammals, Nox complexes can act upstream[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref074">74</xref>] or downstream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref075">75</xref>] of MAPK signaling pathways. IQGAP also interacts with different modules of MAPK- and Ca-dependent signalling cascades[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref073">73</xref>], pointing the link between Nox complexes and signalling cascades. Interestingly, the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cinerea</italic> Δ<italic>noxD</italic> mutant showed growth defects in the presence of oxidative stressors in contrast to the wild-type growth exhibited by the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> Δ<italic>noxD</italic> mutant, which suggests a diversification of the cellular functions of NoxD in fungi. This result also hints differences in the regulation of ROS-mediated signalling pathways in the fungal kingdom.</p>
<p>Importantly, two lines of evidence support the direct involvement of Tpc1 in NoxD expression regulation. The ChIP analysis demonstrates that Tpc1:GFP immunoprecipitates <italic>in vivo</italic> with the <italic>NOXD</italic> promoter region. Tpc1 also regulates Mst12 DNA-binding activity <italic>in vitro</italic> using the corresponding <italic>NOXD</italic> promoter region, and indicates a direct participation of Tpc1 in the MAPK Pmk1 signalling pathway. Despite the ability of Tpc1 and Mst12 to regulate <italic>NOXD</italic> expression together, and their participation in common cellular processes such as penetration peg formation and plant invasion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref009">9</xref>], Δ<italic>mst12</italic> and Δ<italic>tpc1</italic> mutants have different colony morphology. In contrast to Tpc1, Mst12 is dispensable for growth and appressorial turgor generation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref009">9</xref>]. Consequently, Tpc1 has the ability to modulate expression of genes that participate in additional cellular processes, either by interacting with other transcription factors, or activating directly the expression of different genes.</p>
<p>Here, we identified one potential mechanism by which the transcription factor Tpc1 regulates appressorium maturation and plant infection. The loss of pathogenicity associated with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and <italic>F</italic>. <italic>graminearum TPC1</italic> mutants and similar growth defects associated with the <italic>N</italic>. <italic>crassa</italic> Δ<italic>nctpc1</italic> mutant, suggest that Tpc1 plays a key role as a transcriptional regulator in the re-establishment of polarity and the response to numerous signalling pathways, such as the Pmk1 MAP kinase and Atg1 kinase cascades. The role of Tpc1 in appressorium-mediated plant infection appears to be associated with the NADPH oxidase-dependent re-polarisation process of the appressorium, and the associated physiological changes such as autophagy, glycogen/lipid mobilisation and asymmetric reorganization of the F-actin cytoskeleton. Future studies will allow further dissection of this role and precise definition of the biological processes regulated by Tpc1 in filamentous fungi.</p>

A conidial suspension at a concentration of 1 x 10<sup>5</sup> conidia mL<sup>-1</sup> was prepared and dropped onto the adaxial surface of epidermal layers taken from onion. The strips were incubated in a moist chamber at 25°C and penetration events scored 24h to 48h later by recording images with an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope system. Leaf sheath assays were carried out as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref010">10</xref>]. Glycogen staining solution contained 60 mg of KI and 10 mg of I<sub>2</sub> per milliliter of distilled water. Glycogen deposits are visible immediately. For cytorrhysis assays, 10<sup>5</sup> spores were allowed to form appressoria for 18h on coverslips prior the addition of external glycerol (1M or 3M). After 10 minutes in glycerol ~500 appressoria were analyzed in each biological replica; experiment was carried out by triplicate. To visualize lipid droplets, conidia were allowed to germinate in water on coverslips. After 0h, 2h, 9h and 12h water was removed and conidia directly stained with Nile red (Nile Red Oxazone (9-diethylamino-5Hbenzo[alpha]phenoxazine-5-one; Sigma). Nile red was used to 2.5 mg/ml diluted in 50mM Tris/Maleate, pH 7.5 and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (2–3% w/v). Lipid droplets begin to fluoresce within seconds. Samples were visualized under a confocal laser scanning microscope using a 561 nm excitation wave length and a long pass emission filter (592–700 nm). All images were taken using the same parameters.</p>

Mycelia were grown in liquid CM at 25°C for 48 h in a shaker (120 rpm), and collected using two layers of Miracloth. Harvested mycelia were washed extensively with sterile water. To crosslink DNA and proteins, one gram of each washed mycelium was treated with 1% formaldehyde in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4 buffer for 20 min with continuous shaking at 100 rpm. Then, 0.125 M glycine was added and incubated at room temperature for an additional 10 min to stop crosslinking. Mycelia were harvested with Miracloth, rinsed with water removing excessive water by squeezing and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, grinded into a fine powder and stored at -80°C until used. ChIP was conducted according to published procedures with some modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006516.ref087">87</xref>]. 600 mg of each mycelium powder was used for chromatin extraction and sonication. The powder was added into 10 ml of Extraction buffer 1 (0.4 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol/β-ME and Protease Inhibitors Complete-PIC/Roche) and mixed by vortexing. The solution was filtered through a double layer of Miracloth and centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of Extraction buffer 2 (0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM β-ME and PIC) and centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min at 4°C.

Then, samples were centrifuged at 16000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The chromatin pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of Nuclei Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl ph 8, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS and PIC) and sonicated for 25 min at 4°C, operating a pattern of 30 sec ON and 30 sec OFF, at high power level in the Bioruptor Plus (Diagenode, Liege, Belgium) to obtain DNA fragments ranging from 500 to 1,000 bp. The chromatin solution was centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 min at 4°C to pellet cell debris. The supernatant was kept as chromatin solution and a small aliquot (10%) was stored as input DNA control. For each immunoprecipitation, 15 μl of Dynabeads Protein A magnetic beads (ref. 10001D, Life Technologies) was washed twice with 500 μl ChIP dilution buffer (1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA, 16.7 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 167 mM NaCl and PIC). Then, anti-GFP antibody (ref. A6455, Life Technologies) was added and incubated with gentle rotation for 1h at 4°C in 50 μl ChIP dilution buffer. Prepared anti-GFP coated beads were washed twice with 500 μl ChIP dilution buffer and resuspended in 100 μl of ChIP dilution buffer. For each immunoprecipitation, the latter and 100 μl of chromatin solution were gathered together and diluted up to 1 ml of ChIP dilution buffer. All immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4°C with gentle rotation, then washed with a serie of wash buffers (2 washes with Low Salt Wash Buffer: 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8; one wash with High Salt Wash Buffer: 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8; one wash with LiCl Wash Buffer: 0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 2 washes with TE Buffer: 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 mM EDTA). Immunoprecipitated DNAs and Input DNA control were reverse-crosslinked at 95°C for 10 min with 200 μl of 10% chelex 100 resin to remove any trace of metals. DNA samples were treated with proteinase K that was inactivated afterwards. After centrifugation, supernatants of DNA samples were stored at -20°C until used. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was diluted 10 times for qPCR analysis (primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006516.s012">S4 Table</xref>). This was performed using a Roche LightCycler 480 machine. qPCR reactions were carried out using either 2 μl of input DNA or 2 μl of immunoprecipitated chromatin in a final reaction of 12 μl with the following program: one cycle of 95°C for 5 min and 58 cycles of 94°C for 10 s, 60°C for 10 s and 72°C for 10 s. The Ct (threshold cycle) provided a measure for the starting copy numbers of DNA. Three technical repetitions from 4 independent biological experiments were used. Ct values were used to calculate ratios evaluating the fold difference between experimental samples (GFP-tagged or untagged wild-type strains) and normalized the input. We normalized with “Fold Enrichment Method” using the untagged strain. The Wilcoxon Mann Whitney test was applied to analyze the difference between two independent groups. Statgraphics software was used to make pairwise comparisons between GFP-tagged strain and untagged wild-type strain.</p>
