<abstract>
<p>The chemical probe C60 efficiently triggers Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reactivation from latency through an unknown mechanism. Here, we identify the Cullin exchange factor CAND1 as a biochemical target of C60. We also identified CAND1 in an shRNA library screen for EBV lytic reactivation. Gene expression profiling revealed that C60 activates the p53 pathway and protein analysis revealed a strong stabilization and S15 phosphorylation of p53. C60 reduced Cullin1 association with CAND1 and led to a global accumulation of ubiquitylated substrates. C60 also stabilized the EBV immediate early protein ZTA through a Cullin-CAND1-interaction motif in the ZTA transcription activation domain. We propose that C60 perturbs the normal interaction and function of CAND1 with Cullins to promote the stabilization of substrates like ZTA and p53, leading to EBV reactivation from latency. Understanding the mechanism of action of C60 may provide new approaches for treatment of EBV associated tumors, as well as new tools to stabilize p53.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a human gammaherpesvirus that establishes latent infection in B-lymphocytes in over 90% of adults worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref001">1</xref>]. EBV latent infection is also associated with ~1% of all human cancers, including various forms of Burkitt lymphoma (BL), nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, NK/T cell lymphoma and gastric carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref004">4</xref>]. Antiviral agents targeting DNA replication enzymes of human herpesviruses are effective at inhibiting productive infection, but to date there are no approved therapeutics for treatment of latent infection and its associated malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref003">3</xref>]. An alternative strategy has been to induce lytic cycle gene expression and replication, to be followed by treatment with antivirals, such as ganciclovir, that kill lytic infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref008">8</xref>]. Lytic inducers have also been used to enhance the efficacy of immune therapies, such as therapeutic vaccines and adoptive T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>EBV can be reactivated through multiple pathways and cellular stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref012">12</xref>]. In lymphocytes, transcription activation of the immediate early gene BZLF1, encoding the bZIP transcriptional activator ZTA (also referred to as ZEBRA and Z), is sufficient to trigger the viral lytic cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref013">13</xref>]. BZLF1 transcription can be activated partially by phorbol esters through PKC, ERK and MAP kinase pathways, calcium ionophores through calcineurin and NFAT pathways, and HDAC inhibitors through reversal of epigenetic silencing at the BZLF1 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref014">14</xref>]. The DNA-damage response pathway involving ATM and p53 activation has also been implicated in the reactivation of EBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref016">16</xref>]. While the pathways that activate the BZLF1 promoter have been investigated extensively, relatively less is known about the mechanisms that regulate ZTA protein function and stability, and whether this can also be modulated to control the reactivation process.</p>
<p>The ZTA transcriptional activation domain is subject to several modifications and interactions that may modulate its function and stability. ZTA can be SUMOylated on lysine 12 to down-regulate its transcription activation function, and potentiate its DNA replication function, through mechanisms not completely understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref019">19</xref>]. The ZTA activation domain mediates an interaction with Cullins through a paired Cullin 2 (Cul2) and Cullin 5 (Cul5) interaction motif that overlaps with amino acids critical for transcription activation function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref020">20</xref>]. ZTA can also interact with p53 through its b-ZIP domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref021">21</xref>] and can target p53 for degradation through a mechanism that is dependent on the Zta-Cullin interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref020">20</xref>]. In this context, ZTA has been shown to function as an adaptor in the Elongin B/C-Cul2/5-SOCS (ECS) ubiquitin ligase complex. EBV, like other herpesviruses, encodes several ubiquitin deconjugating enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref022">22</xref>], at least one of which, BPLF1, stabilizes ubiquitylated substrates necessary for EBV lytic cycle replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref023">23</xref>]. BPLF1 promotes viral DNA replication through inhibiting multiple Cullin-Ring-ubiquitin ligase (CRL), including those that ubiquitylate cellular S phase licensing factor CDT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref024">24</xref>]. BPLF1 was shown to block the interaction of Cullin with the Cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 (CAND1) protein. CAND1 is an F-box exchange factor required for loading substrates onto the CRL complex required for ubiquitylation and proteasome degradation of numerous protein substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref025">25</xref>]. CAND1 is thought to regulate the exchange of the Cullin-ROC1 module with different SKP1-F-box substrate complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref027">27</xref>]. CAND1 has been implicated as an inhibitor of viral replication since it competes with BPLF1 for interaction with Cullins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref023">23</xref>]. How the ECS, CRL, and CAND1 exchange systems regulate EBV reactivation from latency is not completely understood.</p>
<p>Recent work from our lab identified a new class of small molecular activators of EBV lytic reactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref028">28</xref>]. We identified several molecules with a common tetrahydrocarboline core that stimulated ZTA and EA-D expression in multiple different cell lines latently infected with EBV, including those derived from Burkitt lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and lymphoblastoid cell lines immortalized in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref028">28</xref>]. The most active molecule, C60, was found to have a mechanism of action distinct from HDAC inhibitors and phorbol esters. Here, we provide evidence that C60 works through a novel mechanism that stabilizes p53 and ZTA by altering CAND1-dependent Cullin-ubiquitin ligase substrate exchange and selection.</p>

<title>Identification of CAND1 as a C60-affinity purified protein</title>
<p>To identify proteins that interact with C60, we chemically coupled C60 to HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-activated sepharose resin through an amide linker as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g001">Fig 1A</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">Methods</xref> for details). We then used C60-coupled resin or mono-N-Boc-propane-diamine-control linker-coupled resin to affinity purify proteins from Mutu I total cell extracts. Extracts were incubated, washed, and then eluted with either C60 or boiled in SDS-PAGE elution buffer (Δ), and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). C60 eluted material was subject to LC/MS/MS which identified 136 proteins bound exclusively in the C60 affinity resin experiment with at least 2 spectral counts, but not in the linker resin or blank samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006517.s004">S1 Table</xref>) with the top 52 proteins having 5 or more spectral counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Among the top hits that were bound exclusively in the C60 affinity resin and not the linker resin was CAND1. A proteome network analysis of the most abundant proteins recovered selectively on the C60 resin also identified CAND1 as a central hub in this network with the most known protein-protein interactions, which may explain the majority of hits bound in the C60 resin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). A second hub was centered around the SET protein, which shares common interaction partners with CAND1. We validated by Western blot that CAND1 was selectively enriched in the C60 affinity resin relative to the linker control resin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). We also found other proteins involved in a protein modification network (ubquitination, sumoylation) that are biologically linked to CAND1 function, including UBE2N, UBE2M and SAE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g001">Fig 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>Identification of CAND1 in an shRNA screen for EBV lytic cycle restriction factors</title>
<p>In a parallel effort, we performed an shRNA screen to identify host target genes that restrict spontaneous lytic reactivation. EBV positive LCL or Mutu I cells carrying a stable episome with the EBV early lytic promoter BHLF1 driving GFP expression were transduced with the TRC lentivirus shRNA library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref029">29</xref>], and sorted by FACS for Viral Capsid Antigen (VCA) or GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref>). We then recovered shRNA DNA sequence by PCR from EBV reactivated cells relative to unsorted cells and processed the DNA for Illumina NextGen sequencing. Next, we scored reactivation hits from both cell lines and screening approaches for the cumulative number of different shRNA clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). We found that CAND1 was the top hit based on the identification of 4 different shRNA targeting clones, while the next top hits, PDHB and ZEB1, recovered only 3 shRNA clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). ZEB1 has previously been shown to be a constitutive repressor of EBV lytic reactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref031">31</xref>], providing validation for the shRNA screening method. We compared the ability of shCAND1 (clone_1 and clone_2) to reactivate EBV from transduced LCLs relative to shZEB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Although shCAND1 was not as potent as shZEB1, it stimulated both Zta and EA-D expression relative to control shRNA (shCtrl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Similarly, shCAND1_1 and shCAND1_2 stimulated VCA expression levels similar to that of shZEB1 and shSET as measured by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). These studies indicate that CAND1 is a restriction factor for EBV lytic reactivation from latency in Mutu I and LCLs.</p>

<title>C60 induces a p53-stress response pathway distinct from HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate</title>
<p>To better understand the mechanism of action of C60, we interrogated its effect on cellular gene expression. We compared the mRNA expression profiles in Mutu I cells treated with either DMSO, C60, or sodium butyrate (NaB) using Illumina HumanHT-12V4 expression Beadchip. We found 1695 probes significantly affected by C60 (FDR&lt;5%, at least 1.5 fold, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006517.s005">S2 Table</xref>) with 60 known genes changed at least 2.5 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). While C60 and NaB had some overlapping target genes (666 probes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), among the most affected genes were repression of WNT10A and KISS1R and activation of GBP1 and ZDHHC11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). There were many differences between these two treatments, including 229 genes uniquely affected by C60 and 197 genes affected in the opposite direction to NaB (top affected genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), suggesting that their mechanism of action is different. This finding is consistent with our previous study indicating that C60 does not function as an HDAC inhibitor, since it did not increase global levels of histone acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref028">28</xref>]. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis indicated that C60 activates a G2/M DNA Damage Checkpoint and inhibits EIF2 Signaling, while increasing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation and cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). The Viral Infection pathways was also inhibited by C60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Ingenuity Regulator analysis suggested that C60 was inhibiting Myc, while activating the TP53 and CDKN1 pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). In addition, C60 showed a significant activation of targets of COMMD1, a known CAND1 competitor that interacts with multiple Cullins and prevents their binding with CAND1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref032">32</xref>], suggesting C60 functions through inhibition of CAND1 activity. We also analyzed genes with specific response to C60 for enrichment of general functional categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). This analysis identified DNA Damage Response and Host-Virus Interaction as functional categories linked to C60.</p>

<title>C60 induces p53 protein in multiple cell types independent of EBV</title>
<p>To further investigate the effect of C60 on the various pathways identified by functional genomics studies described above, we treated various EBV positive and negative B-cell lines with DMSO or C60 and assayed total cell lysates by Western blot with antibodies for CAND1, p53, phosphorylated p53 (pS15 p53), Cul1, CDC25, ZTA, EA-D, p21 (CDKN1A), <italic>γ</italic>H2AX, and β-Actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g004">Fig 4a</xref>). We found that C60 treatment had only minor effects on CAND1 and Cullin 1 levels, whereas it produced a significant activation of total p53 and pS15 phosphorylated p53. Although Akata cells lack detectable p53, they still showed EBV lytic reactivation in response to C60, indicating that p53 is not essential for viral reactivation by C60. EBV negative BJAB cells also had increased p53 in response to C60, indicating that EBV genes or DNA replication is not required for p53 activation by C60. As expected, there was an activation of EBV early antigens ZTA and EA-D. Interestingly, p21 expression, typically activated by p53, was reduced relative to DMSO treated cells, including Akata cells that lack detectable levels of p53. C60 weakly activated <italic>γ</italic>H2AX in most cells, but this was not observed in BJAB cells, suggesting that DNA damage is not the primary mode of action of C60.</p>

<p>To better understand the mechanism of action of C60, we compared its effects with that of TPA plus sodium butyrate (TPA/NaB) on Mutu-LCL (M-LCL) and Mutu I cells 24 and 48 hrs post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). As above, C60 had subtle effects on CAND1 and Cullin 1 expression. On the other hand, C60 increased p53 protein levels as early as 24 hrs after treatment in M-LCL and Mutu I cells, while TPA/NaB had only modest effects on p53 levels relative to DMSO control. TPA/NaB treatment led to robust activation of ZTA and EA-D in Mutu I cells by 24 hrs, but had little effect on M-LCL cells. In contrast, C60 induced ZTA and EA-D at 48 hrs in both Mutu I and M-LCL cells, but had little effect on ZTA and EA-D at 24 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). These findings suggest that C60 works through a different mechanism than TPA/NaB, and that its effects on ZTA and EA-D are temporally delayed relative to its effects on p53. We also analyzed several of these proteins in LCLs after transduction with lentivirus shCAND1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). We found that CAND1 depletion led to an increase in total and pS15 p53, and a decrease in p21 expression. CAND1 depletion induced EBV early antigens ZTA and EA-D as expected, but did not lead to a significant increase in <italic>γ</italic>H2AX. Taken together, these findings indicate that C60 increases levels of total and pS15 p53 and reduces the levels of its cell cycle arresting target p21. Furthermore, these effects are consistent with C60 phenocopying shRNA depletion of CAND1.</p>

<title>C60 destabilizes CAND1-Cullin 1 interaction while increasing global ubiquitylation</title>
<p>CAND1 is known to interact with Cullin 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref027">27</xref>]. Therefore, we tested whether C60 had an effect on this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). Mutu I cells treated with DMSO or C60 were used to generate total cell lysates for IP with Cullin1 or CAND1 and probed by Western blot for Cullin 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) or CAND1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).

<title>C60 functions through ZTA transcription activation domain</title>

ZTA has been reported to have a Cullin interaction motif (51-LPEP-54) in its transcriptional activation domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref020">20</xref>].

<title>Zta activation domain mediates interaction with Cullins and CAND1</title>
<p>We next compared the ability of FLAG-ZTA WT (FL-ZTA-WT) and transcription activation defective mutant EP53/54AA (FLAG-ZTA-MUT) to co-immunoprecipitate with Cullin 1, Cullin 2, or CAND1. We found that FLAG-ZTA-WT co-precipitated with Cullin 1, Cullin 2, and CAND1, while FLAG-ZTA-MUT did not, suggesting that transcription activation function is linked to the interactions with Cullins and CAND1. We also examined the effect of C60 on the interaction of ZTA with these factors and found little effect by FLAG-IP, although C60 tended to restore FLAG-ZTA-MUT ability to interact with Cullins and CAND1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>).

In contrast, ZTA protein degraded only 1.5 fold in C60 treated cells at the same time point, providing ~3.3 fold increase in protein stability relative to DMSO. This suggests that C60 functions, at least in part, at the level of ZTA protein stabilization. To investigate further the role of ubiquitin proteolysis in regulating ZTA stabilization and EBV reactivation from latency, we compared C60 to two other small molecules with well-characterized targets in the ubiquitin-conjugating and proteolysis pathway. We compared the effects of C60 with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and the NEDD8 Activating Enzyme (NAE) inhibitor MLN4924 for their ability to induce ZTA and EA-D in Mutu I BL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). As before (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g004">Fig 4</xref>), we observed that C60 stabilized p53 at 24 and 48 hrs post treatment, while ZTA and EA-D were detected at 48 hrs post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). NAE inhibitor MLN4924 had only a minor activating effect on ZTA and EA-D protein levels, but its activity could be detected by the accumulation of a faster migrating deneddylated isoform of Cullins 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Interestingly, C60 resulted in the accumulation of the slower migrating, presumably Neddylated, form of Cullins 1 and 2. Also striking, was the rapid effect of MG132 on abundance of ZTA and EA-D at 24 and 48 hrs. Taken together, these data suggest that C60 functions in the Cullin-Neddylation pathway, but through different mechanisms than MLN4924 and MG132. These results also indicate that ZTA and EBV lytic reactivation control are highly sensitive to proteasome-dependent control pathways.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Strategies to reactivate EBV from latency are of current clinical interest for precision treatment of cancers latently infected with EBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref033">33</xref>]. We previously identified the small molecule C60 as a potent activator of EBV reactivation from various latently infected cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref028">28</xref>]. We now show through biochemical affinity purification that C60 can interact with the cellular protein CAND1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g001">Fig 1</xref>). By genetic shRNA library screening, we demonstrated that CAND1 acts as a restriction factor for EBV reactivation from latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Gene expression profiling data revealed that C60 affects a spectrum of gene targets distinct from the HDAC inhibitor NaB, and targets pathways linked to p53 and cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g003">Fig 3</xref>). We found that C60 induces p53 phosphorylation and protein stability at early time points, while activating ZTA and EA-D at subsequent times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g004">Fig 4</xref>). C60 inhibited the interaction between CAND1 and Cullin1, and increased the global cellular accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In terms of EBV gene regulation, we found that C60 stabilized the immediate early protein ZTA through a mechanism that was partly dependent on functional residues within the ZTA transcriptional activation domain and important for interaction with Cullins and CAND1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Finally, we demonstrate the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome regulation controls ZTA and EA-D levels, and that C60 works through a mechanism distinct from proteasome inhibitor MG132 and Neddylase inhibitor MNL4924 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Taken together, we propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g008">Fig 8</xref>) where C60 perturbs the interaction between CAND1 and Cullins to alter the ubiquitylation cycle of critical targets, such as p53 and ZTA, that regulate EBV lytic reactivation from latency.</p>

<title>CAND1, Cullins, and ubiquitylation</title>
<p>CAND1 is known to interact with Cullins and prevent their reassembly as functional CRLs with new substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref034">34</xref>]. CAND1 binding to Cullin 1 is regulated by Nedd8 covalent modification of Cullin 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref035">35</xref>]. Cullins undergo a Neddylation cycle for their activation, and CAND1 is known to interact with deneddylated Cullins and facilitate F-box receptor-substrate exchange. CAND1 stimulates ubiquitylation of some substrates by facilitating the exchange of Cullins with different CRL adaptor-substrate modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref036">36</xref>]. Hypothetical modulators of CAND1 are predicted to have cell-type and context-dependent effects on different CRLs and their ubiquitin substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref025">25</xref>]. Our data indicates that C60 perturbs CAND1 interaction with Cullin 1. How this confers greater stability to p53 and ZTA is not completely understood. We propose that C60 inhibits the ability of CAND1 to exchange Cullin-p53 or Cullin-ZTA substrates, resulting in the failure of these substrates to get ubiquitylated and degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g008">Fig 8</xref>). On the other hand, C60 may accelerate the ubiquitylation and degradation of other substrates, since we observed a global increase in ubiquitylation and a reduction of some proteins, such as p21. The F-box adaptors and CRLs involved in p21 have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref040">40</xref>], and may represent a different class of CRLs than those responsible for the degradation of ZTA and p53. Future studies will be needed to determine how C60 affects these substrate-specific CRLs.</p>

<title>Transcriptional activation function and CAND1 regulation</title>
<p>The relationship between ubiquitylation and transcription activation has been well-documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref042">42</xref>]. CAND1 was initially identified as the TBP-Interacting Protein 120A (TIP120A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref044">44</xref>], suggesting it may contribute directly to the transcription activation domain function of proteins like p53 and ZTA. Ubiquitylation of transcription activation domains is known to play an integral role in the transcription activation cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref041">41</xref>]. Many transcriptional activation domains (TADs), including that of p53 and ZTA, contain degrons that target ubiquitin mediated degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref041">41</xref>]. Previous studies revealed that amino acids 53E and 54P in ZTA TAD are critical for transcription activation function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref019">19</xref>], and more recent studies revealed that these overlap with a consensus Cul5-interaction motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref020">20</xref>]. ZTA was found to function as an adaptor for Cul2 and Cul5- containing ECS (Elongin B/C-Cul2/5-SOCS- box protein) ubiquitin ligase to stimulate the ubiquitylation and degradation of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref020">20</xref>]. We found that ZTA can also interact efficiently with CAND1, Cullins 1 and 2, and that C60 can alter ZTA stability (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g007">7</xref>). Mutations EP53/54AA that reduce ZTA transcription activation, compromise the interaction with CAND1. These results suggest that the ZTA TAD function is regulated by specific CAND1 and CRL interactions that can be perturbed by C60. We suggest that C60 inhibits CAND1 function in the formation of new CRL complexes that degrade ZTA and p53, consequently enhancing their ability to activate transcription of downstream genes important for EBV reactivation.</p>

<title>Regulation of EBV by CAND1-Cullin and C60</title>
<p>Other modulators of the CAND1-Cullin pathway have been found to alter EBV lytic replication. The EBV encoded tegument protein BPLF1 interferes with NEDD8 binding to Cullins, which stimulated EBV lytic replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref023">23</xref>]. It is possible that C60 mimics some of the activities of BPLF1. CAND1 has also been reported to be a target of miR148-b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref045">45</xref>], which has been implicated in EBV gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref046">46</xref>]. Recent genetic studies have also implicated CAND1 as a potential regulator of EBV copy number during EBV latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref047">47</xref>]. Our findings suggest that C60 targets CAND1 and alters its function in recycling Cullins that degrade ZTA and p53. However, C60 appears to act differently than NAE inhibitor MLN4924 that blocks Cullin neddylation and new CRL formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref048">48</xref>]. Unlike C60, MLN4924 did not did not stabilize ZTA and EA-D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g007">Fig 7</xref>). On the other hand, proteasome inhibitor MG132 had a robust and rapid effect on ZTA and EA-D levels in Mutu I cells, suggesting that these proteins are regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. The effect of C60 on ZTA and EA-D is likely to be partly indirect, as the effect is kinetically delayed compared to p53. However, this could be due to the slow accumulation of ZTA through several rounds of auto-activation. C60 may also induce p53 through an ATM-dependent stress pathway, such as DNA damage. However, C60 does not induce DNA-damage associated <italic>γ</italic>H2AX to levels approaching that of known DNA damaging agents, such as doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006517.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), and doxorubicin does not activate EBV in all cell types as does C60. Thus, C60 is not likely to be a direct DNA damaging agent even though it can activate ATM signaling. We propose that C60 alters CAND1-Cullins to alter substrate selection for ubiquitylation and degradation. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the CAND1-Cullin pathway is an important regulatory node for EBV reactivation from latency, and can be manipulated by biological and pharmacological agents to potentially treat EBV associated disease.</p>

<title>Preparation of C60 affinity resin</title>
<p>The C60 ester was hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid by stirring a solution of C60 in MeOH in the presence of 20% NaOH at room temperature for 4 hours. The resulting carboxylic acid was then dissolved in acetonitrile and treated with hydroxybenzotriazole (HATU) to generate the activated ester, which spontaneously cyclized to form intermediate <bold>1</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006517.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Treatment of <bold>1</bold> with propane-1,3-diamine in dichloromethane at room temperature for 8 hours provided the intermediate amide <bold>2</bold>, which provided an amine functional group that can be used for conjugation to HiTrap NHS-activated sepharose resin. We also treated intermediate <bold>1</bold> with the tert-butyl (3-aminopropyl)carbamate in dichloromethane at room temperature for 8 hours, to generate a neutral amide-linker as the N-Boc protected amine derivative of C60. This neutral N-Boc protected derivative of <bold>2</bold> efficiently stimulated EBV reactivation (IC50&lt;500 nM), confirming that addition of a neutral linker did not adversely affect the affinity of the C60 ligand for our affinity pull down experiment. The amine, <bold>2</bold>, was then coupled to the HiTrap NHS-activated sepharose resin following a slightly modified procedure based on the technical manual provided by the vendor. The contents of a HiTrap NHS-activated HP prepacked 1 mL column was removed and added to a 5 mL polypropylene chromatography syringe barrel containing a fine frit. The material was washed with 1 mL of HPLC grade acetonitrile, then the syringe barrel was capped at the bottom and 1 mL of a 2 mg/mL solution containing amine <bold>2</bold> and 1% diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) was added to the NHS activated Sepharose resin (10 μmol NHS per 1 mL column of resin). The mixture was reacted for 5 hours with gentle mixing, then the bottle cap was removed and the resin was washed consecutively with water and acetonitrile. To react any remaining NHS groups the resin was treated with three consecutive washes with a 2% ethanolamine solution in water. The resin was then washed three times with 5 mL of a 0.5 M solution of sodium chloride, followed by three washes with 5 mL a 0.5 M solution of sodium acetate, followed by three washes with 5 mL of a 0.5 M sodium chloride solution. This material was then used for affinity based chromatography purifications. In addition to C60, we generated a control linker resin (mono-N-Boc propane-1,3-diamine) to help distinguish non-specific binding proteins from the C60 specific binding proteins.</p>

Expression level comparisons between two groups was done using two sample t-test and correction for multiple testing to estimate False Discovery Rate (FDR) as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref050">50</xref>]. Genes with FDR&lt;5% changed at least 1.5 fold were considered significant. Gene set enrichment analysis was done using QIAGEN’s Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA, QIAGEN Redwood City,<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qiagen.com/ingenuity" xlink:type="simple">www.qiagen.com/ingenuity</ext-link>) and “Biological Function,” “Canonical Pathways,” and “Upstream Regulators” results were considered with p-values and prediction of activation Z-scores used to filter results. Significance of enrichment was defined at nominal p-value&lt;10<sup>−3</sup>, Z&gt;2 for non-cancer related functions, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>, Z&gt;2 for regulators and FDR&lt;15% Z&gt;1 for pathways. DAVID enrichment analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006517.ref051">51</xref>] was done considering only swiss-prot functional categories that pass thresholds of FDR&lt;15%, enrichment&gt;2 fold.</p>
