<abstract>
<p>Globally re-emerging dengue viruses are transmitted from human-to-human by <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. While viral determinants of human pathogenicity have been defined, there is a lack of knowledge of how dengue viruses influence mosquito transmission. Identification of viral determinants of transmission can help identify isolates with high epidemiological potential. Additionally, mechanistic understanding of transmission will lead to better understanding of how dengue viruses harness evolution to cycle between the two hosts. Here, we identified viral determinants of transmission and characterized mechanisms that enhance production of infectious saliva by inhibiting immunity specifically in salivary glands. Combining oral infection of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes and reverse genetics, we identified two 3’ UTR substitutions in epidemic isolates that increased subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) quantity, infectious particles in salivary glands and infection rate of saliva, which represents a measure of transmission. We also demonstrated that various 3’UTR modifications similarly affect sfRNA quantity in both whole mosquitoes and human cells, suggesting a shared determinism of sfRNA quantity. Furthermore, higher relative quantity of sfRNA in salivary glands compared to midgut and carcass pointed to sfRNA function in salivary glands. We showed that the Toll innate immune response was preferentially inhibited in salivary glands by viruses with the 3’UTR substitutions associated to high epidemiological fitness and high sfRNA quantity, pointing to a mechanism for higher saliva infection rate. By determining that sfRNA is an immune suppressor in a tissue relevant to mosquito transmission, we propose that 3’UTR/sfRNA sequence evolution shapes dengue epidemiology not only by influencing human pathogenicity but also by increasing mosquito transmission, thereby revealing a viral determinant of epidemiological fitness that is shared between the two hosts.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Dengue is a re-emerging global disease transmitted from human-to-human by mosquitoes. While environmental and host immune factors are important, viral determinants of mosquito transmission also shape the epidemiology of dengue. Understanding how dengue viruses influence transmission will help identify isolates with high epidemic potential and untangle the evolutionary pressures at play in the dual-host cycle. Here, we identified 2 substitutions in the 3’UTR of epidemic isolates that increase transmission through immune suppression in the salivary glands. Using oral infection of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, we reported that epidemic isolates produced more subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) in salivary glands. SfRNA is generated from the 3’UTR sequence remaining after partial genome degradation by a host nuclease. Using reverse genetics, we identified the two 3’UTR substitutions responsible for the higher sfRNA quantity in salivary glands. We further showed that these substitutions increased dengue virus titer in salivary glands and rate of saliva infection, and suppressed the Toll immune response in salivary glands. Our study identifies the substitutions that determine virus epidemiological fitness and provides a mechanism for sfRNA-mediated enhancement of transmission. Together with previous work demonstrating that sfRNA sequence modification influences dengue virus pathogenicity in human, and that shows variation in sfRNA sequence when the viruses transition from one host to vector and vice versa, our study supports that sfRNA evolution is constrained in the two hosts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dengue viruses (DENV), members of the flavivirus genus, infect about 390 million people annually and threaten one third of the world population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref001">1</xref>] making them the most important arboviruses in the world. DENV are primarily transmitted by <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref002">2</xref>]. Increase in transmission efficiency augments arbovirus epidemiological fitness (EF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref004">4</xref>], defined hereafter as the capacity to generate an epidemic, and can trigger epidemics as observed in other mosquito-virus systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref007">7</xref>]. Successful transmission following an infectious blood meal occurs when the virus infects the midgut, escapes from this organ to multiply in secondary tissues, including hemocytes, fat bodies or muscles, and productively infects the salivary glands, from which it is expectorated along with saliva during subsequent blood feedings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref009">9</xref>]. Upon infection, mosquitoes mount a powerful innate immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref010">10</xref>] mediated by the Toll, IMD, Jak/STAT, RNAi, and/or TRAF/Rel2 pathways that can inhibit DENV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref017">17</xref>]. Transmission efficiency is likely dictated by the balance of power between host antiviral measures and viral countermeasures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref019">19</xref>]. Identification of the viral factors that interfere with the immune response will reveal viral strategies to enhance transmission and facilitate identification of viruses with high EF.</p>
<p>One such factor is the subgenomic flaviviral RNA fragment (sfRNA), produced from partial degradation of flavivirus genomes by the host exonuclease XRN1 that stalls at 3’UTR nuclease resistant structures, functionally labelled XRN1-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref023">23</xref>]. Different species of DENV sfRNA can be produced from the 3’UTR sequence depending on which xrRNA the degradation stalls at [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref024">24</xref>]. In mosquitoes, sfRNA from DENV-1 (serotype 1) and West Nile virus (WNV) can suppress RNAi processing of an ectopic substrate by inhibiting Dicer-2 cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref025">25</xref>], likely through direct binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref026">26</xref>]. Nonetheless, a recent <italic>in vivo</italic> study demonstrated the lack of RNAi alteration by WNV sfRNA in spite of sfRNA processing by the RNAi machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref027">27</xref>]. The study further showed a transmission decrease by <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes (the main vector of WNV) for sfRNA-deficient WNV, and indicated that reduction of transmission potential was mediated by an unidentified mechanism in midgut. Phylogenetic clustering of flavivirus 3’UTR sequences according to vector species suggests functional specialization for sfRNAs in different vector-virus system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref028">28</xref>]. In humans, sfRNA alters innate immune response by altering interferon production and the cellular response to interferons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref032">32</xref>]. Evolution of the DENV-2 (serotype 2) sfRNA sequence in more fit viruses increases production of this non-coding RNA and/or augments binding-specificity to innate immune regulators, both concurrently antagonizing the antiviral response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref030">30</xref>]. The resulting increased infectivity provided an explanation for a DENV-2 lineage replacement that occurred in Puerto Rico in 1994–1995 (PR-2B replacing PR-1 isolates), which resulted in an important outbreak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref033">33</xref>]. Altogether, these studies, and several others, suggest a strong immune suppressor function for sfRNA in both humans and mosquitoes. Nevertheless, understanding of the relationship between sfRNA evolution, its anti-immune function in mosquitoes and how these impact mosquito transmission is lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref034">34</xref>]. Such knowledge would serve molecular surveillance to predict emergence of viruses with high transmission capacity and improve the characterization of the evolutionary pressures that shape sfRNA, a determinant of dengue pathogenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>To address this gap in our knowledge, we tested whether or not variant 3’UTR sequences alter sfRNA quantity in mosquitoes and investigated how these influence transmission. We made use of an existing bank of DENV-2 isolates collected in Puerto Rico with different EF and variable 3’UTR sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref033">33</xref>]. After oral infection of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes with high and low EF isolates, we observed that, although overall levels of viral genomes (gRNA) and progeny were not different between these, high EF isolates produced higher sfRNA:gRNA ratios. Using two representatives of each epidemic level, we noted significantly higher sfRNA:gRNA ratio in salivary glands for the high EF isolate. Remarkably, regardless of the isolate, the sfRNA:gRNA ratio was higher in salivary glands than in midgut or carcass, suggesting a heretofore unprecedented tissue-specific regulation of sfRNA accumulation. Using reverse genetics, we demonstrated that two 3’UTR substitutions in the high EF isolate were responsible for the difference in sfRNA:gRNA ratios in salivary glands. We then found that the isolate with higher EF and the chimeric virus with the corresponding 3’UTR resulted in higher infection rate of saliva. Finally, we determined that the high EF isolate disrupted the Toll immune response in salivary glands and incriminated the same two 3’UTR substitutions that alter sfRNA quantity.</p>

<title>While infectivity does not vary with epidemiological fitness, epidemic isolates produce higher sfRNA:gRNA ratio</title>
<p>To study whether sfRNA determines EF by influencing mosquito infection, we selected DENV-2 isolates within the Asia subtype IIIb with different EF and 3’UTR sequences. The isolates were selected from those identified in a study that examined viral phylogeny over the twenty year period from 1981–2001 in Puerto Rico [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref033">33</xref>]. This study revealed the replacement of the endemic PR-1 by an epidemic PR-2B clade over the years 1994–1995, resulting in an important outbreak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref033">33</xref>]. Full genome sequencing of viruses from the two clades refined the phylogenetic history and implicated changes in the 3’UTR in EF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref030">30</xref>]. Three isolates from the clade PR-2B with high EF, which we defined as such because many highly related isolates were collected during the outbreak, were selected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref030">30</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006535.t001">Table 1</xref>). Isolates with lower EF included five isolates from the replaced endemic PR-1 clade and PR315022, which belongs to PR-2B clade but does not have homologous isolates from the outbreak, suggesting low EF. Sequence identity between our virus stocks and the original passage 0 isolates was validated using NGS for one representative of PR-1 (PR1940) and two of PR-2B (PR6452 and PR315022) (raw sequences available on NCBI: SRX2617313-SRX26173151). The 3’UTR sequences varied between and within the clades and all PR-2B isolates possessed the three substitutions associated with immune suppression in humans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref030">30</xref>].</p>

<p>To test whether higher EF was associated with increased vector susceptibility, we orally infected <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes with the aforementioned PR-1 and PR-2B isolates, and quantified feeding rate, mosquito survival and virus infectivity. To use an epidemiologically relevant inoculum dose, we offered mosquitoes an artificial blood meal containing 10<sup>6</sup> pfu/ml. The inoculum concentration is in the lower range of the viremia measured in hospitalized children during the first couple of days after fever onset[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref035">35</xref>], which overlaps with the peak of transmissibility to mosquitoes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref037">37</xref>]. Mosquito feeding rate was not affected by the isolates; except for two PR1 isolates, PR2974 and PR4056, which exhibited significantly higher and lower rates, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). Survival of mosquitoes at 10 days post-infection (p.i.) was not altered after infection with the isolates, except for PR1940, PR0013 and PR6913 that had significantly lower survival than PR315022 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). Importantly, survival did not segregate with EF level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). At 21 days p.i., survival of mosquitoes infected with three viral isolates, which represented high and low EF viruses, was not altered as compared to non-infected mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). A decrease in the rate of blood feeding or in survival could diminish vector capacity and therefore virus fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref038">38</xref>], but our data are not consistent with either of these parameters explaining fitness of the studied DENV-2 isolates.</p>
<p>We detected and quantified DENV genomic RNA (gRNA) in whole mosquitoes 10 days p.i. using RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Infection rate, which was defined as percentage of infected mosquitoes among blood-fed ones, varied between isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) but did not segregate with EF level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g001">Fig 1B</xref>; p = 0.27). Similarly, the number of gRNA copies per infected mosquito varied between isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) but did not segregate with EF level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g001">Fig 1D</xref>; p = 0.98). To determine whether the production of infectious particles was linked to EF level, we orally infected mosquitoes with the three representative isolates, PR1940, PR6452 and PR315022 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006535.t001">Table 1</xref>), and 10 days p.i. measured plaque forming units (PFU) from whole mosquitoes. Virus titer was not different between the three isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Therefore, the level of viral genomes or of infectious particles in whole mosquitoes did not correlate with viral EF.</p>

<p>We then quantified the sfRNA copies per infected mosquito at 10 days p.i. with the same nine isolates, and calculated the ratio of sfRNA to gRNA (sfRNA:gRNA) in whole mosquitoes. The forward primer used to quantify sfRNA with RT-qPCR annealed after the xrRNA1 structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) and, hence, only detects the longer sfRNA species that results from XRN1 stalling at the xrRNA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref024">24</xref>]. Strikingly, the sfRNA:gRNA ratio was significantly higher for the high EF isolates than for isolates with lower EF (p = 0.001), PR-1 isolates and the PR-2B isolate, PR315022 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>). Infection with PR315022 produced the lowest sfRNA:gRNA ratio of 3.6 (± 0.83), whereas infection with PR6452 (high EF PR-2B) resulted in the highest ratio of 38 (± 14.57). The 3’UTR sequences for PR6452 and PR315022 differ by two nucleotides: a C to U transition 5 nt downstream of the termination codon that is not expected to be in the mature sfRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref039">39</xref>], and a U to C transition in the distal loop of the first nuclease resistant (xrRNA1) structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). Both substitutions are absent from the other PR-1 and PR-2B isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Substitutions in sfRNA sequences can disrupt the nuclease resistant structures and result in shorter sfRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref039">39</xref>], to test whether or not this was the case between PR6452 and PR315022 we used Northern blots to compare sfRNA size and quantity in the whole body of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> collected 10 days p.i. with these isolates. The probe used was complementary to the 3’UTR sequence starting immediately downstream of xrRNA1 and ending at the 3’ end of the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), and can thus detect all sfRNA species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref024">24</xref>]. The predominant sfRNA in PR315022 infected cells appeared to be very similar in size to that observed in PR6452 infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g001">Fig 1I</xref>), although high resolution Northern Blot with acrylamide gel would be required to confirm this. Further, we confirmed using Northern Blot the higher ratio of sfRNA:gRNA in PR6452-infected whole mosquitoes. Altogether, our data show an association between higher EF and higher sfRNA:gRNA ratio in mosquitoes.</p>

<title>SfRNA:gRNA ratio positively correlates in human and mosquito</title>
<p>To compare sfRNA production for the aforementioned nine DENV-2 isolates in human cells, we infected HuH-7 cells and quantified gRNA and sfRNA. As we have reported before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref030">30</xref>], PR-1 isolates produced higher gRNA levels than PR-2B isolates at 24 h.p.i.

PR315022 was the exception among the PR-2B isolates and had a sfRNA:gRNA ratio more typical of low EF PR-1 isolates. Interestingly, the ratios in human cells and mosquitoes were positively correlated (Pearson correlation = 0.85; p = 0.004) and the best fit was an exponential regression (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.96 vs. linear regression: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.71) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), suggesting that shared determinants set sfRNA:gRNA ratios in humans and mosquitoes.</p>

<title>SfRNA:gRNA ratio is higher in salivary glands and for the higher epidemiological fitness virus</title>
<p>EF for DENV depends in part on transmission efficiency. One measure of efficiency of mosquito transmission is the extrinsic incubation period, determined by the time to infect salivary glands after oral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref003">3</xref>]. To test whether or not viruses with different EF have different infection kinetics, we orally infected mosquitoes with PR-2B isolates: the high EF PR6452 and the low EF PR315022. We decided to focus on these two isolates since they are both in the same PR-2B clade and yet they appear to be very different in terms of fitness. At 3, 7, 10 and 14 days p.i., we quantified DENV gRNA copies in the midgut, carcass and salivary glands. We did not pursue the experiments past 14 days p.i. as a majority of female mosquitoes do not live longer than this in wild settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref040">40</xref>]. Infection rate for PR6452 was significantly higher in midgut and carcass at 3 days, and in the salivary glands at 14 days p.i. Indeed, 14 days p.i., salivary gland infection rate reached 80 and 57% for PR6452 and PR315022, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).

<p>Quantification of sfRNA revealed two interesting observations. First, regardless of virus, sfRNA:gRNA ratio was higher in salivary glands than in midgut and carcass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s014">S2 Table</xref>). The effect of tissue was significant in our ANOVA model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s014">S2 Table</xref>; P &lt; 0.001) and, at 10 days p.i. which was the apparent peak of sfRNA production, there was approximately a ten-fold higher sfRNA:gRNA ratio in salivary glands than in the two other tissues. Second, the sfRNA:gRNA ratio in salivary glands was higher in PR6452 infected mosquitoes than those infected with PR315022 at 3, 7 and 10 days p.i,. and the difference was significant at 10 days p.i. Both the higher sfRNA:gRNA ratio in salivary glands and for high EF virus suggest a role for sfRNA in salivary glands in transmission efficiency.</p>
<p>To investigate whether or not tissue specific variations in exonuclease XRN1 expression could explain the sfRNA:gRNA ratio, we quantified <italic>XRN1</italic> mRNA expression in the different tissues.

<p>The high EF PR6452 and the lower EF PR315022 isolates have many nucleotide differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s015">S3 Table</xref>) that could cause the observed higher sfRNA:gRNA ratio. Since sequences in the 3’UTR are most likely to cause changes in sfRNA levels, we tested the role of the two transitions in this region on infection parameters including the sfRNA:gRNA ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s015">S3 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). We constructed two chimeric viruses, based on the DENV-2 NGC isolate, identical except for the 3’UTR sequences which were derived from PR6452 or PR315022; thereafter named IC6452 and IC315022, respectively. The sequence of the two chimeric viruses were validated using NGS (raw sequences available on NCBI: SRX2617311-SRX2617312) and were as expected.</p>
<p>The chimeric viruses were used to orally infect mosquitoes, and at 3, 7, 10 and 14 days p.i. infection rate, levels of DENV gRNA and sfRNA:gRNA ratios were quantified in midgut, carcass and salivary glands. Infection rate was not different between the two chimeric viruses in midgut and carcass at 3, 7 and 10 days p.i., but was significantly higher for IC6452 than for IC315022 in salivary glands at 7 and 10 days p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Salivary gland infection rate reached 17.5% and 2.5% at 7 days, and 35% and 15% at 10 days p.i. for IC6452 and IC315022, respectively. The number of gRNA copies per infected mosquitoes was not significantly different between the two chimeric viruses in the three tissues within each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s016">S4 Table</xref>). Similar to what we observed for PR isolates, infection kinetic appeared faster for IC6452 and DENV gRNA copies did not vary between the two viruses.</p>

<p>Quantification of sfRNA copies and calculation of the sfRNA:gRNA ratio showed that the chimeric viruses recapitulated the two key observations made with the parental PR isolates. First, sfRNA:gRNA ratio was higher in salivary glands than in midgut and carcass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s017">S5 Table</xref>). The effect of virus was significant in our ANOVA model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s017">S5 Table</xref>; P &lt; 0.001) and, at 14 days which was the highest sfRNA level, there was at least a ten-fold higher sfRNA:gRNA ratio in salivary glands than in the two other tissues. Second, IC6452 had a higher sfRNA:gRNA ratio in salivary glands at 14 days p.i.. Additionally, we quantified gRNA, sfRNA and viral titers at 14 days p.i. in whole mosquitoes infected with IC6452 and IC315022. While the infection rate, DENV gRNA levels and viral titer were similar for the two chimeric viruses, the sfRNA:gRNA ratio was significantly higher after infection with IC6452 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). IC6452 and IC315022 recapitulated what we observed with PR6452 and PR315022, demonstrating that the 3’UTR sequence from the high EF isolates was responsible for higher sfRNA accumulation in salivary glands.</p>

<title>The high epidemiological fitness 3’UTR increases production of virus progeny in salivary glands</title>
<p>While the 3’UTR sequence did not influence gRNA level and the infection rate in salivary glands at the peak of sfRNA accumulation (14 days p.i.) when quantified using RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), we tested whether 3’UTR sequence from high or low EF altered the production of infectious particles in salivary glands. Mosquitoes were orally infected with the chimeric viruses IC6452 or IC315022, and progeny virus in salivary glands was tittered using a plaque forming assay at 14 days p.i., which corresponded to the peak of sfRNA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The infection rates of salivary glands were not different after infection with either of the chimeric viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), and were comparable to the ones calculated by detecting gRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

<title>The high epidemiological fitness 3’UTR increases infection rate of saliva</title>
<p>To test whether or not higher sfRNA:gRNA ratio and virus titer in salivary glands resulted in higher saliva infection rate (defined as the proportion of saliva containing DENV gRNA), we quantified DENV gRNA in saliva collected 10 days p.i. with PR6452 and PR315022. To avoid false negatives caused when a mosquito did not salivate, we collected saliva in blood and only analysed samples from infected mosquitoes with blood-containing abdomen. In our conditions, the rate of blood imbibing and the gRNA copies per infected whole mosquitoes were not different between the two isolates (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g006">6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s007">S7</xref>).

<title>3’UTR sequences determine viral disruption of the immune response in salivary glands</title>
<p>To test whether viruses with higher epidemiological fitness disrupt the mosquito immune response in salivary glands, we orally infected mosquitoes with PR6452, PR315022 or fed them with non-infectious blood. At 10 days post-oral feeding, which corresponded to the sfRNA:gRNA ratio peak in the salivary glands, we quantified gene expression for activators of Toll, IMD, Jak/STAT and Rel2/TRAF pathway in the salivary glands. We also tested these in midgut and carcass to validate the specificity of the immune disruption. We chose signalling activators that are up-regulated upon DENV infection in midgut or carcass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref016">16</xref>]; Rel1a as an activator of Toll, Rel2 of IMD, Domeless of Jak/STAT and Vago of TRAF/Rel2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref041">41</xref>]. We first validated that DENV gRNA copies were similar between the two isolates for each tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). In salivary glands, <italic>Rel1a</italic> expression was downregulated 3.7 fold (p-value = 0.09) more by PR6452 than by PR315022, and <italic>Domeless</italic> was downregulated 2.6 fold (p-value = 0.071) more by PR6452 as compared to blood feeding while PR315022 did not alter <italic>Domeless</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Quantification of expression of the same immune markers in midgut and carcass showed that <italic>Rel2</italic> was significantly 1.87 times (p-value = 0.016) up-regulated in carcass infected with PR6452 as compared to PR315022 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s010">S10A and S10B Fig</xref>). To confirm the inhibition of Toll and Jak/STAT pathways in salivary glands infected with PR6452, we quantified the expression of genes under the control of either of these pathways in the same samples. We chose to study Cecropin G (CecG) and Defensin C (Def C), two antimicrobial peptides which are positively regulated by Toll [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref042">42</xref>], and Thioester-containing protein 22 (TEP22), a component of the complement system in mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref043">43</xref>], and vir-1, which function is unknown, both positively regulated by Jak/STAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref044">44</xref>]. In salivary glands, <italic>CecG</italic> RNA was significantly downregulated after infection with PR6452 as compared to both PR315022 (1.78 fold; p-value = 0.043) and non-infectious conditions (2.04 fold; p-value = 0.012) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). In midgut and carcass, however, only <italic>TEP22</italic> was significantly up-regulated in carcass upon PR6452 infection as compared to both PR315022 (2.05 times; p-value = 0.04) and non-infectious conditions (1.65 times; p-value = 0.04) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s010">S10C and S10D Fig</xref>).

<p>To determine whether the 3’UTR was responsible for the differential immune disruption of the DENV2 isolates, we orally infected mosquitoes with the chimeric viruses IC6452 or IC315022, or fed them non-infectious blood. At 14 days post-oral feeding, which corresponded to the time where we observed the highest sfRNA:gRNA ratio, we quantified expression of the same immune pathway activators interrogated above. We first validated that DENV gRNA levels were similar between the two chimeric viruses in each tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). In salivary glands, while <italic>Domeless</italic> expression was 1.19 times lower after infection with IC6452 than after non-infectious blood feeding the difference was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Supportive of a role for the 3’UTR sequence in disrupting Toll pathway, <italic>Rel1a</italic> was downregulated 2.14 fold (p-value = 0.001) more by IC6452 than by IC315022.

As we did for the parental viruses we quantified expression of genes under the control of Toll and Jak/STAT pathways. In salivary glands, <italic>CecG</italic> was downregulated 2.22 fold (p-value = 0.024) upon infection with IC6452 as compared to IC315022 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g007">Fig 7D</xref>), whereas none of the genes were differentially expressed in midgut and carcass (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s012">S12C and S12D Fig</xref>). Altogether, these data demonstrate that 3’UTR sequences determine the preferential disruption of the Toll/Rel1a antiviral pathway in salivary glands infected with the high EF isolate PR6452.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>By demonstrating a link between high EF 3’UTR DENV sequence on one hand, and increased sfRNA quantity, infectious particles in salivary glands, saliva infection rate, and immune disruption in the salivary glands on the other hand, we provide an explanation for how 3’UTR sequence evolution augments mosquito transmission.</p>
<p>Our study revealed an unprecedented tissue-specific pattern of sfRNA accumulation in DENV2-infected mosquitoes. The much higher sfRNA:gRNA ratio in salivary glands compared to other tissues suggests an important function for sfRNA in salivary glands, a critical organ for transmission. Furthermore, in salivary glands, but not in the midgut or carcass, we observed dramatically higher sfRNA levels with the high EF isolate when compared to the low EF one. We also observed an interesting temporal variation of sfRNA in salivary glands, where sfRNA peaked after 10 days for the parental isolates and 14 days for the chimeric viruses (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g003">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g004">4C</xref>). The time difference in sfRNA peaks may be attributed to the slower infection kinetic of infectious clones, as measured by the slower infection rate in the different tissues (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g003">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g004">4A</xref>), and may partially be caused by the limited virus genetic variation for the infectious clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref045">45</xref>]. Because sfRNA production comes at the expense of gRNA, which decrease can restrict replication, translation and packaging, sfRNA production might be optimized to match the transmission window and limit its associated cost. Accordingly, we observed that sfRNA peak levels occur after the extrinsic incubation period measured at the same temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref046">46</xref>]. It is intriguing to speculate that the high levels of sfRNA in salivary glands and the timing of its accumulation play important roles in transmission and perhaps infectivity of the virus in the mammalian host.</p>
<p>The tissue-specific overexpression of sfRNA raises several questions. We suspect that other tissues or cell types we did not capture in our analysis may also produce high levels of sfRNA. In fact, it should be noted that carcass samples consist of the material remaining left after dissection of salivary glands and midgut, and are mostly devoid of hemolymph fluids and loose tissues that can be infected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref009">9</xref>]. This technical limitation impacts sfRNA quantification in dissected tissues as compared to that obtained with whole mosquitoes. In terms of a mechanism, sfRNA quantity is determined by production and degradation kinetics. Increased production could be the results of increased XRN1 activity; however, the lack of correlation between sfRNA:gRNA ratio and <italic>XRN1</italic> exonuclease gene expression does not support a determining role for XRN1 expression. These data do not refute possible increases in XRN1 protein or activity. In the same line of thought, increased production should concomitantly diminish gRNA levels, which we did not observe (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g004">4</xref>). Alternatively, binding of tissue-specific proteins to sfRNA could modulate susceptibility to XRN1 degradation or sfRNA stability. Salivary glands have different transcriptome as compared to carcass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref047">47</xref>] and are thus expected to have a unique collection of protein capable of interacting with the sfRNA.</p>
<p>Using reverse genetics, we established a link between 3’UTR sequence and sfRNA quantity in whole mosquitoes and in salivary glands. Our group has previously demonstrated that single substitutions in a replicon are sufficient to alter sfRNA:gRNA ratio in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref030">30</xref>]. Three 3’UTR substitutions previously associated with high sfRNA:gRNA ratio in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref030">30</xref>] are present in all our PR-2B isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006535.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Two additional nucleotide substitutions in the PR-2B PR315022, a C to U transition at nucleotide 10,278 and a U to C transition at nucleotide 10,326, were sufficient to impair the gain in sfRNA:gRNA ratio in both human cells and mosquitoes. While we cannot definitively state which of the two substitution leads to low sfRNA levels for PR315022, we propose that U to C at 10,326 is the critical one. Using the recently solved structure of Zika virus sfRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref048">48</xref>] as a model, we propose that this U to C transition disrupts the terminal loop and would weaken the pseudoknot pk1 and the long-range Watson-Crick base-pair between the bulged A in the long stem of xrRNA1 and the U at the base of the same structure (indicated for PR6452 in green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). These alterations are likely to make xrRNA1 much less resistant to XRN1 degradation reducing levels of full length sfRNA from PR315022. Indeed, the more dramatic reduction in sfRNA:gRNA ratio in PR315022 observed by RT-qPCR, which only measured full length sfRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), versus that seen in Northern blots, which detected all sfRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g001">Fig 1I</xref>), suggests that the longer sfRNA were likely the most affected by the PR315022 substitution. This is fully consistent with a recent study showing the existence of several species of sfRNA in DENV, with relative proportions influenced by point mutations in the 3’UTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref024">24</xref>]. The continuous unravelling of the plasticity of the nuclease-resistant structures indicates that multi-domain interactions are involved in determining sfRNA quantity. Correlated ratios of sfRNA:gRNA in human and mosquito further suggests a shared 3’UTR-based determinism of sfRNA:gRNA ratio, which could reduce dual-host constraints on 3’UTR evolution if sfRNA fitness advantage is also shared between the two hosts.</p>
<p>DENV infection induces an immune response in midgut through Toll and Jak/STAT signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref015">15</xref>]. Artificial activation or repression of the Toll and Jak/STAT decreases or increases DENV replication, respectively, by regulating antiviral effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref015">15</xref>]. In DENV-infected salivary glands, Toll and IMD components are upregulated together with the antimicrobial Cecropin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref013">13</xref>]. In another study, genes related to Toll pathway were found to be upregulated in uninfected salivary glands as compared to uninfected carcass and DENV infection was shown to induce several immune-related genes, although <italic>Rel1a</italic> was not regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref047">47</xref>]. Interestingly, the different immune signalling pathways appear to co-regulate a set of identical genes as well as components from other immune pathways in mosquitoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref015">15</xref>], suggesting cross-talks between signalling cascades. This is exemplified by the Rel2/TRAF pathway. Upon flavivirus infection in mosquito cells, TRAF is activated in a Dicer-2-dependent manner to induce Vago, which activates the Jak/STAT pathway and inhibits flavivirus replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref016">16</xref>]. In our study, salivary gland infection with the high EF isolate or the chimeric virus with the corresponding 3’UTR inhibited gene expression for the Toll component, <italic>Rel1a</italic>, and <italic>Cecropin G</italic> (<italic>Cec G</italic>), which is regulated by Toll [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref015">15</xref>]. Although the same gene expression pattern was observed at 10 and 14 days p.i. with the isolates and the chimeric viruses, respectively, modification of other immune pathways may occur earlier or later during salivary gland infection. We did not monitor gene expression of the RNAi components as they are not regulated upon DENV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref015">15</xref>] and, hence, cannot be studied in our system. Nonetheless, sfRNA may alter the RNAi response as previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref025">25</xref>]. Inhibition of immune gene expression in DENV-infected cells was previously reported but no mechanism was provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref019">19</xref>]. Here, we observed that sfRNA quantity correlates with Toll pathway inhibition in salivary glands, strongly suggesting an immune-suppressor role for sfRNA in mosquitoes additional to its effects on RNAi. That one of the Toll-induced genes we tested, Defensin C, was not differentially regulated after infection by viruses containing the high EF 3’UTR is suggestive of a fine-tuned inhibition of the immune response. It should be noted that PR6452 not only produces more sfRNA than its less fit relative PR315022, but it also produces sfRNA(s) with different sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). The ability of different sfRNAs to bind innate immune regulators in human cells has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref049">49</xref>] and may function similarly in mosquitoes. Indeed, binding to innate immune regulators will be controlled by both sfRNA levels and sfRNA sequence variation. The evolution of sfRNA variants offers flaviviruses a flexible strategy to sample various anti-immune tactics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref050">50</xref>].</p>
<p>Our study showed that the presence of a high EF 3’UTR increased the production of infectious particles but not accumulation of gRNA in salivary glands (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006535.g005">5</xref>). Previous studies observed a decoupling of infectious particle production from gRNA replication in midgut during the course of a normal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref051">51</xref>]. In midgut, gRNA copies steadily increase throughout the infection, whereas infectious particles correlate with gRNA copies early during infection and decrease at later time points. Human immune response targets the difference steps of virus production, from replication, translation, packaging to virus egress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref052">52</xref>]. While the impact of mosquito anti-DENV response remains to be characterized, our results show that inhibition of the Toll pathway correlates with higher number of infectious particles, which explains the increased probability that excreted saliva contains viruses. In conclusion, while outbreaks of DENV are influenced by multiple ecological and host factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref054">54</xref>], viral characteristics are major contributors to epidemic transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref055">55</xref>]. Here, we identified the 3’UTR as a genetic determinant of virus fitness in mosquitoes and report the first <italic>in vivo</italic> characterization of how dengue virus influences transmission through the production of sfRNA. Our study provides new mechanistic insights on the role of mosquito transmission in shaping the epidemiology of dengue, and, together with previous studies in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006535.ref030">30</xref>], emphasizes the importance of sfRNA evolution. Identification and characterization of viral determinants of mosquito transmission will help forecast emergence of DENV strains with higher epidemic potential.</p>
