<abstract>
<p>Mitochondrial protein import is essential for <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> across its life cycle and mediated by membrane-embedded heterooligomeric protein complexes, which mainly consist of trypanosomatid-specific subunits. However, trypanosomes contain orthologues of small Tim chaperones that escort hydrophobic proteins across the intermembrane space. Here we have experimentally analyzed three novel trypanosomal small Tim proteins, one of which contains only an incomplete Cx3C motif. RNAi-mediated ablation of TbERV1 shows that their import, as in other organisms, depends on the MIA pathway. Submitochondrial fractionation combined with immunoprecipitation and BN-PAGE reveals two pools of small Tim proteins: a soluble fraction forming 70 kDa complexes, consistent with hexamers and a second fraction that is tightly associated with the single trypanosomal TIM complex. RNAi-mediated ablation of the three proteins leads to a growth arrest and inhibits the formation of the TIM complex. In line with these findings, the changes in the mitochondrial proteome induced by ablation of one small Tim phenocopy the effects observed after ablation of TbTim17. Thus, the trypanosomal small Tims play an unexpected and essential role in the biogenesis of the single TIM complex, which for one of them is not linked to import of TbTim17.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p><italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> and its relatives are prominent pathogens causing human and animal diseases, which mainly affect developing countries. The single mitochondrion of trypanosomes is essential across its entire life cycle. Most organellar proteins are imported by hetero-oligomeric protein complexes in the two mitochondrial membranes. Interestingly, the composition of the two import machineries is remarkably different from their corresponding counterparts in other organisms. In contrast, chaperones termed small Tims that escort hydrophobic proteins across the aqueous intermembrane space are conserved in almost all eukaryotes including trypanosomes. Here we show that a fraction of them interact tightly with the inner membrane translocase. Another fraction is present as soluble 70 kDa complexes, which likely consists of hexamers of small Tims without a defined subunit composition. In other eukaryotes these hexamers are usually composed of two alternating small Tims. Moreover, while some small Tims are involved in import of a core subunit of the inner membrane protein translocase, we found one small Tim that directly mediates the assembly of the translocase complex. Knowing which components of the trypanosomal protein import systems are conserved and which ones are not is essential to evaluate whether mitochondrial protein import might be a suitable drug target.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The parasitic protozoan <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> is the causative agent of the devastating human sleeping sickness and of nagana in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref001">1</xref>]. However, besides its clinical and economic importance, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> is also an interesting model to investigate variations of basic cell biological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref003">3</xref>]. One such process is mitochondrial protein import, which has been studied in great detail in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref005">5</xref>]. Modern phylogeny divides eukaryotes into five to six supergroups that diverged very early in evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref006">6</xref>]. Fungi and animals belong to the supergroup of the Opisthokonts and therefore are quite closely related. Trypanosomes are a member of the supergroup of the Excavates and thus are phylogenetically very distant to Opisthokonts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref007">7</xref>]. Due to this position in the eukaryotic evolutionary tree and its experimental accessibility, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> is excellently suited to investigate which features of mitochondrial protein import are conserved and which ones are not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref004">4</xref>]. Recent studies in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> have characterized the main protein translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane (TOM), termed archaic translocase of the OM (ATOM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref009">9</xref>], as well as the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref010">10</xref>]. Only two subunits of the ATOM complex and one integral membrane subunit of the single trypanosomal TIM complex are orthologous to TOM and TIM complex subunits of any other eukaryote [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref004">4</xref>]. This is surprising since protein import is considered to be one of the first, if not the first, mitochondria-specific trait to evolve, which suggests that the machineries mediating the process would be conserved.</p>
<p>In the present study we focus on the small Tim family of intermembrane space (IMS) localized chaperones (also known as tiny Tims), which is conserved in all mitochondria-containing eukaryotes including trypanosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref012">12</xref>]. Members of the small Tim family have a molecular weight of around 10 kDa and contain conserved twin Cx3C motifs that normally are separated by 11–16 residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref013">13</xref>]. The two motifs form intramolecular disulfide bonds that stabilize the helix-loop-helix structure of small Tim proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref015">15</xref>]. Their function in yeast and humans is to guide hydrophobic import substrates that emerge from the TOM complex across the IMS to the respective insertases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref013">13</xref>]. Mitochondrial carrier proteins (MCPs), which usually contain 6 transmembrane spanning domains, and other inner membrane (IM) proteins with internal targeting signals are transferred by small Tims to the TIM22 complex in the IM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref017">17</xref>]. Similarly, β-barrel proteins of the OM are handed over to the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref019">19</xref>]. To this end, small Tim proteins form ring-like hetero-hexameric oligomers. In yeast, two such structures have been characterized consisting of either alternating Tim9/Tim10 or Tim8/Tim13 subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref021">21</xref>]. Moreover, a small fraction of Tim9/Tim10 is associated with Tim12 and binds to the TIM22 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref022">22</xref>]. Similarly, in human mitochondria, two hexameric complexes consisting of Tim9/Tim10a or DDP1 (deafness dystonia peptide 1)/Tim13 as well as a Tim9/Tim10a/Tim10b complex that associates with TIM22 can be differentiated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Like most mitochondrial proteins the small Tims are imported. Their import, similar to that of other small cysteine-rich IMS proteins, is coupled to oxidation of their cysteine residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref025">25</xref>]. Small Tim proteins are first translocated across the OM through the TOM complex. Subsequently they engage with Mia40 of the mitochondrial IMS import and assembly machinery (MIA), which in cooperation with the sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1 promotes oxidation and folding of the proteins before they assemble into the hexameric complexes or associate with the TIM22 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Bioinformatic analysis predicts that the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> genome encodes five classical small Tims, as well as one small Tim-like protein that only contains two cysteine residues instead of the classical twin Cx3C motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref012">12</xref>]. Merely a single one of these proteins has been experimentally analyzed to a very limited extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref011">11</xref>]. Here we present the first detailed experimental analysis of trypanosomal small Tim proteins. It focuses on the three most recently discovered proteins, which includes the atypical small Tim. We demonstrate that mitochondrial import of these proteins depends on the trypanosomal TbERV1 orthologue. Moreover, we show that the three small Tims are subunits of the single trypanosomal TIM complex (approximately 700 kDa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref010">10</xref>], but are also present in soluble complexes of approximately 70 kDa. Ablation of any of the three proteins inhibits normal growth, results in the disappearance of the TIM complex and causes mitochondrial protein import defects. While individual ablation of two of the proteins affects import of TbTim17, a core subunit of the single trypanosomal TIM complex, we provide evidence that one small Tim protein is directly involved in TIM complex assembly.</p>

<p>Using bioinformatics, Gentle et al. detected three trypanosomal small Tim proteins, termed Tim9, Tim10 and Tim8-13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref011">11</xref>]. In a more recent compositional characterization of the single trypanosomal TIM complex, three additional such proteins were discovered. Based on their molecular weight they were termed TbTim11 (Tb927.5.3340), TbTim12 (Tb927.4.3430) and TbTim13 (Tb927.10.11520). The characteristic twin Cx3C motifs that stabilize the hairpin structure of small Tims and target them to the MIA pathway in other eukaryotes are conserved in five of these trypanosomal small Tims [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref011">11</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006550.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). TbTim12 however contains only two cysteines that are separated by 22 amino acids, indicating a lack of the outer disulfide bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref012">12</xref>]. This is a unique feature not found in any other small Tim so far. Sequence comparison of trypanosomal small Tims with their counterparts in yeast and human indicates that it is not possible to assign clear yeast or human orthologues to the newly identified trypanosomal small Tims (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006550.s005">S1 Table</xref>). It has been shown that all trypanosomal small Tims are associated with the single trypanosomal TIM complex, irrespectively of whether it is engaged in MCP import or in import of presequence containing proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref010">10</xref>]. The latter is unexpected as presequence-containing proteins do not require small Tims to cross the IMS.</p>

<p>A) Sequence alignment of putative novel small Tims with known small Tims from trypanosomal mitochondria demonstrates conservation of twin CX3C motifs in all candidates except TbTim12. B) Total cells (T) were treated with 0.015% digitonin to separate a mitochondria enriched fraction (M) from the cytosol-containing supernatant (S). The tagged and endogenous small Tim-like proteins co-fractionate with the mitochondrial marker ATOM40, while the cytosolic protein elongation factor 1A (EF1a) stays in the cytosol. C) Alkaline carbonate extraction at pH 11.5 was performed on digitonin extracted crude mitochondria (M). The resulting pellet fraction (P) contains mitochondrial membrane proteins such as TbTim17 and ATOM40, while the soluble marker protein cytochrome c (Cyt C) is released to the supernatant (S). For this experiment, a cell line co-expressing TbTim11-HA and TbTim13-myc was used. D) Inducible expression of individual tagged small Tim candidates in the background of TbERV1 RNAi. Steady state levels of tagged candidates and endogenous small Tim9 are analyzed by immunoblotting. Cyt C is an IMS protein whose import is independent of the MIA pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref030">30</xref>] and the cytosolic protein EF1a serves as loading control. The lower panel depicts a densitometric quantification of the western blot results. Values were normalized to those of EF1a.

<p>In order to determine the intracellular localization of the three newly discovered small Tim proteins, we established cell lines allowing inducible ectopic expression of C-terminally myc- and HA-tagged versions of the three proteins in various combinations. Cell lines expressing tagged TbTim11 and TbTim13 were subjected to digitonin-based cell fractionation. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006550.g001">Fig 1B</xref> show that both tagged proteins as well as the endogenous TbTim12 co-fractionated with the mitochondrial marker ATOM40. Furthermore, alkaline carbonate extraction at pH 11.5 of such crude mitochondrial fractions demonstrated that all three proteins are soluble proteins and behave identical to the IMS-localized peripheral membrane protein cytochrome C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006550.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Import of small Tim proteins into the IMS of yeast and human mitochondria depends on the MIA pathway. We therefore expect the same to be the case for the trypanosomal proteins. To test this prediction we expressed the tagged versions of TbTim11, TbTim12 and TbTim13 individually in the background of an RNAi cell line allowing for ablation of TbERV1, the only known component of the trypanosomal MIA pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref029">29</xref>]. We have previously shown that inhibition of protein import by ablation of import factors results in rapid degradation of the corresponding non-imported substrate proteins in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref009">9</xref>]. In line with this, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006550.g001">Fig 1D</xref> shows that the levels of all three novel small Tim proteins were drastically reduced upon TbERV1 RNAi induction. The same was true for endogenous Tim9, but not for cytochrome C, which is imported in a MIA-independent fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref030">30</xref>]. This indicates that TbTim11, TbTim13 as well as TbTim12 are substrates of the trypanosomal MIA pathway consistent with a localization in the mitochondrial IMS.</p>

<title>Trypanosomal small Tims form soluble and membrane associated complexes</title>
<p>The initial identification of the novel small Tims was based on a set of reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations targeting TbTim17 and TbTim13. In these experiments all six trypanosomal small Tims were specifically interacting with both bait proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref010">10</xref>]. This stands in contrast to other organisms in which some small Tims exclusively form soluble complexes. Thus, we extended our analysis and performed pulldowns of crude mitochondrial fractions (termed "crude mito") with TbTim11-HA and TbTim12-myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006550.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The results show that the two tagged proteins, the endogenous Tim9 as well as the integral membrane TIM subunits TbTim17, TbTim42 and TimRhom I are enriched in the eluate, whereas CoxIV and ATOM40 essentially remain in the unbound fractions. In summary, these results confirm the reciprocal interaction of the trypanosomal small Tims and their association with the single TIM complex.</p>

<p>A) A cell line co-expressing TbTim11-HA and TbTim12-myc was subjected to co-immunoprecipitation targeting either the HA- (left panel) or the myc-tagged protein (right panel). 5% of the respective lysate (”Load”), 5% of the unbound proteins after IP (“Unbound”) and 100% of the final eluate (“Eluate”) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting. The blots were probed for the tagged small Tims and the TIM components Tim9, TbTim17, TbTim42 and TimRhom I. ATOM40, the central components of the OM translocase, and the cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (CoxIV) served as controls. The asterisk denotes the co-eluted heavy chain of the anti-myc antibody. B) Alkaline carbonate extraction at low (pH 10.7) and high stringency (pH 11.5) was performed on digitonin-extracted crude mitochondria (M). Mitochondrial transmembrane proteins such as TbTim17 and ATOM40 as well as tightly associated proteins are retained in the resulting pellet fraction (P), while the soluble marker protein cytochrome c (Cyt C) is released to the supernatant (S). Cell lines co-expressing TbTim11-HA and TbTim13-myc in either wildtype (WT) or TbTim17 RNAi background (2 days induced) were used to analyze small Tim fractionation in the presence (left panel) or absence of TbTim17 (right panel).</p>

<p>Even though alkaline extraction at pH 11.5 had demonstrated that the novel small Tims are soluble proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006550.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), the interaction with transmembrane components of the TIM complex suggests an association with the mitochondrial inner membrane. In order to analyze this further, we subjected a cell line expressing TbTim11-HA and TbTim13-myc to alkaline extraction at pH 10.7. Under these less stringent conditions, all detectable small Tims were partially found in the insoluble pellet fraction, while the peripheral membrane protein cytochrome C was still exclusively detected in the soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006550.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). However, if the experiment was repeated in a cell line ablated for TbTim17, all analyzed small Tims (TbTim11, TbTim12, TbTim13 and Tim9) were exclusively detected in the soluble fraction, regardless of the extraction conditions used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006550.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). These results confirm that the partial association of small Tims with the mitochondrial IM depends on the presence of the TIM complex. Moreover, they reveal a strong interaction between the small Tims and the integral membrane subunits of the TIM complex that, unlike most typical interactions between peripheral and integral membrane proteins, is in part resistant to highly alkaline conditions.</p>
<p>To assess the organization of the small Tim-containing complexes further, we performed 2D-blue native (BN)/SDS-PAGE analysis using crude mitochondrial fractions solubilized with 1% digitonin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006550.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The three novel small Tims were found in a heterogenous population of protein complexes of approximately 70 kDa, 150 kDa and ≥700 kDa in size. While most of the high molecular weight complexes co-migrate with the ones formed by the transmembrane subunits TbTim17 and TbTim42 of the TIM complex, the smallest complexes might correspond to the soluble 70 kDa hetero-hexameric complexes formed by small Tims in yeast and humans. To assess if any of these complexes are soluble, we repeated the 2D BN-PAGE using mitochondrial subfractions. To that end, we lysed the OM of crude mitochondria using 0.2% digitonin. The released soluble fraction contains proteins of the IMS (termed "soluble fraction"), whereas the remaining pellet fraction consists mainly of IM proteins (termed "membrane fraction"). The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006550.g003">Fig 3B</xref> show that the only small Tim-containing complexes present in the soluble fraction are approximately 70 kDa in size, whereas the higher molecular weight complexes were exclusively found in the membrane fraction. The uniform size of the soluble small Tim complexes of approximately 70 kDa suggests the existence of hexameric assemblies.</p>

<p>A) 2D BN-PAGE analysis of digitonin solubilized crude mitochondrial fractions. Lysates of cell lines expressing TbTim17-myc and one of the HA-tagged novel small Tims were combined and subjected to 6–16.5% BN PAGE in the first dimension, followed by 14% SDS PAGE in the second dimension and finally western blotting. The gels were aligned to the 66 kDa marker. The TIM complex components TbTim17-myc and TbTim42 were detected in all three analyses along with the respective HA-tagged small Tims.

Arrowheads indicate the approximate positions of the high molecular weight complexes containing small Tim proteins. B) 2D BN-PAGE analysis of submitochondrial fractions. The soluble content of the IMS (“soluble fraction”) was separated from the “membrane fraction” using 0.1% digitonin. Solubilized proteins were separately subjected to 2D-BN/SDS-PAGE as described above. Cyt C serves as a marker for soluble IMS proteins. Arrowheads indicate high molecular weight complexes containing small Tim proteins. C) Co-immunoprecipitation from submitochondrial fractions targeting myc-tagged TbTim13. A cell line co-expressing TbTim11-HA and TbTim13-myc was used to prepare a crude mitochondrial fraction or a “soluble fraction” containing IMS proteins by differential digitonin extraction. 5% of the initial crude mitochondrial fraction (M) and the same amounts of “Load”, “Unbound” and “Eluate” as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006550.g002">Fig 2A</xref> were separated on SDS-PAGE and subjected to western blotting. The TIM complex component TbTim17 as well as the small Tims Tim9 and TbTim12 were detected by specific antibodies along with the HA- and myc-tagged other small Tims. The IMS protein Cyt C and the outer membrane protein VDAC were detected to confirm proper fractionation.

<title>Composition of small Tim complexes</title>
<p>Next, we separately analyzed the composition of the soluble and membrane-associated complexes formed by the novel small Tims by co-immunoprecipitations based on the submitochondrial fractions described above. Combination cell lines expressing two differently tagged small Tims and the use of peptide antibodies against endogenous Tim9 and TbTim12 allowed us to probe for up to 4 small Tims in a single pulldown experiment. The results show that in pulldowns of the soluble fraction all detectable small Tims co-precipitate with either TbTim13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006550.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) or TbTim12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006550.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). The only difference observed in pulldowns of the respective solubilized crude mitochondria was that also TbTim17 was recovered. This demonstrates that there are at least two major populations of trypanosomal small Tim complexes, soluble ones in the IMS which contain all small Tims but no other TIM complex subunits, and another one in which all small Tims are associated with the TIM complex of the inner membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>To analyze the composition of the soluble small TIM complexes in more detail, we performed SILAC-based co-immunoprecipitation experiments using the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> cell lines allowing inducible, ectopic expression of C-terminally HA-tagged versions of TbTim11, TbTim12 and TbTim13, respectively. Each of these cell lines was grown in the presence or absence of tetracycline and isotopically-labeled heavy or light lysine and arginine respectively. Subsequently, identical cell numbers of both populations were mixed, crude mitochondria were prepared and their OM was lysed with 0.2% of digitonin. The resulting fractions containing the soluble small Tim-containing complexes were subjected to immunoprecipitations using anti-HA antibodies and analyzed by quantitative MS. The results yield a consistent picture: in all three cases all six small Tims were highly enriched in the IPs and no other significantly enriched proteins were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006550.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006550.s006">S2 Table</xref>).</p>

<p>The molecular weight of the small Tim-containing complexes of close to 70 kDa suggests they are present in hexameric assemblies. However, the uniform recovery of all six small Tims in all pull down experiments excludes that the postulated hexamers, as in yeast and mammals, are formed by specific pairs of small Tims. Two alternative quaternary structures that are consistent with the experimental evidence would be: i) that all six small Tims build a single defined hexamer consisting of six different subunits, or ii) that the six different small Tim subunits form promiscuous hexamers without defined subunit compositions. Should a single defined hexamer exist we would expect that ablation of any of the six small Tim subunits would result in the collapse of the hexamer. However, in the case of heterogeneous hexamers ablation of a single Tim subunit would not affect hexamer formation as its absence would be compensated for by the other members of the small Tim protein family. 2D BN-PAGE analysis of the soluble complexes in uninduced and induced TbTim11, TbTim12 and TbTim13-RNAi cell lines favours the second model, since ablation of the corresponding small Tims does not significantly affect the soluble complexes containing other small Tim proteins that were not targeted by the RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006550.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>TbTim17 belongs to the Tim17/22/23 protein family, which in yeast and humans requires small Tim chaperones for its import into mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref033">33</xref>]. In line with this, the steady state levels of TbTim17 are strongly decreased upon ablation of RNAi against TbTim11 and TbTim12 suggesting that the two proteins are involved in import of TbTim17. In absence of TbTim13, however, the steady levels of TbTim17 remain essentially constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006550.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). The abundance of TimRhom I, another subunit of the TIM complex, is slightly reduced in the TbTim11-RNAi cell line although not to the same extent than TbTim17. In the TbTim12 and TbTim13 RNAi cell lines on the other hand the levels of TimRhom I remain essentially unchanged indicating that the protein is stable in the absence of the TIM complex.</p>
<p>In order to investigate the function of TbTim13 in more detail we analyzed the global changes in the mitochondrial proteome that were caused by its ablation. A quantitative MS analysis of protein levels in crude mitochondrial fractions of induced versus uninduced TbTim13 RNAi cells demonstrated significantly reduced levels (≥1.5 fold, p-value ≤ 0.05) of 443 proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006550.s007">S3 Table</xref>).

<p>For the core subunit TbTim17, alkaline carbonate extraction confirmed that the protein is still inserted into the inner membrane in the absence of TbTim13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006550.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Thus, these results strongly suggest that TbTim13, in contrast to TbTim11 and TbTim12, is directly required for the assembly and/or maintenance of the trypanosomal TIM complex but not for import of its subunits. This also explains, why its ablation essentially phenocopies the effects seen after ablation of TbTim17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>We furthermore investigated the fate of two groups of proteins which are typical substrates of small Tim chaperones in other organisms, namely MCPs and β-barrel proteins. Almost half of the detected MCPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref035">35</xref>] were found to be significantly decreased in the TbTim13 RNAi cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006550.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). However, it is not possible to distinguish whether this phenotype is caused by impairment of the predicted chaperone function of TbTim13 or due to the more direct role it plays in TIM complex assembly and/or maintenance.</p>
<p>The biogenesis of β-barrel proteins like ATOM40 or VDAC, on the other hand, is independent of TbTim17 and thus the slightly reduced abundance we observed for all trypanosomal β-barrel proteins could be a direct effect of TbTim13 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006550.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). This is consistent with the idea that TbTim13 may facilitate the transfer of β-barrel protein across the IMS to the SAM complex. However, the observed reductions are too small to be reflected in the amounts of assembled ATOM40 and VDAC that are detected on the BN-PAGE analysis of the TbTim13 RNAi cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006550.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). The same was observed for the RNAi cell lines targeting TbTim11 and TbTim12.</p>

<p>The small Tim family of IMS-localized chaperones belongs to the most conserved components of the mitochondrial protein import system. They are found in all mitochondria-containing eukaryotes, even in trypanosomes which contain highly diverged OM and IM protein translocases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref004">4</xref>]. Here we show that the small Tim protein family in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> includes six members, all of which are implicated in mitochondrial protein import [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref011">11</xref>]. One of them, TbTim12, is unusual since it has an incomplete Cx3C small Tim signature motif and thus can only be stabilized by a single intramolecular disulfide bond. Nevertheless, TbTim12 clearly belongs to the small Tim family since its ablation causes the same defects that are observed in knockdown cell lines targeting classical small Tims [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref011">11</xref>]. Moreover, TbTim12 is conserved throughout kinetoplastids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref012">12</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that similar, unusual small Tims might exist in other organisms but have escaped detection precisely because they lack complete small Tims signature domains. Also, TbTim11 and TbTim13 were not identified in previous bioinformatic analyses, even though they contain the expected Cx3C motifs. The probable reason in this case is that their Cx3C motifs are spaced by more than 16 residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The trypanosomal small Tims also differ from other members of this protein family regarding the complexes they form. All six trypanosomal small Tims were found to associate with the single trypanosomal TIM complex, irrespective of whether it is engaged in MCP import or in import of presequence-containing proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref010">10</xref>]. Since presequence-containing proteins generally are less hydrophobic than MCPs or other small Tim substrates, they do not rely on chaperones for the passage of the aqueous IMS. In line with this, it was not possible to show an interaction between small Tims of yeast or human and the respective presequence translocase, the TIM23 complex, even when using highly sensitive SILAC-based quantitative MS of co-immunoprecipitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref038">38</xref>]. Thus, the association of all six small Tims with the single trypanosomal TIM complex that is in the process of translocating presequence-containing substrates is very unusual.</p>
<p>Besides the TIM complex-associated fraction of small Tims, we demonstrated that all small Tims analyzed in our study (Tim9, TbTim11, TbTim12 and TbTim13) are also present in soluble complexes of approximately 70 kDa in mass. This suggests that trypanosomal small Tims form soluble hetero-hexameric assemblies just as small Tims in other organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref024">24</xref>]. However, the fact that all three SILAC pulldown experiments recover all six members of the small Tim protein family indicates that the postulated hexamers, unlike the ones in yeast and human, are not composed of specific pairs of small Tims. Moreover, in all cases tested, ablation of specific small Tim proteins did not result in the disappearance of the soluble, putative hexameric complexes containing other small Tim subunits. These results are most easily explained by the existence of multiple heterogeneous complexes of highly variable small Tim compositions. Thus, regarding hexamer formation, the small Tims may have at least in part redundant functions. The fact that at least four out of the six trypanosomal small Tims are individually essential for normal growth suggests that their essential function is not linked to the soluble complexes they form but to their tight association with the membrane integrated TIM translocase.</p>
<p>Most organisms contain a whole suite of small Tim proteins. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> has five such proteins, whereas humans and trypanosomes have six members of this protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref023">23</xref>]. The parasitic apicomplexan <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> is an interesting case. It has mitosomes that lack organellar DNA, are not able to perform oxidative phosphorylation and have a highly reduced proteome. A bioinformatic analysis shows that it underwent reductive evolution resulting in a rudimentary mitochondrial protein import system which contains a single small Tim only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref039">39</xref>]. Interestingly, this protein was able to form homo-hexameric assemblies. Moreover, even when imported into the IMS of yeast, where it would have the opportunity to interact with endogenous yeast small Tims, it only assembled with itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref039">39</xref>]. Thus, there appear to be three types of small Tim hexamers in nature: i) the most simple one found in <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> consisting of a single small Tim subunit only, ii) the standard hexamers formed by two different small Tims arranged in alternating order in yeast and mammals and iii) the small Tim hexamers of trypanosomes which likely have highly variable subunit compositions. This suggests that while the subunits of the soluble IMS chaperone complexes all belong to the conserved small Tim protein family, the quaternary structure formed by them is quite variable in different species.</p>
<p>We functionally analyzed TbTim11, TbTim12 and TbTim13 by RNAi-mediated knockdown. In general, all three cell lines were found to phenocopy the mitochondrial defects observed in TbTim17 RNAi. This is explained by the fact that ablation of any of the three small Tims caused the rapid disappearance of the TIM complex. In the case of TbTim11 and TbTim12 we could demonstrate that the two proteins are required for import of TbTim17, a core component of the TIM complex. This is in agreement with results from yeast and human mitochondria where an involvement of small Tims in import of members of the Tim17/22/23 has repeatedly been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006550.ref033">33</xref>]. Ablation of TbTim13 however does not affect import of TbTim17 or of other integral membrane subunits of the TIM complex, indicating that it plays a direct role in the assembly and/or maintenance of the TIM complex. This is a non-canonical function of small Tim proteins that has not been reported before.</p>
<p>In summary, while the number and primary structure of trypanosomal small Tims—except for TbTim12 which lacks a complete twin Cx3C motif—are similar to small Tims of other organisms, the quaternary structure of their complexes is very different. Moreover, at least one trypanosomal small Tim has a non-canonical function in TIM complex biogenesis, emphasizing the need to study this important protein family in non-standard model systems that are not closely related to yeast and mammals.</p>
