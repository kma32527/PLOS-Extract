<abstract>
<p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is the major causative agent of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in children, causing severe clinical outcomes and even death. Here, we report an important role of the highly conserved alanine residue at position 107 in the capsid protein VP1 (VP1<sup>A107</sup>) in the efficient replication of EV71. Substitutional mutations of VP1<sup>A107</sup> significantly diminish viral growth kinetics without significant effect on viral entry, expression of viral genes and viral production. The results of mechanistic studies reveal that VP1<sup>A107</sup> regulates the efficient cleavage of the VP0 precursor during EV71 assembly, which is required, in the next round of infection, for the transformation of the mature virion (160S) into an intermediate or A-particle (135S), a key step of virus uncoating. Furthermore, the results of molecular dynamic simulations and hydrogen-bond networks analysis of VP1<sup>A107</sup> suggest that flexibility of the VP1 BC loop or the region surrounding the VP1<sup>107</sup> residue directly correlates with viral infectivity. It is possible that sufficient flexibility of the region surrounding the VP1<sup>107</sup> residue favors VP0 conformational change that is required for the efficient cleavage of VP0 as well as subsequent viral uncoating and viral replication. Taken together, our data reveal the structural role of the highly conserved VP1<sup>A107</sup> in regulating EV71 maturation. Characterization of this novel determinant of EV71 virulence would promote the study on pathogenesis of Enteroviruses.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71) causes hand, foot and mouth disease in children. In this work, we have discovered, for the first time, that the alanine residue at position 107 of the capsid protein VP1 (VP1<sup>A107</sup>), which is present in almost all EV71 strains, plays an important role in the replication of EV71, since mutation of VP1<sup>A107</sup> significantly impairs viral growth. Detailed mechanistic studies reveal that VP1<sup>A107</sup> determines the efficient cleavage of the VP0 precursor during EV71 assembly, and subsequent virion uncoating in the next round of viral infection. We also observed that flexibility of the VP1 BC loop or the VP1<sup>A107</sup> region directly associates with viral infectivity. Collectively, our data suggest a structural role of the highly conserved VP1<sup>A107</sup> residue in regulating viral maturation, which is instrumental for the viral uncoating and viral replication. Discovery of this novel determinant of EV71 virulence would promote the study on pathogenesis of Enteroviruses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a small, non-enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus, a member of the human enterovirus species A in the Enterovirus genus, the Picornaviridae family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref001">1</xref>]. This virus is the major causative agent of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), a febrile illness that commonly affects young children. Although often mild and self-limiting, EV71 infection may cause severe diseases including poliomyelitis-like paralysis, brainstem encephalitis and fatal cardiorespiratory failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref004">4</xref>]. In recent decades, EV71 outbreaks in the Asia-Pacific region have impacted millions of children, and have caused thousands of deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>The EV71 genome is protected by an icosahedrally symmetric capsid that is made of 60 copies of viral capsid proteins VP1 and VP3 and an average of 58 to 59 copies of capsid proteins VP2 and VP4, in addition to 1 to 2 copies of their capsid precursor protein VP0. During virus assembly, the viral capsid precursor P1 is firstly cleaved to yield VP0 (36 kDa), VP1 (32 kDa) and VP3 (27 kDa), forming a heterotrimer protomer. Five protomers then join together to form the pentameric assembly subunit, twelve of which self-assemble into an empty particle named as procapsid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref010">10</xref>]. Procapsids comprise 60 copies of VP0, VP1 and VP3, can be sedimentated as an 80S complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref011">11</xref>]. Packaging of the genomic RNA into the procapsid leads to the formation of the provirion concurrent with the cleavage of VP0 into VP2 (28 kDa) and VP4 (8 kDa), resulting in the formation of the mature virions that are sedimentated as 160S complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref012">12</xref>]. VP0 cleavage, also called maturation cleavage, is hypothesized to be an autocatalytic event that results from the interactions between the structural proteins and the RNA genome during viral RNA encapsidation. This process is essential for virion stability and infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Structural studies have revealed the processes that occur during enterovirus infection of cells. Cellular receptors first attach to the virus capsids, often binding to a canyon-like cavity surrounding the five-fold axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref016">16</xref>]. This interaction triggers conformational changes in the viral capsid, resulting in the formation of an expanded intermediate particle, referred to as A-particle with a sediment value of 135S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref017">17</xref>]. During the expansion process, the N terminus of VP1 is externalized, and VP4 is expelled from the capsid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref019">19</xref>]. These changes poise the particle for genome release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref020">20</xref>]. Subsequently, a second and unknown trigger causes the genome to egress via a channel near the icosahedral two-fold axis of symmetry, leaving behind an empty capsid shell containing VP1, VP2 and VP3, with a sediment value of about 80S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref017">17</xref>]. This series of conformational changes during the uncoating process imply that the cleavage efficiency of VP0 into VP2 and VP4 determines the conversion of A-particles from the mature virions as well as the subsequent release of viral genomic RNA.</p>
<p>EV71 is genetically diverse. For example, the VP1 gene undergoes an estimated mutation rate of 4.2–4.5×10<sup>−3</sup> substitutions per site year<sup>-1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref021">21</xref>]. In addition, recombination events also play an important role in the emergence of EV71 subgenogroups with different virulence potentials and disease associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref023">23</xref>]. In our previous work, we isolated the EV71-HP strain that belongs to genotype C4, from a HFMD patient with severe neurological complications during the 2008 EV71 epidemic in Anhui province of South China. By continuous multiple passages of this HP strain in Vero cells, we isolated the cell adapted strain, named EV71-CCA. We also found that growth of the CCA strain is significantly impaired in cell culture compared to the parental strain HP. In this study, we have further characterized the CCA strain and identified the genetic determinant behind the attenuated virulence of the CCA strain. A single amino acid alanine at position 107 in the VP1 protein, when changed to threonine, in the CCA strain, dramatically diminishes EV71 replication as a result of impaired maturation cleavage of the VP0 protein during EV71 assembly and subsequent viral uncoating.</p>

<title>EV71-CCA exhibits slower replication kinetics compared with the parental strain EV71-HP</title>
<p>We first examined the replication capability of both EV71-HP and EV71-CCA strains by comparing their growth kinetics and plaque formation in Vero cells. After transfecting Vero cells with equal amounts of <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed full-length viral RNA, both strains were able to induce cytopathic effect (CPE) 24 hours after transfection. However, a significant delay was observed for EV71-CCA to cause CPE compared with EV71-HP. For example, CPE was observed in 100% of Vero cells 3 days after transfection with the EV71-HP RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), whereas it took 7 days for the EV71-CCA strain to cause CPE in all cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006625.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This suggests a lower infectivity of EV71-CCA than EV71-HP. When the titers of viruses were determined in plaque assays, transfection of the EV71-HP RNA produced approximate 10<sup>4</sup> fold more infectious viruses than EV71-CCA at 24 and 48 hours post transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). This difference gradually diminished at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In addition, EV71-CCA displayed a pinpoint-plaque phenotype, whereas EV71-HP exhibited a large-plaque phenotype after 7 days of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The mean plaque size of both strains was determined by sampling 20 plaques for each virus, and the results showed that the mean diameter of EV71-HP plaques is approximately 2-fold greater than that of EV71-CCA plaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate a significant defect in the replication of EV71-CCA compared to EV71-HP.</p>

<p>In order to determine the viral gene(s) that underline the distinct replication kinetics of the EV71-HP and EV71-CCA viruses, we swapped the genomic sequences between these two viruses and generated a panel of chimeric viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Replication capacities of these viruses were assessed on the basis of the cytopathic effects and virus titers 48 hours after transfection of these viral RNA into Vero cells. EV71-HP was scored as the “Rapid type” relative to EV71-CCA that represented the “Slow type”, because much higher titer and faster formation of CPE were observed for EV71-HP. Among the chimeric viruses, exchange of the 5’UTR, the 3’ terminal region from 3C to 3’UTR region or the non-structural protein coding region (NS) from 2A to 3B region had no significant effect on the ability of parental strains to induce CPE, these include viruses HP(CCA-5’UTR)/CCA(HP-5’UTR), HP(CCA-3’)/CCA(HP-3’) and HP(CCA- NS)/CCA(HP-NS). However, exchange of the P1 region resulted in a complete switching of the infection phenotype of the parental viruses, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g002">Fig 2B</xref> that the CCA(HP-P1) virus exhibited a rapid growth phenotype whereas the HP(CCA-P1) virus became a slow one. Similar observation was made for viruses HP(CCA-CDS) and CCA(HP-CDS) that also had the P1 region swapped. These results indicate that the P1 region, which encodes viral proteins VP1 to VP4, determines the different growth phenotypes of EV71-HP and EV71-CCA.</p>

<title>The A107 amino acid in VP1 is primarily responsible for the different replication kinetics of viruses EV71-HP and EV71-CCA</title>
<p>We next aligned the sequences of the P1 protein region between EV71-HP and EV71-CCA, and found three non-conservative amino acid mutations, including leucine (HP)/proline (CCA) at position 329 in capsid protein VP3, alanine (HP)/threonine (CCA) at positions 672 and 854 in capsid protein VP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In order to determine which of these three mutations have impaired the replication of EV71-CCA, we swapped these amino acid residues in EV71-HP and EV71-CCA by site-directed mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) and generated 6 recombinant viruses. Replication of these viruses was examined by recording CPE and determining virus titers 48 hours post transfection of viral RNA into Vero cells. The results showed that mutating the alanine residue at position 672 to threonine in EV71-HP (named HP(A672T)) dramatically delayed viral replication and caused a great reduction in virus titer (3.50 –lgTCID<sub>50</sub>/ml, P&lt;0.01). Conversely, changing the T672 to A672 in EV71-CCA increased viral titer from the original value of 2.00 –lgTCID<sub>50</sub>/ml to 6.00 –lgTCID<sub>50</sub>/ml (P&lt;0.01), a level observed for the EV71-HP virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). In contrast, mutating the amino acids at position 329 or 854 did not affect virus titer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). These results demonstrate that the amino acid substitution at position 672 of the polyprotein (position 107 in the VP1 capsid protein, VP1<sup>A107</sup>) has undermined the replication of EV71-CCA.</p>

<title>The role of the VP1<sup>107</sup> residue in viral replication</title>
<p>We next asked which stage of EV71 replication is affected by the A107T mutation in VP1. To this end, equal amounts of full-length RNA of EV71-HP and EV71-CCA were transfected into Vero cells. The neutralizing antibody was then added into cell culture in order to block a second round of viral infection and thus stop viral spread. Viral replication was monitored by measuring the capsid protein VP1 in Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Similar levels of VP1 were observed for both EV71-HP and EV71-CCA in the presence of neutralizing antibody, whereas in the absence of neutralizing antibody transfection of the EV71-HP RNA led to the expression of more than 4-fold more VP1 than that by EV71-CCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). We also collected and purified viral particles in the equal volumes of supernatants from the virus-producing cells that had been treated with neutralizing antibody, and determined the amounts of viral particles by Western blot using antibody specific for VP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Similar levels of EV71-HP and EV71-CCA particles were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). These data suggest that the A107T mutation in VP1 does not affect viral gene expression, or the levels of virus particle production, but rather impairs the infection of new target cells by the progeny EV71-CCA particles, thus suppressing virus spread.</p>

<p>In order to identify the defect(s) that have led to the impaired infectivity of the EV71-CCA particles, we first quantified viral genomic RNA and the amount of capsid protein in the EV71-HP and EV71-CCA virions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006625.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, the ratio of genome RNA copies to capsid protein in EV71-CCA was higher than that of EV71-HP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g004">Fig 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>VP1 capsid protein plays a central role in the attachment of EV71 virions to host receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref024">24</xref>]. We thus measured the cell attachment of EV71-HP and EV71-CCA using a cell-ELISA as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref025">25</xref>]. Similar amounts of both viruses were found bound to the cell surface using different MOI of viruses, suggesting no significant difference in cell attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). This observation was further verified by the data of flow cytometry. The signals of EV71-HP (in red line) and EV71-CCA (in black line) overlapped completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g004">Fig 4G</xref>), showing comparable amounts of cell attached virions for both viruses.</p>
<p>Next, we further investigated whether the EV71-HP and EV71-CCA viruses were internalized by cells at different rates. Vero cells were inoculated with equal amounts of these two viruses. Following synchronized attachment to cells at 4°C and cell internalization at 37°C, virions that did not enter the cells were removed by digestion with subtilisin. VP1 protein of the internalized virions was analyzed by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). The results showed similar levels of internalized VP1 protein for both viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g004">Fig 4I</xref>), indicating that the cell internalization of EV71-CCA is not impaired compared to EV71-HP. Taken together, these results suggest that the A107T mutation in VP1 affects a step of viral entry after cell internalization of virus particles.</p>

<title>Uncoating of EV71-CCA is delayed compared to EV71-HP</title>
<p>EV71 virion uncoating after its entry is a prerequisite for productive infection, enabling the release of viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm. EV71 uncoating involves conformational changes in capsid, generating 3 types of virus particles: the mature virions sedimentated at 160S, the A-particles sedimentated at 135S and the empty viral particles sedimentated at 80S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref018">18</xref>]. The first step of this dynamic process is conversion of the mature virion (160S) into an expanded intermediate or A-particle (135S), which is characterized by the release of a pocket factor to open the two-fold symmetry axis channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref017">17</xref>]. Then, the A-particle is converted into the empty capsid (80S), which is accompanied by the release of the RNA genome into the cytoplasm. To compare the uncoating of EV71-HP and EV71-CCA, we first separated the mature virions and the A-particles of both strains by ultracentrifugation through a 15%-35% discontinuous sucrose gradient. For each fraction, the virion-associated genomic RNA was determined by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) and the pelleted capsid protein by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Results of both experiments revealed two peaks of RNA-containing virions in fractions 8 to 10 (135S) and fractions 12 to 14 (160S), which correspond to the A-particles and mature virions, respectively. Notably, in 160S fractions, the amounts of both virion-associated genome RNA and viral protein of EV71-HP were less than those of EV71-CCA, while a reverse trend was found in 135S fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g005">Fig 5A and 5C</xref>). This suggests a defect in uncoating for EV71-CCA compared with EV71-HP, which is reflected in the accumulated 160S particles of EV71-CCA. For further detailed comparison between both strains in uncoating efficiency, gradients were fractionated in small volume of aliquots (0.25 ml), then genomic RNA in both 135S and 160S particles were quantified and used to determine amount of different forms of particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). The area under the curve (AUC) represents the amount of virus particles. The ratio of the amount of 135S particles to the 160S particles was used to assess the uncoating efficiency of EV71. The results showed an approximate 2-fold decrease in this ratio for EV71-CCA compared with EV71-HP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), suggesting that the uncoating efficiency of the EV71-HP strain is significantly higher than that of the EV71-CCA strain (P&lt;0.01).</p>

<title>The A107 residue in VP1 regulates the cleavage of precursor VP0 and virion maturation</title>
<p>We noted a considerably higher amount of VP0 protein in the mature virions of the EV71-CCA strain compared to the EV71-HP strain that were sedimentated to fractions 12 to 14 (160S) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The precursor VP0 protein is primarily associated with the procapsids and provirions, and is processed into VP2 and VP4 during viral assembly and maturation, an auto-catalysis process as a result of the interactions between the viral structural proteins and viral RNA genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref013">13</xref>]. The accumulation of VP0 in the mature virions indicates incomplete VP0 cleavage and impaired virion maturation. To further examine the difference in VP0 cleavage efficiency between the EV71-HP and the EV71-CCA strain, fractions 12 to 14 containing the mature virions (160S) for both strains were analyzed in the same Western blot using the antibody recognizing both VP0 and VP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The amounts of VP0 and VP2 were determined and used to calculate the ratio of VP0 vs VP2 proteins, the values reflect the relative amount of VP0 in the mature virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g006">Fig 6B</xref> show that the relative amount of VP0 in the 160S fractions of the EV71-CCA strain is 6-fold higher than that of the EV71-HP strain. We further verified the significant increase in VP0 in the mature EV71-CCA particles by protein quantitative analysis using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>). To exclude the possibility that the antigenicity of the commercial VP0 antibody used is different against the VP0/VP2 from CCA strain and HP strain, we have visualized viral protein in 160S fractions of HP and CCA strains with a silver staining method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006625.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The result shows significantly increased amount of VP0 as well as VP0/VP2 ratio in CCA strain than HP strain. In agreement with western blot analysis, this suggests an inefficient VP0 cleavage in CCA strain. These results collectively suggest that the impairment in VP0 cleavage and virion maturation occurs during assembly of the EV71-CCA strain. Since the mature VP4 protein is expelled from viral capsid during the formation of the A-particle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref019">19</xref>], we propose that the impaired maturation of EV71 virions as a result of the inefficient cleavage of VP0 into VP2 and VP4 hinders the conversion of mature particles (160S) to A-particles (135S) during viral uncoating, ultimately diminishing viral infectivity.</p>

<p>To further demonstrate that the defect in VP0 cleavage in EV71-CCA is caused by the A107T mutation in VP1, we examined the cleavage of VP0 in viruses CCA (T672A) and HP (A672T), both viruses have shown remarkable change in viral infectivity by a single amino acid substitution at VP1<sup>107</sup> compared to their parental strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g003">Fig 3</xref>). These two mutated viruses and their parental strains were separated in a 15%-35% discontinuous sucrose gradient to collect the 160S particles, which were examined in Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). The quantitative analysis of western blot data revealed a significant increase in the ratio of VP0 to VP2 in HP(A672T) compared with its parental strain, which contrasts a remarkable decrease in the ratio for CCA(T672A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). This correlation between viral infectivity and the cleavage of VP0 suggests that the VP1<sup>A107</sup> residue contributes to viral infectivity by regulating the cleavage of VP0 and subsequent viral uncoating.</p>
<p>EV71 virion uncoating is a prerequisite for enabling the release of viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm. Due to the insufficient VP0 cleavage, the inefficient uncoating of the EV71-CCA strain shall result in delayed genomic RNA release and consequently RNA replication. In agreement with the hypothesis, we found that RNA replication in EV71-CCA was delayed in the early stage of the infection compared with that of EV71-HP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). This provide further evidence supporting the defect of EV71-CCA in viral uncoating process.</p>

<p>To further investigate the function of the VP1<sup>A107</sup> residue, we substituted this amino acid for other residues with different electrostatic potential and the side chain in both EV71-HP and EV71-CCA strain and examined the replication of these viral mutants. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g007">Fig 7C</xref> show that among all the amino acids tested, A107 gave rise to the highest viral titers for both the EV71-HP and the EV71-CCA strain, the positively charged residues K and R were much less well tolerated at this position by the virus compared to negatively charged E and D, which explains the high conservation of the alanine amino acid at position 107 in VP1.</p>
<p>We next investigated the structural mechanism underlying the replication ability of the above VP1 mutated viruses through MD simulations of EV71-HP (A107) and the A107T, A107R, A107D and A107S mutants. In the analysis, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of the backbone Cα atoms were calculated and plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g007">Fig 7D</xref>. Root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) values provide details on fluctuation of each residue over simulation time, reflecting the effect of different substitutions on the structural stability of the region tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref026">26</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g007">Fig 7E</xref>, the terminal regions (residues 73–78 and 278–297), the BC loop, and the GH loop exhibited very high RMSF values in all strains. Notably, the RMSF values of residues 160–175 of the EF loop (highlighted in yellow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) for the EV71-HP strain (cyan plot, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g007">Fig 7E</xref>) are greater than those of other mutants, indicating that more unstable conformations were adopted by this loop in the EV71-HP strain. We therefore propose that a flexible conformation of the EF loop or the surrounding region contributes to efficient maturation and replication of EV71 virions.</p>

<title>Analysis of hydrogen-bond networks associated with the VP1<sup>A107</sup> residue</title>
<p>In addition to viral infectious titers, we also examined the growth phenotypes of mutant viruses in cultured cells by monitoring the induction of CPE. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, all the strains that had higher than 4 of -lgTCID<sub>50</sub>/ml exhibited rapid growth phenotype, including A, S, E and D at VP1<sup>107</sup> in both the EV71-HP and EV71-CCA strains. However, substitution of VP1<sup>107</sup> for T, K and R resulted in a slow growth phenotype, and these mutants produced lower than 3 of -lgTCID<sub>50</sub>/ml. These data indicate that viral replication ability is well correlated with viral growth phenotype. Substitution of the VP1<sup>107</sup> residue generated significant variations in viral infectious titers and viral growth phenotypes, which provides an opportunity to explore the structural basis for the replication ability of these various mutants. However, the RMSF analysis used above did not reveal much difference for most of substitutional mutants except for A107. As the hydrogen-bond interaction plays a crucial role for the structure and function of protein, we further investigated the hydrogen-bond networks associated with the VP1<sup>107</sup> residue for each amino acid substitution. The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006625.t001">Table 1</xref> show that the backbone hydrogen bonds formed between residues 107 and V235 are conserved in EV71-HP and all the tested mutations of VP1, indicating their importance in the structural stability. Notably, the analysis data showed that the number and occupancy of hydrogen-bonds for these substitutions increased concurrent with decrease in viral replication. To better visualize the results, we added together all occupancy of hydrogen bonds between each pair of residues, and then classified them into three groups, including high, middle, low possibility of hydrogen bonding if total sum of occupancy is &gt;100%, 100–50% and &lt;50%, respectively. Next, we calculated the total number of hydrogen bonds for each substitution by setting the weighting coefficient of high, middle, low possibility of hydrogen bonding as 1, 0.5 and 0.1, respectively. This number is used to assess the stability of the region surrounding the VP1<sup>107</sup> residue, and the data are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g007">Fig 7F</xref>, showing that the total number of hydrogen bonds for each substitution is inversely correlated to the infectious titers of the mutated viruses. This observation further supports the hypothesis that a flexible conformation of the region surrounding the VP1<sup>107</sup> residue is required for efficient replication of EV71.</p>

<p>Interestingly, D94 is involved in hydrogen-bonding only in the two mutants that exhibited slow growth phenotype. For A107T, the side-chain hydroxyl group of T107 forms strong H-bond with the main chain oxygen atom of D94 with the percentage occupancy of 71% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g007">Fig 7G</xref>, left). For A107R, both the main chain and side chain oxygen atoms of D94 form hydrogen bonds with the guanidinium moiety of R107 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g007">Fig 7G</xref>, right). When the main chain H-bond disappears, the side chain one still present. Therefore, the H-bond probability between D94 and R107 is inferred higher than 76%. Those hydrogen bonds are typically present in the middle of the trajectory. In contrast, we did not observe any H-bond interactions involving D94 for VP1 mutants that exhibit rapid growth phenotype. When mutated to aspartic acid, the carboxylate oxygen atoms of D107 formed H-bonds with the backbone N-H of N108. Although S107 interacted with the Y106, N108 and N102 residues adjacent to it, the percentage occupancy of these H-bonds in trajectories is very low. These results suggest that the H-bonds involving residue D94 for the A107T and A107R mutants significantly enhance the stability of the two β-sheets linked by the BC loop, resulting in impaired replication ability and slow viral growth.</p>
<p>Finally, we examined the VP0 cleavage of these mutants tested above. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g007">Fig 7H</xref>, the VP0 content is increased accompanied with decreased viral replication ability. This provides biochemical evidence supporting the conclusion from MD simulation and hydrogen-bond networks analysis, and the hypothesis that a flexible conformation of the region surrounding the VP1<sup>107</sup> residue is required for efficient VP0 cleavage and virion maturation of EV71.</p>

<sec id="sec011" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A number of virulence determinants for EV71 have been reported, which may influence virus assembly, attachment, replication, or cell tropism. In this study, we have identified a single amino acid A107 in VP1 as the genetic determinant of viral virulence that functions through regulating viral maturation. This A107 in VP1 is conserved in the 3777 EV71 strains that are available in the GenBank database. This high conservation of VP1<sup>A107</sup>, regardless of different EV71 lineages, indicates the important function of this residue in EV71 replication.</p>
<p>Our mechanistic studies showed that mutation of VP1<sup>A107</sup> impairs the cleavage of capsid precursor protein VP0, which occurs at the final stage of enterovirus assembly, involving an inward radial collapse of the provirion to yield the mature virus particle. Infectivity analysis showed that a single amino acid substitution (A to T) at VP1<sup>107</sup> caused slow viral growth and dramatically reduced virus titer (3.50 –lgTCID<sub>50</sub>/ml), concurrent with impaired VP0 cleavage. This correlation between diminished viral infectivity and impaired cleavage of VP0 among the substitutions of the VP1<sup>107</sup> residue further strengthens the important role of VP0 cleavage in viral infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>Cleavage of VP0 has also been reported being critical for the infectivity of other picornaviruses by regulating the assembly of virions and stability of mature particles. Impaired cleavage of VP0 in Poliovirus causes accumulation of the assembly intermediates, i.e., empty-capsid-like structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref013">13</xref>] and provirions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref012">12</xref>], while some substitution mutations at VP2<sup>195</sup> result in the assembly of a highly unstable 150S virus particle resembling mature virions except carrying the uncleaved VP0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref028">28</xref>]. Herein, we found that the defective VP0 cleavage in the EV71-CCA strain hinders the conformational conversion from the 160S virions to the 135S A-particles, suggesting an important role of VP0 cleavage in EV71 uncoating. One model for picornavirus uncoating describes that binding of viral receptor triggers conformational changes of the capsid proteins, leading to the formation of the expanded A-particle with a sediment value of 135S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref018">18</xref>]. During the expansion process, VP4 is expelled from the capsid, allowing the formation of a gateway to release viral genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref017">17</xref>]. Therefore, the failure to dissociate VP4 from the 160S virions, due to inefficient cleavage of VP0, may impair the formation of A-particles in the VP1<sup>107</sup> mutated virus. The defective uncoating consequently prevents release of genomic RNA, resulting in reduction in viral replication. In agreement with this, we found that RNA replication in EV71-CCA was delayed in the early stage of the infection compared with that of EV71-HP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g006">Fig 6G</xref>).</p>
<p>Currently, the mechanism underlying the cleavage of VP0 in EV71 is largely unknown. Based on the study of Poliovirus, two conserved amino acids, VP2-195H and VP2-194P, in the immediate vicinity of the scissile bond as well as two bound water molecules execute the maturation cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref013">13</xref>]. The imidazole ring of VP2-195H is placed in an appropriate spatial configuration to activate the local water molecules due to a tight bend in the main chain formed by VP2-194P, which leads to a nucleophilic attack of the scissile bond to catalyze the hydrolysis of the peptide bond. The cleavage site in VP0 is located at the rim of a large trefoil-shaped hydrophobic depression centered on the particle three-fold axis in the inner surface of the empty capsid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref013">13</xref>]. However, the residue VP1<sup>107</sup> is located on the C β-strand of VP1, adjacent to the end of the BC loop, which is mostly exposed on the capsid surface at a canyon-like depression surrounding the five-fold axis of symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). In view of the distance of the VP1<sup>107</sup> residue from the VP0 cleavage site, the residue VP1<sup>107</sup> may regulate VP0 cleavage and viral maturation in an indirect manner, possibly by conformational alteration of the virion precursor rather than by directly interfering with the active site of proteolysis.</p>
<p>The efficiency of VP0 cleavage is dependent on the folding conformation of the peptide chains surrounding the scissile bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref028">28</xref>]. The VP2-194P mutants carrying serine or glycine substitutions cleave VP0 inefficiently, which may result from configurational alteration of VP2-195H caused by higher degrees of rotational freedom of the main chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref028">28</xref>]. In addition to this, configuration of the local residues away from the VP0 cleavage site may also have a dramatic effect on the cleavage event. Previous studies with hepatitis A virus, rhinovirus, and poliovirus have shown that a series of conformational changes and intra-subunit communications within the particle occur during the maturation cleavage of VP0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref029">29</xref>]. For example, some mutations at VP2<sup>76</sup>, distal to the scissile bond of VP0, prevent the maturation cleavage in poliovirus, suggesting an involvement of conformational changes around the cleavage site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Analysis of associated hydrogen-bond networks showed a trend that the increasing number and occupancy of hydrogen-bond for VP1<sup>107</sup> correlate with decreased viral replication. More specifically, the D94 residue in the B β-strand of VP1, adjacent to the other end of BC loop, was predicted to form hydrogen-bonds with the VP1<sup>107</sup> residue in viruses that exhibit slow growth phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006625.g007">Fig 7G</xref>). This suggests that sufficient flexibility of the VP1 BC loop or the region surrounding VP1<sup>107</sup> residue, which results from less hydrogen-bonding, might favor VP0 conformational changes that are required for the efficient cleavage of VP0, therefore facilitating viral uncoating and viral replication. One possible interesting avenue of this finding might be providing methods for virus vaccine stabilization; similar approaches have shown some promise in the design of synthetic FMDV vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref031">31</xref>]. Increasing stability of the capsid by introducing substitution mutation at VP1<sup>107</sup> may prevent the dissociation of intact virus particles and subsequently the loss in immunogenicity of vaccine. However, this would need to be demonstrated experimentally in the future.</p>
<p>Although much effort has been made to discover molecular determinants for EV71 virulence, the relevant knowledge is still incomplete. One critical domain in VP1 protein near the 5-fold vertices of the EV71 capsid has been reported as an important contributor to viral virulence. This region is critical for receptor binding and necessary for the stability of infectious virions. Single mutations (G145E, E145Q, or K244E) in the conserved, positively charged 5-fold region of the VP1 capsid protein were identified as important sites in EV71 for mouse adaptation and neuropathogenesis in cynomolgus monkey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref034">34</xref>]. Further studies revealed that K244E was necessary for increased virulence and neurotropism of mouse adapted EV71 (mEV71) in adult interferon deficient mice. Meanwhile, another VP1 mutation (H37R) was required for mEV71 (K244E) recovery in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref035">35</xref>]. The VP1-145 residue controls PSGL-1 binding by modulating the exposure of VP1-244K, which determines cell tropism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref024">24</xref>]. A canyon region around residue VP1-172Q has also been shown to interact with the variable region on SCARB2, another main host receptor of EV71 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref016">16</xref>]. Moreover, substitutions in other regions of VP1 protein were shown being important for EV71 virulence. The substitution L97R within the VP1 BC loop confers a replicative advantage in SH-SY5Y cells of neuroblastoma origin with a frequent association of a second non-conservative mutation (E167G or E167A) in the VP1 EF loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006625.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, we have demonstrated that VP1<sup>107A</sup> is critical for EV71 replication, and is highly conserved among all viral genogroups. The results of mechanistic study suggest that the VP1<sup>107</sup> residue modulates the flexibility of the VP1 BC loop, regulates VP0 cleavage and subsequent viral uncoating. Characterization of this novel determinant of EV71 virulence may provide new opportunities for vaccine development and drug discovery.</p>

<title>Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations</title>
<p>VP1 protein configuration was extracted from the empty EV71 particle (PDB ID 3VBU). Residues 211–217 were missing in the PDB file. We added this loop before MD simulation. Four mutants (A107T, A107R, A107D and A107S) were generated using the Maestro software. A total of 10ns MD simulations were carried out for EV71-HP and mutants of VP1. MD simulations of EV71-HP and all these mutants of VP1 were performed using the Amber11 software package. The amber ff99SB force field was applied for the protein. TIP3P water molecules were utilized to solvate the complex, extending at least 10 Å from the protein. The counter ions (Cl-) were added for charge neutralization. To remove the bad contacts, the system was subjected to energy minimization. Firstly, the water molecules and ions were refined through 2,500 steps of steepest descent followed by 2,500 steps of conjugate gradient, keeping the protein fixed. Secondly, the whole system was relaxed by 10, 000 cycles of minimization procedure with 5,000 cycles of steepest descent and 5,000 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization. After that, the system was heated from 0 to 300 K by 500ps position restraint simulation. 2ns MD simulations without any restraints were sequentially performed to equilibrate the system. Finally, a length of 10 ns trajectory was computed at 300K under constant pressure. During the simulation, the cutoff distance for <italic>van der</italic> Waals interactions was set to 10.0 Å, along with a time step of 2.0 fs. Long-range electrostatic interactions are treated with the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method. The SHAKE algorithm was applied to constrain all bonds involving hydrogen atoms. All of the MD results were analyzed using the ptraj module of the Amber 11 software package.</p>
