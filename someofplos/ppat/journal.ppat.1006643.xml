<abstract>
<p>Antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection is a well-described phenomenon that is based on the cellular uptake of infectious virus-antibody complexes following their interaction with Fcγ receptors expressed on myeloid cells. Here we describe a novel mechanism of antibody-mediated enhancement of infection by a flavivirus (tick-borne encephalitis virus) in transformed and primary human cells, which is independent of the presence of Fcγ receptors. Using chemical cross-linking and immunoassays, we demonstrate that the monoclonal antibody (mab) A5, recognizing an epitope at the interface of the dimeric envelope protein E, causes dimer dissociation and leads to the exposure of the fusion loop (FL). Under normal conditions of infection, this process is triggered only after virus uptake by the acidic pH in endosomes, resulting in the initiation of membrane fusion through the interaction of the FL with the endosomal membrane. Analysis of virus binding and cellular infection, together with inhibition by the FL-specific mab 4G2, indicated that the FL, exposed after mab A5- induced dimer-dissociation, mediated attachment of the virus to the plasma membrane also at neutral pH, thereby increasing viral infectivity. Since antibody-induced enhancement of binding was not only observed with cells but also with liposomes, it is likely that increased infection was due to FL-lipid interactions and not to interactions with cellular plasma membrane proteins. The novel mechanism of antibody-induced infection enhancement adds a new facet to the complexity of antibody interactions with flaviviruses and may have implications for yet unresolved effects of polyclonal antibody responses on biological properties of these viruses.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Antibodies are an important component of antiviral host responses and their binding to the surface of virus particles usually leads to neutralization of viral infectivity. In some instances, however, antibodies at sub-neutralizing concentrations can enhance infection of certain cells, because they facilitate the uptake of infectious virus-antibody complexes through interactions with antibody-specific cellular receptors (Fcγ receptors). This mechanism is designated antibody-dependent enhancement of infection and implicated in the pathogenesis of dengue and possibly Zika virus infections, both mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses. Here we describe a novel mechanism of infection enhancement by antibodies that is independent of interactions with Fcγ receptors, using another important human-pathogenic flavivirus, tick-borne encephalitis virus. We demonstrate that binding of a specific antibody to the envelope protein E at the viral surface promotes the exposure of a structural element that interacts with the lipids of the cellular plasma membrane, thus increasing infection. Our study provides new insights into mechanisms that potentially modulate the antiviral effects of antibody populations present in post-infection sera.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Flaviviruses are small, enveloped viruses that cause significant human disease worldwide, including the mosquito-borne dengue, Zika, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever viruses as well as tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref001">1</xref>]. Despite intensive research, the hunt for specific flavivirus receptors has yielded diverse results. A plethora of molecules at the plasma membranes of different cells have been shown to interact with flaviviruses and were proposed to function as attachment factors, but <italic>bona fide</italic> entry receptors are still ill-defined (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref003">3</xref>]). The reported data are quite varied, suggesting that molecules involved in flavivirus cell attachment and entry differ among viruses and cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref004">4</xref>]. In most instances, the major envelope protein E (which mediates viral membrane fusion upon receptor-mediated endocytosis) has been implicated in such interactions. More recently, cellular lipid receptors, (TIM (T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain) and TAM (Tyro3, Axl and Mer) receptor families) that recognize lipids in the viral membrane, have been shown to mediate flavivirus attachment and entry in certain instances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Flaviviruses are assembled at the endoplasmic reticulum as immature virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref007">7</xref>], in which the E proteins are associated with the prM protein (precursor of M) as heterodimers that form trimeric spikes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref008">8</xref>]. During exocytosis, prM is processed by the cellular enzyme furin, giving rise to mature virions that contain the small M protein and E homodimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref009">9</xref>] covering the viral surface in a herringbone-like arrangement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref010">10</xref>]. Each E monomer has three distinct domains (domain I, II, III; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), connected by short flexible linkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref011">11</xref>]. Domain II provides most of the intra-dimeric contacts and contains the conserved fusion loop (FL) at its distal end. In the dimer, the FL is buried in a pocket built by domains I and III of the neighboring subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Most flavivirus E proteins have a single N-linked glycan attached to domain I, while the dengue E proteins have an additional glycan in domain II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref012">12</xref>].</p>

<p>In addition to direct virus-cell interactions, antibodies bound to virus particles can mediate attachment of such immune complexes to Fcγ receptor (FcγR)-bearing cells like monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, leading to endocytosis and—in the case of incomplete virus neutralization—to enhancement of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref015">15</xref>]. This mechanism of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a well-documented phenomenon of flavivirus infections (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref017">17</xref>]), but was also observed for many other viruses that are able to replicate in FcγR-positive cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref018">18</xref>]. ADE has been implicated in the pathogenesis of severe forms of dengue virus infections and is speculated to contribute to congenital Zika virus infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref020">20</xref>], but the precise role of ADE in human infections is still debated (reviewed in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref021">21</xref>]).</p>
<p>Recent evidence indicates that the proteins in the flavivirus envelope are in dynamic motion (referred to as “virus breathing”), best described as an ensemble of conformations around equilibrium (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref022">22</xref>]). These structural dynamics of the virus surface transiently expose sites in E that would be inaccessible in a static virus particle with a closed shell of 90 E dimers in a herringbone-like arrangement, as determined by cryo EM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref010">10</xref>]. Structural analyses, however, have also revealed temperature-dependent changes of the viral envelope for certain dengue virus strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref024">24</xref>], which can result in the exposure of cryptic epitopes and their recognition by certain mabs, leading to virus neutralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref026">26</xref>]. Through binding to such transiently accessible sites, antibodies, and possibly other ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref027">27</xref>], can lock E in different conformational states within the virion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>The structural dynamics of flaviviruses reflects the conformational flexibility of E, which is required during particle maturation as well as during viral membrane fusion. It is primarily made possible by flexible linker elements between each of the domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). For membrane fusion, the acidic pH of endosomes triggers the dissociation of E dimers and thus exposes the FL, allowing for its interaction with the endosomal membrane and the initiation of fusion. Membrane merging is then driven by an irreversible structural change of E that converts it into a stable post-fusion trimer (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref029">29</xref>]).</p>
<p>In this work, we describe a novel mechanism underlying antibody-mediated infection enhancement of TBEV in FcγR-negative cells that is dependent on FL-lipid interactions. We show that a mab recognizing an epitope at the E dimer interface, leads to the dissociation of the E dimer and thus to exposure of the FL. The FL then mediates direct attachment to the plasma membrane (and liposomal membranes) and thus increases the infectivity of TBE virus in FcγR-negative cells. Such a mechanism of antibody-mediated enhancement of infection has not yet been described for flaviviruses and adds a new facet to the potential effects of antibodies in flavivirus infections.</p>

<title>Antibody-mediated enhancement of infection</title>
<p>In the course of focus-reduction neutralization tests in HeLa-H1 (HeLa) cells, we observed a paradoxical infection-enhancing effect with one mab (A5) out of a set of mabs specific for different antigenic sites in the E protein of TBEV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, mab A5 did not neutralize the virus even at the highest concentration of 1,250 μg/ml, but rather caused a significant increase (up to 2.5-fold) of infectivity. This property was not seen with mabs directed to other sites in E that either neutralized the virus (IC3, B4) or had no effect on infectivity (4G2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Measuring the increase of virus production as a function of time post infection in HeLa cells revealed that mab A5-mediated infection enhancement was most prominent at early times of virus replication. After pre-incubation of the virus (MOI 0.25) with mab A5, the maximum increase of virus yield (approximately 3-fold) was reached at 16 hours post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), which was also the time point of peak virus production in the absence of antibody. No significant enhancement effect was observed with the control mab 4G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Since HeLa cells do not express FcγRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref030">30</xref>], these data suggest that the binding of mab A5 increased the infectivity of TBEV by an FcγR-independent mechanism.</p>
<p>As suggested by blocking ELISAs with human sera (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>), mab A5-like antibodies can also be induced in the course of natural TBEV infections, albeit in relatively rare instances. Only one (serum #4) out of 30 sera was found to be positive in this assay (54% mab A5 blocking activity, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006643.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Since several samples had higher overall TBEV-specific IgG titers than serum #4, but were negative in mab A5 blocking (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006643.s001">S1 Table</xref>), this property does not appear to be linked to the total amount of specific antibodies present but to reflect the heterogeneity of antibody compositions in polyclonal sera from different individuals.</p>

<title>Antibody-mediated binding to cells and liposomes</title>
<p>A possible explanation for the observed enhancement of infectivity is the facilitation of viral cell attachment by mab A5. Therefore, we first quantified virus attachment to cells in the absence of antibodies by using qPCR (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>). Given that HeLa cells were efficiently infected by TBEV, binding of the virus to HeLa cells was surprisingly low (less than 1% of input virus), irrespective of the temperature used (4, 30, and 37°C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). To analyze whether this was a specific property of TBEV, we performed the same experiment with dengue virus (serotype 2, DENV2, strain New Guinea C), which also replicates efficiently in HeLa cells. Although binding was slightly higher than for TBEV, the values were again remarkably low (less than 1.5% of input virus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). A similar picture was obtained in binding experiments with primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs), indicating that the low degree of virus attachment was not restricted to transformed cell lines such as HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>To validate these results and our experimental system, we used two approaches. First, we analyzed binding/internalization of human rhinovirus type 2 (RV-A2) to HeLa cells, a system with well-defined and specific receptors (i.e. members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor superfamily; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref031">31</xref>]). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, binding/internalization of RV-A2 was dramatically more efficient than that of the flaviviruses tested. It strongly increased with temperature, as described in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref033">33</xref>]. Secondly, we quantified binding of TBE and DEN2 viruses to immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC), expressing DC-SIGN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006643.s002">S1 Fig</xref>), which has been shown to be a specific attachment factor for dengue viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref034">34</xref>]. Consistent with the potential of dengue viruses to interact with DC-SIGN, efficient binding of DENV2 to immature moDCs was observed, whereas binding of TBEV was as low as on HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess possible implications of the low levels of cellular attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g001">Fig 1</xref>) on measurements of infectivity, we performed serial transfer experiments in a standard focus assay format (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>). Consistent with the low degree of binding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g002">Fig 2</xref>), the number of foci declined only moderately from step to step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g003">Fig 3</xref>), indicating that the usual determination of infectious units in virus-containing samples will yield a gross underestimate of the real number of infectious virus particles present.</p>

<p>We next investigated the influence of mab A5 on TBEV attachment to HeLa cells. In contrast to other antibodies, mab A5 increased cell binding significantly (approximately 4-to-5-fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), supporting the hypothesis, that enhancement of infectivity was caused by facilitation of cell attachment. Mechanistically, one might imagine that interaction of the antibody with the virus surface leads to structural rearrangements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref025">25</xref>] and the exposure of sites in E that allow interactions with yet unknown cellular protein receptors. If this were the case, no such effects should be seen in interactions with liposomes that consist of a mere lipid membrane. Results of binding experiments with liposomes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g004">Fig 4B</xref>. They clearly demonstrate that mab A5 strongly enhances binding to lipid membranes, suggesting that the phenomenon of A5-mediated enhancement of infectivity is due to direct interaction of E with the lipids of the plasma membrane.</p>

<title>Mab A5 induces dissociation of E and FL exposure</title>
<p>The FL at the tip of DII has the capacity to insert into lipid membranes, but at neutral pH it is buried in a pocket lined by residues contributed by DI and DIII of the other subunit in the E dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Under conditions of natural infection, the FL becomes only exposed in the endosome through acidic-pH-induced dissociation of E after viral uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref028">28</xref>]. Due to the location of the epitope recognized by mab A5 at the E dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), we speculated that antibody binding might lead to the dissociation of the dimer and exposure of the FL at neutral pH, allowing for its direct interaction with the plasma membrane. To assess this possibility, we performed chemical cross-linking experiments with a recombinant soluble E (sE) dimer of TBEV in the absence and presence of mab A5. The FL-specific, non-neutralizing mab 4G2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref038">38</xref>] was used as a control. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, cross-linking of sE yielded bands at ~50 kD and ~100 kD corresponding to the monomeric and dimeric form of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, lane 1), in agreement with the dimeric structure of E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref040">40</xref>]. In the presence of mab A5, however, E dimers were absent and only bands of E monomers were visible, indicating that the E dimers had dissociated upon complex formation with mab A5. In the case of the control mab 4G2, however, no change of the cross-linking pattern of sE was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Note that the rabbit antiserum used for detection of TBEV E in the blot exhibited some reactivity with the mabs, leading to background bands at Mr around 150 kD. The absence of higher molecular weight bands indicates that cross-linking between E and mabs did not occur under the conditions used.</p>

<p>We further assessed whether binding of mab A5 also led to exposure of the FL in the context of the virus particle. Since cross-linking of whole virions yields a complex pattern of oligomeric bands, meaningful interpretations with respect to mab A5-induced changes would not be possible in experiments similar to those conducted with the sE dimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref041">41</xref>]. Therefore, we studied putative exposure of the FL induced by mab A5 in an ELISA. TBEV was captured with a polyclonal anti-TBEV serum, and biotinylated mab 4G2 was used as a specific detector for the exposed FL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref038">38</xref>].

The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g006">Fig 6B</xref> illustrate that incubation of TBEV with mab A5 resulted in a significantly higher reactivity of mab 4G2 compared to the control without A5.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have identified a new mechanism by which E protein-specific antibodies can enhance the binding of a flavivirus to the plasma membrane of target cells and thus increase its infectivity. This mechanism differs from the well-described phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, which is mediated by the binding of infectious virus-antibody complexes to FcγRs that are expressed on myeloid cells and trigger virus internalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref018">18</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g010">Fig 10</xref>). In contrast, our experiments provide evidence for a different process of antibody-induced enhancement of infection independent of FcγRs that is mediated by the dissociation of the E dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), the exposure of the otherwise buried FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), and the increased binding of the virus to the plasma membrane of target cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g004">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g008">8A–8D</xref>). This mechanism appears to be based on the structural dynamics of the flavivirus envelope, antibody-promoted conformational changes, and membrane interactions of the FL that normally occur only in endosomes as a first step of low-pH-triggered viral membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g010">Fig 10</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref029">29</xref>].</p>

<p>Enhancement of infection of FcγR-negative cells (Vero, BHK-21) was also described in experiments with the domain II-specific mouse mab E100, directed against the E protein of West Nile virus (WNV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref047">47</xref>], and the domain II-specific mouse mabs 1A5D-1 as well as 10A1D-2, directed against the E protein of dengue virus serotype 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref048">48</xref>]. In addition, in the context of screening for neutralizing activity using Vero cells, cell culture supernatants of some B cells from dengue infected patients also appeared to contain infectivity—enhancing antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref049">49</xref>]. The mechanism underlying these observations, however, was not resolved in these studies. Similarly, experiments with Sindbis virus, a member of another family of spherical enveloped viruses with icosahedral structure (alphaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref050">50</xref>]), demonstrated that a mouse mab specific for an epitope in the receptor-binding protein E2 (MCAB 49) increased the number of plaque forming units in BHK-21 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref051">51</xref>]. In this case, increase of specific infectivity was correlated to increased cellular binding of Sindbis virus. The authors hypothesized that their observation might be due to antibody-mediated conformational changes promoting tighter binding of virions to the cell surface. Whether this augmented binding also involved the FL (present in the alphavirus fusion protein E1) remains to be elucidated. Interestingly, enhanced infection was only seen with a specific strain of Sindbis virus but not with others, which may be related to differences in viral envelope dynamics, similar to those described for flaviviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref054">54</xref>].</p>
<p>An apparently different mechanism of enhanced infection of FcγR-negative cells from humans (A549), hamsters (BHK-21), mice (NIH3T3), and mosquitoes (C6-36) was demonstrated in experiments with dengue 2 virus (strain PL046) and a mab specific for the prM protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref055">55</xref>], which forms a complex with E in immature forms of flaviviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref008">8</xref>]. These findings were discussed to be caused by molecular mimicry of prM of a cellular protein (most likely HSP60), allowing the simultaneous binding of the bivalent antibody to the virus as well as to the cell and thus to increase cellular attachment. This contrasts to the mechanism of enhancement described here. The combination of mab A5 with TBEV appears to be independent of interactions with cellular receptor-like proteins, because it can also be demonstrated with plain liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), suggesting that it is mediated by FL-interactions with the lipids in target membranes.</p>
<p>Indirect evidence for antibody-promoted structural changes that increase the exposure of the FL had already become apparent in competitive binding studies with E-specific mabs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref057">57</xref>]. Studies with TBE and dengue viruses provided evidence that the binding of antibodies to epitopes in domains II and III of E could lead to increased binding of FL-specific mabs. Detailed structural information about influences of antibody binding on the envelope protein arrangement of a flavivirus was first obtained by Lok et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref025">25</xref>] using cryo EM of dengue 2 virus (strain NGC) in complex with a mab to the A strand of DIII. As discussed by Cockburn and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref027">27</xref>], such effects may also be caused by ligands other than antibodies and might contribute to the tuning of infection as well as cellular tropism. Beyond that, the exposure of otherwise cryptic protein surfaces by antibody binding can also modulate the fine specificity of antibody responses upon immunization with immune complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>The binding of the infection-enhancing mab A5 to the E dimer appears to interfere with the equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric states, favoring the monomer and exposing the FL. The epitope of A5 involves residues in DII lying at the interface of the monomers in the E dimer as revealed by the analysis of neutralization escape variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref058">58</xref>] and mutational mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref059">59</xref>]. Interestingly, FcγR-independent enhancement of WNV infection was observed with a mab (E100) that, like mab A5, binds to an epitope at a similar site in domain II and the E dimer interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref047">47</xref>]. Based on this similarity, the mechanism of increased infectivity may be analogous and involve antibody-promoted E dimer dissociation in both virus systems.</p>
<p>Since both mab A5 and mab E100 augment rather than inhibit infection, one has to assume that they are unable to block fusion in the endosome, even when they are co-internalized with the virus. Post-entry neutralization (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref060">60</xref>]) would require maintenance of the virus-antibody interaction at the acidic pH in endosomes. In this context, it is of note, that the epitopes of both mab A5 and mab E100 involve histidines, H208 in TBEV and H263 in WNV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref047">47</xref>]. It is quite possible that protonation of these residues in the endosome might weaken or even abolish the antibody interactions with E. Domain and oligomeric rearrangements required for membrane fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref028">28</xref>] would thus not be inhibited by antibodies specific for E, allowing for infection to proceed unimpaired.</p>
<p>The FL-mediated binding to cellular plasma membranes—through E dimer dissociation induced by mab A5—mimics the first step of the viral fusion process that is normally triggered by the acidic pH in endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref029">29</xref>]. One could therefore speculate that fusion would occur already at this stage of antibody-mediated infection. However, we did not detect any mab-A5-induced fusion activity at neutral pH using liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g009">Fig 9</xref>) similar to what was observed upon E dimer dissociation and FL exposure at alkaline pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref041">41</xref>]. These negative results are consistent with structural considerations that argue against the possibility of fusion without acidification, because the relocation of DIII—required for the fusogenic conformational change of E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref028">28</xref>]—appears to be dependent on the protonation of one or more histidines at the interface of domain I and III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref061">61</xref>]. Taken together, all the above data strongly suggest that mab A5-induced binding to the plasma membrane facilitated virus uptake by endocytosis.</p>
<p>A striking observation of our binding experiments was the low degree of TBEV attachment to both transformed cell lines and primary cells under normal conditions of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Dengue virus bound with similar low efficiency to HeLa cells but—in contrast to TBEV—efficiently to immature dendritic cells, which express DC-SIGN, a previously identified attachment factor for dengue viruses (reviewed in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref062">62</xref>]). The difference appears to be due to interaction of E with DC-SIGN via a glycan at N67 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref012">12</xref>], which is present in dengue viruses but absent in TBEV and other flaviviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref063">63</xref>]. A very low efficiency of cellular attachment is apparently sufficient for infection. Similar results (less than 1% binding of input virus) were obtained by Van der Schaar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref064">64</xref>] with the dengue 2 virus strain PR159S1 and monkey kidney cells (BS-C-1). The low efficiency of binding to certain cells may be responsible for the low specific infectivity of flaviviruses observed in many instances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref064">64</xref>]. Serial transfer experiments of dengue virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref064">64</xref>] and TBEV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006643.g003">Fig 3</xref>) indicate that conventional infectivity determinations lead to a gross underestimation of the real number of infectious particles present in virus suspensions, because of the low degree of virus binding to cells under the conditions of these assays.</p>
<p>The identification of a novel mechanism of antibody-enhanced infection adds an additional facet to the complexity of virus interactions with the variable mixtures of antibodies in polyclonal sera. Influenced by various factors such as binding sites and avidities, the effects of antibody populations on the virus can be expected to be additive, cooperative or competitive and thus modulate neutralizing and infection-enhancing activities in different ways, depending on the antibody compositions of such sera. Importantly, the antibody composition can vary strongly among individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref065">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref067">67</xref>] and is especially influenced by anamnestic responses as a result of the history of previous infections and vaccinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref068">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref070">70</xref>]. In addition to the heterogeneity of antibody responses, FL-mediated enhancement effects can also be influenced by properties of the virus (breathing dynamics and extent of maturation, reviewed in references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref071">71</xref>]). Future studies beyond the proof-of-principle presented here will be necessary to dissect this complexity and investigate whether and to which extent antibody-mediated enhancement in FcγR-negative cells can have implications for immunity and pathogenesis of human flavivirus infections.</p>

<title>Liposome binding assay</title>
<p>TBEV (0.5 μg/ml E protein) was pre-incubated with and without mabs (20 μg/ml) for 1 hour at room temperature (RT). Then, biotinylated liposomes were added to a final concentration of 0.2 mM for 20 minutes at 37°C. The liposomes were aggregated by cross-linking with avidin (Sigma-Aldrich) and pelleted at 1,000 g for 15 minutes at RT. The pellet was resuspended in TAN buffer (50 mM triethanolamine, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The amount of E protein in the pellet (bound) as well as in the supernatant (unbound) was quantified by 4-layer ELISA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref076">76</xref>].</p>
<p>For the inhibition of mab A5-induced enhancement of binding, TBEV-mab complexes (0.5 μg/ml E protein, final mab concentration 10 μg/ml) were further incubated with serial dilutions of mab 4G2 (2.5, 5, 10 μg/ml), mab A1 (2.5, 5, 10 μg/ml) or control mabs (final concentration for each mab 10 μg/ml) for 1 hour at RT.</p>

<p>Virus (1x10<sup>9</sup> RNA copies of TBEV, DENV or RV-A2) was pre-incubated with and without mabs (20 μg/ml) for 1 hour at RT. HeLa cells, Vero cells and HFFs were detached with the non-enzymatic EDTA versene solution (Gibco). 2x10<sup>5</sup> HeLa cells or 2x10<sup>5</sup> Vero cells or 2x10<sup>5</sup> HFFs or 1x10<sup>6</sup> immature moDCs were added at 4°C, 30°C or 37°C in binding buffer (medium 199 (Sigma-Aldrich), containing 15 mM HEPES, 15 mM HEPPS, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.6). Twenty mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl was included to prevent fusion in endosomes, release of the genome and its replication. After incubation for 1 hour at the respective temperature, cells were pelleted by low-speed centrifugation and washed twice with ice-cold PBS pH 7.4 (Sigma-Aldrich) to remove unbound virus. The viral RNA was extracted from the pellet and supernatant using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The number of bound and unbound genomic RNA copies was quantified by two-step quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qPCR).</p>
<p>To block the engagement of FcγRs by TBEV in the presence of virus-specific mabs, 1x10<sup>6</sup> HeLa cells or 1x10<sup>6</sup> FcγR-positive K562 were pre-treated with 2.5 μg of the mouse anti-human Fcγ RII/CD32a monoclonal antibody (R&amp;D Systems) for 90 minutes at 37°C, as described in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006643.ref035">35</xref>].
