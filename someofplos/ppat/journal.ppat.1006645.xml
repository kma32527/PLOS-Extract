<abstract>
<p>Melanization, an important insect defense mechanism, is mediated by clip-domain serine protease (cSP) cascades and is regulated by serpins. Here we show that proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase (PPO) and PO-catalyzed melanization kill the baculovirus <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our quantitative proteomics and biochemical experiments revealed that baculovirus infection of the cotton bollworm, <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic>, reduced levels of most cascade members in the host hemolymph and PO activity. By contrast, serpin-9 and serpin-5 were sequentially upregulated after the viral infection. The <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> serpin-5 and serpin-9 regulate melanization by directly inhibiting their target proteases cSP4 and cSP6, respectively and cSP6 activates PPO purified from hemolymph. Furthermore, serpin-5/9-depleted insects exhibited high PO activities and showed resistance to baculovirus infection. Together, our results characterize a part of the melanization cascade in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic>, and suggest that natural insect virus baculovirus has evolved a distinct strategy to suppress the host immune system.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Melanization is one of important modules in insect defense system. It consists of a cascade of clip-domain serine proteases (cSPs) that converts the zymogen prophenoloxidase (PPO) to active phenoloxidase (PO), which is negatively regulated by serpins. PO then catalyses the formation of melanin that physically encapsulates certain pathogens. Parasites and bacteria have evolved to produce specific proteins or antibiotic to suppress the melanization response of host insects for survival. However, the mechanisms by which virus persists in the face of the insect melanization are poorly understood. In this study, we show that a DNA virus baculovirus infection of the cotton bollworm, <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic>, reduced the levels of most cascade members in the host hemolymph and PO activity. By contrast, serpin-9 and serpin-5 were sequentially upregulated after the viral infection. Our results also reveal that melanization kills baculovirus <italic>in vitro</italic>. Serpin-5 and serpin-9 regulate melanization by directly inhibiting their target proteases cSP4 and cSP6, respectively and cSP6 activates PPO purified from hemolymph. Moreover, serpin-5/9-depleted insects show resistance to baculovirus infection. Our findings have enriched the understanding of molecular mechanisms by which pathogens suppress the melanization response of host insect for survival.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The cotton bollworm, <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic>, is a major pest of cotton and one of the most destructive and polyphagous pest species. It is widespread in central and southern Europe, temperate Asia, Africa, Australia and Oceania, and Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref001">1</xref>]. Moreover, the rapid spread of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> through South America into Central America has threatened agriculture in North America and an immense quantity of crops are exposed to <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref002">2</xref>]. Due to the broad-spectrum pesticide resistance developed in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic>, traditional chemical insecticides do not protect these crops from significant production impact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref002">2</xref>] and transgenic crops also lead to resistance development in pests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref003">3</xref>], highlighting the urgent need to develop effective biopesticide alternatives to control pests. H. armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV), a natural enemy of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic>, has increasingly been used as a biological insecticide for pest control in recent decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref005">5</xref>]. Before the baculovirus kills the pest insects, it must invade and overcome the host immune responses. However, molecular interactions between the virus and its host’s immune system are poorly understood.</p>
<p>Viruses are a major burden for invertebrate organisms. Besides being used as biological agents against pest insects, these obligate intracellular pathogens have an important impact on economically beneficial insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref006">6</xref>]. However, the immunity to viral infection is still poorly understood in invertebrates. An important defense against viruses in invertebrates is RNA interference (RNAi), which can efficiently degrade virally transcribed RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref007">7</xref>]. On the other hand, two additional cellular mechanisms, apoptosis and autophagy restrict viral replication and dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref006">6</xref>]. Moreover, several studies based on invertebrate larvae, have suggested that melanization is involved in antiviral immunity. Melanization is an important defense mechanism in arthropods and plays an essential role in wound healing and innate immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref008">8</xref>]. In the mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, phenoloxidase (PO) activity is required for defense against the Semliki Forest virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref009">9</xref>]. In the shrimp <italic>Penaeus monodon</italic>, the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) has evolved a specific strategy to counteract the host’s melanization response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Studies in a few insects revealed that melanization is initiated by the recognition of microbial elicitors such as β-1, 3-glucan, lipopolysaccharide, and peptidoglycan by pathogen recognition receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref008">8</xref>]. Upon binding, a serine protease (SP) cascade is activated to finally cleave the PPO zymogen to active PO. PO catalyzes the formation of quinones and melanin, which kill and immobilize microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref011">11</xref>]. Biochemical studies of <italic>Manduca sexta</italic>, <italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic> and <italic>Holotrichia diomphalia</italic> have indicated that SP cascades are mainly composed of clip-domain serine proteases (cSPs) that harbor regulatory clip domain(s) in their N- termini. In <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic>, the biochemical model insect, two SP cascades for PPO activation were clarified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref012">12</xref>]. One consists of HP21 and PAP2/3, while the other HP1, HP6, and PAP1. HP21 activates PAP2 or PAP3; PAP2/PAP3 then converts PPO into active PO. PPO activation can also be catalyzed by the other cascade composed by HP1, HP6, and PAP1. Furthermore, the genes for cSPs and cSP homologues (cSPHs) could be phylogenetically divided into 5 clades: A, B, C, D and E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref013">13</xref>]. With the exception of CLIPA and CLIPE, most members of the other three clades are expected to have protease activity. Currently, some cSPs in CLIPB, including PPO-activating proteases (PAP1−3) in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> and SPE in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>molitor</italic>, are thought to directly cleave PPO. In addition, CLIPCs have been shown to cleave CLIPBs, for instance, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> HP6 activates <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> proPAP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref011">11</xref>] and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>molitor</italic> SPE activates <italic>T</italic>. <italic>molitor</italic> proSPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref015">15</xref>]. However, functions of CLIPDs are poorly characterized, only one member, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> HP1, was recently described to cleave a CLIPC, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> proHP6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref012">12</xref>]. Apart from that, cSPs are strictly regulated by serpins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref008">8</xref>] and serpins are a superfamily of proteins, most of which inhibit serine proteases. Containing 350–400 residues typically, serpins have a reactive center loop (RCL) near their C-termini, which acts as the binding site for its target protease. After binding, the serpin is cleaved between the P1 and P1’ residues within the RCL, undergoes a dramatically conformation change, and forms a covalent complex with the protease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref016">16</xref>]. In <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic>, our previous immunotranscriptome study revealed a repertoire of immunity-related genes well conserved in holometabolous insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref017">17</xref>]. Like <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic>, two PPO transcripts were identified in the <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> transcriptome. We also found 11 cSPs and 22 serpins, similar to other lepidopteran insects. These results indicate that <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> contains a melanization regulatory system similar to other lepidopteran insects. This established the basis for further studies of serpins regulating the SP cascade in response to viral infection.</p>
<p>Baculoviruses are large DNA viruses that infect insects, primarily the lepidopteran insects. Studies on the interaction between baculoviruses and insect host innate immunity are mainly performed in cell lines. Two cellular mechanisms, RNAi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref018">18</xref>] and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref020">20</xref>], are implicated in defense against baculoviruses. However, there are a few studies suggesting that melanization plays a role in defense against baculoviruses in larval insects. It has been demonstrated that melanization can inhibit baculovirus infection in the resistant strain of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>zea</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref022">22</xref>]. In addition, hemolymph of <italic>Heliothis virescens</italic> is virucidal to baculovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref023">23</xref>]. More interestingly, the melanin precursor 5, 6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) shows antiviral activity against baculovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref024">24</xref>]. However, the mechanism by which baculovirus overcomes the host immune system is unclear.</p>
<p>The complete genome of HearNPV was sequenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref025">25</xref>], and multiple viral genes contributing to viral infection have been characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref028">28</xref>]. In our previous study, the HearNPV infection suppressed host defense response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref029">29</xref>]. Here, we deciphered molecular mechanisms on how HearNPV modulates host immunity. Quantitative proteomics analyses revealed that the melanization pathway is suppressed in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> infected with HearNPV. In addition, serpin-5 and serpin-9 induced by HearNPV infection downregulate melanization by inhibiting target proteases, cSP4 and cSP6. Our results suggest that the virus has evolved a novel strategy to suppress the host immune system.</p>

<title>Quantitative proteomics identified hemolymph proteins in response to baculovirus infection</title>
<p>Our previous study indicated that HearNPV infection dramatically regulated gene expression at 48 and 72 h post ingestion (hpi) in the fat body, the tissue responsible for the synthesis and secretion of most hemolymph polypeptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref029">29</xref>].

The hemolymph samples (48hM, 48hI, 72hM and 72hI) were collected from control and infected larvae at 48 and 72 hpi, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s001">S1A Fig</xref>), and subjected to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. A high quality, non-redundant protein database (HarmgeraNPV_001.fasta) was queried with MS/MS data for protein identification and quantification. We identified a total of 1,028 unique host proteins with the strict criteria that a protein must be identified at least twice, not only in technical repeats but also in biological repeats. We identified more unique proteins than in previous reports, for example, 654 in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref030">30</xref>], 752 in <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref031">31</xref>], and 725 in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref032">32</xref>], indicating a significant increase in coverage of the insect hemolymph proteome. The pairwise Pearson coefficients of the 1,028 proteins demonstrate excellent data consistency within the control (0.94−1.00) or infected (0.94−0.99) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s008">S1 Table</xref>). The control-infected coefficients were between 0.68 and 0.84 at 48 hpi and were between 0.41 and 0.59 at 72 hpi, suggesting that protein levels dramatically changed between the control and infected hemolymph and the differences in protein level increased over time. Consistent with the information revealed by the correlation analyses, principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a clear difference between control and infected hemolymph proteins, and the magnitude of difference at 72 hpi increased compared to 48 hpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). This is also consistent with our transcriptomic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref029">29</xref>].</p>

<p>A total of 45 HearNPV proteins were identified in infected hemolymph (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s009">S2 Table</xref>), 18 of which belonged to late proteins, including P10, FP25K, and P26. By contrast, fewer early proteins (9) were identified such as GP37, ME53, and FGF. In addition, two viral proteins (HA91, HA133) have both early and late promoters. Analysis of the levels of these viral proteins revealed that two early proteins, ME53 and HA121, were restricted to infected hemolymph at 48 hpi. Conversely, in infected hemolymph at 72 hpi, 5 late proteins (ODV-E66, P24, FP25K, Calyx/PEP, and HA66) were exclusively identified and 10 late proteins including cathepsin were much more abundant. Notably, three late proteins, P26, EGT and cathepsin, represented three of the top four most abundant viral proteins in infected hemolymph not only at 48 hpi but also at 72 hpi. These results suggest that oral inoculation of HearNPV successfully established the systemic infection of host larvae.</p>
<p>Then, we performed pairwise comparisons between control and infected groups to identify the differential proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s010">S3 Table</xref>). Venn diagram analysis revealed that 230 proteins were exclusively regulated in hemolymph at 48 hpi (78 upregulated and 152 downregulated), while another 366 proteins were specifically regulated in hemolymph at 72 hpi (244 upregulated and 122 downregulated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). A total of 305 proteins were regulated at both 48 and 72 hpi. Considering the different stages of viral infection, we speculate that time-dependent differential regulation strategies might be adopted by the virus. Importantly, the data showed consistent downregulation of 87 proteins at both 48 and 72 hpi and some of these (11) were immunity-related, including pattern recognition receptors (PPRs), SPs, and PPOs. In addition, it should be noted that although many proteins (244) were exclusively increased at 72 hpi, most (200) had no putative signal peptide, while among the exclusively downregulated proteins (122) at 72 hpi, most (85) did have a putative signal peptide. Meanwhile, 78 proteins were exclusively increased at 48 hpi, 41 of them had no putative signal peptide, while among the exclusively downregulated proteins (152) at 48 hpi, 73 of them have no putative signal peptide. The percentage of proteins without putative signal peptide in increased protein at 72 hpi (82.0%) is much higher that at 48 hpi (52.5%). As baculoviruses are liberated from the nuclei of infected cells by lytic release at late stage of viral infection, increased cell lysis after virus challenge might be responsible for the bias.</p>
<p>To avoid bias, we only focused on differential proteins identified in both control and infected hemolymph. Functional classification indicated that a large proportion of downregulated proteins were involved in carbohydrate metabolism (48 hpi), glycan biosynthesis/metabolism (72 hpi), and immunity-related processes (72 hpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Other notable functional groups were translation and amino acids (aa) metabolism (48 hpi). Importantly, most immunity-related proteins were downregulated at 72 hpi, as already implied by transcriptomic data, demonstrating the robustness of our approach.</p>

<title>The immune response to baculovirus infection in hemolymph and inhibition of hemolymph melanization by viral infection</title>
<p>Immunity-related proteins were significantly enriched among differential proteins after viral infection. Therefore, we mainly focused on immunity-related proteins identified in hemolymph. Previously, 233 immunity-related transcripts in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> were identified based on homology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref017">17</xref>]. Here, 67 immune proteins were further identified in hemolymph of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic>, including recognition molecules (21), modulators (24), signaling proteins (3) and effectors (19) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). Forty members of these immune proteins were differently expressed in hemolymph during viral infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s011">S4 Table</xref>). Hierarchical clustering revealed that many more immune proteins exhibited more remarkable downregulation than upregulation at the protein level in hemolymph at 48 hpi (8 upregulated and 15 downregulated) and 72 hpi (6 up and 30 downregulated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s001">S1D Fig</xref>), of which 11 members were consistently downregulated at both time points. Six of the 11 downregulated proteins were postulated to be involved in the melanization activation pathway, including PPO1 (9.5-fold at 48 hpi, 2.5-fold at 72 hpi), PPO2 (14.1-fold at 48 hpi, 2.4-fold at 72 hpi), cSP6 (1.4-fold at 48 hpi, 14.7-fold at 72 hpi), cSP8 (1.5-fold at 48 hpi, infinity at 72 hpi) and cSP29 (3.8-fold at 48 hpi, 22.7-fold at 72 hpi). Other putative melanization components also exhibited downregulation at either 48 hpi or 72 hpi, such as SP42 (2.6-fold at 72 hpi), cSP4 (16.9-fold at 72 hpi), and serpin-3 (2.2-fold at 72 hpi). Interestingly, two serpins, serpin-5 and serpin-9, exhibited an inverse regulation pattern. Serpin-9 was upregulated at 48 hpi (3.1-fold) and downregulated at 72 hpi (2.8-fold), whereas serpin-5 was completely different, being downregulated at 48 hpi (2.8-fold) and upregulated at 72 hpi (infinity). Serpin-5 is involved in regulating melanization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref034">34</xref>], and the function of serpin-9 has not been previously reported. These results suggest that baculovirus infection suppresses hemolymph melanization in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic>.</p>
<p>To test the resultant hypothesis from our quantitative proteomics analysis that baculovirus infection suppresses host melanization, a well-established PO activity assay using <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> larvae hemolymph was performed. Time-course analysis showed that PO activity in infected hemolymph did not exhibit any remarkable changes at 0 or 24 hpi. As infection progressed, PO activity decreased sharply at 48 hpi (7.4-fold) and 72 hpi (4.2-fold) compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The results demonstrated that at the early stage of baculovirus infection, hemolymph melanization was not affected. However, at the middle and late stages of the virus infection, the hemolymph melanization pathway was persistently downregulated.</p>

<title>Melanization blocks baculovirus infection <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>Our results showed that baculovirus infection reduced not only PPO amount but also host PO activity. A recombinant variant of HearNPV, HearNPV-<italic>egfp</italic> that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) in infected cells, was used in the virus infection assay to evaluate the effects of hemolymph melanization. The HearNPV-<italic>egfp</italic> was incubated with <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> hemolymph and dopa, the substrate of melanization, for 1, 3, and 6 h.

After 1 h incubation, the virus titer of hemolymph only, hemolymph and dopa group both decreased to zero. However, when phenylthiourea (PTU), specific inhibitor of PO, was incubated together with hemolymph, dopa, and virus, the virus titer did not change even after 6 h incubation. Dopa incubated with virus also did not have significant decrease in virus titer. Moreover, when the HearNPV-<italic>egfp</italic> suspension was incubated with DHI, a reactive intermediate compound generated by PO, the virus titer exhibited 95-fold reduction after 1 h incubation and could hardly be detected after 3 h.</p>
<p>Next, the same samples of reaction mixture for 1, 3, and 6 h were added to HzAM1 cells, after which the fluorescence microscopy images were taken at 72 hpi. When the HearNPV-<italic>egfp</italic> suspension was incubated with DHI, fewer infected cells was observed for 1 h incubation and no infection was observed after 3 h. Consistently, no viral infection was observed in hemolymph and dopa treatment group after 1 h incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). However the addition of PTU rescues the infection. Infected cells didn’t decrease even after 6 h incubation.

<title>Alteration of melanization component protein levels during baculovirus infection</title>
<p>The abovementioned experimental data suggest a critical role of hemolymph melanization in baculovirus infection. We developed eight antibodies against PPO, cSP, and serpins involved in the melanization pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s012">S5 Table</xref>) and the specificity of the cSP antibodies were confirmed by a knockdown experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). We performed immunoblot analyses of hemolymph from control and infected larvae at 48 and 72 hpi using these antibodies. The samples were left for 30 min for PPO to undergo spontaneous activation. The results showed that the amounts of cSP4, cSP6, cSP8, and cSP29 in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> hemolymph decreased over the time course in response to HearNPV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). The protein level of cSP4 in infected hemolymph was almost the same as that in mock hemolymph at 48 hpi, but its level was drastically reduced at 72 hpi. Regarding cSP6, the protein bands in the infected group were much weaker than those in the mock group at both 48 and 72 hpi. Moreover, the protein level of cSP8 significantly decreased at 48 hpi, and was undetectable at 72 hpi. Likewise, cSP29 could barely be detected by immunoblot in infected hemolymph (48 and 72 hpi), suggesting the strong effects of viral infection on its expression. In addition, two key enzymes involved in melanization, PPO1 and 2, were significantly downregulated at the protein level upon viral infection. Apart from the changes in protein levels, the cleavage of PPO was inhibited, with no cleaved forms detected in infected hemolymph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), The same result was observed even when increasing 4–7 times higher loading amount (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Furthermore, serpin-9 and serpin-5 were sequentially increased in protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s003">S3A Fig</xref>); the former was induced at 48 hpi and the latter was induced at 72 hpi, which is consistent with proteomics data, implying that these two molecules play critical roles in the modulation of host melanization and their targets were likely distinct from each other.

<p>To explore the effects of serpin-5 and serpin-9 on PO activity, we performed a PO activity assay <italic>in vitro</italic> using recombinant serpins. First, we cloned the cDNA of serpin-5 and serpin-9 from <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic>. <italic>Ha</italic>serpin-5 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 400 aa residues with a predicted signal peptide of 21 residues. The calculated molecular weight of mature serpin-5 is 42 kDa. <italic>Ha</italic>serpin-9 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 406 aa residues, with a predicted signal peptide of 20 residues. The calculated molecular weight of mature serpin-9 is 43 kDa. Sequence analysis indicated that <italic>Ha</italic>serpin-5 is orthologous to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> serpin-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref035">35</xref>] with 78% identity in aa sequence, suggesting that they might share similar regulatory functions. However, the ortholog gene of <italic>Ha</italic>serpin-9 was not found in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic>. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis revealed that <italic>Ha</italic>serpin-5 and <italic>Ha</italic>serpin-9 form a group with <italic>Ms</italic>serpin-4, <italic>Ms</italic>serpin-5 and <italic>Dm</italic>serpin77Ba [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref036">36</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). In addition, comparison of the RCL regions also showed that these five serpins have similar predicated residues at the P1-P1’ positions of the scissile bond (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s004">S4B Fig</xref>), implying that <italic>Ha</italic>serpin-9 might also participate in melanization.</p>
<p>To explore their biochemical functions, serpin-5 and serpin-9 gene were cloned into pET-28a vector and pET-32a vector respectively, and expressed in an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> expression system. Soluble serpin-5 and serpin-9 protein were further purified by nickel affinity chromatography. Recombinant serpin-5 and serpin-9 proteins migrated as 42.8-kDa and 61.5-kDa single bands on SDS-PAGE under reduced conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) and were confirmed by mass spectrometry.</p>
<p>As melanization was suppressed by HearNPV infection and serpin-5 and serpin-9 were upregulated in hemolymph from baculovirus infected larvae, it’s presumable that serpin-5 and serpin-9 might inhibit melanization in hemolymph. Therefore, we collected hemolymph from naïve larvae of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> and added serpin-5 and serpin-9 at different concentrations. Before subject to PO activity assay, these samples were exposed to air at 27°C for 5 min to undergo spontaneous melanization. The results showed that PO activities decreased by up to 46% and 83%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), suggesting that serpin-5 and serpin-9 inhibit melanization by targeting one or more cSPs in the PPO activation cascade.</p>

<title>Interactions between serpins and their target proteases</title>
<p>The above results showed that serpin-5 and serpin-9 function as inhibitors of PPO activation. To further identify their target cSPs, we tried to activate the infected larval hemolymph at the two time points by exposure to air, and captured serpin-associating cSPs in the hemolymph samples using a semi-quantitative proteomic approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Immunoaffinity chromatography using serpin-5 antibody allowed us to isolate complexes formed by serpin-5 and its associated proteins from the hemolymph at 72 hpi. Similarly, serpin-9 and its associated proteins from the hemolymph at 48 hpi were purified using serpin-9 antibody. Proteins eluted from the column were analyzed and quantified using tryptic peptide nano-LC-MS/MS analysis. The abundances of serpin-5 and serpin-9 increased in infected hemolymph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), as suggested by the quantitative proteomic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) and immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Among serpin-5 immunoprecipitated proteins (277), cSP4 and cSP6 were identified. Meanwhile cSP29 and cSP6 were identified among serpin-9 immunoprecipitated proteins (214). cSPs were remarkably increased in the infected hemolymph. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that cSP6 as well as cSP8 belong to the CLIPB group and are orthologous to PAP3 and PAP1 in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic>, respectively. Meanwhile cSP4 and its ortholog <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> HP6 belong to the CLIPC group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, cSP29 is orthologous to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> HP1, which is reported to activate HP6 in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> and is the only member of the CLIPD group with a known function. Apart from serpins and the target cSPs, serpin-3 and PPOs also tightly associated with the antibody columns. Serpin-3 had similar change patterns to serpin-5 at 72 hpi and serpin-9 at 48 hpi, respectively. The protein abundance of PPO associated with serpin-5 increased at 72 hpi. However, the protein level of PPO bound with serpin-9 substantially decreased. These results indicate that serpin-5 might be a key regulator of cSP4 and cSP6, while serpin-9 might be a critical modulator of cSP6 and cSP29 in the melanization cascade.</p>

<p>To further confirm the specific interaction between serpins and associated cSPs, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid assay. We constructed prey plasmids containing serpin-5 or serpin-9, and bait plasmid containing cSP4, cSP6, or cSP29. In selective growth media, we observed that serpin-5 bound to cSP4, whereas serpin-9 interacted with cSP6 and cSP29 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). The results suggest that cSP4 is likely the targeted protease of serpin-5 while cSP6 and cSP29 are the targeted proteases of serpin-9.</p>

<title>Inhibition of cSP4 by serpin-5 and cSP6 by serpin-9</title>
<p>To further investigate the interaction of serpin-5 with cSP4 and serpin-9 with cSP6, we expressed cSP4 and cSP6 in their zymogen forms using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 expression system. Predicted activation site of cSP4 and cSP6 was manually changed from LDLH<sup>92</sup> to IEGR<sup>92</sup> and VGNK<sup>156</sup> to IEGR<sup>156</sup> respectively. IEGR is the sequence of cleavage, which could be recognized by bovine coagulation factor Xa. They were named as procSP4<sub>Xa</sub> and procSP6<sub>Xa</sub>. Expressed recombinant proteins were purified by Ni-NTA agarose column. The amidase activity was detected using the substrate acetyl-Ile-Glu-Ala-Arg-<italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide (IEAR). Serpin-5 that was incubated with factor Xa-activated cSP4<sub>Xa</sub> was found to form a higher molecular weight complex by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Once being activated by factor Xa, the cSP4<sub>Xa</sub> zymogen band disappeared, and the catalytic domain of cSP4<sub>Xa</sub> band was detected by anti-His antibodies. When serpin-5 was mixed with active cSP4<sub>Xa</sub>, a novel band with high molecular weight appeared. IEAR activity of cSP4 was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Similar results were also observed with serpin-9 and cSP6<sub>Xa</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), active cSP6<sub>Xa</sub> was inhibited by serpin-9, as demonstrated by the formation of high molecular complex and decreased IEAR activity. These results confirm that serpin-5 and serpin-9 can inhibit cSP4 and cSP6 enzymatic activity by forming an SDS-stable complex respectively. Because cSP6 is predicted to function as PAP to cleave PPO directly, the inhibition of cSP6 by serpin-9 would lead to suppression of PPO activation. To test the hypothesis, hemolymph PPOs was purified from hemolymph of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> and shown to be a heterodimer formed by PPO1 and 2, which is consistent with results revealed from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> and <italic>H</italic>. <italic>diomphalia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g006">Fig 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). It exhibited PO activity after activation by alcohol in native PAGE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). Then, we incubated purified PPO with cSP6<sub>Xa</sub> with or without factor Xa. The results clearly showed that PPOs were enzymatically cleaved and activated by cSP6<sub>Xa</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g006">Fig 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). Taken together, serpin-5 and serpin-9 suppress PPO activation by the inhibition of cSPs in melanization cascade.</p>

<title>Serpin-5- and serpin-9-depleted <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> increased survival to baculovirus infection</title>
<p>To reveal the effect of serpin-5 and serpin-9 <italic>in vivo</italic> during baculovirus infection, we conducted dsRNA mediated knockdown by injecting double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of serpin-5 or serpin-9 into 2<sup>nd</sup> instar larvae of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic>. The relative mRNA expression levels were detected by qPCR in whole larvae, and the protein levels were detected by immunoblot in hemolymph.

Immunoblotting tests also confirmed efficiency of serpin-5 and serpin-9 RNAi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s006">S6A Fig</xref>).

We found that depletion of serpin-5 and serpin-9 significantly increased PO activity compared to the control after HearNPV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g007">Fig 7C</xref>).

Consistently, immunoblot indicated that the amount of VP39, the structural protein of HearNPV, dramatically decreased in hemolymph of serpin-5 and serpin-9 depleted larvae in comparison to the control (iGFP-NPV). Conversely, PPO2, cSP6, cSP29 was apparently increased in hemolymph of serpin-5 and serpin-9 depleted larvae, while cSP4 increase in hemolymph of serpin-5 depleted larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s006">S6B Fig</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>After viral infection, it appeared that cathepsin, EGT and P26 represented three of the top four most abundant viral proteins in infected hemolymph not only at 48 hpi but also at 72 hpi. These are secreted proteins, and are not included in the top 20 most abundant viral proteins in infected fat body at 72 hpi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref029">29</xref>]. Cathepsin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref037">37</xref>], an enzyme involved in insect disintegration, increased over time during infection. EGT was reported to block insect molting and pupation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref038">38</xref>], as observed in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref029">29</xref>]. P26 was described as a budded virus (BV) specific structural protein, the high level of P26 suggested that a large number of BV virions were secreted into hemolymph of infected <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> at 48 and 72 hpi. There were high abundance of virus proteins in the hemolymph, however, our proteomic study also indicates that most immunity-related proteins were downregulated, including the melanization pathway, an essential component of insect immune response. Baculovirus encoded microRNA may be employed to regulate the host immunity-related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref040">40</xref>], and increased serpin-5 and serpin-9 may also be involved in the host immunity-related gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s006">S6B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Because baculoviruses are natural enemies of insects, specific interactions between the virus and host likely influence virus survival. Our previous report revealed that RNAi and JAK-STAT pathways were not significantly regulated during baculovirus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref029">29</xref>]. In this study, our proteomic analysis show that levels of most AMPs were not significantly changed. But most of melanization components were downregulated in hemolymph after viral infection. Further results show that melanization can inactivate baculoviruses and block their infection. The fact that hemolymph does not melanize during infection by baculovirus in permissive lepidopteran hosts but melanizes in resistant ones has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref021">21</xref>]. The resistance is attributed to the impact of melanization in hemolymph, however, the inhibition of melanization in permissive hosts is still elusive. In this study, our proteomics and immunoblot analyses demonstrated that the protein level of melanization-activating components exhibited a significant decline during the viral infection, while two putative negative regulators of melanization, serpin-5 and serpin-9, increased instead. Consistent with the change at the protein level of melanization genes, PPO activation was inhibited and PO activity in the infected hemolymph dramatically decreased. Hemolymph PO of the larval tobacco budworm, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>virescens</italic>, is virucidal to baculovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref023">23</xref>], and DHI generated by PO has virucidal activity against baculovirus AcMNPV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref024">24</xref>]. In this study, similar effects of melanization on HearNPV were observed in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic>, hence, we concluded that the permissiveness of baculovirus infection is attributable to the inhibition of melanization by regulation of protein levels in hemolymph.</p>
<p>Melanization is an important invertebrate immune mechanism. The major components in the melanization pathway such as SPs and serpins have been characterized in some insects and other arthropod species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref041">41</xref>]. However, melanization cascade in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> remains unclear. In our previous work, transcripts for 46 SPs, 22 serpins, 7 SPHs and 2 PPOs were identified in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref017">17</xref>], providing fruitful ground for deciphering their roles in melanization. In this study, we identified the proteins encoded by 11 SPs, 10 serpins, 2 PPOs, and 3 SPHs in hemolymph using proteomics. Based on phylogenetic analysis, many were found to have orthologs in other insects, strongly suggesting the conservation of melanization-mediated immunity in the cotton bollworm. We deciphered the mechanism of HearNPV suppressing host melanization reaction using integrated approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis reveals that <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> melanization reactions is homologous to those reported in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic>. In <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic>, cSP29-cSP4-cSP8 was predicted to form a sequential activation cascade. Both cSP6 and cSP8 are PPO activating enzyme. The cleavage and activation of PPO by cSP6 are further demonstrated by <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Moreover, the inhibition of cSP4 activity by serpin-5 was similar to the interaction of HP6 regulated by serpin-5 in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref033">33</xref>]. However, we did not find orthologue of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> PAP-2 in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> and the inhibition of PPO activation by serpin-9 has not been reported in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> at present. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that melanization pathway is clarified in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic>, and it is shown to respond to viral infection, which further advances our knowledge of melanization in diverse insects and provides a theoretical basis for better controlling agricultural pests.</p>

<title>Proposed model for regulation of PPO activation cascade in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> during baculovirus infection.</title>
<p>HearNPV infection results in persistent suppression of melanization in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> hemolymph, which helps baculovirus particles to modulate the virucidal capacity of melanization in hemolymph. In detail, serpin-5 inhibits cSP4, and serpin-9 inhibits cSP6 and cSP29. PPO can be proteolytically activated by cSP6. During viral infection, the expression of Sepin-9 and serpin-5 are induced sequentially, while among components of the melanization pathway, cSP4 decreases at 72 hpi, and cSP6, cSP29, and PPOs decrease continuously.</p>

<p>In our study, serpin-5 and serpin-9 were demonstrated to be involved in modulating the melanization reaction during viral infection. Serpin-5 was previously shown to be induced in hemolymph of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> after bacterial or fungal infection and to inhibit melanization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref035">35</xref>]. Similar results were also found in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>mori</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref034">34</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrated that the inhibition of melanization caused by serpin-5 is indispensable to viral infection. Strikingly, we identify a novel serpin, serpin-9, whose ortholog in the model insect <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> has not been found, but that also participates in the suppression of melanization for successful viral infection. The inhibitory mechanisms of these two serpins are different. Serpin-9 acts upstream and downstream to serpin-5, and its induction time is also earlier (48 vs. 72 hpi). In addition, it is also possible that serpin-5 and serpin-9 might inhibit melanization by regulating a signaling pathway (such as Toll pathway) that controls the expression of components of melanization cascade. As the increased expression of components of the melanization cascade in both iserpin-5/NPV and iserpin-9/NPV insects were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006645.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). Interestingly, a baculovirus encoded serpin has been characterized as an inhibitor of host melanization and its expression increased the virulence of the virus by four-fold in <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref042">42</xref>]. However, this molecule is not an ortholog of serpin-5 or serpin-9 in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic>, and its exact molecular mechanism remains unknown.</p>
<p>We have demonstrated that the polyphagous pest <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> retains very complex melanization against the invasion of microbes. However, in nature, pathogens have evolved distinct strategies to modulate host immunity by suppressing melanization. An antibiotic produced by the entomopathogenic bacterium <italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic> inhibits melanization by targeting PO activity in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref043">43</xref>]. Parasitoid wasps associated polydnavirus also expresses two viral proteins, Egf1.0 and Egf1.5, to suppress melanization via PAP inhibiton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref046">46</xref>]. More recently, it was reported that a viral protein encoded by WSSV interacts with PAP to suppress melanization in the shrimp <italic>Penaeus monodon</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref010">10</xref>]. Different from these findings, HearNPVs exploit host serpins to inhibit SPs at different steps of the melanization cascade. The phylogenetic analysis comparing the SPs interacting with serpin-5 or serpin-9 to other insect SPs showed that they belong to three different clades. cSP6 belongs to the CLIPB clade and is an ortholog of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> PAP3. Indeed, cSP6 is inhibited by serpin-9 and acts as a PAP in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic> and is found to cleave PPO directly. cSP4, which interacts with serpin-5, is predicted to cleave PAP. cSP4 belongs to the CLIPC clade and is the <italic>Helicoverpa</italic> ortholog of <italic>Ms</italic>HP6. <italic>Ms</italic>HP6 has been verified experimentally to cleave <italic>Ms</italic>PAP1 (a CLIPB member), while biochemical studies have shown that <italic>Ms</italic>PAP3 cleaved PPO directly in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref047">47</xref>]. Moreover, cSP29, targeted by serpin-9, is an SP belonging to the CLIPD subfamily, and its hypothesized function is to cleave cSP4. More recently, <italic>Ms</italic>HP1 was identified to be able to cleave <italic>Ms</italic>HP6 and its activation did not require proteolytic cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref012">12</xref>]. It is tempting to postulate that <italic>Ha</italic>cSP4, cSP6, and cSP29 also function as their orthologs in the melanization cascade. Among them, cSP6 and cSP8 are orthologous to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>sexta</italic> PAP3 and PAP1, respectively and may function as PAPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref048">48</xref>]. Likewise, cSP4 is postulated to cleave PAPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006645.ref049">49</xref>], while cSP29 is postulated to cleave cSP4.</p>
<p>Taken together, we envision a mechanism whereby baculovirus overcomes host melanization. The viral infection induces the level of serpin-5 and serpin-9 in hemolymph. Serpin-5 specifically inhibits cSP4, and serpin-9 inhibits cSP6 and cSP29, resulting in a dramatic decline of PO activity to suppress the virucidal capacity of host melanization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006645.g008">Fig 8</xref>). This mechanism, which involves baculovirus induced serpin-5 and serpin-9 and then inactivates the host immune system, suggests that these two negative regulators of immune response are important for baculovirus infection in insects. These findings improve our understanding of the interaction between HearNPV and its co-evolutionary host <italic>H</italic>. <italic>armigera</italic>.</p>

<title>The protein levels of melanization components in hemolymph after baculovrius infection.</title>
<p>(a) The protein levels of melanization components proteins were quantified by immuneJ software and HSP27.2 was used as a loading control. The average of protein level in each control litter was defined as 1. The average of protein level in each litter of the infected hemolymph on the same immunoblot was normalized to that of time-matched control. Results derived from three independent experiments were subjected to standard t test. * <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05, ** <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01. (b) Immunoblot analysis of PPOs in hemolymph after baculovirus infection. To compare the amount of cleaved PPOs between infected and control samples when the protein levels of the PPO zymogens in infected samples were comparable to or higher than those in control samples, the amounts of loading samples of 48hI and 72hI were five and seven times the expected amount respectively in immunoblot assay for antibodies to PPO1, and were four and six times the expected amount respectively in immunoblot assay for antibodies to PPO2.</p>
