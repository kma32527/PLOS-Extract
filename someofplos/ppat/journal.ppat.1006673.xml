<abstract>
<p>Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent, medically important mosquito-borne virus. Disease ranges from uncomplicated dengue to life-threatening disease, characterized by endothelial dysfunction and vascular leakage. Previously, we demonstrated that DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) induces endothelial hyperpermeability in a systemic mouse model and human pulmonary endothelial cells, where NS1 disrupts the endothelial glycocalyx-like layer. NS1 also triggers release of inflammatory cytokines from PBMCs via TLR4. Here, we examined the relative contributions of inflammatory mediators and endothelial cell-intrinsic pathways. <italic>In vivo</italic>, we demonstrated that DENV NS1 but not the closely-related West Nile virus NS1 triggers localized vascular leak in the dorsal dermis of wild-type C57BL/6 mice. <italic>In vitro</italic>, we showed that human dermal endothelial cells exposed to DENV NS1 do not produce inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8) and that blocking these cytokines does not affect DENV NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability. Further, we demonstrated that DENV NS1 induces vascular leak in TLR4- or TNF-α receptor-deficient mice at similar levels to wild-type animals. Finally, we blocked DENV NS1-induced vascular leak <italic>in vivo</italic> using inhibitors targeting molecules involved in glycocalyx disruption. Taken together, these data indicate that DENV NS1-induced endothelial cell-intrinsic vascular leak is independent of inflammatory cytokines but dependent on endothelial glycocalyx components.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Dengue is the most prevalent mosquito-transmitted disease in humans and a significant public health issue worldwide. Severe dengue disease is characterized by vascular leak, which can lead to shock and potentially death. We previously demonstrated that nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), the only protein secreted from dengue virus (DENV)-infected cells, can both trigger vascular leak in mice when given systemically and increase permeability in human pulmonary endothelial cells via disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx-like layer, the molecular barrier that lines blood vessels. NS1 also triggers release of inflammatory cytokines from immune cells through activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Here, we explored the relative contributions of inflammatory molecules and the endothelial glycocalyx-like layer to NS1-mediated pathogenesis. Using cultured human dermal endothelial cells and mice genetically deficient for TLR4 or TNF-α receptor, we showed inflammatory signaling is not required for direct DENV NS1-mediated vascular leak. In contrast, inhibition of molecules involved in glycocalyx disruption blocked DENV NS1-induced vascular leak both in mice and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Altogether, our results indicate that disruption of endothelial glycocalyx components but not production of inflammatory cytokines is required for the direct action of DENV NS1 on endothelial cells and suggest potential molecular targets for treatment of severe dengue disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dengue (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes up to 390 million infections, 96 million cases of dengue, and ~500,000 hospitalizations annually. Infection with any of the 4 DENV serotypes (DENV1-4) results in a spectrum of disease from inapparent infection to classic dengue fever (DF) to dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), characterized by vascular leakage and shock. The DENV positive-strand 10.7 kb RNA genome encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved into 3 structural proteins and 7 non-structural proteins. DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is synthesized by infected cells as a monomer (48 kDa), glycosylated in the ER, and released into the extracellular milieu as a hexamer (~310 kDa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref003">3</xref>]. Secreted DENV NS1 circulates in the blood during acute illness, and serum NS1 levels correlate with dengue disease severity, as does viral load (i.e., viremia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Under normal physiological conditions, the microvascular endothelium maintains a low permeability to fluids and molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref005">5</xref>]. Disruption of the endothelial barrier can result in excessive leak across the endothelium, a phenomenon known as hyperpermeability. Clinically, this manifests as vascular leakage, where fluid accumulates in tissues after extravasating from the vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref006">6</xref>]. Two of the primary determinants of endothelial barrier function are the endothelial glycocalyx and intercellular junctional complexes, such as tight and adherens junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref008">8</xref>]. The glycocalyx lines the luminal surface of the endothelium, protecting the underlying endothelial cells from shear forces and contributing to hemostasis, signaling, and blood cell-endothelial cell interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref009">9</xref>]. Disruption of the glycocalyx has been shown to lead to vascular pathology and has been previously hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref010">10</xref>], and modulation of the glycocalyx under inflammatory conditions is thought to contribute to various diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>DENV NS1 has been shown to play a role in viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref013">13</xref>] and immune evasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref015">15</xref>]. We recently showed that DENV NS1 can directly induce endothelial hyperpermeability <italic>in vitro</italic> and vascular leak <italic>in vivo</italic> in the absence of DENV infection, as well as lethally exacerbate an otherwise sublethal DENV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref016">16</xref>]. We also demonstrated that DENV NS1 can disrupt the endothelial glycocalyx-like layer (EGL) <italic>in vitro</italic> through the activation of endothelial sialidases and the cathepsin L/heparanase pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref017">17</xref>]. Further, glycocalyx components, such as heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, have been shown to circulate at higher levels in the sera of DENV-infected patients than healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref019">19</xref>]. Others recently showed that NS1 can also act through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on mononuclear cells to induce secretion of vasoactive cytokines, and systemic inoculation of NS1 alone leads to significant increases in circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines in our mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we sought to evaluate the relative contributions of cytokine-driven inflammatory mechanisms and NS1-induced EGL degradation to NS1 pathogenesis of the endothelium. Using an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of endothelial permeability, we found that DENV NS1 triggers hyperpermeability independently of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. <italic>In vivo</italic>, we demonstrated that DENV NS1 induces localized vascular leak in the dermis of wild-type mice and that this effect is specific to DENV NS1 and independent of TLR4 and TNF-α signaling. Finally, we showed that DENV NS1-induced endothelial dysfunction is dependent on endothelial sialidases, cathepsin L, and heparanase both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Taken together, our results indicate that DENV NS1 acts directly on the endothelium to induce vascular leak <italic>in vivo</italic> that is dependent on components of the glycocalyx.</p>

<title>DENV2 NS1 triggers localized vascular leak in the dorsal dermis of mice</title>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic>, vascular permeability is often assessed by intravenous (IV) injection of small-molecule dyes, such as the albumin-binding Evans Blue dye (EBD); extravasation into tissues is then quantified by extracting dye in formamide and measuring absorbance at 620 nm. To measure the induction of vascular leak by DENV NS1 in the dermal endothelium, we removed hair from the dorsal side of wild-type C57BL/6 (B6) mice and administered a retro-orbital (RO) injection of EBD and four intradermal (ID) injections: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a vehicle control, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, 200 ng) as a positive control, and DENV2 NS1 (7.5 μg and 15 μg) <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006673.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</bold> Two hours post-injection, the dorsal dermis of the mice was removed, and equal areas of tissue were excised for EBD quantification. We found that VEGF and 15 μg of DENV2 NS1 induced vascular leak at levels significantly higher than PBS (p ≤ 0.0001, p = 0.0085, respectively) <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006673.g001">Fig 1C</xref>)</bold>. These data demonstrate that DENV2 NS1 can induce vascular leak in the dermis of wild-type B6 mice.</p>

<p>To improve the sensitivity of the assay, we established a novel measure of vascular leak using IV injection of dextran molecules labeled with a fluorophore (Alexa Fluor 680), which can be quantified via fluorescent scanning. Similar to the traditional Evans Blue model, hair was removed from the dorsal side of wild-type B6 mice, fluorescent dextran was delivered RO, and the same four ID injections were administered as above <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006673.g001">Fig 1B</xref>)</bold>. Using this model, we found that VEGF and both 7.5 μg and 15 μg of DENV2 NS1 induced vascular leak at levels significantly higher than PBS (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.0001, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0230, <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.0001, respectively) <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006673.g001">Fig 1D</xref>)</bold>.

Untreated HMEC-1 were used as a steady-state control, and HMEC-1 treated with 10 ng/ml or 100 ng/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used as a positive control. We found that HMEC-1 did not produce IL-6 in response to DENV2 NS1 but did in response to both concentrations of LPS in a dose-dependent manner <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006673.g002">Fig 2A</xref>)</bold>. HMEC-1 did not produce detectable levels of TNF-α in response to either DENV2 NS1 or LPS <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006673.g002">Fig 2B</xref>)</bold>; LPS only stimulates production of TNF-α from endothelial cells in the presence of a secondary inflammatory signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref021">21</xref>].

<p>We previously demonstrated that the EGL is an important determinant of endothelial dysfunction triggered by DENV2 NS1 in HPMEC.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that DENV2 NS1 can directly trigger vascular leak in the dermis of wild-type B6 mice in the absence of viral infection and that this effect is specific to DENV2 NS1 and was not observed with WNV NS1. <italic>In vivo</italic>, TLR4 and TNF-α did not contribute to NS1-induced vascular leak in our dermal model, which reflects endothelial cell-intrinsic NS1-triggered leak. Consistent with this observation, human dermal endothelial cells did not produce TNF-α or IL-6 in response to DENV2 NS1 stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic>, nor was NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability mediated by these cytokines. Finally, we show that inhibition of endothelial sialidases, cathepsin L, and heparanase is sufficient to prevent vascular leak induction by DENV2 NS1 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Endothelial glycocalyx components have not previously been experimentally shown to play a role in dengue pathogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here, we showed that disruption of glycocalyx components is responsible for the induction of vascular leak observed in the murine dermis by DENV2 NS1. We were able to protect mice from local vascular leak using a combination of Zanamivir, Cathepsin L Inhibitor, and OGT 2115, demonstrating that the activity of endothelial sialidases, cathepsin L, and heparanase mediate the disruption of endothelial barrier function by DENV2 NS1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. These enzymes contribute to glycocalyx disruption via degradation of sialic acid and trimming of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Using our <italic>in vitro</italic> HMEC-1 model of endothelial permeability, we demonstrated that inhibition of each enzyme alone partially abrogated NS1-induced hyperpermeability, while the combination of all three inhibitors completely protected endothelial monolayers. Our results are consistent with previous findings that demonstrated that NS1 induces endothelial hyperpermeability by increasing expression of sialidases, cathepsin L, and heparanase in human pulmonary endothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref017">17</xref>]. These results suggest potential targets for novel therapeutics that inhibit enzymes that contribute to degradation of glycocalyx components for the treatment of severe dengue disease.</p>
<p>It has previously been shown that TLR4 is an important mediator of DENV NS1 pathogenesis, as NS1 activation of TLR4 on PBMCs leads to production of IL-6 and IL-8, cytokines that have been shown to contribute to endothelial barrier dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref020">20</xref>]. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of DENV2 NS1 on local and systemic vascular leak in TLR4-deficient B6 mice and found no significant differences in the levels of EBD and dextran extravasation in TLR4-deficient and wild-type mice following NS1 inoculation, suggesting that NS1 induces acute vascular leak that is not dependent on TLR4. In addition, infection of mice doubly deficient in TLR4 and IFNAR with a lethal dose of DENV2 did not result in significant differences in morbidity or mortality compared to IFNAR-deficient mice. However, slight differences were observed between wild-type and TLR4-deficient mice in all assays. In our model of localized vascular leak, levels of leak were marginally higher in <italic>Tlr4</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice, whereas levels were slightly lower in our systemic vascular leak model. In our DENV infection model, morbidity and mortality were both somewhat delayed in <italic>Ifnar</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> <italic>x Tlr4</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> B6 mice, though mice succumbed to infection at the same rates. Modhiran et al. found that LPS-RS, a potent antagonist of TLR4, and an anti-TLR4 antibody both protected HMEC-1 monolayers from DENV2 NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability as measured by TEER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref020">20</xref>]. These observations suggest that TLR4 does play a contributing role to NS1-induced vascular leak, but because substantial vascular leak, morbidity, and mortality are still observed in the absence of TLR4, we conclude there are additional, more critical drivers of NS1 pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Previously, we demonstrated that systemic administration of DENV2 NS1 resulted in significantly elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-α 72 hours post-injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref016">16</xref>]. We sought to evaluate whether endothelial cells produce these inflammatory cytokines in response to DENV2 NS1 in the absence of PBMCs. We demonstrated that HMEC-1 did not produce IL-6, TNF-α, or IL-8 in response to DENV2 NS1, although HMEC-1 produced high levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in response to the positive control, the TLR4 ligand LPS. Further, to evaluate the role of these cytokines in our HMEC-1 model of endothelial permeability, we measured TEER in the presence of both DENV2 NS1 and IL-6- and TNF-α-specific mAbs. We demonstrated that DENV2 NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability is independent of both IL-6 and TNF-α, although HMEC-1 can respond to both cytokines, an effect that is prevented with blocking antibodies. We then sought to determine the contribution of TNF-α to NS1-induced vascular leak <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using TNF-αR-deficient B6 mice, we found that DENV2 NS1 triggered similar levels of vascular leak in both knockout and wild-type mice. These results suggest that NS1 stimulation of endothelial cells does not result in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and that any directly pathogenic effects of NS1 on the endothelium occur independently of key endothelial cell-produced cytokines, further emphasizing the role of endothelial cell-specific mechanisms such as glycocalyx component disruption and mislocalization of intercellular junction proteins.</p>
<p>In humans, severe symptoms of vascular leak appear several days after the peak of NS1 antigenemia in blood has passed, suggesting a requirement for prolonged exposure to NS1 to cause severe leak and presumably reflecting the cumulative effects and accumulation of NS1 in target tissues. Our previous mouse model data, also requiring three days of exposure to NS1 delivered systemically before morbidity and mortality were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref016">16</xref>], suggest that the induction of systemic vascular leak caused by NS1 is cumulative over time <italic>in vivo</italic>. The NS1 dose that we used here in our <italic>in vivo</italic> model of localized vascular leak was meant to reflect the cumulative effect of NS1 in tissues, allowing us to simulate the effects of NS1 on the endothelium in a shorter time span. Overall, the endothelial-intrinsic mechanisms we observe following NS1 inoculation in the dermis may be working in conjunction with NS1 activation of TLR4 on the surface of PBMCs and release of inflammatory cytokines to contribute to systemic vascular leak observed in both our previous findings and clinical manifestations of DHF and DSS.</p>
<p>Clinically, DHF and DSS are both characterized by vascular leak and endothelial dysfunction in multiple organs. The lungs are particularly affected, with pulmonary edema representing a common complication in severe dengue disease. We have previously published a study identifying the EGL as a required determinant of endothelial barrier function in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref017">17</xref>], and our <italic>in vitro</italic> results here further support that DENV2 NS1 triggers endothelial hyperpermeability in HPMEC in a cytokine-independent manner in the absence of virus and non-endothelial cell types. Further, petechiae are an additional sign of capillary fragility and leak in dengue disease in humans, and previous reports have shown that DENV is absent at the site of rash and petechiae in dengue fever patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref022">22</xref>], though DENV antigens have been found in skin biopsies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref023">23</xref>]. Here, we demonstrated the ability of DENV2 NS1 to trigger localized vascular leak in the absence of virus in the mouse dermis, suggesting a potential link between DENV NS1 and formation of petechiae. Combined with our results in HPMEC, our findings suggest that NS1 may be an important contributor to vascular leak in various tissue sites during DENV disease.</p>
<p>The glycocalyx has been previously implicated in plasma leakage in DENV-infected patients. Nguyen-Pouplin et al. performed dextran fractional clearance studies in a group of Vietnamese dengue patients with evidence of vascular leak and in healthy controls and found that there was no difference in dextran clearance between infected and healthy patients, seemingly contradictory results. However, their data suggest that the dextran administered for the study may have helped stabilize the glycocalyx following loss of plasma proteins during DENV infection, thereby restoring glycocalyx integrity and normal endothelial barrier function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref010">10</xref>]. More recent studies have evaluated different glycocalyx components in patient sera during acute DENV infection and found that serum levels of hyaluronic acid, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and syndecan-1 are all elevated, suggesting disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx by DENV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Ascertainment that disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx is mediated by DENV NS1 entails direct visualization of the glycocalyx layer <italic>in vivo</italic>. As the glycocalyx is a delicate and complex structure, this direct visualization requires challenging techniques, such as intravital microscopy, two-photon microscopy, and electron microscopy, which have previously been used to image the glycocalyx in live mice and in fixed murine tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref027">27</xref>]. Further, though cultured endothelial cells express key components of the glycocalyx on their surface, they do not necessarily express a true glycocalyx structure <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus, drawing definitive conclusions regarding the glycocalyx and its role in dengue disease is difficult; however, we believe our results support a critical role for glycocalyx components and thus implicitly for the glycocalyx in vascular leak, though further validation <italic>in vivo</italic> is necessary.</p>
<p>As we have previously speculated, we believe that DENV NS1 induces endothelial hyperpermeability following its internalization by endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref017">17</xref>]. After NS1 binds to an as-yet unidentified receptor, internalization may then facilitate NS1 interaction with cathepsin L (which can then cleave heparanase into an active form) and the endothelial sialidase Neu1, both of which are localized in lysosomal compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref029">29</xref>]. It is also possible that binding and downstream signaling triggers activation of these enzymes, specifically Neu3, which is localized to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref030">30</xref>]. Preliminary data from our laboratory suggests that inhibition of endocytic pathways in endothelial cells may protect monolayers <italic>in vitro</italic> from DENV NS1-induced hyperpermeability. Further research is required to fully elucidate the mechanisms driving DENV NS1-related pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Finally, our model improves upon the existing Miles assay that uses Evans Blue dye as a tracer for vascular leak. By using dextran conjugated to Alexa Fluor 680, we were able to observe greater differences between groups in our model, as well as decreased variability as compared to using EBD. Additionally, we are able to evaluate positive and negative controls alongside experimental conditions in the same animal. These factors serve to decrease the total number of mice required to achieve statistical significance of our data, saving on costs and contributing to the overall goal of limiting animal numbers used in experiments. Additionally, this method does not require excision of individual spots or extraction of dye but allows for direct imaging of the skin on a fluorescent scanner, thereby decreasing the time spent processing each animal and allowing for faster development and analysis of results. Compared to our systemic models of vascular leak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006673.ref016">16</xref>], the modified Miles assay facilitates the evaluation of the direct and immediate effects of NS1 on the vascular endothelium, as ID injections deliver the protein to a localized spot. Additionally, this allows for usage of substantially lower quantities of NS1 protein. It is, however, possible that compounds delivered intradermally may interact with resident dermal immune cells or the abluminal surface of the endothelium following inoculation. Thus, results obtained in the intradermal assay should be validated using intravenous delivery of NS1 in a systemic model of leak, as we have done here.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results contribute to the growing body of literature demonstrating a critical role for NS1 in dengue pathogenesis, specifically in its contributions to directly pathogenic effects on the vascular endothelium. We show that DENV2 NS1-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction is not related to inflammatory cytokines in a mouse model of dermal vascular leak or in endothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> but that instead, specific endothelial enzymes that degrade components of the endothelial glycocalyx layer are required. Overall, these findings further illustrate the role of NS1 in the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease and highlight the importance of the endothelial glycocalyx in vascular leak, suggesting targets for novel therapeutics in the treatment of DHF and DSS.</p>
