<abstract>
<p>Scaffold proteins are ubiquitous chaperones that promote efficient interactions between partners of multi-enzymatic protein complexes; although they are well studied in eukaryotes, their role in prokaryotic systems is poorly understood. Bacterial membranes have functional membrane microdomains (FMM), a structure homologous to eukaryotic lipid rafts. Similar to their eukaryotic counterparts, bacterial FMM harbor a scaffold protein termed flotillin that is thought to promote interactions between proteins spatially confined to the FMM. Here we used biochemical approaches to define the scaffold activity of the flotillin homolog FloA of the human pathogen <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, using assembly of interacting protein partners of the type VII secretion system (T7SS) as a case study. <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> cells that lacked FloA showed reduced T7SS function, and thus reduced secretion of T7SS-related effectors, probably due to the supporting scaffold activity of flotillin. We found that the presence of flotillin mediates intermolecular interactions of T7SS proteins. We tested several small molecules that interfere with flotillin scaffold activity, which perturbed T7SS activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results suggest that flotillin assists in the assembly of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> membrane components that participate in infection and influences the infective potential of this pathogen.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The recently discovered functional membrane microdomains (FMM) of prokaryotic cells contain a protein homologous to the scaffold protein flotillin found in eukaryotic lipid rafts. It remains to be elucidated whether, like their eukaryotic counterparts, flotillin homolog proteins have a scaffold function in bacteria. Here we show that the <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> flotillin FloA acts as a scaffold protein, to promote more efficient assembly of membrane-associated protein interacting partners of multi-enzyme complexes. In a case study, we provide biochemical evidence that FloA participates in assembly of the Type VII secretion system and thus contributes to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infective potential. Targeted dispersion of FMM-related processes using anti-FMM molecules opens up new perspectives for microbial therapies to treat persistent <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Scaffold proteins, which are responsible for tethering proteins and facilitating multi-enzymatic biological reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref003">3</xref>], are found ubiquitously in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. These proteins were first identified in eukaryotic cells, where they have been traditionally studied. They play an important role in numerous signaling cascades, as they increase the interaction efficiency of signaling proteins by concentrating them locally and positioning kinases near their substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref005">5</xref>]. Biological reactions are more efficient if scaffold proteins tether protein partners and facilitate interactions. This scaffold role might apply to both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, although the precise function in prokaryotes is not well understood. Several scaffold proteins have nonetheless been described in bacteria and their molecular mechanisms characterized. For instance, the scaffold UspC regulates the K<sup>+</sup> uptake signaling cascade in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref006">6</xref>], and GraX is a scaffold that participates in a signaling transduction cascade in response to antibiotics in the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>A new type of scaffold protein was recently found in association with bacterial cell membranes. These proteins are homologs of the so-called flotillin proteins that localize preferentially to membrane lipid rafts in eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref014">14</xref>]. Bacterial flotillins are found in discrete membrane regions termed functional membrane microdomains (FMM), which differ in lipid composition from the rest of the membrane and spatially confine several proteins involved in signal transduction (sensor kinases), protein trafficking (ABC transporters and protein secretion machineries) and other multi-protein enzymatic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref016">16</xref>]. FMM thus resemble the lipid rafts of eukaryotic cells in certain organizational and functional aspects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref017">17</xref>]. Flotillin scaffold activity in eukaryotic lipid rafts centers on recruiting raft-associated proteins to the rafts and catalyzing more efficient interaction or oligomerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref022">22</xref>]. Bacterial flotillins probably have a similar role, and their scaffold activity might also facilitate more efficient interactions and oligomerization of protein partners within FMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref023">23</xref>]. The biological significance of bacterial flotillins is nonetheless incompletely understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>The Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> is currently the best-established model for study of the physiological relevance of flotillins and FMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref014">14</xref>]. <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> FMM contain two flotillin-like proteins, FloT and FloA, which interact physically and recruit various proteins to the FMM. Strains lacking both of these flotillins show altered function of FMM-associated protein complexes, such as sensor kinase dimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref025">25</xref>], FtsH-mediated protease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref013">13</xref>], and protein secretion via Sec machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref009">9</xref>]. Current research links flotillin activity and correct function of virulence-related cell processes in Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The Gram-positive pathogen <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> expresses a flotillin homolog, FlotP, that is structurally similar to <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> FloT (~65% identity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref026">26</xref>]. Subcellular FlotP localization is associated with membrane integrity, and alteration of its distribution correlates with a decrease in toxin secretion. In Gram-negative pathogens, a flotillin-defective <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> strain is unable to adhere to or be internalized by epithelial cells, resulting in impaired virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref027">27</xref>]; experiments in mice showed that this mutant did not cause campylobacteriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref028">28</xref>]. Despite the number of examples that correlate flotillin activity with correct function of cell processes in bacteria, a precise molecular description of how flotillin contributes to the activation of these processes has yet to be elucidated.</p>
<p>The flotillin of the human pathogen <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> is 84% identical to <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> FloA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref012">12</xref>]. Inhibition of flotillin activity interferes with oligomerization of FMM-associated proteins in other bacterial models, and flotillin-lacking pathogenic strains show attenuated virulence. Such inhibition could thus be a strategy by which to disable virulence-related protein complexes in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, which is currently a major problem in both clinical and community settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref029">29</xref>]. MRSA (methicillin-resistant <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>) invasive infections are difficult to treat and have a ~20% mortality rate in clinical contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref030">30</xref>].

<p>Successful translocation of these T7SS substrates through the membrane requires the four membrane proteins EsaA, EssA-EssC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref033">33</xref>]. While little is known of the molecular function of EsaA or EssA, available crystal structures of EssB and EssC suggest that EssB is a single-pass transmembrane protein that forms a conditional dimer with large extra- and intracellular domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref041">41</xref>]. EssC is a FtsK/SpoIIIE homolog with several ATPase domains, probably to provide energy for translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref044">44</xref>]. The oligomerization state of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> T7SS is currently debated. The homologous secretion system from mycobacteria typically forms membrane-bound complexes &gt;1 MDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref050">50</xref>] and similarly sized complexes have recently been purified from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref051">51</xref>]. This is in contrast to a recent report showing that T7SS membrane proteins form only homo-oligomers and might not interact with one another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref052">52</xref>]; these proteins might not form large oligomers, at difference from other bacterial T7SS. Structural analyses of EssB and EssC in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> nonetheless identified distinct domains that act as hubs for protein-protein interactions (the EssC FHA domain or the EssB pseudokinase fold), which suggests that multimerization is an important feature of this protein machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref051">51</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we identified the T7SS as a complex associated with the FMM in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>.

We demonstrate that microdomain dissociation by genetic depletion of the FloA scaffold leads to decreased T7SS activity, probably due to less efficient T7SS membrane protein interaction. FMM dispersal by small anti-FMM molecule inhibitors and concomitant reduction of FloA scaffold activity similarly leads to reduced T7SS activity.</p>

<title>T7SS proteins are part of the DRM</title>
<p>To identify new FMM-associated protein complex candidates, we quantified proteomes of detergent-sensitive (DSM) and -resistant (DRM) membrane fractions using a biochemical approach designed to purify eukaryotic raft-associated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref054">54</xref>]. This approach is based on the ability of rafts to resist disaggregation by treatment with non-ionic detergent (Triton X-100, Brij, CHAPS). Differences in lipid composition make rafts more compact than the remainder of the cell membrane and more resistant to detergent disaggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref054">54</xref>]. After detergent treatment, large hydrophobic membrane fragments enriched in FMM can be concentrated in a DRM fraction using a phase separation approach. This allows comparison to a DSM fraction that is sensitive to detergent disaggregation, as it is comprised mainly of phospholipids and does not concentrate to the hydrophobic phase during phase separation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref006">6</xref>]. As FloA expression is higher and its activity possibly more important, we used stationary cultures of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> cells to isolate DRM and DSM fractions and quantify the proteins by label-free quantification (LFQ) mass spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref055">55</xref>]. We plotted LFQ intensities of DRM fraction proteins against those of the DSM fraction, which led to separation into four protein populations (I-IV; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006728.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). The first population (I) consisted of proteins detected exclusively in the DSM fraction; population II and III proteins were found in both DRM and DSM, with greater abundance in the DSM (II) or DRM fraction (III). Population IV was associated exclusively with the DRM fraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006728.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Most of the proteins we associated with DRM fractions were histidine kinases, lipoproteins, transporters, or components of protein complexes; we identified 12 of 13 known membrane-bound histidine kinases and more than 85% of all identified components of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> membrane transporters (ABC transporters; ion, nutrient and metabolite transporters) in DRM-associated populations (III, IV) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006728.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). Proteins involved in division, like FtsA, FtsY or FtsI, were generally detected in DSM populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006728.s001">S1B and S1D Fig</xref>). Nonetheless, sequence analysis of the DRM and DSM proteins categorized by this approach did not lead to the identification of any common features within each protein population (I-IV) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006728.s001">S1C Fig</xref>); all proteins identified for each population are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006728.s010">S1 Table</xref>. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that FMM, which are very concentrated in the DRM fractions, mainly contain proteins that require protein-protein interaction or form part of protein complexes.</p>
<p>During our data analysis, we detected several proteins of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> T7SS, significantly enriched in the DRM fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g001">Fig 1B</xref>); these included membrane proteins EsaA, EssA, EssB, which suggested that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> T7SS is physically and functionally associated to FMM. We used purified DRM and DSM fractions to measure T7SS membrane proteins EsaA, EssA, EssB and EssC by immunodetection, using polyclonal antibodies to EsaA, EssB or EssC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref033">33</xref>]. EssA was fused to the codon-optimized RFP variant MARS and detected with polyclonal anti-mCherry antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref056">56</xref>]. Western blot analyses confirmed EsaA, EssA and EssB enrichment in the DRM fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Signals attributable to EssB and EsaA were enriched in the DRM fraction (~10- and 2-fold, respectively), and immunodetection of EssA-MARS showed most of the signal associated with this fraction. EssC was also detected in the DRM fraction, although it was not markedly enriched in this fraction compared to the DSM. These data are consistent with the LFQ mass spectrometry findings and correlate T7SS and DRM in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. Based on these results, we hypothesized that T7SS proteins are associated with the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> FMM, probably in a transient manner, as we did not detect all T7SS membrane-associated proteins exclusively in the DRM fraction.</p>
<p>The FMM are specific membrane regions that probably act as oligomerization platforms. They spatially confine interacting protein partners and promote efficient interaction/oligomerization of multiprotein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref057">57</xref>]. The membrane-bound scaffold protein flotillin localizes preferentially to the FMM. Flotillin probably has an important role in tethering interacting proteins and facilitates oligomerization, similar to its function in eukaryotic lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref023">23</xref>]. To determine whether the T7SS-related membrane proteins in the DRM fractions are among the flotillin-tethered protein partners, we used a bacterial two-hybrid assay in a heterologous <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> system, in which <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> flotillin (FloA) and T7SS membrane proteins were tagged with T25 or T18 fragments of an adenylate cyclase. After flotillin interaction with T7SS proteins, the enzyme is reconstituted, produces cAMP and triggers expression of a measurable cAMP-inducible <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref058">58</xref>]. We detected strong interaction between FloA and EssB (&gt;2000 Miller Units; a 700 Miller Unit threshold defines positive and negative interaction signals), with no consistent interactions between FloA and EsaA, EssA or EssC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006728.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Our protein-protein interaction analyses in a heterologous system thus suggest interaction between flotillin and the membrane-bound T7SS protein EssB from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> T7SS.</p>

<p>We extended the FloA-EssB interaction analyses to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> cells and performed pulldown experiments to identify interaction between FloA and EssB, using a FLAG-EssB, FloA-His double-labeled strain. FloA-His is a functional construct used in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref059">59</xref>]. The FLAG-EssB construct was functional when expressed in a <italic>ΔessB</italic> genetic background, as immunodetection experiments of the EsxC substrate in culture supernatants showed that this complemented strain rescued the <italic>ΔessB</italic> mutant secretion defect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006728.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref039">39</xref>]. A purified membrane fraction of this FLAG-EssB, FloA-His double-labeled strain was loaded on a column of Ni-NTA/His-tag resin selective for proteins that bind directly or indirectly to FloA-His. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and FLAG-EssB was detected by immunoblotting using monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies. A FLAG-EssB signal was detected in the eluted sample of the double-labeled strain, suggesting that EssB co-eluted with FloA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In contrast, the elution fraction of FloA-His and FLAG-EssB single-labeled strains showed no signal, which implies that EssB retention on the column was FloA-dependent.</p>

<p>We used stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy to examine EssB and FloA signal colocalization in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> cells. STED microscopy is a super-resolution technique previously used in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> to demonstrate partial colocalization of FMM-associated proteins with the scaffold protein FloA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref024">24</xref>]. Pull-down experiments or BN-PAGE coupled to immunoblotting have shown that flotillin interacts directly or indirectly with these FMM-associated proteins, and that this interaction contributes to FMM-associated complex oligomerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref057">57</xref>]. Partial colocalization of FloA with FloA-interacting FMM protein cargo is likely because flotillin does not form part of these oligomeric complexes and is thus not strictly necessary for their activity. The role of flotillin could be transient, to facilitate oligomerization of multimeric complexes that then act in a flotillin-independent manner. This is consistent with the role of FMM as oligomerization platforms, to promote efficient interaction between protein partners. To study FloA and EssB colocalization, we immunodetected these proteins in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> cells, using specific antibodies. Subcellular signal localization in double-labeled samples was examined using STED microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, top panel). Traditional colocalization studies focus on 1:1 ratios of red- and green-labeled proteins, resulting in a merged yellow signal. Proteins abundant at different ratios still colocalize, but are falsely disregarded using this approach. We determined protein colocalization independent of the relative FloA and EssB abundance, and present the results in a white colocalization map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, bottom). The flotillin signal was distributed in 1–6 fluorescent foci per cell, whereas the EssB signal formed 1–4 membrane foci. Using this method, we determined that 27% of the total EssB signal showed an overlap with FloA fluorescent signal. Thus, 73% of the EssB did not overlap with FloA and 68% of FloA did not overlap with EssB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). This partial colocalization indicates biochemical interactions of EssB and FloA and suggests that this EssB and FloA interaction occurs in a transient manner, similar to previous flotillin-associated interactions.</p>

<title>T7SS secretion is low in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> cells lacking flotillin</title>
<p>Having determined that EssB is enriched in the DRM fraction and interacts with FloA, we analyzed FloA influence on T7SS activity; this is an important aspect of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> virulence, since EssB is essential for secretion of T7SS effectors during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref039">39</xref>]. We compared the levels of the T7SS substrates EsxA and EsxB and of EsxC in wild type or FloA-defective cells in culture supernatants. EsxA and EsxB were C-terminally labeled with a FLAG-tag and expressed under the control of a constitutive promoter. Culture supernatant proteins were concentrated by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation, and EsxA- and EsxB-FLAG were immunodetected with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies and EsxC with EsxC-specific polyclonal antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref033">33</xref>]. The <italic>ΔfloA</italic> mutation might alter other secretory protein complexes in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, like the Sec system defect in a <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> flotillin-deficient strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref009">9</xref>]. To normalize total <italic>ΔfloA</italic> mutant-to-wild type secreted protein in immunoblot analyses, we normalized cell culture optical density and added a defined concentration of an unrelated protein to supernatants. We added purified denatured YtnP lactonase (25 μg/ml) from <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref060">60</xref>] to supernatants before TCA precipitation, and we used polyclonal anti-YtnP antibodies to trace YtnP concentration and thus ensure comparable concentration of the supernatant. In this system, EsxA-FLAG and EsxB-FLAG showed a marked decrease in supernatants from the Δ<italic>floA</italic> mutant compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g003">Fig 3</xref>); EsxC substrate was also decreased in Δ<italic>floA</italic> compared to wild type supernatants, which implied an important flotillin role in T7SS activity. Quantitative differences in T7SS substrates in the supernatant are probably due to reduced T7SS secretion efficiency rather than reduced abundance of its components, as immunodetection indicated similar EsaA, EssA, EssB and EssC protein levels in wild type and Δ<italic>floA</italic> mutant whole cell extracts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006728.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Flotillin mediates T7SS intermolecular interactions</title>
<p>The most direct hypothesis as to how flotillin influences T7SS activity is that its scaffold activity promotes T7SS stability or assembly by tethering interacting proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref003">3</xref>].

<p>EssB oligomerizes <italic>in vitro</italic> and forms conditional dimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref041">41</xref>], although <italic>in vivo</italic> homo- or hetero-oligomerization has not been detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref052">52</xref>]. We thus tested whether FloA scaffold activity affects EssB oligomerization directly. FLAG-EssB-labeled <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> was cultured to stationary growth phase and membrane protein extracts (0.25% DDM, 4°C) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006728.s005">S5A Fig</xref>) were resolved by 3-12% gradient Blue-Native (BN)-PAGE, which allows separation of membrane protein complexes into their natural oligomeric states (30–10,000 kDa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref061">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref063">63</xref>]. FLAG-EssB was immunodetected using specific anti-FLAG antibodies. We observed a signal attributable to EssB at &gt;250 kDa, which indicates that EssB forms stable oligomers <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006728.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). Protein samples crosslinked using DSP (dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate)) prior to cell lysis showed EssB-containing oligomers &gt;1 MDa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006728.s005">S5B Fig</xref>), which indicated the existence of large EssB-containing complexes in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> cells. We applied this experimental approach using anti-FLAG epitope antibodies to compare FLAG-EssB-labeled wild type and Δ<italic>floA</italic> mutant membrane fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Wild type cells usually showed two signals that corresponded to distinct EssB oligomeric states (&gt;1 MDa), whereas Δ<italic>floA</italic> mutant showed one &gt;1 MDa signal that did not coincide with either wild type band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In addition to these differences, we detected an intensity increase in a low molecular weight signal (~250 kDa) in the Δ<italic>floA</italic> mutant compared to the wild type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, right, bottom arrow). These results suggest an important role for FloA in formation of EssB-containing high molecular weight complexes in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>.</p>
<p>To ascertain whether these very large protein complexes are EssB homo-oligomers or are constituted by other T7SS proteins, we analyzed FLAG-EssB in a pulldown analysis using FLAG-capture beads. Beads captured FLAG-EssB as well as EssB-associated proteins, which were eluted, resolved in SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted, which indicated EssA, EssC and an EsaA fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The polyclonal EsaA antibody did not detect full-length EsaA in the pull-down assay, but showed fragmented EsaA, which is also detected in membrane fractions. Similar fragmentation is reported for the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> EsaA homolog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref064">64</xref>]. The wild type and Δ<italic>floA</italic> eluted fractions showed EssC and the EsaA fragment in comparable amounts, but no EssA was detected in the Δ<italic>floA</italic> fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). These data suggest that flotillin mediates the EssB-EssA interaction.</p>
<p>To better understand the flotillin effect on the EssB-EssA interaction, we used a bacterial three-hybrid assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref057">57</xref>] to measure EssB-EssA oligomerization efficiency, alone or with FloA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). A bacterial two-hybrid assay in which EssB and EssA were tagged respectively with the T25 and T18 catalytic domains, was complemented with a modular vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref065">65</xref>] that expressed <italic>floA</italic>. Whereas there was no EssB-EssA interaction in the absence of FloA, the EssB-EssA interaction signal was increased when FloA was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). FloA did not affect the EssB interaction with other T7SS membrane proteins (EsaA or EssC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006728.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), which implied that FloA scaffold activity is specific to the EssB-EssA interaction. This finding indicates the importance of FloA expression in T7SS protein-protein interactions and supports the hypothesis that flotillin acts as a scaffold to promote EssB-EssA interaction.</p>
<p>To determine whether this FloA activity is sufficient to promote T7SS protein oligomerization, we genetically engineered an orthogonal T7SS system in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, in which the T7SS membrane proteins EsaA, EssA, EssB and EssC were isolated from their native complex oligomerization network, and thus free from interference by potential staphylococcal oligomerization inputs. EsaA, EssA, EssB and EssC proteins were expressed alone (-FloA) or in the presence of FloA (+FloA). Solubilized membrane fractions were purified, proteins extracted and their oligomerization states identified by BN-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-EssB antibody. In the absence of FloA (-FloA), EssB signals were observed in the 200-400 kDa range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), similar to EssB oligomers detected in uncrosslinked staphylococcal membranes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006728.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). In the presence of FloA (+FloA), EssB oligomeric species shifted towards higher molecular weight complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), indicating that FloA affects EssB oligomerization and potentially other T7SS complex components in the orthogonal biosystem.</p>

<title>The T7SS secretion defect of Δ<italic>floA</italic> is relevant during an infection</title>
<p>Targeting of flotillin scaffold activity could be an appropriate strategy for fighting bacterial infection by perturbing oligomerization of multiple virulence-related protein complexes such as T7SS. In mice, the T7SS Esx substrates participate in formation of persistent abscesses, probably due to the virulence of EsxA, EsxB, EsxC and EsxD secreted proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref066">66</xref>]. In addition, EsxC is an immunogenic substrate, and kidney abscesses are associated with the generation of anti-EsxC antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref032">32</xref>]. In a murine infection model similar to that of Burts et al.

<title>Small anti-FMM molecules reduce T7SS activity</title>
<p>To target flotillin activity exogenously and develop alternative strategies against staphylococcal infections, we tested several small molecules known to interfere with FMM organization in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref059">59</xref>]. The small molecule zaragozic acid (ZA) is a potential inhibitor of flotillin activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref012">12</xref>], as it blocks <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> squalene synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref069">69</xref>], which is needed to produce the polyisoprenoid lipids that stabilize flotillin in the FMM. When bacteria are exposed to micromolar ZA concentrations, flotillin organizes in a smaller number of membrane foci, concomitant with a reduction in its chaperone activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref012">12</xref>]. Similar to ZA, the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin used to treat patients with hypercholesterolemia, inhibits the same polyisoprenoid lipid production pathways in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. Simvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme upstream of squalene synthase in the constituent lipid biosynthesis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref070">70</xref>]. We included the small molecule 5-DSA (5-doxyl-stearic acid), a lipid probe that accumulates in biological membranes and is used to monitor membrane fluidity in lipid raft organization studies in eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref071">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref072">72</xref>]. In addition, 5-DSA is reported to displace certain membrane lipids and alter the function of various membrane-associated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref073">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref074">74</xref>].</p>
<p>Wild type <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strains were grown in liquid TSB medium with different concentrations of simvastatin, 5-DSA and ZA to define the highest concentrations that did not affect <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> growth (20 μM simvastatin, 150 μM 5-DSA, 50 μM ZA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). We used fluorescence microscopy to monitor anti-FMM activity by evaluating FloA subcellular distribution. We quantified the number of fluorescent foci of a FloA-MARS strain grown with simvastatin, 5-DSA or ZA. Most untreated cells showed one, two or three fluorescent foci; occasional cells had no fluorescent foci or had four or more foci. Treatment with 20 μM simvastatin or 50 μM ZA reduced the number of fluorescent FloA foci per cell, and 150 μM 5-DSA treatment showed a drastic reduction in the number of foci per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006728.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). The altered subcellular localization of FloA-MARS in the presence of anti-FMM molecules was not a result of decreased flotillin in the cell membrane or its displacement to the cytosol, as shown by immunoblot analysis of fractionated cells after anti-FMM treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). We thus suggest that these molecules severely alter FMM organization and probably affect associated processes.</p>

<p>To determine whether 5-DSA, simvastatin or ZA also affected T7SS assembly and organization, we repeated BN-PAGE analysis as above. Without crosslinking, the FloA-interacting protein EssB only formed oligomers at ~250 kDa; high molecular weight protein complexes were not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g008">Fig 8A</xref>, left). DSP treatment before cell lysis allowed stabilization of high molecular weight complexes, and 5-DSA, simvastatin, and ZA treatment led to a decrease in the high molecular weight signal in wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g008">Fig 8A</xref>, center). This was consistent with the increase in low molecular weight species detected in 5-DSA-, simvastatin-, or ZA-treated samples compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g008">Fig 8A</xref>, right, bottom arrow).

<p>We tested whether 5-DSA, simvastatin or ZA treatments also inhibit T7SS secretion <italic>in vitro</italic>. To define this, we monitored secretion of the T7SS substrates EsxA, EsxB and EsxC in stationary phase cultures. Concentrated proteins from supernatants of untreated and simvastatin-, 5-DSA- and ZA-treated cultures were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed in immunoblot. Simvastatin-, 5-DSA- and ZA-treated cultures showed a notable reduction in secreted EsxA, EsxB and EsxC, particularly marked in ZA-treated cells, for which no signals were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). To determine the localization of the T7SS substrates, we analyzed cell extracts by immunoblot, which showed EsxA, EsxB and EsxC signals in the cytoplasmic fraction of treated cultures. Simvastatin, 5-DSA and ZA in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> cultures thus compromised T7SS activity and reduced T7SS substrate secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).

<p>The ZA inhibitory effect on T7SS activity via FMM perturbation led us to test ZA-mediated T7SS inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic> in the murine infection model. We administered 20 mg/kg ZA to a cohort of BALB/c mice via intraperitoneal injection, followed by challenge with sublethal doses of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. This procedure was repeated twice (days 14 and 28); after 40 days mice were sacrificed and serum was collected for ELISA determination of immunoglobulin titers to EsxA, EsxB, EsxC and EsxD substrates. IgM antibody titers against all T7SS Esx substrates decreased for all T7SS Esx substrates, which was statistically significant for EsxB, EsxC and EsxD compared to levels in infected untreated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). These results indicate that ZA inhibits secretion of T7SS-related substrates <italic>in vivo</italic>, probably by reducing secretion efficiency.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The role of scaffold proteins in prokaryotic cells is being studied for a number of bacterial species. These proteins are thought to have a central role in regulating assembly of protein-protein interactions; their activity is thus important for correct function of many biological reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref075">75</xref>]. We show that the scaffold protein flotillin (FloA) promotes more efficient interaction in a multimeric complex involved in staphylococcal virulence. Here we used FloA-mediated T7SS secretion as a case study to evaluate FloA scaffold activity, although FloA might also contribute to oligomerization of other DRM fraction multimeric complexes with a role in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> virulence.</p>
<p>Lack of FloA causes a reduction in T7SS substrate secretion <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, which implies an important FloA function in T7SS oligomerization. Additional possibilities for the role of flotillin in T7SS oligomerization should also be considered, for instance, that lack of flotillin causes changes in membrane stiffness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref009">9</xref>], which might affect T7SS oligomerization indirectly. We nonetheless found that FloA interacts with the T7SS membrane component EssB, thus facilitating its interaction with EssA and probably with other T7SS protein components; this highlights the importance of FloA for T7SS oligomerization, although T7SS organization remains unclear. Whereas FloA scaffold activity assists oligomerization of complexes such as T7SS, FloA is not a T7SS structural protein; it probably contributes to more efficient complex assembly, although FloA activity is not absolutely essential for the activity of these complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref076">76</xref>]. In fact, some T7SS oligomerization and secretion of T7SS effectors are detectable in the absence of FloA. Bacterial flotillin might thus have a transient role, acting as a scaffold for oligomerization of membrane-associated protein complexes, whose subsequent activity is flotillin-independent. Flotillin might contribute to organizing FMM membrane microdomains, which are specialized in confining specific protein complexes, and to promoting their efficient oligomerization; these complexes will be excluded from the FMM once oligomerized.</p>
<p>Bacterial FMM appear to facilitate efficient oligomerization of FMM-associated protein complexes (FMM act as “oligomerization factories”) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref012">12</xref>], and flotillin scaffold activity has a key role in facilitating interaction of FMM-associated membrane protein partners. Biochemical approaches such as pull-down experiments or BN-PAGE coupled with immunodetection demonstrated flotillin interaction with FMM-associated proteins, as well as its importance for correct oligomerization of protein partners in various bacterial species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref077">77</xref>].</p>
<p>FMM are dynamic structures and move across the bacterial membrane in milliseconds. STED fluorescence microscopy was used to show partial flotillin colocalization (milliseconds) with various FMM protein partners such as FtsH and SecA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref024">24</xref>], previously identified in pull-down studies as flotillin interactors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref013">13</xref>]. In the STED study, partial FloA colocalization with FtsH and SecA contrasted with full flotillin colocalization with NfeD, which implies that partial colocalization was not due to experimental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref024">24</xref>]. The structural FMM proteins FloA and NfeD form part of the same operon, are expressed at similar levels, and are thus present in an equal ratio. When one is green- and one is red-labeled, colocalization is detected as a merged yellow signal. Most FMM cargo proteins are not expressed at the same ratio as FloA, however, and this approach can lead to false negative results due to differences in protein levels/signal intensities. To overcome these drawbacks, we studied FloA colocalization with FMM cargo proteins using a method that focuses on the signal, independent of its intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref078">78</xref>]. Colocalization of proteins in unequal ratios can be detected using high-resolution microscopy images. Full colocalization of cargo proteins with flotilin would not be anticipated, as flotillin is not a structural component of these complexes.</p>
<p>Protein interaction with FloA in pull-down experiments, and partial colocalization using STED microscopy support the hypothesis that FMM act as oligomerization platforms, in which flotillin and probably other structural proteins like NfeD assist FMM organization. The NfeD/FloA interaction is stable and would help maintain correct FMM architecture. In contrast, flotillin interaction with the FMM protein cargo is probably transient, as this interaction facilitates efficient oligomerization of protein partners. Protein complexes will thus dissociate from flotillin once oligomerized and will abandon FMM.</p>
<p>Using a number of biochemical approaches, we detected FloA interaction with EssB, and showed partial FloA/EssB colocalization using STED microscopy. We thus propose a model to explore the role of FMM and FloA in T7SS organization, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006728.g009">Fig 9</xref>. The FloA interaction with EssB facilitates EssB-EssA binding; as EssB and EssA are significantly enriched in the DRM, this binding probably takes place in FMM. In contrast, FloA does not influence EssB interaction with other T7SS proteins (EsaA, EssC), since EsaA and EssC are detected in pull-down experiments in a Δ<italic>floA</italic> mutant background. We hypothesize the formation of an EssC-EsaA-EssB pre-complex, and EssA incorporation via FloA scaffold activity to generate T7SS in a flotillin-dependent manner.</p>

<title>Model of FloA/FMM-mediated T7SS assembly.</title>
<p>I.) A pre-existing, probably non-functional T7SS complex consisting of EssC, EsaA and an EssB oligomer (here represented by two EssB molecules) resides in the non-FMM membrane (yellow). FMM (green) contain EssA and FloA. II.) The EssC-EsaA-EssB pre-complex is transiently recruited to the FMM. This allows FloA to interact with EssB. III.) FloA scaffold activity promotes EssB-EssA interaction. This could help to incorporate EssA into the EssC-EsaA-EssB pre-complex. IV.) The fully assembled T7SS complex is released from FMM and is now functional.</p>

<p>Although our data indicate a large T7SS hetero-oligomer, the nature of T7SS assembly is currently debated. Some reports argue that T7SS assembly in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> resembles that in mycobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref051">51</xref>], but there are also experimental evidences that interactions between T7SS protein components in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> cells are exclusively homomeric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref052">52</xref>]. Based on our results, we consider that both hypotheses are probably correct and are not necessarily mutually exclusive. T7SS assembly is influenced by the activity of proteins that catalyze T7SS oligomerization, such as flotillin. It is possible that T7SS assembly is transient during the bacterium lifespan, and is regulated by the activity of scaffold proteins expressed at a specific time during growth or in response to a specific signal. These signals are likely to be produced during an infection in which T7SS activity is necessary, which impedes reproduction of these conditions in the laboratory. In addition, laboratory conditions might affect results for T7SS assembly; the choice of detergent and its concentration for membrane proteins solubilization is critical for an appropriate balance between membrane disaggregation and extraction of membrane proteins in their natural oligomeric states, and subtle variations in detergent use can affect results notably [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref079">79</xref>].</p>
<p>During an infection in a murine model, the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> T7SS is critical for abscess development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref032">32</xref>]. Using a variety of virulence factors, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> is able to evade immune mechanisms and eventually disseminate into peripheral organs to establish the formation of a purulent abscess [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref080">80</xref>]. Secretion of the T7SS substrates EsxA and EsxB is important in kidney and liver abscess formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref031">31</xref>]. EsxC is crucial for maturation of these abscesses over a prolonged period, leading to establishment of persistent infection during which EsxC continues to be produced, since infected mice generate antibody responses against EsxC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref032">32</xref>]. Although the actual host cell targets are unknown, one can speculate that Esx substrates interfere with several immune mechanisms (apoptosis, cytokine responses), similar to T7SS substrates of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, to generate a severe persistent infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref081">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref082">82</xref>].</p>
<p>Targeting the activity of bacterial scaffold proteins could thus be an innovative antimicrobial strategy that could reduce the virulence potential of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> during a persistent infection. Here we show the potential antimicrobial effect of simvastatin, 5-DSA and ZA by their ability to perturb FMM organization, reduce T7SS function, and thus inhibit T7SS-mediated secretion of the EsxA, EsxB and EsxC substrates. Treated cells showed reduced extracellular EsxA, EsxB and EsxC levels, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in an <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse infection model. Anti-FMM compounds could be a promising anti-microbial strategy to interfere simultaneously with molecular pathways that contribute to the virulence potential of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, toward eliminating hard-to-treat <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infections. Such infections are considered endemic in hospitals, and their ~20% mortality rate in invasive MRSA infections makes them a leading cause of death by a single infectious agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref030">30</xref>].</p>

Solubilized protein (1 mg) was incubated with 150 μl Ni-NTA resin and rotated (2 h, 4°C), washed twice in buffer W1 (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol), twice in buffer W2 (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol), and eluted with 200 μl elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 1 M imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol). The eluted fraction was concentrated by TCA precipitation before SDS-PAGE and immunoblot.</p>
<p>To capture FLAG-tagged proteins, crude membrane fractions were solubilized in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl supplemented with 0.25% DDM. After removal of insoluble material (100,000 xg, 1 h, 4°C), a total of 4 mg protein was mixed with 20 μl pre-equilibrated beads. After rotation (2 h, 4°C), beads were washed four times in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl with decreasing amounts of detergent (two washes with 0.125% DDM, two washes with 0.02% DDM). Captured FLAG-tagged proteins were eluted by boiling beads in 50 μl Laemmli buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot.</p>

<title>Microscopy</title>
<p>For microscopy analysis, cells were harvested from liquid TSB culture, washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (5 min). After two additional washes in PBS, cells were spotted on an agarose pad (0.8% agarose in PBS) to immobilize them for image acquisition. Epifluorescence microscopy was performed using a Leica DMI6000B microscope, equipped with a Leica CRT 60000 illumination system and DFC630FX camera. Raw images were processed and deconvoluted using image processing software Leica LAS AF v3.7.</p>
<p>For super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, immunofluorescent staining of the samples was guided by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref091">91</xref>]. Δ<italic>spa</italic> mutant cells were grown to mid-exponential phase and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. After washing with PBS, cells were resuspended in GTE buffer (50 mM glucose, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA pH 8) and mounted on 0.1% poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips. Samples were treated with 10 μg/ml lysostaphin in GTE for 5 min, washed with PBS and incubated in 70% EtOH for 10 min. Coverslips were air dried and blocked with 5% BSA for 30 min. Blocking solution was removed and the primary antibody (anti-EssB 1:25 and anti-FloA 1:100) was incubated overnight in 0.5% BSA at 4°C. For each experiment a negative control was incubated without the primary antibody. Coverslips were washed with PBS and the Alexa conjugated secondary antibody was incubated for 2 h in the dark at room temperature (anti-rabbit-Alexa546 1:250, anti-chicken-Alexa488 1:500, ThermoFisher). After washing with PBS, coverslips were air dried and mounted on microscope slides with 3 μl of Prolong Gold Antifade Mountant (ThermoFisher). Slides were incubated in the dark overnight and images taken with a Leica SP8 TCS STED 3X system. Dual channel images were obtained exciting Alexa 546 and Alexa 488 at 561 nm and 488 nm respectively, with a pulsed white light laser depleting at 660 nm and 592 nm, respectively. Deconvolution of z-stacks was obtained with the software Huygens Professional and colocalization analysis was performed with the Costes’ threshold function of the JACoP Plugin for ImageJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref078">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006728.ref092">92</xref>].</p>

<title>Animal experiments and ELISA</title>
<p>Cohorts of 3-week-old BALB/c mice (<italic>n</italic> = 6) were infected intravenously with 100 μl of suspension containing 10<sup>6</sup> CFU staphylococci in PBS. For anti-FMM treatment, 20 mg/kg zaragozic acid (in PBS) was administered intraperitoneally 30 min prior to challenge with staphylococci. The procedure was repeated twice (days 14 and 28). Mice were sacrificed after 40 days and blood samples collected by cardiac puncture. Serum EsxA-D and IsaA antibody titers were examined by ELISA. Briefly, recombinant His-tagged Esx proteins and IsaA were purified as above, diluted in PBS to 10 μg/ml final concentration and coated on 96-well plates (Nunc, MaxiSorp). Plates were incubated (overnight, 4°C) and blocked with 5% BSA (bovine serum albumin) in PBS. Serum samples were diluted (1:50 in PBS), incubated on plates (1 h, 37°C); plates were washed with PBS-T (PBS + 0.05% Tween) and incubated with anti-mouse IgM antibodies (1:5000; Life Technologies; 1 h, 37°C). After a final wash with PBS-T, 100 μl TMB (3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine; Life Technologies) was used to develop the reaction, which was terminated with 100 μl 1 N NaOH and absorbance measured at 450 nm.</p>
