<abstract>
<p>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) entry is associated with Akt translocation to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane to promote a complex signaling cascade. We hypothesized that phospholipid scramblase-1 (PLSCR1), a calcium responsive enzyme that flips phosphatidylserines between membrane leaflets, might redistribute Akt to the outside during entry. Confocal imaging, biotinylation of membrane proteins and flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that HSV activates PLSCR1 and flips phosphatidylserines and Akt to the outside shortly following HSV-1 or HSV-2 exposure. Translocation was blocked by addition of a cell permeable calcium chelator, pharmacological scramblase antagonist, or transfection with small interfering RNA targeting PLSCR1. Co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation studies demonstrated that PLSCR1 associated with glycoprotein L at the outer leaflet and studies with gL deletion viruses indicate that this interaction facilitates subsequent restoration of the plasma membrane architecture. Ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, also induced PLSCR1 activation resulting in Akt externalization, suggesting a previously unrecognized biological phenomenon.</p>

<p>Defining the mechanisms by which herpes simplex viruses (HSV) enter cells will facilitate the development of new strategies to prevent or treat infections and provide insights into cell biology. We report the novel observation that HSV activates the enzyme, scramblase, which redistributes phosphatidylserines, the major component of the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, and the associated protein, Akt, between the inner and outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, to promote viral entry.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Herpes simplex virus serotypes 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are significant global health problems, disproportionately impacting developing countries and fueling the HIV epidemic. HSV-2 is the leading cause of genital ulcerative disease worldwide, whereas HSV-1 has emerged as the more common cause of genital infection in industrialized nations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref001">1</xref>]. Perinatal transmission of either serotype can result in severe infant morbidity or death. Moreover, HSV-1 is the most common cause of sporadic fatal encephalitis and even with optimal intravenous acyclovir therapy, mortality is 14–19% and fewer than 50% of the survivors resume a normal lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref002">2</xref>]. These epidemiological findings highlight the need to better define the mechanisms by which HSV invades cells to establish life-long persistent infection and to exploit this knowledge to develop new antiviral strategies.</p>
<p>HSV entry is initiated by attachment of HSV-1 glycoprotein (g) C (gC-1) or HSV-2 gB (gB-2) to heparan sulfate moieties on syndecan proteoglycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref007">7</xref>], followed by engagement of one of several gD receptors, most commonly nectin-1 on epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref011">11</xref>]. This activates a complex signaling cascade that requires interactions between cellular molecules and viral glycoproteins gB, gH and gL and culminates in the insertion of the gB fusion loops into the plasma membrane (or less commonly, endosomal membrane), with formation of a fusion pore through which the viral capsid and tegument proteins are delivered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Precisely how these viral glycoproteins interact with cellular components to promote viral entry is not fully defined. In previous work, we found that chelation or pharmacological blockade of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release prevented HSV entry in multiple cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref014">14</xref>]. A small amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was detected near the plasma membrane in response to heparan sulfate binding and nectin engagement by Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorimetry and confocal microscopy. This initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> response facilitated subsequent activation of Akt and downstream signaling pathways culminating in the release of inositol-triphosphate receptor (IP3R)-regulated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores that promote viral entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref017">17</xref>]. Co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation studies demonstrated that Akt associated with gB, which was surprising as Akt is presumed to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, whereas viral envelope glycoproteins are retained at the outer surface. We subsequently showed that HSV triggered the externalization of Akt, providing access to the viral envelope. Akt was detected by fluorescently conjugated antibodies (Abs) in non-permeabilized cells shortly after exposure to HSV-1 or HSV-2 by confocal imaging, but was only visualized after permeabilization in mock-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>There are several transmembrane lipid transporter enzymes that translocate phospholipids between the inner (dominated by negatively charged phosphatidylserines (PtdS) and outer (dominated by phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) lipid bilayer of cell membranes. These include phospholipid flippases and floppases, which are ATP-dependent unidirectional enzymes that move lipids from the outer to the cytosolic face or in the reverse direction, respectively, and phospholipid scramblases (PLSCRs), which are Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive small transmembrane proteins that act bidirectionally. There are several splice variants of PLSCR, but PLSCR1 is the prototype and the most studied member of the family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref018">18</xref>]. More recently, two additional scramblase proteins, TMEM16F, which is regulated by elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and XKR8, a caspase-sensitive protein required for PtdS exposure in apoptotic cells, have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref019">19</xref>]. Mutations in TMEM16F are associated with Scott syndrome, a platelet disorder in which Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced PtdS exposure is impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the initial intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to HSV receptor engagement activates Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive scramblases to trigger the translocation of PtdS from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane resulting also in the externalization of Akt. However, because PtdS on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane is associated with activation of apoptotic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref021">21</xref>], we further hypothesized that HSV would flip PtdS and Akt back to restore the plasma membrane architecture. Focusing on PLSCR1, we used a combination of confocal imaging, molecular and biochemical techniques and wild type or deletion viruses to test these hypotheses in human cervical or vaginal epithelial cells and keratinocytes. To address whether the response is limited to HSV or a more generalized phenomenon, we also examined the response to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore, ionomycin.</p>

<title>HSV redistributes phosphatidylserines to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane</title>
<p>To test the hypothesis that PtdS translocate from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane in response to HSV, human cervical epithelial cells (CaSki) or keratinocytes (HaCAT) were infected with HSV-1(KOS) or HSV-2(G) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 or 1 pfu/cell at 4°C for 1 h, unbound virus removed by washing the cells and then shifted to 37°C for 15 minutes, washed with a pH 3.5 buffer to inactivate any non-penetrated virus, fixed with or without Triton X and stained with annexin V, which binds PtdS (red) or, as a control, with an antibody (Ab) to the ATP-dependent flippase, aminophospholipid transporter class 1 (FIC-1) (green). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). PtdS were detected in non-permeabilized cells following exposure to HSV-1 or HSV-2 in both cell types, but FIC-1 was only detected after permeabilization (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). Similar results were obtained when cells (membranes stained green and nuclei blue) were exposed to increasing concentrations of HSV-2(G) at 37°C and stained with a primary anti-PtdS monoclonal and secondary Alexa Fluor conjugated Abs (red) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>). Moreover, flow cytometry also demonstrated that PtdS were detected in a significantly higher percentage of non-permeabilized HaCAT cells 20 minutes post-exposure to HSV-2(G), but not following exposure to an HSV-2(G) virus deleted in gD (HSV-2ΔgD<sup>-/-</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>).

<title>PLSCR1 is required for PtdS and Akt externalization</title>
<p>We hypothesized that externalization of PtdS, and in association, Akt, may be mediated by PLSCR1. To evaluate whether HSV activates PLSCR1, CaSki cells were infected with HSV-2 or mock-infected and cell lysates were prepared at different times post-infection (pi) and incubated with an anti-PLSCR1 Ab. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-agarose and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine Ab (anti-PY20) to detect phosphorylated PLSCR1 (There is no commercially available Ab specific for phosphorylated PLSCR1). HSV induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLSCR1 within 15 minutes following exposure to virus and phosphorylation returned to basal levels by 4 h pi (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>). To test whether the HSV-induced activation of PLSCR1 was responsible for translocation of the PtdS from the inner to outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, cells were transfected with siRNA targeting PLSCR1 or control siRNA. Silencing was assessed by evaluating protein expression by Western blot analysis (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>) and by confocal imaging 72 h post-transfection. The cells were then synchronously infected and evaluated by confocal imaging 15 minutes post-temperature shift. PLSCR1 and PtdS were readily detected in non-permeabilized cells transfected with control siRNA in response to HSV-1 or HSV-2, but not in PLSCR1-silenced or mock-infected cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g002">Fig 2C</xref></bold>). Moreover, silencing of PLSCR1 prevented the externalization of Akt (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g002">Fig 2D</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>(A) CaSki cells were mock-infected or infected with HSV-2(G) and 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour and 4 hours post-infection, cell lysates were harvested. Lysates were incubated with a goat anti-PLSCR1 antibody and immune complexes precipitated with protein A-agarose and analyzed by Western blotting with a mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) or mouse anti-PLSCR1 mAb. The blot is representative of results obtained in 2 independent experiments. (B). CaSki, VK2E6/E7 or HaCAT cells were transfected with siRNA targeting PLSCR1 or a control siRNA (siCtrl) and protein expression was evaluated by Western blot probing for PLSCR1 (rabbit anti-PLSCR1) and β-actin (mouse monoclonal). Blot is representative of results obtained in 3 independent experiments. (C) CaSki or HaCAT cells were transfected with siControl (siCtrl) or siPLSCR1 RNA and 72 h post-transfection, plasma membranes were stained with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (red) and then synchronously infected with HSV-1(KOS), HSV-2(G), or mock-infected (4 hours at 4°C, washed, and then shifted to 37°C for 15 min and treated with low pH citrate buffer). The cells were then fixed and nuclei were stained blue with Hoechst, and phosphatidylserines (PtdS) or PLSCR1 stained green with respective primary murine and secondary Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies. Images are representative of results obtained from 2–3 independent experiments. (D). CaSki cells were transfected with the indicated siRNA and then synchronously infected with HSV-2(G), fixed with or without Triton X permeabilization and stained with fluorescently-conjugated antibodies to Akt (red) and PLSCR1 (green); nuclei were stained blue with DAPI.

<title>Activation of PLSCR1 requires viral binding and gD-nectin engagement</title>
<p>CaSki or HaCAT cells were transfected with siPLSCR1 or siControl and exposed to serial dilutions of HSV-2(G) at 4°C.

There was no reduction in bound viral envelopes (red) in PLSCR1-silenced cells, but silencing resulted in a decrease in the percentage of GFP positive cells detected 4 h post-temperature shift (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold>). To explore which viral envelope glycoprotein-cell interactions were required to induce PtdS externalization, HSV-2(G) was preincubated with 100 μg/ml heparin, a competitive inhibitor of viral binding, or with 1:100 dilution of mAbs to HSV-2 gB, gD, gC, gL, or gH or control mouse IgG and then applied to cells. The mAbs to gB, gD, gH and gL neutralize HSV-2 infection by ~50% at this dilution. After a 30-minute incubation, the cells were washed with low pH buffer, fixed without permeabilization and stained for PtdS. PtdS (green) were readily detected in the cells following treatment with anti-gC (gC-2 is not required for HSV-2 binding), anti-gL, anti-gH or control mouse IgG, but not when virus was incubated with anti-gB, anti-gD or heparin (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>). We also compared pretreating cells or concentrated virus with Abs that target PtdS, Akt, nectin, or gD and then washing the cells or diluting the virus-Ab mixture 100-fold (to a final viral inoculum that yielded ~100 plaques per well when virus was mixed with the control mouse IgG) prior to infecting cells for 1 h at 37° to allow viral entry. The cells were then washed, overlaid with medium, and plaques were counted at 48 h. Each of the Abs inhibited viral plaque formation when added during the 1 h entry period (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).</bold> However, while the Abs to nectin-1 also inhibited infection when cells were pretreated, and the Abs to gD inhibited infection if the virus were pretreated, the anti-PtdS and anti-Akt Abs were only inhibitory if added during viral entry. These results are consistent with the observation that PtdS and Akt are only accessible to Abs following viral binding to heparan sulfate and engagement of nectin.</p>

<title>PLSCR1 blockade inhibits HSV entry</title>
<p>To assess whether PLSCR1 blockade inhibits viral infection, we took advantage of the pharmacological scramblase antagonist, R5421 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref022">22</xref>]. R5421 prevented the viral induced externalization of PtdS (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>) and reduced HSV-2 and HSV-1, but not VSV infection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g004">Fig 4B</xref></bold>). For these studies, infection was monitored using viruses that express GFP (HSV-2(333ZAG), HSV-1(VP26GFP) and VSV-GFP) and the percentage of GFP positive cells quantified 16 h pi (n = 400–500 cells each). To more specifically assess the impact of PLSCR1 blockade on HSV entry, we again took advantage of HSV-1VP26GFP, which has GFP inserted within the VP26 capsid protein, thus providing a marker of viral entry, or HSV-2(333ZAG), which expresses GFP under the control of a CMV promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref023">23</xref>]. Cells were treated with 5μM R5421 or 0.5% DMSO for 15 minutes and then infected with virus (~5 pfu/cell) for 4 h and then fixed and stained for confocal imaging. GFP expression increased within the first 4 h following inoculation with either HSV-1(VP26GFP) or HSV-2(333ZAG), but not when cells were treated with R5421 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g004">Fig 4C</xref></bold>, representative images and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g004">Fig 4D</xref></bold> quantification).

<p>To evaluate whether PLSCR1 is required for Akt phosphorylation and subsequent downstream cellular responses including the release of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, Akt phosphorylation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations were monitored in siRNA transfected cells. Cells were transfected with siPLSCR1 or siControl and 72 h later were mock-infected or infected with HSV-2(G) (10 pfu/cell). Akt activation was assessed by preparing cell lysates at different times post viral exposure and assaying for phosphorylated and total Akt by Western blot and release of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was monitored by fluorimetry. PLSCR1 silencing reduced Akt phosphorylation in CaSki cells in response to HSV-2(G), but had no effect on the detection of total Akt in cell lysates (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g005">Fig 5A</xref></bold>).

<title>PLSCR1 interacts with glycoprotein L to promote restoration of membrane architecture</title>
<p>To determine if any of the viral envelope glycoproteins interacted with PLSCR1, we conducted proximity ligation studies. CaSki cells were synchronously infected with HSV-2(G) or HSV-1(KOS) (5 pfu/cell) and 15 minutes after the temperature shift, the cells were fixed and stained with murine serotype-common mAbs directed against gD, gB, gL or gH and with a rabbit polyclonal Ab against PLSCR1 and probed with species-specific proximity ligation secondary Abs.

A high concentration of fluorescence (red signal) was detected only in the virally-infected cells probed with anti-gL, suggesting interactions between gL and PLSCR1 independent of gH. Because gL and gH exist, at least in part, as hetero-oligomers, additional proximity ligation studies were conducted with HSV-2(G) viruses deleted in gH or gL. An association between PLSCR1 and gL was again detected when cells were exposed to ΔgH-2 or, as a control, the phenotypically complemented ΔgL-2<sup>+/-</sup> virus.

CaSki cells were synchronously infected with HSV-2(G) (5 pfu/cell) and cell lysates were prepared 15 min post-temperature shift and incubated with a mAb to gL or gH or conversely with rabbit anti-PLSCR1. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-agarose and analyzed by Western blotting with rabbit anti-PLSCR1 or, for the converse, with mAbs to gL, gH, or integrinαvβ3, which we previously showed interacts with gH downstream of Akt activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref016">16</xref>].

<p>Confocal imaging studies showed that PtdS and Akt became accessible on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane within first 5 minutes of viral exposure, peaked at ~30 minutes but were no longer detected 2–4 h pi (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g007">Fig 7D</xref></bold>), a time course that mirrors the kinetics of PLSCR1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The addition of R5421 at the time of infection (t = 0) prevented PtdS and Akt externalization, whereas the addition of R5421 30 min pi resulted in persistence of PtdS and Akt at the outer leaflet for up to 4 h pi (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g007">Fig 7E</xref></bold>), indicating a role for PLSCR1 in the bidirectional movement of PtdS and Akt during HSV entry.</p>
<p>Deletion of gL had no effect on the activation of PLSCR1 as evidenced by the increase in PLSCR, PtdS and Akt detected by confocal imaging in non-permeabilized cells 30 minutes post-viral exposure compared to mock-infected cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>)</bold> or by biotinylation of membrane proteins and immunoblotting for PLSCR1 (or as a control, FIC-1) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g008">Fig 8C</xref></bold>). However, while these cellular proteins were no longer detected by confocal microscopy 4 h pi following exposure to HSV-2(G) or to the complemented ΔgL viruses, they persisted following exposure to the non-complemented ΔgL<sup>-/-</sup> viruses (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006766.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These studies identify a previously undescribed and novel role for PLSCR1 in HSV entry and provide a key missing link in understanding how Akt, which has been presumed to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, gains access to viral envelope glycoproteins at the outer leaflet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref017">17</xref>].

<title>Model of phospholipid scramblase activation during HSV entry.</title>
<p>Binding of HSV-1 glycoprotein C or HSV-2 glycoprotein B (Step 1) and engagement of nectin-1 by glycoprotein D (Step 2) trigger the release of a small amount of calcium near the plasma membrane (Step 3) that is sufficient to activate (phosphorylate) phospholipid scramblase (Step 4). This results in flipping of phosphatidylserines (PtdS) from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, which results in externalization of Akt and possibly other inner plasma membrane- associated proteins (Step 5). Akt interacts with gB, which may promote a conformational change in Akt that facilitates its phosphorylation at threonine 308 and serine 473 by yet to be determined kinases (Step 6). Integrinαvβ3 binds to gH (Step 7), and activated Akt and integrin transfer signals to the cell cytoplasm that lead to the generation of inositol triphosphates and release of inositol-triphosphate receptor (IP3R)-regulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (Step 8) culminating in fusion of the viral envelope and plasma membrane and entry of viral capsids (Step 9). PtdS flip back to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to restore normal membrane asymmetry in a process that may occur in response to viral entry and may be regulated by gL binding to PLSCR1 and subsequent shift to primarily dephosphorylated PLSCR1. (Step 10).</p>

<p>In response to viral gC (HSV-1) and/or gB (HSV-2) binding to heparan sulfate and engagement of the primary co-receptor, nectin-1, by gD (both serotypes), a small amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released intracellularly, which is sufficient to activate PLSCR1. PLSCR1 flips PtdS from the inner to outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, which results in externalization of Akt and possibly other inner leaflet proteins. Glycoprotein B binds to externalized Akt, which may promote a conformational change to expose Akt phosphorylation sites, similar to what happens when Akt interacts with 3’-phosphoinositides at the inner plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref025">25</xref>]. Akt becomes phosphorylated by yet to be determined kinases at serine 473 and threonine 308 and activated Akt may act as a catalytic kinase, possibly via outside-in signaling, although the downstream targets of Akt’s kinase activity require future study. Interference with PLSCR1 (chelation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, siRNA, or R5421) or Akt (siRNA, miltefosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref026">26</xref>] and other Akt kinase inhibitors) prevents downstream signaling events associated with viral entry including interactions between integrin αvβ3 and gH, generation of inositol triphosphates and release of IP3R-dependent intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Externalization of Akt had not been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref017">17</xref>], but may be a generalized response to PLSCR1 activation, as phosphorylated Akt was also detected on the outside when cells were treated with ionomycin, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore. Prolonged PtdS exposure on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane is an apoptotic signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref021">21</xref>]. HSV prevents this by flipping PtdS back within 2–4 h following viral exposure in a process that is dependent on PLSCR1 and gL. PtdS persist on the outside if R5421 is added to the cultures 30-minutes post-infection or if the cells are infected with HSV variants deleted in gL. The major role of gL in HSV entry has been presumed to be that of a chaperone protein, enabling gH to be transported from the ER to the plasma membrane where it is incorporated into the viral envelope as a gH-gL heterodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref027">27</xref>]. However more recent work indicates that gL becomes dissociated from gH during viral entry and may play a regulatory role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref028">28</xref>]. Our findings indicate that at least part of this “regulatory” role involves PLSCR1. HSV may initially “lock” PLSCR1 in a conformation that retains PtdS and Akt at the outer leaflet to allow Akt activation but, subsequently, in a process that involves gL, HSV “unlocks” PLSCR1 to allow PtdS to flip back thereby preventing apoptosis. Our studies also suggest that the conformation and activation state of PLSCR1 are linked to its tyrosine phosphorylation. PLSCR1 is tyrosine phosphorylated and readily detected by immunostaining with a mAb that recognizes an N-terminal epitope in non-permeablized cells shortly after exposure to HSV-1 or HSV-2. However, 2–4 h pi, PLSCR1 becomes inactivated and is detected only in permeabilized cells and primarily in its non-phosphorylated form. In contrast, phosphorylated PLSCR1 persists and remains detectable in non-permeabilized cells following exposure to HSV-1 or HSV-2 gL deletion viruses. We speculate that interactions between gL and PLSCR1 may alter the conformation and thus the phosphorylation state of PLSCR1.</p>
<p>Equine herpesvirus (EHV)-1 also activates PLSCR1, but this was observed downstream of the interactions between gH and integrin α4β1 and was dependent on the release of IP3R-regulated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref029">29</xref>]. In contrast, HSV-1 and HSV-2 activate PLSCR1 upstream and independent of the interactions between gH and integrins. Possibly this reflects difference in the cellular response to gD co-receptors. Both EHV and HSV bind to heparan sulfate moieties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref030">30</xref>], but EHV-1 gD interacts with MHC class 1 molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref032">32</xref>], whereas HSV gD interacts with nectin-1 on most cell types. HSV binding and gD-nectin interactions trigger the release of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> near the plasma membrane, a response that is necessary and sufficient to activate PLSCR1. Blockade of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release with the cell-permeable chelator, BAPTA-AM, inhibiting heparan sulfate binding with soluble heparin, or gD-nectin-1 interactions by adding antibodies to gD or nectin to the cultures, prevents PLSCR1 activation.</p>
<p>Several viruses incorporate PtdS into their envelope and then exploit this to interact with PtdS cellular receptors such as Human T-cell Immunoglobulin and Mucin-domain containing proteins (TIMs) to promote subsequent entry or egress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref033">33</xref>]. For example, Ebola virus VP40 interacts with PtdS during viral egress causing the relocalization of PtdS from the inner to outer leaflet of the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref034">34</xref>]. Whether this involves PLSCR1 or other scramblases has not been addressed. The PtdS on the viral envelope subsequently bind TIM-1 or TIM-4 to mediate viral entry into target cells. Similar mechanisms are employed by flaviviruses such as dengue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref033">33</xref>]. In contrast, the results of the current studies including the silencing of cellular PLSCR1 suggest that the source of the PtdS is not the HSV envelope but rather flipping of cellular PtdS from the inner to the outer plasma membrane in response to the increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> observed when virus binds to heparan sulfate and engages nectin. The addition of anti-PtdS antibodies during viral entry reduced viral infection suggesting a direct or indirect role for PtdS in this process that warrants future investigation. Possibly, PtdS promote Akt-gB binding analogous to the observation that PtdS promote binding of Akt to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) and subsequent conformational changes needed for Akt phosphorylation and activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006766.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>The key role of PLSCR1 and Akt in HSV-1 and HSV-2 entry into several different human cell types and their localization to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane where they interact with HSV glycoproteins L and B, respectively, represents an unprecedented opportunity for targeting these molecules to develop new antivirals. Potentially membrane-impermeable Akt or PLSCR1 inhibitors could be developed that would specifically block HSV entry without adversely impacting normal cellular signaling pathways.</p>

<title>Calcium kinetic measurements</title>
<p>CaSki or VK2E6/E7 cells (5x10<sup>4</sup>) were seeded in 96 well black plates with clear bottoms (3340, CellBIND surface, Corning Inc., NY) and incubated with 25 μM Fura-2 AM diluted in PBS (F1221, Invitrogen Molecular Probes) for 60 min at 37°C, rinsed with PBS thrice, placed on ice and then exposed to cold purified HSV-2 (MOI~5 pfu/cell) or control buffer (PBS). In select experiments, cells were pretreated with 5μM R5421 prior to infection. Additional controls included cells exposed to 1μM of ionomycin. The cells were then transferred to SpectraMaxMF<sup>e</sup> temperature-regulated chamber at 37°C (Molecular Devices Ca) without washing; photometric data for intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] were generated by exciting cells at 340 and 380nm and measuring emission at 510 nm every minute for one hour using SoftMaxPro. 5.4 software (Molecular Devices). An intracellular calibration was performed with each experiment by determining the fluorescence ratio (340:380) in the presence of Ca-free 10mM K<sub>2</sub>EGTA buffer (R<sub>min</sub>) and 10mM CaEGTA buffer containing 10μM ionomycin (R<sub>max</sub>) (C-3008, Calcium Calibration Buffer Kit #1, Invitrogen Molecular Probes). The mean [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was determined from four wells according to the manufacturer’s recommendations using the following equation: [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] = K<sub>d</sub> Q (R-R<sub>min</sub>)/(R <sub>max</sub>-R), where R represents the fluorescence intensity ratio F<sub>λ1</sub>/F<sub>λ2</sub>; λ1(340 nm) and λ2 (380 nm) are the fluorescence detection wavelengths for ion-bound and ion-free indicators; K<sub>d</sub> is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dissociation constant and equals 0.14 μM (Fura and Indo Ratiometric Calcium Indicators, Invitrogen Molecular Probes); and Q is the ratio of F<sub>min</sub> to F<sub>max</sub> at λ2 (380nm).</p>

<title>Co-immunoprecipitation assays</title>
<p>Cells were serum-starved for 24 h prior to being exposed to virus (equivalent to 5 pfu/cell) by for 4 h at 4°C, washed 3x with cold PBS, and then placed in a water bath at 37°C for 15 min to allow viral entry and then immediately placed back on ice. Alternatively, serum-starved cells were treated with ionomycin (or DMSO control) for 10 min and then exposed to soluble gL for 30 min before being placed back on ice. The cells were then lysed by sonication in RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with complete protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). The lysates were incubated overnight at 4°C with mAb to gL or gH, control mouse IgG, or rabbit-anti-PLSCR1 and then immune complexes were isolated following a 4-h incubation with protein A agarose beads (Thermo Scientific) or protein G Plus agarose beads (sc-500778, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The precipitated complexes (pellet), supernatants or an aliquot of the cell lysate were analyzed by Western blot with rabbit anti-scramblase polyclonal Abs or mAbs to gL, gH, gB, or gD, nectin or integrinαvβ3.</p>
<p>Because there is no Ab for phosphorylated scramblase, co-immunoprecipitation was also used to identify phosphorylated scramblase-1. Cells were serum starved overnight, infected with virus (5 pfu/cell) or serum-free medium (mock-infection) and cell lysates were prepared at different times and incubated with goat-anti-PLSCR1 Ab (sc-27779, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-agarose and analyzed by Western blotting with mouse anti-phosphotyrosine mAb.</p>
