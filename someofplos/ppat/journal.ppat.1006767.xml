<abstract>
<p><italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, the protozoan that causes Chagas disease, has a complex life cycle involving several morphologically and biochemically distinct stages that establish intricate interactions with various insect and mammalian hosts. It has also a heterogeneous population structure comprising strains with distinct properties such as virulence, sensitivity to drugs, antigenic profile and tissue tropism. We present a comparative transcriptome analysis of two cloned <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> strains that display contrasting virulence phenotypes in animal models of infection: CL Brener is a virulent clone and CL-14 is a clone that is neither infective nor pathogenic in <italic>in vivo</italic> models of infection. Gene expression analysis of trypomastigotes and intracellular amastigotes harvested at 60 and 96 hours post-infection (hpi) of human fibroblasts revealed large differences that reflect the parasite’s adaptation to distinct environments during the infection of mammalian cells, including changes in energy sources, oxidative stress responses, cell cycle control and cell surface components. While extensive transcriptome remodeling was observed when trypomastigotes of both strains were compared to 60 hpi amastigotes, differences in gene expression were much less pronounced when 96 hpi amastigotes and trypomastigotes of CL Brener were compared. In contrast, the differentiation of the avirulent CL-14 from 96 hpi amastigotes to extracellular trypomastigotes was associated with considerable changes in gene expression, particularly in gene families encoding surface proteins such as trans-sialidases, mucins and the mucin associated surface proteins (MASPs). Thus, our comparative transcriptome analysis indicates that the avirulent phenotype of CL-14 may be due, at least in part, to a reduced or delayed expression of genes encoding surface proteins that are associated with the transition of amastigotes to trypomastigotes, an essential step in the establishment of the infection in the mammalian host. Confirming the role of members of the trans-sialidase family of surface proteins for parasite differentiation, transfected CL-14 constitutively expressing a trans-sialidase gene displayed faster kinetics of trypomastigote release in the supernatant of infected cells compared to wild type CL-14.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, is an infection that occurs in several Latin American countries, resulting in a mild illness or in severe damage of the heart and intestinal tract. Such a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations observed in Chagas disease patients is likely due to differences in host susceptibility as well as to a large heterogeneity among <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> isolates. The identification of virulence factors that are differentially expressed in the parasite population is a valuable strategy for understanding of the distinct interactions that occur between this pathogen and its host, which may or may not lead to pathogenesis. By comparing the gene expression profiles of two <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> strains that display contrasting virulence phenotypes in animal models of infection, we identified a central role for genes encoding surface proteins that is associated with the differentiation from intracellular replicative amastigotes to infective trypomastigotes. We showed that the expression of these genes occurs differentially within the two strains and this difference may be a factor that impacts parasite survival and dissemination in the mammalian host.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> is the etiological agent of Chagas disease, a disease affecting at least 8 million people throughout Latin America and for which there are only two drugs available, both with poor efficacy and harmful side effects (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs340/en/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs340/en/</ext-link>). <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection begins with metacyclic trypomastigotes released in the feces of a triatominae vector during a blood meal. After reaching the bloodstream through skin cuts or through the mucosa, trypomastigotes invade different cell types in the mammalian host. Once in the cytoplasm, they differentiate into replicative non-flagellated amastigotes, which undergo several rounds of division before differentiating again into trypomastigotes and bursting out of the host cell. Bloodstream trypomastigotes, ingested by the vector during a blood meal, differentiate into epimastigotes and replicate in the insect midgut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref001">1</xref>]. Such a complex life cycle, involving several morphologically and biochemically distinct parasite forms and very different host environments, requires complex regulatory mechanisms to direct gene expression and the adaptive strategies that allow parasites to thrive within distinct hosts.</p>
<p>The sequence of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> CL Brener genome, with an estimated haploid size of 55 Mb, revealed a highly repetitive genome with protein coding genes organized in long, unidirectional polycistronic transcription units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref002">2</xref>]. Because of its hybrid nature and repetitive content, which prevented its complete assembly, the CL Brener genome is represented by two datasets of contigs, each corresponding to one haplotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref003">3</xref>]. The two haplotypes are referred to as “esmeraldo-like” or “non-esmeraldo-like” based on their parental strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref004">4</xref>]. Several genes, particularly members of large multicopy gene families, were excluded from the current assembly of the CL Brener genome, which is predicted to contain 41 pairs of chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>The naturally occurring <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> population is comprised of a highly heterogeneous pool of strains with striking intra-species variation and exhibiting wide-ranging biological characteristics in experimental settings such as distinct morphology, growth rate, curves of parasitemia, virulence, sensitivity to drugs, antigenic profile, metacyclogenesis and tissue tropism. This variability may explain the wide-ranging pathogenesis observed in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infections (reviewed by Buscaglia and DiNoia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref005">5</xref>]). Those studies recently converged on a classification that proposes the existence of six major groups in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>, also known as discrete typing units (DTUs): I to VI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref006">6</xref>]. Although clonal evolution is predominant, evidence indicates that genetic exchange between parasites has occurred. CL Brener, the cloned reference strain used for the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> genome project, is among the strains that are the products of hybridization events. More recently, genome sequences from several other <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> strains have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref008">8</xref>], allowing comparative analyses that are essential for the understanding of the variable courses of infection and clinical forms of Chagas disease. Most importantly, the study of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> genetic diversity provides essential information for the identification of new drug targets and antigenic candidates for better diagnostic tools and vaccine development.</p>
<p>In addition to investigating genomic variation, differences in gene expression also provide valuable information necessary to fully understanding the complex patterns of interaction between different <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> strains and their hosts. Being part of a group of early branching eukaryotes, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> possesses unique mechanisms to control the expression of its repertoire of about 12,000 genes. Similar to other trypanosomatid genomes, the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> genome is constitutively transcribed into long polycistronic transcripts containing sequences from several functionally unrelated genes. Mature, monocistronic mRNAs for protein-coding genes are produced after the pre-mRNA is processed through trans-splicing and polyadenylation, two coupled reactions determined by polypyrimidine-rich tracts located within intergenic regions (see Araújo and Teixeira, 2011 for a review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref009">9</xref>]). As a consequence of polycistronic transcription and the scarcity of typical RNA polymerase II promoters, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> gene expression is regulated at the post-transcriptional level. Various studies have characterized regulatory sequences present in the 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of different genes, which act as protein-binding sites and, together with RNA binding proteins, are key elements in the control of individual mRNA steady levels during the parasite life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Genome-wide expression studies showing global changes in gene expression during the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> life cycle not only help to unravel the processes involved in the parasite’s interaction with different hosts but also provide an invaluable tool for the understanding of molecular mechanisms controlling gene expression in a group of early branching eukaryotes. Steady-state transcriptome analyses, based on microarray hybridizations of cDNAs derived from epimastigotes, metacyclic trypomastigote, tissue culture derived trypomastigotes and axenically-induced amastigotes of the Brazil strain show that almost 5000 genes exhibit statistically significant up or down regulation in at least one of the four life cycle stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref010">10</xref>]. More recently, RNA-seq analysis of the Y strain during infection of primary human foreskin fibroblasts revealed that ~15 to 30% of the predicted protein-coding genes undergo significant changes in gene expression when epimastigotes, trypomastigotes and amastigotes were compared. Focusing on the parasite energy metabolism, this study highlighted the importance of mitochondrial electron transport for intracellular survival of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> amastigotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref011">11</xref>]. Similar RNA-seq analysis of trypomastigotes, amastigotes and epimastigotes of the Dm28c strain showed an increased expression of genes encoding surface proteins in extracellular trypomastigotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref012">12</xref>]. In a comparative transcriptome analysis of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> strains belonging to the two main genetic groups present in the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> population, the Sylvio (DTU I) and Y (DTU II) strains, Houston-Ludlam et al. (2016) showed the existence of striking similarities among the differentially expressed core genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref013">13</xref>]. However, genome-wide analyses comparing <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> strains with clear differences in their virulence properties have yet to been conducted.</p>
<p>Here, we present a comparative transcriptomic analysis, across multiple life cycle stages for two nearly isogenic <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> cloned strains, CL Brener and CL-14, which were originally cloned from the parental CL strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref014">14</xref>]. In contrast to CL Brener, CL-14 is non-infectious and non-pathogenic <italic>in vivo</italic>, even when inoculated into newborn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref016">16</xref>] or immune deficient, CD8<sup>-/-</sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref017">17</xref>] that are otherwise highly susceptible to <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> infection. Importantly, after inoculation in adult animals, CL-14 prevents the development of parasitemia and mortality following challenge with the virulent CL strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref019">19</xref>]. Since vaccination with live CL-14 induces a potent and long-lasting parasite-specific humoral and T-cell mediated immunity against challenge with highly virulent strains of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic>, the immunological adjuvant properties of the CL-14 clone is being explored as a possible vaccine vector for induction of T-cell mediated immunity against other diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref017">17</xref>]. Preliminary comparisons of the CL Brener and CL-14 genomes, based on shotgun sequences, revealed only few differences in the core gene content of both strains. Although a direct comparative study between the two fully assembled genomes is still under way, our initial analyses showed that the CL-14 genome, which is also a hybrid, TcVI genome, is 99.73% identical to CL Brener (S. Teixeira, in preparation). Thus, in the absence of major differences identified so far at the genome level, we analyzed the CL-14 and CL Brener transcriptomes and compared them with the aim of identifying changes in gene expression that could explain the differences in virulence between the two strains.</p>

<title>Distinct outcomes of the <italic>in vitro</italic> infection with CL Brener and CL-14 cloned strains</title>
<p>The availability of two genetically similar <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> strains that display marked differences in virulence presents a unique opportunity to identify fundamental phenotypic differences associated with the colonization and completion of the intracellular infection cycle in mammalian host cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). To characterize the dynamics of intracellular infection by <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> CL Brener and CL-14 cloned strains, parallel infections of low passage human fibroblasts (HFF) were established and monitored for several days post-infection. The capacities of CL Brener and CL-14 trypomastigotes to infect HFF were comparable with a similar fraction of the host cell monolayer colonized by these parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In contrast, analysis of the number of intracellular amastigotes over time revealed significant differences in amastigote growth rates, with CL-14 lagging behind the faster growing CL Brener (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The slower growth of CL-14 amastigotes correlated with delayed release of trypomastigotes from infected cells upon completion of the intracellular growth and differentiation cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). As a consequence, significantly fewer trypomastigotes were released into the supernatant of CL-14-infected cells as compared to monolayers infected with CL Brener (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). These findings suggest that the intracellular stages of CL-14 exhibit both growth and developmental defects, which may underlie the inability of CL-14 parasites to establish patent infection <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Global transcriptome assessment from developmental stages in both strains</title>
<p>To further characterize the differences in host cell infection phenotype, a comparative transcriptome analysis was performed focused on the mammalian-infective stages of CL Brener and CL-14. Total RNA was isolated from extracellular trypomastigotes and from fibroblasts infected with each strain in parallel, at time points post-infection that capture active amastigote replication (60 hr) and the transition from amastigotes to trypomastigotes (96 hr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The mRNA populations derived from biological triplicates of each sample were sequenced on the Illumina platform and the total number of reads generated from all libraries as well as the percentages of reads mapped to the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> CL Brener reference genome are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006767.s005">S1 Table</xref>. Consistent with the general trend observed in the numbers of intracellular amastigotes per cell, the proportion of parasite reads mapping to the reference genome at 96 hours post-infection (hpi) was smaller in cells infected with CL-14 (12.1% on average) than with CL Brener (37.0% on average). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, the numbers of amastigotes per cell at day 5 post infection were higher in CL Brener infected cells than in CL-14 infected cells. Also consistent with data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, a smaller difference (6.7% versus 10.7%, respectively) was observed at 60 hpi, when the numbers of intracellular amastigotes were similar between the two infections.</p>
<p>Mapped sequencing data derived from all libraries were analyzed using a variety of methods, including principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering, to inspect the relationships between samples and to identify potential outliers. The resulting PCA plot and heat maps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006767.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), after normalization, showed the expected clustering between biological triplicates with the exception of one sample generated from RNA isolated from CL Brener trypomastigotes (CLB.Tryp.1), which was identified as an outlier and excluded from subsequent analyses. Following normalization and surrogate variable analysis, the hierarchical clustering of the remaining samples revealed an intriguing set of observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The global transcriptome profiles of the CL-14 amastigotes at 96 hpi, while resembling their CL Brener counterparts, clustered tightly with the profiles of CL Brener amastigotes at 60 hpi. Additionally, the profiles from CL-14 trypomastigotes displayed a greater similarity to mammalian intracellular amastigote stages (from both strains) than the CL Brener trypomastigotes. The PCA plot displayed similar characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). These findings suggested that a delayed expression of a large number of genes might be occurring in CL-14 amastigotes.</p>

<p>The numbers of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> genes that emerged as differentially expressed (DE) with adjusted P value of &lt;0.05, in pairwise comparisons of similar developmental stages of CL Brener and CL-14, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g003">Fig 3</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006767.s006">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006767.s007">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006767.s008">S4</xref> Tables for the complete datasets).

<p>As demonstrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g001">Fig 1B–1D</xref>), the CL Brener strain completes its intracellular life cycle in mammalian host cells more rapidly and more efficiently than CL-14: similar differences are predicted to be reflected in the global gene expression patterns. Changes in the CL Brener global transcriptome appeared to be more pronounced with twice the number of significantly up- and down-regulated genes when compared to CL-14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g003">Fig 3</xref>), particularly when amastigotes at 60 hpi and 96 hpi were compared. The most significant differences appeared to lie in the temporal patterns of expression of some multi-gene family encoding surface proteins, which constituted 26% to 89% of highly DE genes (&gt;2 fold). This is best illustrated when members of multigene families of surface proteins such as trans-sialidase (TS), mucin, mucin-associated surface proteins (MASP) and GP63 were color-coded on MA plots for all three DE contrasts (trypomastigote vs. 60 hpi amastigotes, 60 hpi vs. 96 hpi and 96 hpi amastigotes vs. trypomastigotes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g004">Fig 4</xref>). In the contrast representing the transition of extracellular trypomastigotes to amastigotes at 60 hpi (Tryp to A60), an expected down-regulation of genes encoding TS, MASP and mucin was conspicuous for both strains and there were few differences in the behavior of most gene families in CL-14 when compared to CL Brener. The latter observation was supported by a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, which quantifies and tests the distance between two distributions and a Welch's test of the mean log fold changes (logFC) among the genes in each family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006767.s009">S5 Table</xref>). The resulting K-S distance values were small for MASP, mucin, RHS and GP63 and TS (<italic>D</italic> = 0.05, 0.05, 0.7, 0.09, respectively) and so were the differences in the mean logFC values. A clear and diverging pattern emerged when the selected multi-gene families were compared during differentiation from 60 to 96 hpi amastigotes. Genes encoding MASP, mucin and TS were up-regulated <italic>en masse</italic> as CL Brener began its transformation back to trypomastigotes while showing little change in CL-14 (<italic>D</italic> = 0.39, 0.35 and 0.27, respectively). A careful examination of the mean logFC change values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006767.s009">S5 Table</xref>) reveals a more vigorous up-regulation of MASP and mucin genes when compared to TS genes, which may reflect the roles played by these cell surface proteins during parasite development in the mammalian host. The most striking observation was a delayed up-regulation of CL-14 genes encoding MASP, mucin and TS, marking a slow transition of amastigotes to trypomastigotes when compared to CL Brener and suggesting that the processes that regulate the expression of this specific group of genes encoding parasite surface proteins may be a major factor underlying the avirulent phenotype of CL-14. It is also possible that a smaller proportion of CL-14 amastigotes differentiates into trypomastigotes, resulting in the release of fewer trypomastigotes in the extracellular milieu. Members of the DGF family displayed a similar pattern of expression in CL Brener and CL-14, however their down-regulation was considerably more pronounced as CL-14 amastigotes transform into trypomastigotes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006767.s009">S5 Table</xref>). It is also important to note that the clear temporal asynchronicity in expression patterns of MASP, mucin and TS genes in CL-14 when contrasted to CL Brener were not observed for members of other multigene families such as GP63 and RHS.</p>

<title>Gene ontology enrichment analyses</title>
<p>A gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of DE genes in CL-14 and CL Brener revealed some trends similar to those observed in the transciptome analysis of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> Y strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref011">11</xref>]. Because the differentiation from trypomastigotes into intracellular amastigotes is accompanied by a massive down regulation of the expression of gene families encoding trans-sialidase, MASP and mucin surface proteins, we masked all DE genes that belong to any of the six largest multigenic families (MASP, mucin, DGF-1, Trans-sialidase, RHS and GP63) present in the CL Brener genome before performing the GO enrichment analysis. The transformation from extracellular trypomastigotes to intracellular replicative amastigotes was accompanied by enrichment of several biological processes including translation (GO:0006412), protein folding (GO:0006457), chromosome organization (GO:0051276), ion transport (GO:0006811), lipid biosynthesis (GO:0008610), and oxidoreductase activity (GO:0016491) in both parasite strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006767.t001">Table 1</xref>). As discussed by Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref011">11</xref>], these changes reflect the rapid proteome and membrane lipid remodeling as well as metabolic adaptations to distinct carbon sources that are required for parasite replication and intracellular survival. Interestingly, GO enrichment analyses described in the Y strain revealed that genes related to ion transport are among the most highly differentially expressed genes in amastigotes at 48 and 72 hpi compared to trypomastigotes. One of those genes (TcCLB.509197.39) belongs to the ZIP family of metal transporters that was also found highly expressed in 60 hpi amastigotes of CL Brener and CL-14 compared to trypomastigotes (logFC of 4.9 and 4.3, respectively). It is important to note that while both strains shared most of the same enriched GO processes, the numbers of genes that were significantly up regulated (with logFC&gt;1) within the GO categories were consistently higher in CL Brener amastigotes than in CL-14. For example, whereas 109 genes related to oxidoreductase activity were up-regulated during the transformation of CL Brener trypomastigotes into 60 hpi amastigotes, only 58 genes were up-regulated in 60 hpi amastigotes of CL-14. Likewise, the numbers of genes involved in ion transport and lipid biosynthesis that were up-regulated in 60 hpi amastigotes were in general 50% lower in CL-14 when compared to CL Brener. These data indicate that the differentiation of non-dividing trypomastigotes into replicative and more metabolic active amastigotes may be occurring at a slower pace in CL-14 compared to CL Brener. On the other hand, when amastigotes at 60 hpi and 96 hpi are compared, the number of genes in the two GO categories that are upregulated in 96 hpi amastigotes of CL-14 are greater than in CL Brener, which also indicates a slower reprogramming of gene expression during intracellular differentiation of CL-14 compared to CL Brener. Among the two GO categories that were enriched with down-regulated genes when trypomastigotes from either strain differentiated into amastigotes, was a hexose transport biological process. In the current <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> genome database only one gene encoding a glucose transporter (TcCLB.506355.10) is annotated, but after a more careful inpection, we identified two additional hexose transporter orthologues. Transcript levels of all three hexoxe transporters were significantly down-regulated in amastigotes from both strains (for TcCLB.506355.10, with a logFC -2.418 in CL Brener and -2.747 in CL-14), as expected, since carbohydrates do not constitute a significant energy source for intracellular amastigotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref020">20</xref>].</p>

<p>When we contrasted the GO enrichment analyses for the amastigotes’ transition from 60 hpi to 96 hpi in both strains, a few notable differences were observed, including a category involved with cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility (GO:0001539), which appeared up-regulated only in CL Brener at 96 hpi. Ciliary and flagellar motility also emerged as an enriched GO terms associated with mature <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> amastigotes as early as at 48 hpi in Y strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref011">11</xref>]. Another interesting difference from CL Brener included an enrichment of CL-14 genes involved in chromosome organization (GO:0051276) and ion transport (GO:0006811) that was sustained in CL-14 amastigotes at 96 hpi. We noted earlier that genes encoding several cell surface proteins were up-regulated <italic>en masse</italic> as CL Brener began its transformation back to trypomastigotes, i.e., when 60 hpi and 96 hpi amastigotes were compared. In CL-14, the induced expression of these surface gene families became evident only when 96 hpi amastigotes and trypomastigotes were compared. The GO enrichment analyses indicated that in addition to genes encoding cell surface proteins, amastigotes of CL-14 at 96 hpi did not express genes required for the last steps of amastigote-to-trypomastigote differentiation, such as genes involved with flagellum-dependent motility (TcCLB.510955.40, TcCLB.509005.10, TcCLB.508793.14). Also, genes related to protein folding (GO:0006457) and ion transport (GO:0006811), which were down-regulated in 96 hpi amastigotes compared to 60 hpi amastigotes in CL Brener did not show significant differences in gene expression when 60 hpi and 96 hpi amastigotes of CL-14 were compared.</p>
<p>When GO enrichment was examined for the differential expression from amastigotes at 96 hpi to trypomastigotes, an expected enrichment of protein kinase activity (GO:0004672) and hexose transport (GO:0008645) was identified amongst the upregulated genes in both strains. These finding are in agreement with data that showed that glucose is the main energy source for the parasite in the bloodstream and also with increased protein modification, such as phosphorylation of MASPs, that is required for the abundant expression of cell surface glycoproteins in trypomastigotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref022">22</xref>]. Also consistent with a decreased metabolism and macromolecular biosynthesis of the non-replicative trypomastigotes, down-regulated genes in both strains were enriched in protein translation (GO:0006412), protein folding (GO:0006457), ion transport (GO:0006811), oxidoreductase activity (GO:0016491), lipid biosynthesis (GO:0008610) and chromosome organization (GO:0051276). Hence, in addition to confirming the associations between gene expression and the metabolic differences that are known to occur during the intracellular differentiation, our GO enrichment analyses revealed further differences in gene expression between CL Brener and CL-14 during the transition from early to late stages of the intracellular amastigote development. It can be assumed that, in addition to a distinct program controlling the expression of multigene families encoding cell surface glycoproteins, other differences in gene expression related to changes in the parasite metabolism and cellular structures may also contribute to the distinct behavior of the two strains during infection of mammalian cells.</p>

<title>Differential expression of RNA-binding proteins</title>
<p>To further investigate the regulatory mechanisms controlling the distinct transcriptional programs that drive the development from intracellular amastigotes to the extracellular trypomastigote stage in the two cloned strains, we analyzed the expression of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that are differentially expressed throughout the infection of the host cell by CL Brener and CL-14. Using homology searches to four protein domains known to be present in RNA binding proteins (PUF (Pumilio), zinc finger, RNA recognition motif (RRM) and Alba domains), we identified a total of 253 <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> sequences representing 147 genes (since two alleles were identified for most genes), which are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006767.s010">S6 Table</xref>. This list includes all genes encoding <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> RBPs containing the RRM motif identified by Gaudenzi et al. (2005) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref023">23</xref>] and Guerra-Slompo et al. (2012) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref024">24</xref>], Pumilio-type RNA binding proteins identified by Caro et al.

(2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref026">26</xref>], with an additional 13 genes. Among all the putative RBP-encoding genes identified, six genes were differentially expressed in CL Brener (logFC&gt;2, <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05) during differentiation between 60 hpi and 96 hpi amastigotes and from amastigotes to trypomastigotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g005">Fig 5A–5F</xref>). Amongst them is the gene encoding a CCCH zinc finger (ZFN) motif-containing protein (TcCLB.511511.6) that was significantly upregulated in trypomastigotes from CL Brener as well as in CL-14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Previous studies with the Dm28c strain of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> indicate that this RBP acts as a regulatory factor possibly involved with metacyclogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref027">27</xref>], whereas the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> homologue TbZFN1 (Tb927.6.3490) was identified as a factor that is upregulated during differentiation from bloodstream to procyclic forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref028">28</xref>].</p>

<p>Five transcripts encoding RBPs are upregulated in amastigotes from both strains, indicating that they may control expression of genes involved with replication and intracellular survival of the parasite in the mammalian host cell. TcCLB.511727.190 encodes a RRM containing protein, which was significantly upregulated in 60 hpi and 96 hpi amastigotes compared to trypomastigotes of CL Brener and CL-14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Its <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> homologue DRBD18 (Double RNA Binding Domain, encoded by Tb927.11.14090) can be modified by arginine methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref029">29</xref>]. TcCLB.469785.40, identified as amastigote-specific not only in CL Brener and CL-14 but also in the Y strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref011">11</xref>], is also a member of the DRBD family whose <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> ortholog (Tb927.6.3480) has been identified as the post-transcriptional repressor DRBD5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref030">30</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Similar to TcCLB.469785.40, transcript levels of the RBP encoded by TcCLB.509551.60 is increased in 60 hpi amastigotes of CL Brener compared to 96 hpi amastigotes and trypomastigotes as well as in amastigotes of the Y strain up to 12 hpi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref011">11</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g005">Fig 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>TcCLB.504005.6, annotated as RBP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g005">Fig 5E</xref>) encodes an RBP that is upregulated in 96 hpi amastigotes of CL Brener and CL-14, as well as in the Y strain amastigotes at 72 hpi amastigotes but not at 48 hpi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref011">11</xref>]. Similarly, transcript levels of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> PUF9 (TcCLB.506563.10) are also up-regulated in CL Brener 96 hpi amastigotes as well as in Y strain amastigotes at 72 hpi compared to amastigotes at early stages of the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). In <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>, PUF9 (Tb927.1.2600) stabilizes a group of transcripts during S-phase and may be involved with the temporal coordination of nuclear and kinetoplast replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref031">31</xref>]. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the RBPs encoded by TcCLB.504005.6 and TcCLB.506563.10 act as regulatory factors involved with the final steps of amastigote-trypomastigote differentiation and the release of trypomastigotes from infected cells.</p>
<p>Because of their critical role in regulating gene expression in trypanosomatids, we searched for RBPs whose expression significantly differs in the CL Brener and CL-14 transcriptomes. In contrast to all six differentially expressed RBP genes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g005">Fig 5A–5F</xref>, TcCLB.507611.300 is constitutively expressed in the mammalian stages of CL Brener as well as in the Y strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref011">11</xref>], but its transcript levels are significantly increased in trypomastigotes of CL-14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). TcCLB.507611.300 encodes a spliceosomal protein that is part of the U1A small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex as indicated by the studies with the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic> ortholog (Tb927.10.830) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref032">32</xref>]. In addition to further investigating whether the differences observed in the expression of CL Brener and CL-14 RBP genes, such as TcCLB.469785.40 and TcCLB.509551.60, which may be involved with the control of steady state levels of their target transcripts, further studies are also needed to verify whether the differential expression of an RBP involved in mRNA processing may cause any impact on the expression of genes related to the virulence of CL-14 trypomastigotes.</p>

<title>Constitutive expression of a trans-sialidase gene in CL-14 affects amastigote to trypomastigote differentiation</title>
<p>Because data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g004">Fig 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006767.s009">S5 Table</xref> indicated that several genes encoding surface protein families are been expressed at later time points during intracellular infection of CL-14 compared to CL Brener, we sought to test whether altering the expression of a member of these multigene families might affect parasite differentiation inside the host cell. We selected the trans-sialidase (TS) gene Tc00.1047053509495.30 (whereby named TS95.30) because it belongs to TcS group I and encodes an enzymatically active TS that contains the C-terminal SAPA (Shed Acute Phase Antigen) repeats known to be expressed only in the mammalian stages of the parasite life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref033">33</xref>]. Our RNA-seq analyses confirmed the expression of TS95.30 in amastigotes and trypomastigotes of CL Brener and CL-14 but also highlighted distinct expression levels of TS95.30, which is highly upregulated (FC = 9.8) in 96 hpi amastigotes compared to 60 hpi in CL Brener, and less so in CL-14 (FC = 3.5).</p>
<p>The complete open reading frame of TS95.30 was cloned in the pROCKNeo vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref034">34</xref>] and transfected into CL-14 epimastigotes using the linearized form of the vector shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g006">Fig 6A</xref>. As described previously, transfection with linearized pROCKNeo vector results in the integration of the DNA construct in the tubulin locus and, because signals for mRNA processing of the foreign gene are derived from the constitutively expressed housekeeping genes <italic>TcP2</italic>β (at the 5’ end) and <italic>gapdh</italic> (at the 3’ end), the pROCKNeoTS transgene can be constitutively expressed in all parasite life cycle stages, including epimastigotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref034">34</xref>]. After selecting a neomycin-resistant population as well as transfected cloned cell lines, total RNA and protein extracts from these cultures were subjected to northern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) and western blot analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). For northern blot, we used a probe derived from the 3’ region of the TS95.30 gene and for the western blot we used an anti-SAPA antibody that detects the expression of members belonging to TS group 1 sub-family. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, two cloned epimastigote cell lines derived from G418-resistant, CL-14 parasites transfected with the TS gene (clones TS 14 and TS 22) showed increased levels of TS mRNA compared to untransfected CL-14 or with epimastigotes from CL Brener. These two transfected cell lines plus two additional ones (TS 16 and TS 18), all of them showing increased TS protein expression compared to WT CL-14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), were selected and tested in <italic>in vitro</italic> infection assays. No differences in the growth curves of epimastigote cultures from all four transfected cell lines compared to WT CL-14 and CL Brener epimastigotes were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006767.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>The infection capacity of the transfected parasites was tested <italic>in vitro</italic> by incubating Vero cells with equal numbers of tissue culture derived trypomastigotes from WT CL Brener, CL-14 and from the CL-14 transfected cell lines (TS 14 and TS 22) constitutively expressing TS95.30. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>, parasites from all four cell lines transfected with TS displayed faster kinetics of trypomastigote release in the supernatant compared to untransfected CL-14 or with CL-14 parasites transfected with the empty vector. Although no significant differences in the numbers of intracellular amastigotes were observed, the numbers of trypomastigote released by cells infected with transfected CL-14 parasites was increased compared to cells infected with WT CL-14 or with CL-14 transfected with the empty vector. This result indicates that the constitutive expression of one member of the TS gene family is sufficient to alter the differentiation from amastigote to trypomastigotes, a process that occurs intracellularly before trypomastigotes are released to infect new host cells. Although constitutive TS expression facilitates intracellular amastigote to trypomastigote differentiation and parasite egress from infected cells, constitutive expression of TS is not sufficient to restore parasite virulence. When the two cloned, transfected CL-14 cell lines TS 14 and TS 22 were inoculated into BALB/c mice, similar to WT CL-14 infected animals, no parasites were detected in the bloodstream at any time point after infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006767.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). It should be noted that, cells infected with one transfected cell line, TS 22, showed a total number of trypomastigotes released in the supernatant that was statistically equivalent to the number of released trypomastigotes in CL Brener infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006767.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). It is therefore assumed that differences regarding the gene expression profiles of trypomastigotes from both strains also contribute to determine the distinct virulence phenotypes observed during infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. The mechanisms by which the increased expression in CL-14 of a TS gene affects amastigote to trypomastigote differentiation need to be investigated. The work of Rubin-de-Celis and colleagues, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref035">35</xref>] suggests that sialic acid present on lysosomal membrane glycpoproteins are targets of TS, since over-expression of TS in the Y strain facilitates escape of amastigotes from the parasitophorous vacuole. It is also possible that the constitutive expression of TS triggers other changes in gene expression or modifications at the cell surface that affect parasite differentiation. It has been shown that glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored proteins such as TS, mucins and MASPs are transported to the parasite surface through the contractile vacuole complex, in a trafficking process that involves the small GTPase protein Rab11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref036">36</xref>]. Therefore, the possibility that early overexpression of TS in CL-14 may cause changes in membrane trafficking in a way that affects membrane remodeling events required for amastigote to trypomastigote differentiation, should also be considered. These hypotheses are currently being investigated using RNA-seq analyses. As predicted by the differential expression and GO analyses, adequate expression of mucins, MASPs and/or several other genes may also be needed during late stages of intracellular development of the parasite, along the expression of TS genes, to restore CL-14 virulence in animal models of infection. Our results also suggest that a genome wide DNA manipulation strategy allowing the inspection of multiple factors will be necessary to fully address the question regarding differences in the virulence phenotype among the two <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> strains.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>Our <italic>in vivo</italic> infection assays confirmed previous studies, which have shown that, in contrast to an infection with the CL Brener clone, no patent parasitemia can be detected in immune competent animals that were inoculated with trypomastigotes from the attenuated CL-14 clone. However, <italic>in vitro</italic> infection assays showed that CL-14 trypomastigotes are able to infect and multiply within different cell types (this study tested infection of HFF and Vero cells), although the CL-14 infection resulted in lower numbers of intracellular amastigotes during early time points and a markedly reduced number of trypomastigotes released by the CL-14 infected cells compared to the CL Brener infection. One might conclude that a deficient capacity of CL-14 amastigotes to differentiate into trypomastigotes is a key factor accounting for the CL-14 attenuated phenotype. The results from the <italic>in vitro</italic> infection assays prompted us to investigate the molecular basis of the attenuated phenotype of CL-14 by performing gene expression analyses at two time points of the intracellular development of the two strains. As shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref011">11</xref>], once reaching the cell cytoplasm, CL Brener amastigotes replicate for about 4 days, before they differentiate back into trypomastigotes and rupture the cell. Our comparative transcriptome analyses showed that the transition of extracellular trypomastigotes to amastigotes at 60 hpi was accompanied by only few differences in gene expression between the two parasite strains, including a similar down-regulation of multi-gene families encoding TS, MASP and mucin. In contrast, large differences in the transcriptome remodeling were observed between the two strains when gene expression at 60 hpi and 96 hpi were compared, particularly regarding the expression of gene families encoding surface proteins, which are up-regulated with faster kinetics in CL Brener than in CL-14. Thus, the RNA-seq data presented in this study point to a central role of this group of proteins in the process of differentiation from the replicative amastigote to infective trypomastigotes and establishment of infection in the mammalian host.</p>
<p>Our RNA-seq analysis is also consistent with experimental data that shows no differences in the parasite’s invasion capacity or ability to multiply in the cytoplasm of the mammalian cell. As observed during <italic>in vivo</italic> infection, it is possible that CL-14 amastigotes are able to multiply in a limited number of tissues of the infected animal at least during the initial stages of the infection, but the delayed expression of genes encoding surface proteins prevents the release of trypomastigotes in the bloodstream and in neighboring tissues. This is consistent with several reports showing that, although infection with CL-14 does not result in patent parasitemia, it results in efficient immunity against a lethal challenge with virulent parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref019">19</xref>], or against a human tumor antigen if this antigen is expressed by the parasite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref017">17</xref>]. Because CL-14 retains its capacity to multiply during the first round of infection after trypomastigote inoculation, this initial multiplication within host tissues may be sufficient to induce a highly efficient immune response that includes a balanced Th1/Th2 cytokine production that is beneficial for the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>In one study addressing the basis of the non-virulent phenotype, Atayde and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref037">37</xref>] showed that metacyclic forms of the CL strain and from the CL-14 clone express comparable levels of gp82, a member of the TS family, and gp35/50, a member of the mucin family of glycoproteins. Although we did not analyze the gene expression profile of metacyclic forms, the RNA-seq data obtained for trypomastigotes from CL Brener and CL-14 indicated that once the parasites differentiated into trypomastigotes, their gene expression profiles still showed large differences, particularly regarding genes belonging to the multi-gene families of surface proteins. In another study where the number of extracellular trypomastigotes was determined after infection of CHO-K1 cells with CL-14, Tonelli and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006767.ref038">38</xref>] found that increased numbers of trypomastigotes are released in the supernatants if cells are kept at 33°C instead of 37°C. In addition, the numbers of trypomastigotes released into the medium were 2.5 to 3-fold higher if the cultures were supplemented with 20 or 200 microM proline. We confirmed the increased capacity of CL-14 to differentiate from amastigote to trypomastigote if the temperature is lowered from 37 to 33°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006767.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). The thermo-sensitive character of the differentiation process of CL-14 will be investigated using RNA-seq data collected at both temperatures. Using RNA-seq analyses, we are also planning to investigate whether the constitutive expression of one member of the trans-sialidase in CL-14 affects the expression of other genes that may also be involved with the amastigote to trypomastigote differentiation. Finally, RNA immunoprecipitation analyses using tagged versions of the three RNA binding proteins (TcCLB.507611.300, TcCLB.506563.10 and TcCLB.469785.40), identified as being differentially expressed in both strains, are also underway with the aim of identifying their target genes, which may correspond to genes directly involved with the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> differentiation program. However, the lack of a fully assembled genome poses a major limitation that needs to be resolved before we can perform a conclusive comparative analysis between these strains. Efforts towards the generation of the complete sequences of all chromosomes from CL Brener and CL-14 are underway using the long read sequencing technology by PacBio. With this new sequencing strategy we should be able to resolve all the complex regions in this parasite genome, particularly regions where large multigene families are present. Together with additional gene expression analyses, further genome studies investigating gene copy number variation will help understand the diversity of the <italic>T</italic>. <italic>cruzi</italic> population and its impact on parasite infection.</p>

<title>Expression values for individual genes.</title>
<p>The metric of ‘expression’ was collected from limma following the application of voom for each experimental condition. It is comprised of the normalized, batch-adjusted, expression value on the log2 scale. Errors were calculated by taking the logFC from the limma identity tables and dividing by the t-statistic for each gene. The table contains annotations (columns A-E), followed by the metric of expression for each condition (columns F-K), followed by the standard error (columns L-Q) for each condition.</p>

<title>Putative RNA-binding domain containing genes.</title>
<p>Genes were identified using homology searches to four protein domains known to be present in RNA binding proteins: PUF (Pumilio), zinc finger, RNA recognition motif (RRM) and Alba domain. For most genes, the two alleles (Esmeraldo-like and non-Esmeraldo-like) are shown.</p>

<title>Raw counts for all samples.</title>
<p>The workbook comprises 7 sheets. The first, 'legend', contains a legend and copy of the experimental design. The 'raw_reads' sheet contains the gene annotation data along with numbers of raw counts observed for each gene. The 'raw_graphs' a series of initial plots describing the raw data. The 'norm_data' provides the counts after the normalization applied as stated in the legend (log2, quantile, sva, filtered). The 'norm_graphs' provides the same set of plots describing the normalized data. Finally, the 'median_data' provides a set of median values of the data after normalization by experimental conditions.</p>
