<abstract>
<p>Viroporins are small transmembrane proteins with ion channel activities modulating properties of intracellular membranes that have diverse proviral functions. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) encodes a viroporin, p7, acting during assembly, envelopment and secretion of viral particles (VP). HCV p7 is released from the viral polyprotein through cleavage at E2-p7 and p7-NS2 junctions by signal peptidase, but also exists as an E2p7 precursor, of poorly defined properties. Here, we found that ectopic p7 expression in HCVcc-infected cells reduced secretion of particle-associated E2 glycoproteins. Using biochemical assays, we show that p7 dose-dependently slows down the ER-to-Golgi traffic, leading to intracellular retention of E2, which suggested that timely E2p7 cleavage and p7 liberation are critical events to control E2 levels. By studying HCV mutants with accelerated E2p7 processing, we demonstrate that E2p7 cleavage controls E2 intracellular expression and secretion levels of nucleocapsid-free subviral particles and infectious virions. In addition, our imaging data reveal that, following p7 liberation, the amino-terminus of p7 is exposed towards the cytosol and coordinates the encounter between NS5A and NS2-based assembly sites loaded with E1E2 glycoproteins, which subsequently leads to nucleocapsid envelopment. We identify punctual mutants at p7 membrane interface that, by abrogating NS2/NS5A interaction, are defective for transmission of infectivity owing to decreased secretion of core and RNA and to increased secretion of non/partially-enveloped particles. Altogether, our results indicate that the retarded E2p7 precursor cleavage is essential to regulate the intracellular and secreted levels of E2 through p7-mediated modulation of the cell secretory pathway and to unmask critical novel assembly functions located at p7 amino-terminus.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Viroporins are small transmembrane viral proteins with ion channel activities modulating properties of intracellular membranes, which impacts several fundamental biological processes such as trafficking, ion fluxes as well as connections and exchanges between organelles. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) encodes a viroporin, p7, acting during assembly, envelopment and secretion of viral particles. HCV p7 is produced by cleavage from the HCV polyprotein but also exists as an E2p7 precursor, of poorly defined properties. In this study, we have explored how the retarded cleavage between E2 glycoprotein and p7 viroporin could regulate their functions associated to virion assembly and/or perturbation of cellular membrane processes. Specifically, we demonstrate that p7 is able to regulate the cell secretory pathway, which induces the intracellular retention of HCV glycoproteins and favors assembly of HCV particles. Our study also identifies a novel assembly function located at p7 amino-terminus that is unmasked through E2p7-regulated processing and that controls the infectivity of different types of released viral particles. Altogether, our results underscore a critical post-translational control of assembly and secretion of HCV particles that governs their specific infectivity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver diseases worldwide. With 180 million people persistently infected, chronic HCV infection induces liver diseases such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although new direct antiviral agents are now able to eradicate the virus in most patients, no protective vaccine currently exists against HCV and it remains major challenges in basic, translational and clinical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>HCV is a plus-strand RNA enveloped virus. Its genome is translated as a single polyprotein that is processed by cellular and viral proteases in 10 mature viral proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref003">3</xref>] consisting of: i) an assembly module (core-E1-E2-p7-NS2) encompassing the capsid protein (core) as well as the E1 and E2 surface glycoproteins that are incorporated in viral particles, and the p7 and NS2 proteins that support virion assembly, and ii) a replication module encompassing the nonstructural proteins NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B that are sufficient to support viral RNA replication but that also contribute to virion production through ill-defined processes. As HCV proteins arise from a shared polyprotein, several post-translational modifications control their expression rates within infected cells. In addition, at least three precursors, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., tandem proteins with delayed cleavage, are also detected and may implement functions different than their cognate individual proteins. They consist of immature core protein, associated to the D3 trans-membrane peptide, whose removal allows core targeting to lipid droplets (LDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref005">5</xref>]; NS4B-5A, which promotes the formation of replication vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref006">6</xref>]; and E2p7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref011">11</xref>], whose properties are explored in this report.</p>
<p>Assembly of viral particles occurs at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived membranes in close proximity to LDs and virus replication complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref012">12</xref>], with NS2 and p7 being key players in gathering virion components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref017">17</xref>]. Particularly, NS2 associates with E1E2 glycoproteins and NS3 as well as with NS5A, which interacts with HCV RNA and core [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref020">20</xref>] and promotes genome encapsidation. Virion assembly begins with the formation of a nucleocapsid, formed by core/RNA complex, and is coupled with its envelopment and acquisition of the E1E2 glycoproteins as well as lipids and apolipoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref021">21</xref>]. The pathway of secretion of virions remains to be elucidated and may occur through a non-canonical route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref023">23</xref>]. Of note, HCV produces different types of particles in addition to infectious virions, including nucleocapsid-free subviral particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref025">25</xref>], E2-containing exosome vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref027">27</xref>], naked nucleocapsids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref028">28</xref>], and a range of more or less lipidated infectious viral particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref029">29</xref>]; yet, the regulation of their production is poorly understood.</p>
<p>The p7 protein is a small, 63 amino-acid-long protein, consisting of a “hairpin-like” topology involving three helices inducing two trans-membrane segments connected by a hydrophilic, positively-charged cytosolic loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref032">32</xref>], though alternative folds and topologies have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref035">35</xref>], <italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., with the p7 C-terminus exposed to the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref033">33</xref>].

Importantly, p7 is dispensable for replication but essential for both assembly and secretion of infectious particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref011">11</xref>]. First, p7 modulates the formation of NS2 complexes with E2, NS3 and NS5A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref039">39</xref>], allowing clustering of assembly components and regulation of early assembly events. Second, p7 allows, in concert with NS2, the regulation of core localization at lipid droplets <italic>vs</italic>. ER-derived membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref017">17</xref>], from where viral particles are released in the secretory pathway. Third, p7 modulates the envelopment of nascent virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref040">40</xref>]. Fourth, p7 may regulate the pH of some intracellular compartments, which could be essential for the protection and secretion of infectious particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>A recent study indicated that residues of the first helix of p7 that are predicted to point toward the channel pore are important for assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref010">10</xref>]. Noteworthy, viroporin ion channel activities modulate properties of intracellular membranes and, thereby, impacts several fundamental biological processes such as trafficking, ion fluxes as well as connections and exchanges between organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref043">43</xref>]. While several biophysical studies showed that p7 can change ionic gradients in reconstituted membrane assays <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref047">47</xref>], few reports have addressed the relevance of such properties <italic>in cellulo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref049">49</xref>], although, by analogy with viroporins from alternative viruses, this may have diverse proviral functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref038">38</xref>]. For example, the 2B viroporin from coxsackievirus modulates calcium homeostasis, which leads to the suppression of apoptotic host cell responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref050">50</xref>]. Likewise, p7 may promote immune evasion by antagonizing the antiviral IFN function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref051">51</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, while p7 is released from the viral polyprotein through cleavage at E2-p7 and p7-NS2 junctions by the cellular signal peptidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref052">52</xref>], it also exists in infected cells as an E2p7 precursor of poorly defined properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref011">11</xref>]. Intriguingly, virus mutants that exhibit either only E2p7 precursor (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., using a point mutation in E2-p7 cleavage site) or, conversely, no E2p7 expression (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., using an IRES sequence between E2 and p7) are both impaired for production of infectious particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref053">53</xref>], suggesting that timely liberation of E2 and/or p7 are critical events for assembly/release of HCV particles.</p>
<p>Here, we explored how the retarded cleavage between E2 and p7 could regulate their functions associated to virion assembly and/or perturbation of cellular membrane processes. We demonstrate that p7 is able to regulate the cell secretory pathway, which induces intracellular retention of HCV glycoproteins, and to control release of nucleocapsid-free subviral and infectious viral particles. Specifically, through biochemical, imaging and functional analysis of a series of mutant viruses with modified E2-p7 junction as well as through p7 transcomplementation assays, our data uncover different mechanisms by which p7 regulates the proportion of different types of secreted HCV particles and determines their specific infectivity.</p>

<p>Since some viroporins from alternative viruses alter the canonical secretory pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref043">43</xref>], we then asked whether p7 could impact the secretion of VSV-G tsO45 (VSV-Gts), a temperature-dependent folding mutant of VSV-G glycoprotein commonly used as model cargo of protein secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref054">54</xref>]. At 40°C, this protein remains unfolded, resulting in its accumulation in the ER, whereas its folding can be restored at 32°C, which allowed its transfer from the ER to the Golgi and then the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). We transfected in Huh-7.5 cells VSV-Gts with p7 constructs from different HCV strains and using different signal peptide configurations, which resulted in <italic>ca</italic>. 60% of cells co-expressing both proteins among the transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). As monitored by flow cytometry analysis, p7 co-expression significantly reduced the kinetics and levels of VSV-Gts cell surface expression at permissive temperature of 32°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, to address how p7 alters traffic through the secretory pathway, we measured the resistance of intracellular VSV-Gts to endoH digestion, used as a marker of ER-to-Golgi traffic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref055">55</xref>]. While at 0h, all VSV-Gts glycans remained endoH-sensitive, reflecting ER retention at 40°C, they progressively became resistant to endoH cleavage upon 1-3h incubation at 32°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g001">Fig 1D–1F</xref>), underscoring VSV-Gts transfer to the Golgi apparatus. Importantly, p7 co-expression resulted in dose-dependent decrease of the kinetics of VSV-Gts endoH-resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g001">Fig 1D–1F</xref>), in a manner similar to influenza virus M2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), indicating that p7 slowed down the rate of VSV-Gts ER-to-Golgi traffic or, alternatively, favored its retention in the ER. We noticed that p7 proteins from different HCV genotypes/strains mediated this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) with that of H77 strain appearing less efficient for inhibiting Golgi transfer. We also found that p7 associated to its own signal-peptide, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., the E2 amino-terminus (∆E2p7 construct), induced the strongest VSV-Gts ER retention.</p>
<p>We then thought that p7-mediated alteration of the secretory pathway could induce the retention of HCV glycoproteins at ER membranes, which may favor assembly of HCV particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref021">21</xref>]. Thus, we expressed E1E2 glycoproteins, alone or with p7, to promote their secretion in the cell supernatant as subviral particles (SVP), <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., nucleocapsid-free enveloped particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref024">24</xref>], that peaked at a buoyant density of <italic>ca</italic>. 1.05–1.06 g/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). As detected by E2 immunoblots from the pellets after ultracentrifugation of the cell supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g001">Fig 1H and 1I</xref>), we found that p7 co-expression induced up to 60% increase of E2 intracellular expression and concomitant 55% decrease of SVP release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). This resulted in a <italic>ca</italic>. 2–3 fold reduced E2 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g001">Fig 1I</xref>), which, combined with the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, indicates that p7 can induce the retention of HCV glycoproteins.</p>

<title>p7 N-terminal alterations that accelerate E2p7 cleavage inhibit HCV infectivity</title>
<p>By controlling the release of free p7, E2p7 cleavage efficiency may adjust the levels of p7 expression, which could regulate the extent by which p7 slows down the cell secretory pathway and, concomitantly, the traffic and thus secretion of HCV E2 glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g001">Fig 1A, 1H and 1I</xref>). Hence, we introduced mutations at the E2-p7 junction in Jc1 and/or JFH1 viruses in order to design HCVcc mutants that exhibit increased E2p7 cleavage scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), as predicted by SignalP method (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/</ext-link>). This strategy was preferred over the use of an IRES sequence between E2 and p7, as reported before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref014">14</xref>], because it induces a natural, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., signal peptidase-mediated liberation of p7 from the HCV polyprotein. First, we inserted linkers of various sizes at the N-terminus of p7 (HAHALp7 and ASGGSp7 viruses), which left p7 sequence unchanged; the former linker consisting of a double HA tag allowing the detection of p7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref056">56</xref>]. Second, we introduced a substitution at position 2 of p7 (p7-L2S). Third, we generated p7 mutants having insertions of a single residue, either a threonine (p7-T2) at position 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref008">8</xref>] or an alanine (Ap7) at position 1 of p7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). None of these mutations–termed hereafter p7 ATMI (Amino-Terminus Membrane Interface) mutants, introduced before the first p7 helix (shown as grey box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref036">36</xref>], are expected to change p7 structure or opening of its channel pore, as shown by molecular modeling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).

<p>Next, we investigated the rate of E2p7 cleavage by treating lysates of Huh-7.5 cells expressing mutant virus RNAs with EndoH to remove E2 glycans, which improved E2 <italic>vs</italic>. E2p7 electrophoretic separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>).

Using a HA-tag antibody to reveal the HAHALp7 protein, we confirmed that the accelerated cleavage detected for the JFH1 HAHALp7 and Jc1 HAHALp7 viruses induced the release of p7 at the expected molecular size with poor if not undetectable E2p7 (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., E2HAHALp7) expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), though such analysis could not be extended to the other p7 ATMI mutants owing to the unavailability of antibodies against native p7. In addition, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref011">11</xref>], we also detected small amounts of E2p7NS2 precursor for both wt and mutant viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s002">S2A Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, when we investigated the infectivity of these mutant viruses, we found that, relative to parental viruses, the p7 ATMI mutant viruses had decreased extracellular infectivity, by <italic>ca</italic>. 3-fold to over 100-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), depending on the p7 modifications and the virus backbones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Particularly, the Ap7 insertion and the p7-L2S substitution mutants in JFH1 virus induced <italic>ca</italic>. 3- and 10-fold decreased infectivity, respectively, whereas the p7-T2, ASGGSp7, and HAHALp7 JFH1 insertion mutants exhibited complete loss of infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Likewise, the Jc1 HAHALp7 mutant virus displayed a 10–20 fold reduced infectivity, as compared to parental virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Similar defects were observed for intracellular infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), indicating that these p7 ATMI mutant viruses were not impaired at the stage of secretion of viral particles. Finally, we found that co-expression of wt p7 (though not mutant p7 such as HAHALp7) restored the production of both extracellular and intracellular infectious particles to levels detected for wt viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2F and 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). Hence, since all p7 ATMI mutants displayed nearly complete E2p7 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>) and since HAHALp7 co-expressed with mutant viruses did not restore infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2G</xref>), these results indicated that the integrity of the N-terminal end of p7 itself is crucial for assembly of infectious particles.</p>
<p>Thus, in the subsequent experiments, we compared more particularly the Jc1 HAHALp7 virus to its parental Jc1 counterpart since this mutant retained some infectivity levels, which allowed us to further characterize this novel phenotype; yet, the most salient results described below could be extended to the other p7 ATMI mutant viruses (see supplemental figure set).</p>

As compared to wt viruses, we observed a 2–3 fold increased intracellular expression of total E2 (<italic>i.e.</italic>, free E2 + E2p7) for all mutant viruses exhibiting increased E2p7 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g003">Fig 3A–3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). No modification of E2 half-life could be detected for mutant <italic>vs</italic>. wt virus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). Specifically, taking into account that <italic>ca</italic>. 40% E2 was detected as E2p7 precursor for wt JC1 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>), we estimated that the actual ratio of free E2 expression for mutant <italic>vs</italic>. wt viruses is <italic>ca</italic>. 4–5 fold. We also found that core expression was increased by <italic>ca</italic>. 1.5–2 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g003">Fig 3B and 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s003">S3B Fig</xref>), whereas expression levels of NS2 and NS5A non-structural proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g003">Fig 3B and 3D</xref>) were unchanged. As similar results were obtained for all p7 ATMI mutant viruses, this indicated that these mutations modulated the expression levels of structural proteins without altering viral replication and/or translation. Importantly, co-expression of either wt p7 or HAHALp7 did not revert E2 expression to wt levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>), which indicated that increased E2p7 cleavage (rather that p7 N-terminus modification <italic>per se</italic>) induce up-regulation of E2 glycoproteins.</p>

<p>Next, we hypothesized that the increased expression of structural proteins could be due to a blockage of their secretion, which may also explain the losses of mutant virus infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2E–2G</xref>). Thus, we quantified the total secretion of virion components, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., E2 glycoproteins, core and viral RNAs, in the supernatants of cells expressing p7 ATMI mutant virus relative to wt virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Using immuno-precipitation (IP) assays of cell supernatants with GNA lectins, which bind glycans present on HCV E1E2 glycoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref057">57</xref>], we detected a <italic>ca</italic>. 4–5 fold increased secretion of E2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), which matched the 4–5 fold elevated levels of intracellular free E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, combined with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). Although the ratio of extracellular <italic>vs</italic>. total intracellular E2 expression levels indicated a 2–3 fold difference between wild-type and mutant viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), taking into account that 40% of intracellular E2 species were in the form of non-secreted E2p7, we deduced identical ratios of extracellular <italic>vs</italic>. intracellular free E2 for wt and mutant viruses. Similar results were obtained for the other p7 ATMI mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s004">S4A Fig</xref>), suggesting that the increased E2 secretion from cells expressing the p7 ATMI mutant viruses is directly linked to the augmented intracellular E2 expression. As co-expression of p7 in trans did not significantly restore E2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) and secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g004">Fig 4A and 4D</xref>) to wt levels, this indicated that the delayed cleavage of E2p7 is essential for the control of intracellular and extracellular E2 levels.</p>

</fig>
<p>Strikingly, in contrast to E2, we observed that the p7 ATMI mutant viruses had decreased secretion of both core and viral RNAs in the cell supernatants, by <italic>ca</italic>. 2–5 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s004">S4B and S4C Fig</xref>). Furthermore, we found that wt p7 restored normal secretion levels of nucleocapsid components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s004">S4D Fig</xref>) though not those of E2 glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). This indicated that viruses harboring p7 ATMI mutations display differential alterations of pathways leading to trafficking and/or secretion of viral glycoproteins <italic>vs</italic>. nucleocapsid components, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., HCV core and RNA. Finally, since mutant p7, <italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., HAHALp7, co-expression did not restore normal secretion levels of core and RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>), these results indicated that p7 itself, rather than its cleavage from E2, modulates the secretion of viral nucleocapsids.</p>
<p>Altogether, our results suggest that altered p7 expression, as induced by accelerated cleavage and release from E2 as well as by its N-terminal modification, influence the proportion of secreted virion components. Indeed, relative to core and/or viral RNAs, a 15–25 fold higher expression of HCV glycoproteins was detected in the supernatants of cells infected with Jc1 HAHALp7 virus as compared to wt virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found that the p7 ATMI mutant viruses exhibited strongly decreased specific infectivity relative to their content in core protein or viral RNA, from 4–5 fold for Jc1 HAHALp7 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g004">Fig 4H and 4I</xref>) to over 50-fold for other mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>). Likewise, relative to E2 glycoprotein, the specific infectivity of the Jc1 HAHALp7 virus was decreased by <italic>ca</italic>. 35-fold, as compared to the parental virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). Importantly, co-expression of wt p7, but not of ATMI mutant p7, restored (though not completely), the specific infectivity of the mutant viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g004">Fig 4G–4I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s005">S5C Fig</xref>). Altogether, this pointed out to altered ratios of different secreted forms of HCV-derived particles incorporating these components or, alternatively, altered composition of the viral particles themselves.</p>

<title>p7 controls secretion levels of HCV-derived particles</title>
<p>To demonstrate if the viral components were secreted in particulate forms, we centrifuged the supernatants of infected-cells in conditions allowing sedimentation of particles. We detected in the pellets a <italic>ca</italic>. 3-fold increase of E2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g005">Fig 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s006">S6A Fig</xref>) and a 2–3 fold decrease of both core and RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g005">Fig 5C</xref>) while comparing Jc1 HAHALp7 mutant <italic>vs</italic>. parental viruses. This augmentation of secreted particle-associated E2 levels could be detected for all p7 ATMI mutant viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed an increased secretion of E1-containing particles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s006">S6A Fig</xref>), likely owing to secretion of HCV glycoproteins as E1E2 heterodimers. Furthermore, ectopic expression of wt p7 restored wt levels of particle-associated HCV glycoproteins, core and RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g005">Fig 5A and 5C</xref>). Since ectopically-expressed ATMI mutant p7 did not rescue the above levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), this indicated that p7 N-terminus modifications rather than accelerated E2p7 cleavage induced changes in secretion levels of mutant viral particles, perhaps by altering the ratios between SVPs and (infectious) viral particles.</p>

</fig>
<p>Then, we aimed at characterizing the different types and proportions of secreted particles for wt <italic>vs</italic>. p7 ATMI mutant viruses.</p>
<p>First, to confirm that E2 detected in the pellets of ultracentrifuged cell supernatants was secreted as particles, we treated the supernatants of virus-expressing cells with Triton-X100 before ultracentrifugation. We found that such treatment decreased the presence of E2 in the pellets for both wt and mutant viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g005">Fig 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s006">S6C Fig</xref>), hence indicating that a substantial part of secreted E2 proteins were in a sediment form, likely vesicular.</p>
<p>Second, since the p7 ATMI mutant viruses secreted higher E2 amounts with poorer infectivity compared to wt viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g004">Fig 4G</xref>), we quantified the association of their glycoproteins with other virion components, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., core and RNA. When we pulled down E2 using GNA lectins, we found a 5–6 fold decreased association of core and RNA with E2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Moreover, ectopic expression of wt p7, though not mutant p7, restored, though partially, the association of E2 with viral core and genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Finally, we investigated the degree of envelopment of the secreted core proteins within a lipid bilayer. Hence, we treated the supernatants of virus-expressing cells with proteinase K and subsequently determined the amounts of proteinase K-resistant core, which indicates its full protection by a lipid membrane or, conversely, its secretion as naked or badly enveloped core particles. Interestingly, as compared to their corresponding parental viruses, we detected decreased amounts of membrane-protected core for Jc1 HAHALp7 virus and, more dramatically, for JFH1 HAHALp7 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), which correlated with their respective losses of infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2E–2G</xref>). Furthermore, we found that co-expression of wt p7, though not mutant p7, restored the lipid membrane envelopment of their secreted core proteins to almost wt levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, these results pointed out to a disruption induced by p7 amino-terminus changes of the degree of association between HCV glycoproteins, viral envelopes and nucleocapsids, which could be due to an excess of E2 <italic>vs</italic>. core and RNA forms secreted independently, such as SVPs <italic>vs</italic>. naked/partially enveloped core particles, respectively, or, alternatively, to an increased density of E2 glycoproteins on the surface of secreted viral particles.</p>
<p>To investigate this further, we separated virus sub-populations using buoyant density-gradient fractionation. Jc1 and JFH1 HCVcc physical particles had more than 90% of viral RNA and 95% of core protein in fractions of densities of 1.10–1.15 g/ml, with a peak at 1.11 g/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g006">Fig 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s007">S7A–S7C Fig</xref>). As shown before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref062">62</xref>], core and RNA could also be detected at higher densities (to up to 1.36 g/ml) and at lower densities, until 1.02 g/ml (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Jc1 HCVcc particles had more than 80% of their infectivity in fractions of densities of 1.08–1.13 g/ml, with a peak at 1.11 g/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g006">Fig 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>), in agreement with recent reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref060">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref064">64</xref>]. Lastly, we found that E2 glycoproteins were detected in lower density fractions, with <italic>ca</italic>. 90% in fractions of densities of 1.03–1.08 g/ml and a peak at 1.05–1.06 g/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g006">Fig 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s007">S7A Fig</xref>) representing SVPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Importantly, less than 10% of E2 could be detected at densities of 1.08–1.15 g/ml, in which physical and infectious particles were prominent and corresponded to enveloped viral particles.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the density profile of Jc1 HAHALp7 virus was qualitatively similar to that of wt virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g006">Fig 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>) and did not reveal any alteration of the distribution of the different types of particles along the gradient. However, quantitatively, we found the same alterations of the ratios of E2, core, RNA and infectivity in the different fractions for the mutant <italic>vs</italic>. parental virus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s007">S7A Fig</xref>), as compared to unfractionated viral particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g005">Fig 5A and 5C</xref>). Specifically, 2–3 fold augmented E2 levels were detected in the SVP fractions of 1.03–1.08 densities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). Likewise, 2–3 fold reduced core or RNA levels were detected in all fractions whereas infectious titers were decreased by <italic>ca</italic>. 10-fold in these fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). Furthermore, we found that, whatever the density, the co-expression of Jc1 HAHALp7 virus with ectopic p7 restored wt infectivity concomitantly to restoration of the wt levels of core and RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s007">S7B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we found that the loss of infectivity was accentuated for the JFH1 HAHALp7 virus, which displays a stronger phenotype than the Jc1 HAHALp7 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2E–2G</xref>), in fractions of densities of 1.08–1.15 g/ml containing most viral particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g006">Fig 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). Particularly, while core levels were reduced by <italic>ca</italic>. 2–3 fold for both Jc1 HAHALp7 and JFH1 HAHALp7, 6- and over 100-fold reductions of infectivity levels were detected for the Jc1 HAHALp7 and JFH1 HAHALp7 mutant viruses, respectively, relative to parental viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g006">Fig 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, these results suggested that the p7 N-terminus controls both the secretion and the specific infectivity of secreted virus particles, likely <italic>via</italic> a process involving the completion of their envelopment, as indicated by the PK-sensitivity of core from secreted p7 ATMI mutant particles.</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>p7 amino-terminal alterations impair NS2, NS5A and E2 interactions required for envelopment of infectious particles</title>
<p>We then aimed at dissecting how p7 modulates the composition of viral particles by addressing HCV assembly mechanisms, from intracellular clustering of virion components to their envelopment.</p>
<p>First, since the HCV virion assembly rate is linked to core subcellular localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref065">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref067">67</xref>] and since p7 alters this event in concert with NS2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref040">40</xref>], we investigated by confocal microscopy analysis whether core from p7 ATMI mutant viruses could be relocated from lipid droplets to ER membranes, where envelopment and release of viral particles occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref021">21</xref>]. While individually expressed Jc1 core had predominant distribution around lipid droplets, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref017">17</xref>], its co-expression with either wt p7 or HAHALp7 protein induced full targeting at ER membranes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). Similar results were obtained with full-length viruses, since no difference between Jc1 and Jc1 HAHALp7 viruses could be detected regarding the prevalent ER-localization of their core proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s008">S8B Fig</xref>). These data indicated that the p7 ATMI mutations and/or the accelerated E2p7 cleavage did not prevent p7-mediated early assembly events leading to core targeting to the ER membrane, but rather, impaired later assembly events.</p>
<p>Using HA-tag antibodies, we confirmed that HAHALp7 and core co-localized at the ER in cells infected with the Jc1 HAHALp7 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), as reported before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref056">56</xref>]. Interestingly, we found that HAHALp7 and core co-localization could also be detected in infected cells treated with 5μg/ml digitonin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g007">Fig 7A and 7C</xref>), which permeabilizes plasma but not ER membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref068">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref069">69</xref>].

<p>Next, since the NS2 non-structural protein is thought to serve as a scaffold for gathering virion assembly components through its interaction with E1E2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref071">71</xref>] and since p7 regulates this association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref039">39</xref>], we tested if our p7 ATMI mutants had impaired E1E2/NS2 association. Using confocal microscopy, we did not detect altered co-localization of core, E2 and NS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g009">Fig 9A and 9B</xref>), further highlighting that the assembly sites of viral particles were not grossly changed. However, when we analyzed E1 and NS2 co-immuno-precipitation with E2 antibodies, although the E1/E2 association was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g009">Fig 9C</xref>), we detected a 3–4 fold decreased association of E2 with NS2 for p7 ATMI mutant <italic>vs</italic>. wt viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g009">Fig 9E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s010">S10A Fig</xref>). These results indicated that, relative to wt virus, the higher amounts of intracellular HCV glycoproteins detected for the p7 ATMI mutant viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s003">S3 Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s007">S7 Fig</xref>) were not associated to NS2. This implied that only a fraction of the up-regulated E2 levels interact with the NS2 assembly platform, and suggested that part of the pool of HCV glycoproteins not associated to NS2 or to assembly sites induce the formation of SVPs. Thus, we performed the reverse co-immuno-precipitation with NS2 antibodies to more directly address interactions between assembly proteins at assembly sites. Strikingly, when we analyzed E1 and E2 co-immuno-precipitation with NS2, we found <italic>ca</italic>. 2–3 fold increased E1E2 association to NS2 in cells expressing Jc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g009">Fig 9F</xref>) or JFH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g009">Fig 9D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s010">S10B Fig</xref>) p7 ATMI mutant viruses, as compared to parental viruses.

Thus, since ectopically-expressed p7 did not restore wt intracellular E2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) and since NS2 expression was unchanged for the mutant virus compared to wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), this indicated that p7 N-terminus modulates NS2 association with HCV glycoproteins.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report here novel functions of the HCV p7 viroporin, which appears to modulate i) the cell secretory pathway, ii) the assembly and proportion of different secreted HCV-derived particle forms, including SVPs, partially enveloped core particles and infectious virions, and iii) the specific infectivity of the latter type of particles. Overall, our results provide novel insights in the properties of p7, particularly regarding the role of its junction segment with E2 and its retarded cleavage from E2. This distinguishes different functions of p7 between those that only depend on delayed E2p7 cleavage from those that reveal the role played by the p7 amino-terminus itself in envelopment and production of infectious viral particles.</p>

<title>E2p7 cleavage rate regulates E2 intracellular levels</title>
<p>Because of their intrinsic capacity to be routed to the cell surface, owing to their localization in the cell secretory pathway, the traffic and distribution of envelope glycoproteins need to be controlled, by <italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., retention in specific intracellular compartments, in order to avoid immune detection of infected cells. Moreover, as these glycoproteins are synthesized in the ER lumen, counteracting ER stress activation in infected cells is important to avoid subsequent cell death. Since HCV proteins are expressed from a polyprotein, implying that all proteins are initially expressed at the same rate, its well-ordered cleavage may regulate the stability and functions of some proteins, such as for E2 and p7 that coexist with a E2p7 precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2</xref>) of ill-defined functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref011">11</xref>]. Here, by designing mutants at E2-p7 junction, we show that the augmentation of E2p7 cleavage, which is mediated by signal peptidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref052">52</xref>], induced an up-regulation of the levels of E2 in infected cells, by <italic>ca</italic>. 4–5 fold.</p>
<p>This original phenotype is not caused by increased rates of replication or translation of such mutant viruses, judging from similar levels of viral RNAs or of non-structural proteins, respectively, for mutant <italic>vs</italic>. wt viruses. That both short peptide extensions and single alanine insertion before p7 structure induced E2p7 increased cleavage and E2 up-regulation at similar levels (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g003">3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s003">S3A Fig</xref>) argued against the possibility that p7 N-terminal modifications could <italic>per se</italic> change E2 expression. Consistently, co-expression of wt p7 with these mutant viruses did not restore wt E2 intracellular levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Different possibilities may explain how E2p7 processing could modulate E2 expression. On the one hand, liberated E2 could be stabilized by its partners, such as <italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., E1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref074">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref075">75</xref>] or SPCS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref071">71</xref>]. On the other hand, E2 and E2p7 could activate or block different degradation pathways, such as autophagy or proteasome/lysosome. Indeed, HCV glycoproteins are known to be activators of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in HCV-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref076">76</xref>]. Finally, it is also possible that the amounts of free p7, which are likely higher for the p7 ATMI mutant viruses, may regulate these degradation pathways. In support of these assumptions, a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref077">77</xref>] indicated that a mutation of p7 reported to block cleavage between E2 and p7 (p7-R(K)GR33-35AAA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref013">13</xref>] induced E2 degradation. Likewise, mutants abrogating E2p7 cleavage, such as E2-A367R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2</xref>) as well as p7-A1W, p7-E3W, p7-K4W, p7-A10W or p7-S12W [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref010">10</xref>], exhibited poor E2p7 expression despite wt rates of replication, relative to parental viruses. Further studies will be necessary to clarify this issue.</p>

<title>Processing of E2p7 modulates E2 targeting to NS2 assembly platform</title>
<p>Regulation of the intracellular quantities of surface glycoproteins as well as their recruitment at virion assembly sites is crucial for production of infectious particles, which require optimal E1E2 incorporation levels to mediate entry into cells. Several cellular factors promoting the different steps of HCV assembly have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref003">3</xref>] and include factors allowing initial core and NS5A targeting at the LDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref078">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref082">82</xref>], HCV particle assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref071">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref083">83</xref>], or fission of enveloped nucleocapsids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref084">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref085">85</xref>]. As for viral factors, NS2 gathers assembly components at ER-localized sites near LDs and replication complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref086">86</xref>], at detergent-resistant membranes (DRM) areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref039">39</xref>]. Specifically, NS2 interaction with E2 and E1 as well as with other viral factors—p7, NS3 and NS5A, is believed to be key for virion biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref071">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref084">84</xref>]. Yet, independent of this capture mechanism, E1E2 glycoproteins have the intrinsic capacity to induce SVP formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g001">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref024">24</xref>], which implies a competition for their recruitment at the assembly sites of infectious particles. Noteworthy, E2/NS2 interaction depends on SPCS1, one of the 5 subunits of signal peptidase, and abrogation of E2/NS2/SPCS1 triple interaction <italic>via</italic> SPCS1 silencing markedly reduced HCV assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref071">71</xref>].</p>
<p>Our co-IP assays indicated that increasing E2p7 cleavage, concomitantly with augmented E2 expression and SVP formation, stimulated the interaction between E1E2 and NS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g009">Fig 9D and 9F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s010">S10B Fig</xref>). A first, simple possibility to explain this stronger E1E2/NS2 association may involve the increase of E2 intracellular expression, which, incidentally, would lead to greater opportunities for E2/NS2 association. A second possibility could involve either a concentration of SPCS1 at the vicinity of E2 and NS2, as a result of SPCS1 recruitment by the signal peptidase complex during E2p7 and p7NS2 processing, or, alternatively, of a preferential interaction of cleaved, liberated E2 with SPCS1 and hence, with NS2. However, both possibilities would be difficult to reconcile with the finding that wt p7 co-expression, which did not restore wt E2 intracellular levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), restored normal levels of E1E2/NS2 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g009">Fig 9D and 9F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s010">S10B Fig</xref>). A third possibility is that the alteration of p7 N-terminus in our E2-p7 junction mutants may affect NS2 capacity to interact with some of its other partners, as discussed below. Unexpectedly, our results indicated that the increased E1E2/NS2 interaction correlated with reduced formation of infectious particles, in agreement with lowered secretion of nucleocapsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). In this respect, it is likely that a loss of viral particle formation would translate in an increase of E2 density on NS2 platforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g009">Fig 9D and 9F</xref>) because E2 would not be consummated in assembled and released virions.</p>

Intriguingly, we reveal here for the first time, a novel determinant at the extreme amino-terminal end of p7, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., before its first helix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), that strongly modulates infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and the relative amounts of enveloped <italic>vs</italic>. non/partially-enveloped core particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Furthermore, we demonstrate that changes in this amino-terminal p7 determinant (p7 ATMI mutants), <italic>via e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., short peptide extensions, single amino-acid insertions or substitutions that did not alter p7 structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), induced a stronger reduction of infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g002">Fig 2</xref>) than of secretion of enveloped core particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g006">Fig 6D</xref>), resulting in reduced specific infectivity of the mutants, by 4- to over 50-fold depending on ATMI mutant types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g004">Fig 4G–4I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s005">S5 Fig</xref>.</p>
<p>Envelopment of viral particles pertains to a series of events that likely occur rapidly once two components, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., surface glycoproteins and nucleocapsids, encounter at assembly sites following mobilization from their respective storage pools, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., respectively, NS2 platforms apposed to LDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref039">39</xref>] and LDs/replication complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref012">12</xref>]. Such events are difficult to catch experimentally, because they are transient by nature as they lead to quick release of assembled viral particle from such assembly sites within the ER lumen. How HCV core and RNA are transferred from LD surface to ER assembly sites to initiate the release of infectious, enveloped viral particles remains poorly defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref087">87</xref>], although it involves concerted actions of p7 and NS2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref017">17</xref>] and of NS5A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref020">20</xref>]. Accordingly, previously described assembly-defective mutants, such as p7-KR33/35QQ and core-C69-72A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref040">40</xref>], ∆p7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref065">65</xref>] or ∆E1E2 and NS5A-∆2328–2435 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref020">20</xref>], display strong core-LD accumulation, which correlates with their loss of infectivity. Strikingly, in contrast to these previous assembly mutants but similar to parental viruses, our Jc1 p7 ATMI mutants readily targeted core at the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s008">S8 Fig</xref>) despite reduced infectivity and did not significantly alter the co-clustering of structural and non-structural proteins with HCV RNA (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g010">10</xref>), both of which events previously shown to be critical for achieving efficient assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref065">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref066">66</xref>]. Moreover, as shown by others, p7 regulates NS2 subcellular localization at punctate sites near LDs and its association with DRMs along with other viral proteins, including core, E2, and NS3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref086">86</xref>]; yet, while other assembly-defective virus mutants, such as the p7-KR33/35QQ and p7-KR33/35AA in these previous reports, disrupted NS2 localization and/or E2/NS2 association, the p7 ATMI mutants displayed increased E1E2/NS2 interaction, compared to parental viruses. Along with the finding that our mutants exhibited wt capacity to slow down the cell secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), this underscores that the ATMI class of p7 mutants retains most p7 properties and inhibits viral assembly though a novel mechanism.</p>
<p>Our results imply an envelopment defect caused by inadequate mobilization and/or transfer of core and RNA at E1E2-containing NS2 assembly platforms. This is reflected by our findings that such p7 ATMI mutants exhibited altered E1E2/NS2 and NS2/NS5A interactions (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g009">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g010">10</xref>) but also that failure to mediate correct particle envelopment resulted in secretion of partially enveloped, proteinase K-sensitive core particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Since co-expression of our mutant viruses with wt p7 restored the above alterations to almost normal levels, this questions about the role of p7 N-terminus in this mechanism and raises the possibility that it regulates core and RNA transfer to assembly sites and/or to assembling viral particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g011">Fig 11</xref>). Interestingly, a previous report suggested that p7 genetically interacts with some regions of NS2 as well as of NS5A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref088">88</xref>], strengthening the notion of a functional dialog between p7, NS2 and NS5A. Our findings that the N-terminus of HA-tagged p7 points towards the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g007">Fig 7</xref>) support the likelihood that it mediates critical interactions with cytosolic factors promoting assembly. A possibility is that modifications of p7 N-terminal surface, before the first p7 helix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006774.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), disrupted such interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g011">Fig 11</xref>). In this respect, co-localization and association of NS2 with NS5A, which is decreased upon p7 deletion or alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref016">16</xref>], is thought as a crucial event mediating core/RNA transfer to assembly sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref066">66</xref>]. Thus, since our mutant viruses did not display altered co-localization of these assembly factors, it is likely that NS2 complexes formed with p7 ATMI mutants failed to efficiently mediate the encountering of nucleocapsids with NS2-bound viral surface components and/or to induce the release of fully enveloped, infectious viral particles. Why such failure resulted in a proportional release of partially enveloped core particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g006">Fig 6B</xref> <italic>vs</italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g006">Fig 6D</xref>), which could be similar to those that have been detected in the serum of infected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref028">28</xref>], is intriguing. It raises the possibility that the transfer of core and RNA to E1E2 glycoproteins liberated from NS2 complexes at assembly sites is associated to the recruitment of a mechanism that closes nascent particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g011">Fig 11</xref>). Such a mechanism, which likely involves components of the ESCRT pathway, as previously described for HCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref084">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref085">85</xref>], could be disrupted by p7 ATMI mutants is such a way that, rather than being correctly closed, the budding membrane capsule would detach, allowing escape of imperfectly enveloped nucleocapsids in the ER lumen, which could explain their reduced specific infectivity. Indeed, as p7 ATMI mutants impair the interaction between NS2 and NS5A, this may prevent the recruitment of HRS, an ESCRT-0 component that interacts with p7, NS2 and NS5A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref084">84</xref>] and subsequently, of all ESCRT components required for correct envelopment.</p>

Subsequently, the E1E2-free p7NS2NS5A complex leaves whereas a new E1E2p7NS2 complex reaches the assembly area (dotted arrows). (<bold>4</bold>) The process is reiterated with p7 from incoming E1E2p7NS2 complexes regulating the encountering of NS2 and NS5A, which leads to the further release of E1E2 and core/RNA that accumulate at the assembly site.

<title>Free p7 slows down the cell secretory pathway</title>
<p>Our data indicate that the regulation of the amounts of free p7 could modulate the production of viral particles. Indeed, we found that p7, which localizes at the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g007">Fig 7</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref089">89</xref>] slows down the cell secretory pathway in a dose-dependent manner, likely at the stage of ER-Golgi transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g001">Fig 1</xref>). While this property is not intuitive, given that HCV, like other <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, is thought to exit the cells through the secretion pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref090">90</xref>], this could either induce the concentration of its glycoproteins at virion assembly sites in the ER lumen through their active retention or reflect the cooptation of another pathway of secretion for HCV particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref023">23</xref>]. Furthermore, as HCV glycoproteins can be secreted as SVPs independently of other viral proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g001">Fig 1G</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref024">24</xref>], this feedback loop may ensure that excess glycoproteins, arising from their release upon E2p7 cleavage, could be appropriately controlled so as to prevent activation of immune responses. Additionally, as indicated by the delayed transport of VSV-Gts used as a model cargo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006774.g001">Fig 1B–1F</xref>), it is possible that p7 expression could alter the secretion of cellular proteins such as, <italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., immune effectors, as shown for viroporins of other viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref091">91</xref>].</p>
<p>The mechanism used by p7 to slow down the secretion of glycoproteins needs further investigation. Viroporins of alternative viruses have previously been involved in modulation of the secretory pathway, though through a variety of mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref038">38</xref>]. For example, the M2 protein from influenza virus has a direct effect on late steps of plasma membrane delivery by delaying late Golgi transport, which indirectly affects the efficiency of earlier transport steps by altering the ionic content of the Golgi apparatus and the endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref092">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref093">93</xref>]. Alternatively, Coxsackievirus 2B proteins modify ER membranes, which inhibits protein processing and sorting by decreasing calcium homeostasis in ER and Golgi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref043">43</xref>]. Likewise, p7 can change ionic gradients in both reconstituted membrane assays <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref047">47</xref>] and <italic>in cellulo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref042">42</xref>], which could affect anterograde transport and/or modify intracellular compartments.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our report underscores the function of E2p7 delayed processing in modulating i) the intracellular E2 levels, ii) the retention of E2 through the slowing down of the secretion pathway, and iii) the unmasking of functions of p7 amino-terminus in assembly and envelopment.</p>

<p>For NS2/E2 interaction, 1 million electroporated cells were lysed with buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000xg for 10 min at 4°C and were incubated overnight at 4°C with AR3A antibody against HCV E2 or with rabbit NS2 antibody. Protein A/G-coated agarose beads were added to samples for 2h at room temperature. Immune complexes were then washed and eluted with Laemmli buffer for 5 min at 95°C before western blot analysis.</p>
<p>For NS2/NS5A interaction, 1 million electroporated cells were cross-linked with 1mM dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP) (ThermoFisher) 30min at room temperature. Tris (pH 7.5) was added up to 200 mM to quench unreacted DSP. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5% n-dodecyl-β-maltoside) and treated as for NS2/E2 interaction with incubation with rabbit NS2 antibody.</p>

<title>Immuno-fluorescence (IF) and confocal microscopy imaging</title>
<p>Experimental procedures were previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref066">66</xref>]. Briefly, Huh7.5 cells grown on glass coverslips and were infected at MOI of 0.2. 72h post-infection, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15min, quenched with 50mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Fixed cells were then incubated with primary antibodies in 1% BSA/PBS, washed and stained with the corresponding fluorescent Alexa-conjugated secondary antibody (Alexa-488, Alexa-555 and Alexa-647, Molecular Probes) in 1% BSA/PBS. LDs were stained with 10μg/mL Bodipy 493/503 (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were washed with PBS, stained for nuclei with Hoechst (Molecular Probes) and mounted with Mowiol 4–88 (Sigma-Aldrich) prior to image acquisition with LSM-710 (Zeiss) confocal microscope. When stated, the combined detection of HCV RNA by FISH and viral proteins was done as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref066">66</xref>].</p>
<p>For digitonin permeabilization, the staining procedure was the same except that cells were permeabilized with 5μg/ml Digitonin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min. Cells permeabilized with Triton X-100 were acquired first; then, cells permeabilized with Digitonin were acquired in order to use the same laser settings.</p>

<title>Molecular modeling of p7 hexamers</title>
<p>Three-dimensional homology models of p7 hexamers and their mutants were constructed using the NMR/MD p7 model of Chandler and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref036">36</xref>] and the NMR p7 structure of OuYang and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref035">35</xref>] (PDB accession number 2M6X) as templates. Models of p7 were constructed with the Swiss-Model automated protein structure homology modeling server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.expasy.org/spdbv/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.expasy.org/spdbv/</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref096">96</xref>]) using the HCV JFH1 strain p7 sequence as input. JFH1 p7 homology model derived from OuYang et al. was directly obtained as a hexamer by the automated procedure. For JFH1 p7 homology model derived from Chandler et al., raw amino-acid sequence of p7 from strain JFH1 was first loaded in Swiss-PdbViewer software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref096">96</xref>] and fitted to the NMR/MD p7 hexamer model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006774.ref036">36</xref>] before submission for model building to Swiss-Model using the SwissModel Project Mode. All p7 JFH1 mutants were constructed using the latter protocol, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., fitting of the raw amino-acid sequence of p7 mutants to wild type hexamer models from the JFH1 strain. Coordinates of homology models derived from the automated model building were used without further minimization or manual manipulation. For mutants Ap7 and ASGGSp7 exhibiting N-terminal extensions, additional residues were added manually assuming a random conformation and were minimized using Swiss-PDB Viewer tools.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Significance values were calculated by applying the paired t-test using the GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, USA). For confocal analysis, a two-tailed, unpaired Mann-Whitney test was applied. P values under 0.05 were considered statistically significant and the following denotations were used: ****, P≤0.0001; ***, P≤0.001; **, P≤0.01; *, P≤0.05; ns (not significant), P&gt;0.05.</p>
