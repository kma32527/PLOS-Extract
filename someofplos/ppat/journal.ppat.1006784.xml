<abstract>
<p>Hepadnavirus covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA is the <italic>bona fide</italic> viral transcription template, which plays a pivotal role in viral infection and persistence. Upon infection, the non-replicative cccDNA is converted from the incoming and <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized viral genomic relaxed circular (rc) DNA, presumably through employment of the host cell’s DNA repair mechanisms in the nucleus. The conversion of rcDNA into cccDNA requires preparation of the extremities at the nick/gap regions of rcDNA for strand ligation. After screening 107 cellular DNA repair genes, we herein report that the cellular DNA ligase (LIG) 1 and 3 play a critical role in cccDNA formation. Ligase inhibitors or functional knock down/out of LIG1/3 significantly reduced cccDNA production in an <italic>in vitro</italic> cccDNA formation assay, and in cccDNA-producing cells without direct effect on viral core DNA replication. In addition, transcomplementation of LIG1/3 in the corresponding knock-out or knock-down cells was able to restore cccDNA formation. Furthermore, LIG4, a component in non-homologous end joining DNA repair apparatus, was found to be responsible for cccDNA formation from the viral double stranded linear (dsl) DNA, but not rcDNA. In conclusion, we demonstrate that hepadnaviruses utilize the whole spectrum of host DNA ligases for cccDNA formation, which sheds light on a coherent molecular pathway of cccDNA biosynthesis, as well as the development of novel antiviral strategies for treatment of hepatitis B.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Hepadnavirus cccDNA is the persistent form of viral genome, and in terms of human hepatitis B virus (HBV), cccDNA is the basis for viral rebound after the cessation of therapy, as well as the elusiveness of a cure with current medications. Therefore, the elucidation of molecular mechanism of cccDNA formation will aid HBV research at both basic and medical levels. In this study, we screened a total of 107 cellular DNA repair genes and identified DNA ligase 1 and 3 as key factors for cccDNA formation from viral relaxed (open) circular DNA. In addition, we found that the cellular DNA ligase 4 is responsible for converting viral double-stranded linear DNA into cccDNA. Our study further confirmed the involvement of host DNA repair machinery in cccDNA formation, and may reveal new antiviral targets for treatment of hepatitis B in future.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hepadnavirus specifies a group of hepatotropic viruses that carry a single copy of the partially double stranded relaxed circular (rc) viral DNA genome in the enveloped virion particle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref001">1</xref>]. Hepadnavirus infects mammalian and avian hosts with strict species-specific tropism, including human hepatitis B virus (HBV) and duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref002">2</xref>]. It is estimated that HBV has infected 2 billion people globally, resulting in more than 250 million chronically infected individuals who are under the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Upon infection of an hepatocyte, the hepadnaviral rcDNA genome is delivered into the nucleus and converted into an episomal covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA, which exists as a minichromosome and serves as viral mRNA transcription template [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref006">6</xref>]. One mRNA species, termed pregenomic (pg) RNA, is packaged into the cytoplasmic nucleocapsid, where the viral polymerase reverse transcribes pgRNA into viral minus strand DNA, followed by asymmetric plus strand DNA synthesis to yield the major rcDNA genome or a minor double stranded linear (dsl) DNA form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref007">7</xref>]. The mature nucleocapsid either acquires viral envelope proteins for virion egress, or recycles the viral DNA to the nucleus to replenish the cccDNA reservoir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref008">8</xref>]. Therefore, cccDNA is an essential component of the hepadnavirus life cycle for establishing a persistent infection, and cccDNA elimination is an undisputed ultimate goal for a cure of hepatitis B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref009">9</xref>]. However, the available drugs for treatment of chronic hepatitis B are rarely curative due to their failure to eliminate cccDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref010">10</xref>]. Therefore there is an urgent unmet need to fully understand HBV cccDNA biology and develop novel effective treatments to directly target cccDNA formation and maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Unlike the episomal circular genomes of other DNA viruses, such as papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref014">14</xref>], HBV cccDNA does not undergo semiconservative replication, but is mainly converted from rcDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref001">1</xref>]. The molecular mechanism by which rcDNA is converted into cccDNA remains obscure. Comparing the major differences between rcDNA and cccDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g001">Fig 1</xref>), a series of well-orchestrated biological reactions are required to cope with the terminal molecular peculiarities of rcDNA during cccDNA formation, including: 1) completion of viral plus strand DNA synthesis; 2) removal of the 5’-capped RNA primer at the 5’ terminus of plus strand DNA; 3) removal of viral polymerase covalently attached to the 5’ end of minus strand DNA; 4) removal of one copy of the terminal redundancy on minus strand DNA; 5) ligation of both strands to generate the wildtype cccDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref009">9</xref>]. Previous studies by us and others have identified a rcDNA species without the viral polymerase attachment on the minus strand DNA, namely deproteinized rcDNA (DP-rcDNA) or protein-free rcDNA (PF-rcDNA), which is a putative functional precursor for cccDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref016">16</xref>]. The molecular mechanism underlying rcDNA deproteinization is largely unknown. Previous studies have demonstrated that the host tyrosol-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2) is able to unlink the covalent bond between viral polymerase and rcDNA <italic>in vitro</italic>, but its role in cccDNA formation remains controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref018">18</xref>]. We have further demonstrated that DP-rcDNA is produced in cytoplasmic viral capsid and transported into nucleus by cellular karyopherins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref019">19</xref>]. Upon nuclear delivery of DP-rcDNA, it is hypothesized that the host functions, most likely the DNA repair machinery, recognize the gaps/nicks in rcDNA as DNA breaks (damages), and repair it into the perfect circular cccDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref020">20</xref>]. Such an assumption has only been theoretically conceivable and has not been experimentally confirmed until a recent study reported that host DNA polymerase κ (POLK) is involved in HBV cccDNA formation during <italic>de novo</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref021">21</xref>]. In addition, hepadnaviral dslDNA can also be converted into cccDNA through illegitimate self-circularization after preparing the termini for intramolecular ligation, however, dslDNA-derived cccDNA normally carries insertion-deletion mutations (indels) at the junction region, a typical phenotype of host non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref024">24</xref>]. In line with this, we have previously demonstrated that an NHEJ component Ku80 is responsible for cccDNA formation from DHBV dslDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref025">25</xref>], thus further confirming the involvement of DNA repair machinery in cccDNA formation.</p>

<p>In order to systematically identify the host factors involved in cccDNA formation, we screened 107 human DNA repair genes for their effects on HBV cccDNA formation through shRNA knock-down in HepDES19 cells, and selected gene candidates (screen hits) for validation by functional inhibitions in multiple cell systems and assays. We report herein that the cellular DNA ligase (LIG) 1 and 3 are responsible for hepadnavirus cccDNA formation from rcDNA, and the conversion of dslDNA to cccDNA requires LIG4. Such findings will shed light on the molecular mechanism of cccDNA biosynthesis and suggest novel antiviral targets for treatment of chronic hepatitis B.</p>

<title>Screen for cellular DNA repair genes involved in cccDNA formation</title>
<p>We screened a total of 107 cellular DNA repair genes for their effects on HBV cccDNA production by shRNA knock-down (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Materials and methods</xref> for detailed screening procedures), and the primary screening result is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s001">S1 Fig</xref>. The screened genes were grouped based on their primarily associated DNA repair pathways. Knock-down of 8 genes showed more than 50% reduction of cccDNA compared to control knock-down, including LIG1 and LIG3. The low hit rate of the shRNA screen may be due to the incomplete depletion of the targeted genes and/or functional redundancy of the cellular DNA repair genes/pathways. Surprisingly, a large number of gene knock-down resulted in cccDNA upregulation. Such unanticipated observation indicates that certain DNA repair genes may negatively regulate cccDNA formation through rcDNA sequestration or even degradation, which awaits further investigations.</p>
<p>We prioritized DNA ligases for functional validation in cccDNA formation for two reasons. Firstly, although the redundant activities of host DNA repair factors may be involved in cccDNA formation, it is likely that the DNA ligation is an essential and final step to seal the nicks/gaps on rcDNA. Secondly, there are only three known DNA ligases in mammalian cells, including LIG1, LIG3, and LIG4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref026">26</xref>], and we have previously ruled out the involvement of NHEJ repair apparatus, which contains LIG4, in rcDNA to cccDNA conversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref025">25</xref>].</p>

<title>DNA ligase inhibitors block cccDNA formation in nuclear extract</title>
<p>In addition to the above cell-based screening assay, considering that the conversion of rcDNA into cccDNA occurs in the cell nucleus where the DNA repair machinery functions, we established an <italic>in vitro</italic> cell-free cccDNA formation system with nuclear protein extract. With this assay, we have tested the ability of cccDNA formation from the purified DHBV virion rcDNA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, although cccDNA could not be directly detected by Southern blot, we were able to detect cccDNA signal by a sensitive PCR assay with primers targeting the sequences outside of the gap region in DHBV rcDNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s002">S2A Fig</xref>), a similar principle has been used for the quantitative detection of HBV cccDNA by real-time PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref027">27</xref>]. The assay specificity is sufficient enough to distinguish 0.3 pg of cccDNA from 30 pg of input rcDNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s002">S2B and S2C Fig</xref>). Sequence analysis of the cccDNA amplicons demonstrated a perfect repair of rcDNA gaps in nuclear extract. It is worth noting that the observed cccDNA PCR signal from the above <italic>in vitro</italic> cccDNA formation assay might be derived from rcDNA-like template with one strand being repaired into a closed circular DNA. In line with this, a recent study has identified a HBV rcDNA species with a covalently closed minus strand but an open plus strand through digesting the Hirt DNA samples from cell cultures with 3’→5’ exonuclease I and III (ExoI/III), which is possibly an intermediate during rcDNA to cccDNA conversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref028">28</xref>]. We thus attempted to search for such rcDNA-like species that might be generated during the <italic>in vitro</italic> cccDNA formation reaction by the similar approach. However, neither the minus-strand nor the plus-strand closed circular ssDNA was detected by Southern blot (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), indicating that the rcDNA species with covalently closed minus or plus strand in this <italic>in vitro</italic> cccDNA formation assay, if any, is below the detection limit of Southern blot. Further optimization is needed to improve the assay robustness. Nonetheless, the current <italic>in vitro</italic> cell-free cccDNA formation assay may still be able to partly recapitulate the nuclear events during rcDNA to cccDNA conversion, which provides a simple and convenient system to assist the study of DNA repair functions in hepadnavirus cccDNA formation.</p>

<title>Ligase inhibitor L189 inhibited DHBV cccDNA formation in cell cultures</title>
<p>Taking advantage of the fast kinetics and high productivity of DHBV cccDNA formation, we established a tetracycline (tet)-inducible DHBV stable cell line in the background of HepG2 cells, namely HepDG10, to study hepadnavirus cccDNA formation in human cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, DHBV pgRNA, core DNA and cccDNA were rapidly and robustly produced in HepDG10 cells upon withdrawal of tet, cccDNA could be detected by Southern blot as early as day 4 post induction and it accumulated to more significant levels after longer induction. The authenticity of the cccDNA band shown on Southern blot was confirmed by heat denaturation and EcoRI linearization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Considering that HBV cccDNA formation in cell cultures is extremely time-consuming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref015">15</xref>], the HepDG10 cell line thus provides a robust and convenient cell-based system for assessing human gene functions in hepadnavirus cccDNA formation through loss-of-function approaches (e.g. chemical inhibitors, gene knock down/out), which the relative short assay window may avoid or reduce the potential cytotoxic effects and/or functional redundancy. Consistent with the results from the <italic>in vitro</italic> nuclear extract-based cccDNA formation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), pan-ligase inhibitor L189 also inhibited DHBV cccDNA accumulation in HepDG10 cells without affecting core DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), further indicating a role of ligase(s) in cccDNA formation.

The indel mutation sequencing result confirmed the disruption of LIG1 and LIG3 gene at genomic DNA level in the established HepDG10-LIG1 K.O. and HepDG10-LIG3 K.O. cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s005">S5A, S5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s006">S6A and S6B</xref> Figs).

Similar result was observed with another clone of HepDG10-LIG1 K.O. and HepDG10-LIG3 K.O. cells. The incomplete inhibition of cccDNA formation by knocking out either LIG1 or LIG3 might be due to a redundant function between these two DNA ligases.

<p>We have also attempted to CRISPR-out LIG1 and LIG3 simultaneously in HepDG10 cells, but were unable to obtain clones with complete knock-out of both genes, which might be due to that at least one ligase gene is required for cell viability. However, in a single colony-derived cell line with LIG1/3 double knock-down, which the knock-down efficiency was confirmed by both Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, top panel) and T7E1 indel assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s007">S7 Fig</xref>), DHBV cccDNA formation was more profoundly inhibited without affecting core DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), further confirming the requirement of LIG1/3 in cccDNA synthesis. In addition, the similar phenomena was observed in HepDG10 cells with LIG1/3 single or double knock-down by lentiviral shRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s008">S8 Fig</xref>).</p>

We reason that the concurrent decrease of protein-free rcDNA might be a consequence of cccDNA reduction because the Hirt DNA sample from HepDG10 cells contained a large quantity of nicked cccDNA, which has the indistinguishable electrophoretic mobility as true rcDNA but cannot be mild heat denatured into dslDNA form (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s009">S9 Fig</xref>).

<title>LIG4 is required for hepadnavirus cccDNA formation from the viral double stranded linear DNA genome</title>
<p>With rcDNA serving as the major viral genome DNA form and cccDNA precursor, hepadnavirus replication produces a minor double stranded linear (dsl) DNA species, which can also be converted into cccDNA format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref001">1</xref>].

In this study, we set out to assess the role of LIG4, the end effector of NHEJ pathway, in hepadnavirus cccDNA formation through gene knock-out approach. Because the classical CRSIPR/Cas9-based knock-out system requires NHEJ apparatus to introduce indel mutations at the DNA cleavage site, we made use of an alternative microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) DNA repair based CRISPR PITCh system to obtain the LIG4-null cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref032">32</xref>] (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Materials and methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s012">S12 Fig</xref>).

The results demonstrated that the cccDNA formation in the context of wildtype DHBV replication was not affected by knocking out LIG4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, comparing lane 2 to lane 1), while the cccDNA formation from dslDNA was completely abolished in the absence of LIG4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, lane 4 vs lane 3). Furthermore, restoration of LIG4 expression was able to rescue cccDNA formation in DSL-DHBV transfected LIG4 K.O. cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Collectively, the above data strongly supports a conclusion that LIG4 is specifically required for generating cccDNA from the hepadnaviral dslDNA genome.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The establishment and persistence of hepadnavirus infection is dependent upon the viral cccDNA, which is a non-replicating episomal viral genome deposited in the nucleus of infected cell after conformational conversion from viral rcDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref009">9</xref>]. Due to the limited gene-coding capacity of hepadnavirus genome, the virus needs to borrow host functions to complete its lifecycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref008">8</xref>]. The cellular DNA repair is a well-conserved surveillance and restoration system to detect and heal the damage in chromosomal DNA, by which maintains the stability and integrity of the host genome for replication and transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref034">34</xref>]. It is plausible that hepadnaviruses hijack the cellular DNA repair apparatus for cccDNA formation by disguising the rcDNA as a “damaged” DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref020">20</xref>]. The two gaps on rcDNA would be recognized as lesions for DNA repair by the host, and the DNA termini and their associated modifications are expected to undergo trimming, elongation, and ligation, during cccDNA formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g001">Fig 1</xref>). However, the host DNA repair pathway responsible for cccDNA formation remain largely unknown, and thus far, only a few host DNA repair enzymes have been reported to be involved in cccDNA formation, including the tyrosol-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref017">17</xref>], polymerase κ (POLK) and λ (POLL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref021">21</xref>]. In this study, we screened 107 host DNA repair factors to assess their individual effect on HBV cccDNA formation by lentiviral shRNA knock-down, and identified and validated the host DNA LIG1 and LIG3 as key factors for hepadnavirus cccDNA formation by using a battery of <italic>in vitro</italic> and cell-based assays. Such work hence provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying hepadnavirus cccDNA formation in hepatocyte nucleus.</p>
<p>As part of the cellular DNA replication and repair machineries, DNA ligases complete joining of DNA strands by catalyzing the phosphodiester bond formation. Specifically, LIG1 ligates the Okazaki fragments during chromosomal DNA synthesis, and it is involved in the ligation steps of homologous recombination repair (HRR), long-patch base-excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER); LIG3 is responsible for sealing single strand DNA breaks during the process of short-patch BER and NER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref026">26</xref>]. The involvement of DNA ligases in cccDNA formation indicated that the process of rcDNA termini generates ends that can be ligated and DNA ligases are the end-effectors for sealing the breaks of rcDNA. It is worth noting that previous studies have shown that LIG3, but not LIG4, is essential for nuclear DNA replication in the absence of LIG1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref036">36</xref>]; and LIG1 is a backup enzyme for LIG3 in BER and NER DNA repair pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref038">38</xref>]. Such functional redundancy between LIG1 and LIG3 may explain the unaffected cell viability and the incomplete inhibition of cccDNA formation by knocking down/out LIG1 or LIG3 only (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g004">4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s008">S8A</xref>) or knocking down both (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g004">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s008">S8B</xref>). In previous studies, the redundant functions in cccDNA formation have also been observed between POLK and POLL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref021">21</xref>], and perhaps between TDP2 and an unknown TDP2-like protein(s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref017">17</xref>]. It is of note that the potential role of TDP2 in cccDNA formation remains controversial. While one study demonstrated that knock-down of TDP2 inhibited, or at least delayed, DHBV cccDNA formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref017">17</xref>]; another study suggested that TDP2 might even serve as a negative regulator of HBV cccDNA formation rather than a facilitator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref018">18</xref>], and a recent study showed that TDP2 chemical inhibitors did not inhibit HBV infection in cell cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref039">39</xref>]. In our shRNA screen, POLK or TDP2 lentiviral shRNA did not significantly reduce cccDNA formation in HepDES19 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), indicating that cellular functional redundancy for each enzyme might also exist in our experimental system. Further validation and mechanistic studies are required to reconcile these results. On the other hand, it is also possible that the first round cccDNA formation from virion DNA during infection and the intracellular cccDNA amplification pathway may have preference for different DNA repair enzymes, or there is hepatic cell line- or clone-specific requirement of host DNA repair factors/pathways for cccDNA formation. We had attempted to CRIPSR out both ligases in HepDG10 cells but only achieved partial double knock-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), suggesting that at least one of LIG1 and LIG3 is required by the cells, and perhaps by hepadnaviruses as well. However, our data does not completely rule out a possibility that a LIG1/3-independent ligation mechanism might be involved in cccDNA formation, such as DNA topoisomerase I (TOP1) which has been suggested to play a role in rcDNA circularization through its DNA endonuclease and strand transferase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref040">40</xref>]. Based on the previous and current data, it can be also inferred that hepadnaviruses have evolved to take advantage of the functional redundancy of host DNA repair machinery for a successful cccDNA formation.</p>
<p>The mechanism underlying the different efficiency of cccDNA formation between HBV and DHBV remains largely unknown, but likely in a virus-specific but not host-specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref030">30</xref>]. Based on that, we created the cell-free and the human hepatoma cell-based DHBV system to facilitate the identification and validation of host and viral regulators of cccDNA formation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g003">3</xref>). In addition to the possible determining factors for cccDNA formation in the steps of rcDNA maturation, deproteinization, nuclear importation and uncoating, whether the cellular DNA repair system differentially recognizes and repairs nuclear HBV and DHBV rcDNA into cccDNA remains obscure. In this study, we found that both viruses employ LIG1 and LIG3 for cccDNA formation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s008">S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s011">S11</xref>), suggesting that the different repair process of HBV and DHBV rcDNA, if any, should be at the steps upstream of rcDNA end joining.</p>
<p>Though LIG1 and LIG3 have overlapping functions, knocking out/down of LIG3 resulted in relatively lower level of cccDNA than LIG1 knock-out/down (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s008">S8</xref>), which suggests that LIG3 may play a more important role in cccDNA formation. In line with this notion, the two separated nicks/gaps in rcDNA are reminiscent of single strand breaks, which are preferable substrates for LIG3 in BER- and NER-mediated single strand break repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Moreover, during the primary screen, two other BER components, APEX1 and POLB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref041">41</xref>], emerged as candidates for positive regulator of cccDNA formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), further suggesting the potential involvement of short-patch BER in cccDNA formation, which awaits further systematic investigations.</p>
<p>With the protein and RNA attachments at the 5’ end of minus- and plus-strand, respectively, hepadnavirus rcDNA is not a typical DNA break substrate for the major known repair pathways, and it is unknown whether the two gaps in rcDNA are repaired simultaneously or separately, including the final ligation step. A recent study revealed a nuclear rcDNA species with a covalently closed minus strand but an open plus strand, indicating that the nick on minus strand may be sealed first during cccDNA formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref028">28</xref>]. However, we did not observe an increased accumulation of protein-free rcDNA after blocking cccDNA synthesis in LIG1 or LIG3 knock-out cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g007">7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s008">S8</xref>). This phenomena may be due to a fact that the processed rcDNA ready for ligation is unstable. Previous studies have shown that the Hirt DNA samples from DHBV replicating cells contain high levels of nicked cccDNA which might be generated intracellularly or during the Hirt extraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref030">30</xref>]. We also found that the protein-free rcDNA in Hirt extraction from HepDG10 cells were largely nicked cccDNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s009">S9 Fig</xref>), indicating that the observed reduction of protein-free rcDNA in LIG1/3 knock-out cells might be a consequence of cccDNA reduction (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g007">7</xref>). Nonetheless, further characterization of the nuclear rcDNA in LIG1/3 knock-out cells will provide further information for understanding the biological processes of rcDNA termini prior to the final ligation step during cccDNA formation.</p>
<p>In parallel with the <italic>bona fide</italic> rcDNA-to-cccDNA formation during hepadnavirus infection, the viral dslDNA byproduct is also repaired into cccDNA with indel mutations at the joint region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref023">23</xref>]. Although the dslDNA-derived cccDNA is generally defective of initiating a new round of viral DNA replication, it remains functional to express HBsAg and thus may play a role in viral pathogenesis. Based on the linear format of dslDNA and the indel mutations of its cccDNA derivative, it is hypothesized that dslDNA is a substrate for host error-prone NHEJ DNA repair system, and we have previously reported that another NHEJ component Ku80 is required for DHBV cccDNA formation from the dslDNA but not rcDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref025">25</xref>]. LIG4 is the DNA ligase responsible for performing the last step of double strand DNA end joining in the NHEJ pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref024">24</xref>]. In this study, we have demonstrated that LIG4 plays an essential role in cccDNA formation from DHBV dslDNA, and no functional redundancy was observed between LIG4 and other ligases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006784.g008">Fig 8</xref>). In addition, it has been reported that the chromosome DNA double strand breaks are targets for DHBV DNA integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref042">42</xref>], which indicates that the NHEJ machinery, including LIG4, is also responsible for the integration of hepadnavirus dslDNA into host genome.</p>
<p>Altogether, our study revealed a critical role of cellular DNA ligases in hepadnavirus cccDNA biosynthesis. Another possible function of DNA ligases in hepadnavirus life cycle can be to maintain the integrity of cccDNA, provided the preexisting cccDNA undergoes DNA damage and the host cell is able to repair it. Based on our observations, the DNA ligase inhibitors, which are currently under development for anti-cancer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref043">43</xref>], may be developed into host-targeting antiviral means to treat chronic hepatitis B by blocking cccDNA formation and/or repair.</p>

<p>DHBV total RNA in cell cultures was extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen) and detected by Northern blot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref025">25</xref>]. HBV and DHBV cytoplasmic core DNA and whole cell Hirt DNA were extracted and analyzed by Southern blot as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref046">46</xref>]. HBV total DNA and cccDNA qPCR were performed according to the literature with modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref049">49</xref>]. Firstly, HBV total DNA in the total Hirt DNA sample, including protein-free rcDNA and cccDNA, was first quantified by qPCR with 0.8 μM of forward primer (5’-CCGTCTGTGCCTTCTCATCTG-3’ (nt 1551–1571)), 0.8 μM of reverse primer (5’-AGTCCAAGAGTYCTCTTATGYAAGACCTT-3’ (nt 1674–1646)), and 0.2 μM of TaqMan probe (5’-FAM- CCGTGTGCACTTCGCTTCACCTCTGC-TAMRA-3’ (nt 1577–1602)). In the meantime, the relative cellular mitochondrial DNA (COX3 gene) level in each Hirt DNA samples was quantified by SYBR green qPCR with forward primer 5’-CCCTCTCGGCCCTCCTAATAACCT-3’ and reverse primer 5’-GCCTTCTCGTATAACATCGCGTCA-3’. Next, to reduce the contamination of HBV rcDNA in the qPCR detection of cccDNA, the Hirt DNA sample was first heated at 85°C for 5 min to denature rcDNA into single-stranded DNA, followed by Plasmid-safe ATP-dependent DNase (PSAD) (Epicentre) treatment at 37°C for 16 h. The PSAD reaction was then stopped by heat inactivation at 70°C for 30 min, and the samples were further purified by DNA clean-up spin column (Zymo Research). Real-time PCR amplification of 2 μl cleaned cccDNA sample was performed in a 20 μl reaction containing 0.9 μM forward primer (5’-ATGGAGACCACCGTGAACGCCC-3’(nt 1610–1631)), 0.9 μM reverse primer (5’-TCCCGATACAGAGCTGAGGCGG-3’(nt 2021–2000)), and 0.2 μM TaqMan probe (5’-FAM-TTCAAGCCTCCAAGCTGTGCCTTGGGTGGC-TAMRA-3’; nt 1865–1894). The cccDNA qPCR primers were designed to target the HBV DNA sequences outside of the gap region in rcDNA and to avoid PCR amplification of the integrated HBV genome in HepDES19 cells. The FastStart Essential DNA Probes Master (Roche) and FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (Roche) were used to assemble TaqMan and SYBR Green qPCR reactions, respectively. The qPCR was run by Roche LightCycler 96 under the following thermal cycling conditions: 10 min at 95°C, followed by 15 sec at 95°C and 1 min at 61°C for 50 cycles. The cccDNA qPCR data was normalized by the cellular mitochondrial DNA quantitation.</p>
<p>The supercoiled cccDNA from DHBV transfected 293T cells were extracted by a previously developed alkaline lysis method with minor modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref022">22</xref>]. Briefly, cells in a 6-well-plate were lysed in 200 μl lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.4), 1 mM EDTA, and 0.2% NP40, at room temperature for 10 min. The lysate was mixed gently with 200 μl alkaline lysis buffer (0.1 M NaOH, 6% SDS) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min, followed by adding 100 μl 3 M KAc (pH5.0) and mixing gently. After incubating on ice for 10 min and centrifuging at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, supernatant was collected and extracted by phenol twice.

<p>The customized Mission lentiviral shRNA DNA repair gene family set was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The library contains 586 lentiviral shRNA targeting 140 DNA repair genes of all the known DNA repair pathways except for NHEJ, with an average of 3–5 different shRNA sequence against each target gene. The virus stocks were aliquoted in 96-well-plate with viral titer ranging from 1×10<sup>7</sup> to 3×10<sup>7</sup> g.e/ml.

<p>To establish stable DNA repair gene knock-down cell lines. HepDES19 cells were infected with the pooled lentiviral shRNA targeting the same DNA repair gene or control lentiviral shRNA in the presence of tet, 2 days later, the cells were selected by puromycin (3 μg/ml) for 1 week and the antibiotics-resistant cells were pooled and expanded into cell lines. The cells transduced by different lentiviral shRNA exhibited variable growth rate during puromycin selection but all were viable. A total of 107 DNA repair gene lenti-shRNA transduced cell lines were obtained. To assess the effect of RNAi on cccDNA production, the knock-down cells under confluent condition (1×10<sup>6</sup> cells per 35mm-dish) were cultured in the absence of tet for 10 days, total Hirt DNA was extracted and subjected to Southern blot or HBV total DNA and cccDNA qPCR. It is known that the HBV Hirt DNA level is positively related to HBV DNA replication level, especially the cytoplasmic rcDNA level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref019">19</xref>]. To assess the efficiency of cccDNA formation under gene knock-down, the relative cccDNA levels in DNA repair gene knock-down cells compared to control knock-down cells were normalized by total HBV Hirt DNA signals, which indicates a relative rcDNA-to-cccDNA conversion rate.</p>

<p>DHBV virion DNA which contain predominantly rcDNA and a minor portion of dslDNA were purified from serum derived virions and quantified by Southern blot using DHBV DNA marker as standard according to published literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref052">52</xref>].

The nuclear extract was prepared from HepG2 cells and stored in aliquots following a published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref053">53</xref>]. To assemble the DNA repair reaction, the purified DHBV virion DNA was mixed with 4 μl nuclear extract in 200 μl reaction buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, 80 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, and 50 μM dNTPs, and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. To stop the reaction, 10 μl of 1% SDS, 20 μl of 0.5 M EDTA and 10 μl of 10 mg/ml pronase were added and incubated at 37°C for an additional 30 min.

<title>Establishment of HepDG10 cell line</title>
<p>Plasmid pTRE-GFP-DHBV, which bidirectionally supports the tet-inducible expression of GFP and DHBV pgRNA, was constructed as follows. Firstly, a DNA fragment, which, in the 5’ to 3’ orientation, contained the partial sequence (nt 12–430) of pBI vector (Clontech, GenBank Accession No.: U89932) and the reverse complementary sequence of GFP ORF followed by SV40 polyadenylation signal, with unique PstI and KpnI restriction site at the 5’ and 3’ end, respectively, was chemically synthesized (Genescript). Then the PstI/KpnI restricted fragment was cloned into the same endonuclease treated pTREHBVDE plasmid to generate pTRE-GFP-HBV. Next, another DNA fragment containing nt 425–468 sequence from pBI, a spacer sequence (5’-GCAGAGCTCGTTTGATC-3’), and DHBV sequence (nt 2524-3021/1), with unique KpnI and EcoRI site at 5’ and 3’ end, respectively, was chemically synthesized (Genescript), and the fragment was inserted into the KpnI/EcoRI sites of pTRE-GFP-HBV to generate pTRE-GFP-DHBV-EcoRI-HBV. The HindIII site in the backbone sequence downstream of the remaining HBV sequence in pTRE-GFP-DHBV-EcoRI-HBV was further mutated to SalI site by using QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies) to obtain pTRE-GFP-DHBV-EcoRI-HBV-SalI. One unit length of DHBV genome was amplified from DHBV-1S by PCR with forward primer (5’- CGGCTA<underline>GAATTC</underline>ATGCTCATTTGAAAGCTT-3’, nt 3011-3021/1-19, DHBV EcoRI site is underlined) and reverse primer (5’-AATTAA<underline>GTCGAC</underline>AATTCTAGCCGTAATCGGATA-3’, nt 3021–3001, non-DHBV SalI site is underlined) and digested by EcoRI and SalI and cloned into the same sites in pTRE-GFP-DHBV-EcoRI-HBV-SalI to generate the final product pTRE-GFP-DHBV.</p>
<p>To establish tetracycline-inducible DHBV stable cell lines, HepG2 cells were cotransfected by pTRE-GFP-DHBV and pTet-off which expresses tet-responsive transcriptional activator (tTA) (Clontech) with 7:1 molar ratio. The transfected HepG2 cells were selected with 500 μg/ml G418 in the presence of 1 μg/ml tet. G418-resistant colonies were picked and expanded into cell lines. To determine DHBV positive cell lines, the candidate clones were cultured in 96-well-plate with tet-free medium for 6 days and subjected to fluorescence microscopy to select GFP-positive clones. Then, the GFP-positive cells were lysed in 1% NP40 and the cytoplasmic lysate was subjected to dot blotting as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref047">47</xref>]. The dot blot was hybridized by α-<sup>32</sup>P-UTP (800 Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer) labeled minus strand specific full-length DHBV riboprobe, and the obtained DHBV positive cell lines were further assessed for their tet-inducible DHBV core DNA replication and cccDNA production by Southern blot. A DHBV cccDNA highly producing cell line clone was named HepDG10. The maintenance and induction of HepDG10 cells were performed in the same way as HepDES19 cells.</p>

The shRNA coding sequences for knocking down LIG1 and LIG3 are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s013">S1 Table</xref>. HepDG10 and HepG2-NTCP12 cells were transduced by above lentiviral LIG1 or LIG3 shRNA or control shRNA per manufacturer’s instruction. The transduced cells were selected with 3 μg/ml puromycin and the antibiotics-resistant cells were pooled and expanded into cell lines. The knock-down levels of LIG1 and LIG3 in knock-down cell lines were assessed by Western blot by using antibodies against LIG1 (sc-271678, clone C5, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and LIG3 (sc-390922, clone E7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), respectively, and compared to control knock-down cells. β-actin served as loading control for Western blot by using anti-actin antibody (MAB1501, clone C4, Millipore).</p>
<p>To construct a lenti-vector expressing both LIG1 and LIG3 shRNA, a chemically synthesized DNA fragment containing the H1 promoter sequence and downstream LIG3 shRNA sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s013">S1 Table</xref>) was cloned into the unique EcoRI site of lenti-shRNA plasmid DNA pLKO.1-LIG1 (TRCN0000048494, Sigma), giving rise to the bicistronic lenti-shRNA plasmids with two orientations of the H1-shLIG3 cassette right downstream of the original U6-shLIG1 cassette. The head-to-tail and tail-to-tail dimer clones were named pLKO.1-LIG1/3C1 and pLKO.1-LIG1/3C2, respectively, and pLKO.1-LIG1/3C2 was used to prepare lentiviral shRNA particles with MISSION Lentiviral Packaging Mix (Sigma). HepDG10 cells were transduced with lentiviral shLIG1/3 and the puromycin-resistant cells were pooled and expanded into stable cell line, namely HepDG10-shLIG1/3. The double knock-down of LIG1 and LIG3 were determined by Western blot comparing to the aforementioned control knock-down cells.</p>

<title>Establishment of LIG1- and LIG3-knock-out cell lines</title>
<p>LIG1 and LIG3 knock-out cell lines were generated through CRISPR-mediated genome editing of LIG1 and LIG3 gene loci. The single guide (sg) RNAs targeting two different sites of human LIG1 and LIG3 gene were designed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.e-crisp.org/E-CRISP" xlink:type="simple">http://www.e-crisp.org/E-CRISP</ext-link> and shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s005">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s006">S6</xref> Figs. In addition to the general criteria for sgRNA design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref054">54</xref>], the sgRNAs were designed to target either the 5’ end of the ORF or the functional domain coding sequences of LIG1 or LIG3. Furthermore, the designed sgRNA sequences do not possess any possible CRISPR sites in DHBV or HBV sequences. The synthetic sgRNA oligo pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s014">S2 Table</xref>) were annealed and cloned into BbsI-digested lentiCRISPRv2 control vector (Addgene # 52961, gift from Dr. Feng Zhang). Lentivirus preparations were performed according to the protocols from Dr. Feng Zhang’s Lab (genome-engineering.org). Briefly, each lentivector was co-transfected with packaging plasmids psPAX2 and pMD2.G (Addgene# 12260 and 12259, respectively, gift from Dr. Didier Trono) in molar ratio of 4:3:1 into 293T cells by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogene), and 48 h later, media was collected, centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, filtered through a 0.45um filter, and virus titers were determined by lentiviral titration kit. Lentiviral transduction of HepDG10 or HepDES19 and antibiotics-selection were performed as above described to generate control and LIG1/LIG3 stable knock-out cell lines, specifically HepDG10 LIG1 K.O., HepDG10 LIG3 K.O., HepDES19 LIG1 K.O., and HepDES19 LIG3 K.O. cells. The LIG1 or LIG3 knock-out phenotype was confirmed by Western blot and indel sequencing assay. The corresponding coding sequences for epitopes of LIG1 and LIG3 antibodies have no overlap with the gene targeting sites of the designed sgRNAs.</p>
<p>To knock out both LIG1 and LIG 3 in HepDG10 cells, the cells were transduced with lentiviruses encoding CRISPR/Cas9-LIG1-sgRNA1 and CRISPR/Cas9-LIG3-sgRNA1 together (1:1 ratio). The puromycin selection and clone screening was performed as described above. The indel mutations of sgRNA targeting sites in LIG1 and LIG3 gene loci was detected by T7E1 assay.</p>

<title>Generation of LIG4 knock-out cell line</title>

Therefore a newly developed microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) repair based CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006784.ref032">32</xref>] was used to establish LIG4 knock-out cells. Briefly, annealed sgRNA targeting the last exon of LIG4 gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s012">S12 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s016">S4 Table</xref>) was inserted into pX330A-1×2 (Addgene# 58766, gift from Dr. Takashi Yamamoto) to obtain pX330A-1×2-LIG4-gRNA, and after Golden Gate assembly using BsaI (New England Biolabs), the cassette of PITCh-gRNA from pX330S-2-PITCh (Addgene# 63670, gift from Dr. Takashi Yamamoto) was inserted into pX330A-1×2-LIG4-gRNA to generate the All-in-One pCRISPR/Cas9-PITCh-LIG4-gRNA vector containing both LIG4 gRNA and PITCh-gRNA. Then, pCRIS-PITChv2-LIG4 was constructed based on pCRIS-PITChv2-FBL (Addgene# 63672, gift from Dr. Takashi Yamamoto) by performing two separate PCR, one to amplify the vector backbone and one to amplify LIG4-specific microhomology arm containing EGFP-2A-Puro knock-in cassette. Generic 5′-reverse and 3′-forward primers were used for vector backbone amplification, and LIG4-specifc primers containing the desired microhomologies were used to amplify the insertion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006784.s016">S4 Table</xref>). The above two purified PCR fragments were conjugated by using the In-Fusion HD cloning kit (Clontech) to generate plasmid pCRIS-PITChv2-LIG4. To generate LIG4 knock-out cell line, 293T cells were transfected with pCRIS-PITChv2-LIG4 and the All-in-One plasmid pCRISPR/Cas9-PITCh-LIG4-gRNA with a molar ratio of 1:2, followed by puromycin (1 μg/ml) selection. The puromycin-resistant colonies were pooled together and subjected to fluorescence microscopy for determining EGFP-positive cells with successful knock-in, and then the knock-out efficiency of LIG4 was determined by Western blot using antibodies against LIG4 (sc-28232, clone H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Control knock-in 293T cells were made by transfecting pCRIS-PITChv2-FBL and pX330A-FBL/PITCh (Addgene# 63671, gift from Dr. Takashi Yamamoto) that target human fibrillarin (FBL) gene.</p>

To avoid the integrated lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9-LIG3 sgRNA system targets LIG3 ectopic expression plasmid, the LIG3 sgRNA1 corresponding PAM motif “CGG” in pcLIG3 was mutated to “CGA” by Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs) with primers (forward: 5’-AACTAGAGCGaGCCCGGGCCA-3’, reverse: 5’- TCTCAAACATGCATTTAATGTGGTACCAC-3’) but without changing the amino acid sequence of LIG3. The sgRNA-resistant pcLIG3 was used to transfect HepDG10-LIG3 K.O. cells in the function rescue experiment. Because the LIG4 knock-out 293T cells were made by transient transfection-mediated knock-out, pcLIG4-FLAG was used directly in rescue experiment by transfection.</p>
