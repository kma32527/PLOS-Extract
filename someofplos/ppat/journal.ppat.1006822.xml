<abstract>
<p>Emergency hematopoiesis facilitates the rapid expansion of inflammatory immune cells in response to infections by pathogens, a process that must be carefully regulated to prevent potentially life threatening inflammatory responses. Here, we describe a novel regulatory role for the cytokine IFNγ that is critical for preventing fatal encephalitis after viral infection. HSV1 encephalitis (HSE) is triggered by the invasion of the brainstem by inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils. In mice lacking IFNγ (GKO), we observed unrestrained increases in G-CSF levels but not in GM-CSF or IL-17. This resulted in uncontrolled expansion and infiltration of apoptosis-resistant, degranulating neutrophils into the brainstem, causing fatal HSE in GKO but not WT mice. Excessive G-CSF in GKO mice also induced granulocyte derived suppressor cells, which inhibited T-cell proliferation and function, including production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Unexpectedly, we found that IFNγ suppressed G-CSF signaling by increasing SOCS3 expression in neutrophils, resulting in apoptosis. Depletion of G-CSF, but not GM-CSF, in GKO mice induced neutrophil apoptosis and reinstated IL-10 secretion by T cells, which restored their ability to limit innate inflammatory responses resulting in protection from HSE. Our studies reveals a novel, complex interplay among IFNγ, G-CSF and IL-10, which highlights the opposing roles of G-CSF and IFNγ in regulation of innate inflammatory responses in a murine viral encephalitis model and reveals G-CSF as a potential therapeutic target. Thus, the antagonistic G-CSF-IFNγ interactions emerge as a key regulatory node in control of CNS inflammatory responses to virus infection.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Successful resolution of infections requires a balanced immune response that recognizes and destroys invading pathogens, without provoking excessive damage to the host. Interferon gamma (IFNγ) is an important pleiotropic cytokine, which regulates host immunity at key stages of the immune response. However, much less is known about its regulatory activities during inflammation, especially in viral infections. Here, we show a novel role for IFNγ in regulating innate immune responses during a viral infection. HSV1 induced encephalitis is triggered by inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils invading the brainstem. In the absence of IFNγ, G-CSF and IL-6 levels but not IL-17 and GM-CSF, were highly elevated. This resulted in uncontrolled expansion and infiltration of pathogenic neutrophils into the CNS causing fatal encephalitis in IFNγ deficient (GKO) but not wildtype mice. Depletion of G-CSF in GKO mice abolished neutrophil expansion, reinstated IL-10 secretion by T cells, resulting in protection from encephalitis. Our study reveals a novel G-CSF regulated pathway, independent of GM-CSF and IL-17, that controls neutrophil responses to viral infection. Importantly, IFNγ emerges as a key regulator of the inflammatory response to virus infection and this functionality is distinct from its direct anti-microbial activities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Early detection and eradication of invading pathogens by the immune response, without excessive bystander damage to the inflamed organ, is the most desirable outcome for the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref001">1</xref>]. Efficient pathogen control requires activation of innate immune cells, including BM derived neutrophils and monocytes, and their recruitment to the infected tissue to initiate pathogen clearance and shape the ensuing immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref004">4</xref>]. Although the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the target organ is directed by the establishment of a chemokine gradient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref005">5</xref>], the generation of inflammatory cells is facilitated by a hematopoietic response program, termed emergency hematopoiesis, which is characterized by greatly increased de novo neutrophil and monocyte production from BM progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref009">9</xref>]. Under steady state conditions, hematopoiesis is a tightly regulated process; but, to satisfy the enormous demand for leukocytes after infection, a complete overhaul of the program occurs. This overhaul results in emergency hematopoiesis and the subsequent production of substantial numbers of the desired cell type(s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref009">9</xref>]. However, under some conditions, impaired regulation of emergency hematopoiesis results in unrestrained inflammation and toxicity to the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref014">14</xref>]. Several intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence emergency hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref021">21</xref>]. In the last decade, various reports have elucidated the key role played by cytokines in the regulation of both steady state and emergency hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Cytokines are master regulators of the immune response, and they are produced during immunological stress, such as infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref022">22</xref>]. The evolution of an immune response can be predicated by the amount and location of cytokine production, cytokine access to other cells, and the stage of infection during which the cytokine is produced. Several cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-α, GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-1α, and the IFNs, control leukocyte production and emigration during steady state and emergency hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref024">24</xref>]. G-CSF and GM-CSF influence myeloid homeostasis and GM-CSF is thought to be a key mediator of Th17-driven neutrophil-mediated inflammatory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref028">28</xref>]. Some cytokines, such as IFN, play prominent dual roles in both development and homeostasis of the immune system and immunity to pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref031">31</xref>]. Type I IFN subtypes (α/β) are considered indispensable for antiviral protection while IFNγ, a type II IFN, is essential for bacterial eradication and also for controlling replication of some viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref034">34</xref>]. Because we found increased IFNγ, rather than IFNα/β, following HSV infection in mice, we investigated the role of IFNγ in HSV-induced inflammation of the CNS.</p>
<p>IFNγ has long been considered a prototypical pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokine that drives cell-mediated immunity. However, its role in inflammation remains controversial, even though evidence for its immuno-regulatory role has gradually accumulated over the last decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref037">37</xref>]. Several organ-specific autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases have been associated with dysregulated Th1 responses, but unexpectedly, these diseases progress at accelerated rates in mice deficient in IFNγ or its receptor due to increased Th17 responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref040">40</xref>]. These observations have challenged the dogmatic pro-inflammatory role of IFNγ, as well as the Th1-Th2-Th17 paradigm, as a rationale for explaining autoimmune disorders. We reported that mortality from viral encephalitis is primarily linked to exaggerated innate inflammatory monocyte and neutrophil responses, rather than viral replication induced tissue damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref042">42</xref>]. In the current report, we establish a novel role for IFNγ in the development and resolution of protective CNS innate immune responses, after infection with HSV, a neurotropic 〈-herpesvirus. In the absence of IFNγ, production of G-CSF, but not GM-CSF or IL-17, was greatly increased resulting in the generation of apoptosis-resistant, spontaneously degranulating neutrophils. These neutrophils invaded the CNS in large numbers, causing fatal HSV-induced encephalitis (HSE). This increase in G-CSF and neutrophils suppressed T-cell functionality and importantly, ablation of G-CSF abolished neutrophilia, restored T cell functionality and protected mice from fatal HSE. Thus, our study reveals a novel regulatory role for IFNγ in the control of G-CSF induced neutrophilia and further illuminates its role in protection from viral encephalitis.</p>

<title>IFNγ and IL-10 are the predominant cytokines secreted following HSV infection</title>
<p>We showed previously that IL-10-deficient and T- and B cell-deficient Rag<sup>-/-</sup> mice succumb to fatal HSE resulting from excessive infiltration by inflammatory Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes (IMs) into the brainstem (BS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref043">43</xref>]. To determine the mechanism(s) by which inflammation, specifically IM infiltration, is suppressed by T cells in WT mice, we measured cytokine production by T cells isolated from WT mice at days 6 and 14 post-infection (pi). We determined the T-cell cytokine levels by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) using flow cytometry, and serum cytokine levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). IL-10 and IFNγ were the major cytokines produced by T cells in the BS, draining cervical lymph nodes (CLN) and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g001">Fig 1A–1D</xref>). At day 6 pi in the BS, we observed 20–40% IL-10<sup>+</sup> and IFNγ<sup>+</sup> T cells, which almost doubled by day 14 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Notably, most (&gt; 80%) of the cytokine-secreting CD4 and CD8 T cells in the BS were IFNγ<sup>+</sup> at day 14 pi. Although not as impressive as in the BS, IFNγ<sup>+</sup> and IL-10<sup>+</sup> T cells comprised the predominant cytokine-producing subsets detected in the CLN and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). The cytokines and chemokines that were analyzed in the sera and BS of infected WT mice at day 6 pi are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s002">S2</xref> Figs respectively and these were either undetectable or altered relative to day 0 levels. Not surprisingly, the IFNγ-driven chemokines, such as IP-10 (CXCL10) and MIG (CXCL9), dominated the chemokine profile, concordant with our prior observation that T cells are the predominant cell population in the BS infiltrate of WT mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref042">42</xref>]. Since, the major cytokines detected in serum are IL-27, IL-13, IFNγ, IL-10 and IL-18 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), we conclude that the infected WT mice express a balanced Th1/Th2 signature. Previously, we found an anti-inflammatory role for IL-10, which suppressed the generation of IM, thereby preventing HSE in WT but not IL-10 knockout (IL-10KO) mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref042">42</xref>]. We now show that IFNγ, a classical pro-inflammatory cytokine, is present at substantially greater levels than the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in HSV-infected WT mice.</p>

<p>To investigate the role of IFNγ in HSE, we infected WT, IFNγ KO (GKO), IL-10KO, and Rag<sup>-/-</sup> mice and monitored their survival.

<p>To determine if GKO mice succumbed due to uncontrolled virus replication, we measured the levels of infectious virus in the trigeminal ganglion (Tg) and BS tissues from GKO mice.

<title>Unrestrained CNS inflammation in the absence of IFNγ</title>
<p>Excessive CNS infiltration by the pathogenic CD11b<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>high</sup> IM subset, which is characteristic of fatal HSE, is limited by the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref042">42</xref>]. Because IFNγ plays an important role in myeloid responses, we investigated whether GKO mice succumbed to HSE due to inefficient control of BS inflammation, specifically IM infiltration. As early as day 4 pi, CD45<sup>high</sup> infiltrates composed 65% of the mononuclear cell population within the BS of GKO mice and remained the dominant population in the BS of GKO mice at day 6 pi, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g003">Fig 3A and 3C</xref>). Notably these cells were also present at high levels in the brain and spinal cord of GKO but not WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Relative CD45<sup>high</sup> infiltrate levels in the BS were ranked in the order: GKO &gt; IL-10KO &gt; Rag<sup>-/-</sup> &gt;&gt;&gt; WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), which implies surprisingly that suppression of CNS infiltration requires T cells secreting both IFNγ and IL-10. We next determined if, similar to IL-10KO mice, IMs were the major CD45<sup>high</sup> infiltrating subset in the BS of the GKO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref042">42</xref>]. As anticipated, most of the monocytes / macrophages (CD45<sup>high</sup> SSC<sup>low</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD115<sup>+</sup> Ly6G<sup>-</sup> F480<sup>+/lo</sup>) in the BS of GKO, IL-10KO and Rag<sup>-/-</sup> mice, but not WT mice, expressed high levels of Ly6C, characteristic of the IM subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g003">Fig 3A, 3D and 3E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref042">42</xref>]. However, infiltration of monocytes / macrophages into the GKO BS was significantly reduced compared to WT, IL-10KO and Rag<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Interestingly, although macrophages only accounted for a minor fraction (25%) of the total CD45<sup>high</sup> infiltrate in the GKO BS, conversion to numbers revealed a three fold increase in macrophage numbers in the BS of GKO mice compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). These data suggest that an alternate CD45<sup>high</sup> cell subset, possibly neutrophils, dominates BS infiltrates in GKO mice. In prior studies, we could not determine the specific role of neutrophils in HSE due to cross reactivity of the neutrophil specific antibodies available at that time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref041">41</xref>].</p>

<title>IFNγ controls neutrophil expansion and invasion of the BS</title>
<p>We next determined whether neutrophils (PMN) dominated the BS infiltrates in GKO mice. Neutrophils (CD45<sup>high</sup> SSC<sup>high</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> Ly6G<sup>+</sup> CD115<sup>-</sup>) comprised ~60–75% of the CD45<sup>high</sup> infiltrates in the BS of GKO mice at days 4–12 pi, but were reduced in the BS of WT mice at days 4–6 pi (~30%) and diminished after day 6 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g003">Fig 3A and 3F</xref>). Amazingly by day 8 pi when PMNs were on the decline in the BS of WT mice, PMN numbers were increased 30 fold in the GKO BS compared to the WT BS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Furthermore, neutrophils isolated from either the BM or blood of GKO mice were increased compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g003">Fig 3B, 3G and 3H</xref>). Thus, in the absence of IFNγ, neutrophils were the predominant BM-derived population in the BS of GKO mice. Importantly, the ratio of PMNs to IMs in the blood of GKO mice was much higher than in WT mice, and increased from day 2 to 6 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g003">Fig 3B and 3I</xref>). Because IL-10 is important for inhibiting neutrophil responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref046">46</xref>], we analyzed the ratio of neutrophils to IMs in the blood of IL-10KO and Rag<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The ratio was reversed for IL-10KO but not Rag<sup>-/-</sup> mice at days 4 and 6 pi, implying that control of IM, but not neutrophil expansion, requires IL-10 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). Furthermore, IL-10KO T cells secreted substantial amounts of IFNγ, similar to WT T cells further emphasizing IFNγ’s role in neutrophil contraction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s003">S3D Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). These data suggest that during viral infection, IFNγ rather than IL-10 is the major regulator of neutrophil output, especially at later time points after infection.</p>

<title>Regulatory CD4 T cells do not prevent HSE in the absence of IFNγ</title>
<p>Since FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and ICOS<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells have been shown to moderate inflammation, we examined GKO and WT mice for regulatory CD4 T cells during HSE. IL-10-secreting FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and ICOS<sup>+</sup> FoxP3<sup>-</sup> CD4 Tr1 cells, previously shown to protect against HSV challenge, were expanded in the CLNs and spleens of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref042">42</xref>]. We have shown previously that Tregs were induced in peripheral lymphoid organs of WT mice but were not detected in the BS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref042">42</xref>]. To determine if these cells were induced in GKO mice, we analyzed CLN, spleen, and BS for FoxP3 and ICOS expression on CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s004">S4A and S4E Fig</xref>). Unexpectedly, Tregs were reduced in the spleens of GKO mice compared to WT mice and absent in the BS of GKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g004">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s004">S4E Fig</xref>). Also, adoptive transfer of FoxP3<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> CD4 Tregs or ICOS<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells from infected WT, but not GKO or naïve WT mice protected naïve WT recipients from HSE, which suggests the GKO Tregs were unable to suppress inflammatory innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g004">Fig 4D</xref>); we have shown previously that IL-10 secreting Tregs prevented HSE by suppressing innate inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref042">42</xref>]. Intriguingly, the IL-10<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells that expanded in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g001">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref042">42</xref>] were not detected in the BS, CLN or spleen of GKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>: top row, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s004">S4B–S4D Fig</xref>), consistent with their inability to protect from HSE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g004">Fig 4D</xref>).

<p>We next asked whether suppression of effector T-cell function during acute infection of GKO mice results from induction of myeloid- or granulocyte-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs / GDSCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref047">47</xref>]. Spleen cells isolated at day 6 pi from GKO mice (containing high numbers of neutrophils) or WT mice (containing few neutrophils) were labeled with CFSE, then incubated with heat-killed HSV (HK-HSV) and analyzed at various time points for dilution of CFSE. Although neither WT nor GKO T cells proliferated after 4 h of culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s005">S5A Fig</xref>), by 24 h WT CD4 and virus-specific CD8 T cells proliferated more rapidly than their GKO counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g005">Fig 5A–5C</xref>). However, after 48 h of culture, proliferation rates were similar for both WT and GKO T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g005">Fig 5A–5C</xref>), suggesting that the suppressive activity of GKO neutrophils declines over time, likely due to their rapid death in culture. Furthermore, in vitro WT effector CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation was suppressed in the presence of GKO CD11b<sup>+</sup> Ly6G<sup>+</sup> PMN but not CD11b<sup>+</sup> Ly6G<sup>-</sup> monocytes or CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs (M / DCs) that were isolated at day 6 pi from blood of HSV infected GKO mice, confirming that suppression was mediated by GKO GDSCs and not other suppressor cells including Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). To determine if similar suppressive effects were observed for memory T cells, CD11b<sup>+</sup> Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils or M / DCs isolated from the blood of infected GKO mice at day 6 pi were incubated with CFSE-labeled spleen cells isolated from HSV immunized WT mice at day 21 pi and memory T-cell proliferation was analyzed in vitro. Indeed, WT memory CD4, CD8 and virus specific gB<sub>498-505</sub> tetramer<sup>+</sup> (Tet<sup>+</sup>) CD8 T cells reactive to virus antigens (HK-HSV) proliferated at reduced rates (~10%) when cultured with GKO neutrophils, compared to m / DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Although, WT memory CD4 and CD8 T cells proliferation was reduced in the presence of GKO PMNs compared to WT PMNs presenting HK-HSV antigen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s005">S5B and S5C Fig</xref>), virus-specific WT and GKO CD8 T cells cultured with the immunodominant H-2K<sup>b</sup> HSV gB<sub>498-505</sub> peptide proliferated at similar rates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s005">S5D Fig</xref>), suggesting that the suppressive effects of GKO GDSCs depends on the cytosolic proteolysis of viral antigens but can be overcome with an optimal concentration of immunodominant peptide. To determine if suppression by GDSC can also be overcome by stimulation with αCD3 and αCD28, CFSE-labeled splenocytes containing memory CD4 or CD8 T cells isolated from HSV-infected WT or GKO mice at day 25 pi were incubated with soluble αCD3 and αCD28 in the presence of Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils isolated from blood of infected GKO mice at day 6 pi. Similar rates of proliferation were observed for both WT and GKO memory T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s005">S5E and S5F Fig</xref>). Additionally, very few exhausted CD4 and CD8 T cells were observed in the two groups, as &lt;5% of cells expressed high levels of PD-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s005">S5B–S5D Fig</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that the suppressive effects of GDSCs are specific to virus antigens that require cytolytic processing but could be overcome by stimulation with αCD3 and αCD28 or immunodominant viral peptides.</p>

<p>Several reports have shown that IFNγ regulates the generation of IL-23-driven pathogenic Th17 cells producing IL-17 and GM-CSF.

The major cytokines upregulated in the sera and BS of infected GKO mice were IL-6 and G-CSF, along with the CXC chemokines CXCL1 (KC) and CXCL2 (MIP-2), which elicit neutrophil production and egress from BM <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g006">Fig 6A–6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s006">S6</xref> Figs).

Astonishingly, G-CSF was increased ~3–4 fold in the sera of GKO mice compared to WT mouse sera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Notably, although G-CSF levels declined in WT mice after day 6 pi (day 8 pi: &lt; 1500 pg/ml), G-CSF levels remained extremely high in the sera of GKO mice (day 6 pi: ~15,000 pg/ml, and day 8 pi: ~10,000 pg/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Also, because the serum levels of G-CSF in GKO mice (735 pg/ml) were ~2-fold greater than in WT mice as early as day 2 pi (304 pg/ml) we speculate that control of G-CSF production was impaired at, or soon after, day 2 pi in GKO compared to WT mice.</p>

<title>Depletion of G-CSF protects infected GKO mice from HSE</title>
<p>Depletion of Gr-1-expressing Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils and Ly6C<sup>high</sup> IMs in GKO mice, using an αGr1 mAb, did not protect the mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Also surprisingly, depletion of macrophages with chlodronate liposomes enhanced mortality in GKO mice, compared to PBS liposome-treated mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). This result argues against macrophages or IM being causally involved in induction of HSE in GKO mice. Because neutrophils expanded more than other cell subsets in HSV-infected GKO mice, we depleted the neutrophils using a αLy6G-specific mAb. Remarkably, ~50% of the GKO mice survived HSV infection after Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophil depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), but the majority of mice died following cessation of mAb treatment. Because G-CSF was dramatically increased (~3–4 fold) in the sera of GKO mice, and G-CSFR is expressed predominantly by neutrophils and their progenitors in the BM, we depleted G-CSF using 3 doses of αG-CSF mAb to determine if reducing G-CSF levels could prevent neutrophilia and thus fatal encephalitis. As expected, G-CSF depletion protected the GKO mice from HSE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) with only one mouse succumbing on day 15 pi. Importantly, after G-CSF depletion, levels of circulating neutrophils in GKO mice were significantly reduced compared to untreated GKO mice, at days 4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s008">S8A and S8B Fig</xref>) and 6 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). CNS infiltration by CD45<sup>high</sup> cells, Ly6C<sup>high</sup> IMs, and Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils was reduced in the G-CSF-depleted GKO mice, rendering them similar to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s008">S8C and S8D Fig</xref>). Similarly, G-CSF depletion drastically reduced the levels of degranulating neutrophils in the BS of GKO mice compared to the vastly increased numbers (~30X) in non-depleted GKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). These data show that αG-CSF mAb treatment normalized the neutrophil and monocyte levels to that observed in WT mice, thus confirming that excessive levels of G-CSF drive neutrophillia in GKO mice. These data highlight the importance of G-CSF and IFNγ in balancing the neutrophil and monocyte output from the BM following infection with a viral pathogen.</p>

<title>IL-10-mediated protection against HSE is restored by G-CSF inhibition</title>
<p>Several cell types, including hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, secrete G-CSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref011">11</xref>]. We found that CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells, including macrophages and neutrophils in the blood and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g007">Fig 7F</xref>: left plot), secrete G-CSF in response to HSV infection.

G-CSF secretion was greatly diminished by treatment of infected GKO mice with αG-CSF mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g007">Fig 7F and 7G</xref>). Importantly, neutralizing G-CSF in GKO mice reinstated IL-10 secretion by ICOS<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells in the blood and BS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g007">Fig 7F</xref>: right plot <bold>and G</bold>: bottom row) and reduced IM and neutrophil output from BM and infiltration into the BS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g007">Fig 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s008">S8A and S8B Fig</xref>). This result further validates the suppressive effects exerted by G-CSF induced GDSCs on T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g007">7G</xref>). G-CSF is known to activate STAT3, thereby promoting neutrophil turnover and activation; however, SOCS3 mediated inhibition of STAT3 signaling curtails neutrophil expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref018">18</xref>]. We observed that pSTAT3 expression was upregulated in neutrophils isolated from the blood of GKO mice at day 6 pi, compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s009">S9A, S9B and S9C Fig</xref>). In contrast, SOCS3 expression was increased in neutrophils isolated from the blood and BM of WT mice, compared to GKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Futhermore, ex vivo treatment of neutrophils isolated at day 6 pi from blood of WT, GKO or G-CSF-depleted GKO mice with recombinant IFNγ, prior to treatment with recombinant G-CSF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s009">S9B and S9C Fig</xref>), reduced pSTAT3 expression.

<p>Since G-CSF is a survival factor for neutrophils, we asked whether GKO mice that have elevated G-CSF levels, exhibit reduced apoptosis of neutrophils. We found that indeed, the elevated G-CSF levels also increased the survival of circulating neutrophils as revealed by reduced Annexin V<sup>+</sup> neutrophils in blood and BS of GKO, compared to αG-CSF treated GKO mice or WT mice, resulting in neutrophilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g008">Fig 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s008">S8D Fig</xref>). These data are consistent with a previously described role for SOCS3 in suppression of G-CSF signaling and neutrophil apoptosis during emergency hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref018">18</xref>]. Reduced neutrophil apoptosis and chronic inflammation have also been linked to increased IL-17 secretion. Although, we did not find CD4 T cells secreting IL-17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>), ~50% of the γδ T cells in the CLN and 30% in the spleen of GKO mice were IL-17<sup>+</sup> at day 14 pi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g008">Fig 8C and 8D</xref>) compared to 15% and 7% at day 6 pi in CLN and spleen respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006822.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). These data reveal a complex interaction network involving several pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines that regulate CNS inflammation during viral infection. Our data support a model wherein a normal response to HSV infection depends on IFNγ-induced suppression of G-CSF and IL-6 levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). This suppression of G-CSF allows for neutrophil apoptosis and the secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10 from CD4 T cells, which controls IM expansion. In the absence of IFNγ, excessive neutrophil production and diminished IL-10 secretion predominate, leading to fatal HSE. This work demonstrates a mechanism by which IFNγ, a prototypical pro-inflammatory cytokine, can exert anti-inflammatory effects on innate inflammatory responses during viral infection of the CNS.</p>

<sec id="sec011" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Dysregulated CNS inflammation is a hallmark of viral encephalitis. Our previous studies have shown an anti-inflammatory role for IL-10, which, by suppressing the generation of IMs, prevents HSE in WT mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref042">42</xref>]. The present study uncovered a novel and complex interplay among IFNγ, G-CSF and IL-10, which determines the induction of neutrophila and HSE as shown schematically in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006822.s010">S10 Fig</xref>. IFNγ was present at substantially greater levels than IL-10 in HSV-infected WT mice and played a unique role in the development and resolution of protective innate inflammatory responses in the CNS. Contrary to prior studies of neuroinflammatory diseases, we found that G-CSF and CXCL1, but not GM-CSF or IL-17, increased drammatically in HSV-infected GKO mice, resulting in invasion of the CNS by massive numbers of apoptosis-resistant, inflammatory neutrophils. Remarkably, we found that IFNγ controls G-CSF signaling by increasing SOCS3 expression in neutrophils and thereby induces apoptosis. Our study reveals that during viral encephalitis, it is G-CSF rather than GM-CSF that is the critical regulator of emergency hematopoiesis. The elevated levels of G-CSF induced production of GDSCs, which suppressed T-cell proliferation and function, including IL-10 secretion by regulatory T cells. Importantly, G-CSF depletion eliminated neutrophilia and restored protective IL-10 secreting regulatory T cells, thus preventing fatal HSE. GM-CSF has recently been ordained as a central mediator of tissue inflammation during emergency hematopoiesis and as a crucial conduit between tissue invading lymphocytes and myeloid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref050">50</xref>]. However, our study reveals a novel anti-inflammatory role for IFNγ, where G-CSF but not GM-CSF suppression results in control of expansion and survival of potentially pathogenic neutrophils. Thus, the antagonistic G-CSF-IFNγ interactions emerge as a key regulatory node in control of the innate inflammatory response to virus infection of the CNS.</p>
<p>Neutrophils are the most abundant immune cell subset and are produced daily in prodigious amounts. Earlier studies established that neutrophils play indispensable roles in various aspects of host immunity, including defense against pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref051">51</xref>]. Recent awareness that excessive numbers of neutrophils in tissues are associated with inflammatory diseases, has led to the re-evaluation of neutrophils as the primary drivers of inflammation associated pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref052">52</xref>]. Consequently, neutrophil numbers and activity require precise regulation to avert the inflammatory pathology linked to various inflammatory diseases, including infections, autoimmunity and chronic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref055">55</xref>]. This regulation is imposed mainly by the G-CSFR / STAT3 / SOCS3 axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref056">56</xref>]. G-CSF is a key regulator of production, activation, and survival of neutrophils both during steady state and specifically during emergency hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref056">56</xref>] and its levels are tightly controlled to avoid emergence of pathogenic neutrophils as a result of chronic G-CSF signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref011">11</xref>]. We found that in contrast to WT mice, GKO mice were unable to suppress G-CSF levels after HSV infection, causing neutrophilia and death, demonstrating for the first time that IFNγ controls G-CSF levels and importantly neutrophil expansion and survival in vivo. In addition, several studies have documented the importance of GM-CSF and the Th17-related cytokines IL-23 and IL-17 for induction of inflammatory and autoimmune disease when IFNγ is lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref030">30</xref>]. In contrast, our data reveals that G-CSF, rather than GM-CSF, IL-23 or IL-17 is the primary cytokine that provokes neutrophilia and fatal HSE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref052">52</xref>]. These results highlight the importance of IFNγ interaction with G-CSF signaling for regulation of neutrophil responses. We have identified a novel regulatory role for IFNγ as a suppressor of neutrophil proliferation during viral infection. Although IFNγ’s role in contraction of T-cell responses after the resolution of infections is well defined, its role in neutrophil contraction has been less clear. This work highlights the complexity of antiviral inflammatory responses, which depends on the virulence of the infectious agent and the extent of emergency hematopoiesis.</p>
<p>The resolution of an inflammatory response is initiated by apoptosis of neutrophils, which are then programed for phagocytosis by macrophages that release anti-inflammatory mediators to resolve inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref002">2</xref>]. However, during severe acute infections, apoptotic neutrophils can stimulate IL-17 secretion by either γδ or CD4 T cells, resulting in chronic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref057">57</xref>]. Alternatively, reduced apoptosis of neutrophils, can sustain chronic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref055">55</xref>]. Our results show that GKO mice have increased IL-17-secreting γδ T cells at day 14 pi, as well as reduced apoptosis of neutrophils, which likely accounts for impaired resolution of inflammation in GKO mice. Furthermore, depletion of G-CSF in GKO mice induced apoptosis of neutrophils and resolved inflammation, implicating impaired neutrophil apoptosis as the cause of chronic inflammation in the GKO mice.</p>
<p>Increased SOCS3 in neutrophils and BM cells is essential for desensitizing G-CSFR signaling to terminate neutrophil production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref056">56</xref>]. Myeloid expression of SOCS3 is also crucial for controlling neuroinflammatory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref058">58</xref>]. Our data show reduced SOCS3 expression in GKO, compared to WT, neutrophils, which likely impeded resolution of neutrophil responses, and is consistent with the established role for SOCS3 in regulating G-CSF signaling to prevent neutrophil-mediated disease.</p>
<p>We have previously shown that IL-10 suppressed expansion of IM in WT mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref059">59</xref>]. In our current study, excessive G-CSF in GKO mice was accompanied by deficient IL-10 production by CD4 T cells, which importantly was restored by neutralization of G-CSF. The mechanism linking IFNγ deficiency, G-CSF and lack of IL-10 production by CD4<sup>+</sup> Tregs and Tr1 cells is intriguing and remains to be resolved. High levels of IL-27, which induce Tr1 cells, IL-10 production and suppression of Th17 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref060">60</xref>], were present in both WT and GKO mice, which explains the absence of Th17 cells but not the loss of IL-10 in GKO mice. In addition to the loss of IL-10 production, there are several possible reasons for the failure of GKO Tregs and Tr1 cells to protect from HSE, including effects of chronic inflammation in GKO mice, differences in TLR signaling or metabolic programs compared to WT Tregs and Tr1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref062">62</xref>]. Also, the reduced SOCS3 expression, which resulted in sustained G-CSF signaling and neutrophil production, could contribute to IL-10 deficiency. Although IL-10 has been implicated in the resolution of neutrophil responses in a viral model of CNS infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref046">46</xref>], in our model IL-10KO mice displayed increased IM, but not neutrophil expansion; this difference likely results from the different virus-mouse strain combinations used in the two studies. Furthermore, IL-10KO T cells secreted increased IFNγ compared to WT T cells, which considered together with the reduced neutrophil levels in IL-10KO mice, clearly implicates IFNγ rather than IL-10 as an important regulator of neutrophils during inflammation. Thus our data reveals a “division of labor” for IL-10 and IFNγ in the resolution of inflammation following viral infection, with IL-10 being important for control of IMs and IFNγ being essential for termination of neutrophil responses.</p>
<p>IFNγ’s role in balancing the neutrophil-to-monocyte output from BM and regulation of neutrophil apoptosis during HSV infection, emphasizes its importance in controlling emergency hematopoiesis and neutrophil responses via regulation of G-CSF. Interestingly, a few studies have shown that the absence of type I IFNs results in CXCR2-driven neutrophil accumulation in the lungs or sensory ganglia following viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref064">64</xref>]. Although we did not observe increased IFNα/β expression, increased expression of serum CXCL1 and CXCL2 which are CXCR2 ligands, was observed in GKO mice, compared to WT mice. Therefore, it is plausible that neutrophil expansion in the absence of IFNα/β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref064">64</xref>] might involve interference with the G-CSF / STAT3 / SOCS3 axis, similar to our results. Importantly, G-CSF signaling is crucial for the down-regulation of CXCR4, which permits neutrophil egress from BM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref065">65</xref>]. The continued G-CSF signaling observed in GKO mice could account for the unabated production and egress of pathogenic neutrophils, and fatal HSE. Although the G-CSF receptor is present only on neutrophils, infiltration of other immune cells including IM into the BS of G-CSF depleted GKO mice was markedly reduced. Because neutrophils are the first cells to infiltrate an inflamed tissue, where by stimulating chemokine and integrin expression at the site of infection they enable other cells to enter the target organ, depletion of neutrophils likely resulted in reduced infiltration by macrophages along with all other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref066">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref068">68</xref>].</p>
<p>In various animal models of neutrophil-mediated inflammatory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006822.ref013">13</xref>], administration of αG-CSF Ab resolves the disease by controlling neutrophil numbers and function. Thus, in the clinical setting, management of G-CSF levels with antibodies or analogous inhibitors could be beneficial in diseases where chronic inflammation is associated with aberrant inflammatory neutrophil responses. Our study corroborates a growing body of evidence emphasizing the importance of neutrophils in neuroinflammatory disorders, including viral-mediated encephalitis. We propose identifying novel factors that target the activation and function of neutrophils, rather than T cells, as a novel therapeutic approach for neuroinflammatory disease.</p>

<title>Excessive G-CSF causes neutrophilia.</title>
<p>Top panel: GKO mice. In the absence of IFNγ, copious amounts of G-CSF and CXCL1 are secreted by cells in the brain including microglia, astrocytes and macrophages. Excessive G-CSF provokes neutrophilia in the bone marrow and these apoptosis-resistant neutrophils along with Ly6C<sup>high</sup> inflammatory monocytes (IM) invade the brainstem in massive numbers inflicting damage that culminates in fatal HSV encephalitis (HSE). G-CSF also suppresses IL-10 production by regulatory CD4 T cells resulting in an inability to regulate IM. Bottom panel: WT mice. IFNγ produced by WT T cells suppresses G-CSF production via increased SOCS3 expression thereby inducing neutrophil apoptosis and protecting WT mice from fatal HSE. Cells involved in this mechanism are shown in the key. Red arrows: inhibitory, green arrows: stimulatory; text in gray and dashed arrows indicate reduced or absent effectors.</p>
