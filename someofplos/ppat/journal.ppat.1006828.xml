<abstract>
<p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is an obligate intracellular parasite that can infect virtually all nucleated cells in warm-blooded animals. The ability of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> tachyzoites to infect and successfully manipulate its host is dependent on its ability to transport “GRA” proteins that originate in unique secretory organelles called dense granules into the host cell in which they reside. GRAs have diverse roles in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>’s intracellular lifecycle, including co-opting crucial host cell functions and proteins, such as the cell cycle, c-Myc and p38 MAP kinase. Some of these GRA proteins, such as GRA16 and GRA24, are secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) within which <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> replicates and are transported across the PV membrane (PVM) into the host cell, but the translocation process and its machinery are not well understood. We previously showed that TgMYR1, which is cleaved by TgASP5 into two fragments, localizes to the PVM and is essential for GRA transport into the host cell. To identify additional proteins necessary for effector transport, we screened <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> mutants defective in c-Myc up-regulation for their ability to export GRA16 and GRA24 to the host cell nucleus. Here we report that novel proteins MYR2 and MYR3 play a crucial role in translocation of a subset of GRAs into the host cell. MYR2 and MYR3 are secreted into the PV space and co-localize with PV membranes and MYR1. Consistent with their predicted transmembrane domains, all three proteins are membrane-associated, and MYR3, but not MYR2, stably associates with MYR1, whose N- and C-terminal fragments are disulfide-linked. We further show that fusing intrinsically disordered effectors to a structured DHFR domain blocks the transport of other effectors, consistent with a translocon-based model of effector transport. Overall, these results reveal a novel complex at the PVM that is essential for effector translocation into the host cell.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is an intracellular parasite capable of infecting virtually all warm-blooded animals, including humans. <italic>Toxoplasma’s</italic> ability to manipulate and persist in the host is due in part to its secretion of effector proteins into the host cell. Some of these effector proteins, such as GRA16 and GRA24, must cross the vacuolar membrane that the parasite replicates within during intracellular infection to reach the host cell cytosol; however, the proteins that mediate this effector transport are largely unknown. We previously identified a cleaved protein, MYR1, that is essential for effector transport. To identify other proteins that are involved in this process, we screened <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> mutants that are unable to induce c-Myc up-regulation in the host for their ability to transport GRA16 and GRA24 across the vacuolar membrane. Here we identify two novel proteins, MYR2 and MYR3, that are essential for effector transport. These proteins co-localize with MYR1 in the PV space and membrane and are membrane-associated. Furthermore, MYR3 stably associates with MYR1. These results indicate that MYR1 and MYR3 form a complex involved in the transport of key effectors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is an obligate intracellular parasite with an extraordinary host range: it can infect virtually any nucleated cell in almost any warm-blooded animal. Upon infecting such a host, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> differentiates into tachyzoites that rapidly disseminate throughout host tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref001">1</xref>]. When a tachyzoite invades a host cell, it invaginates the host plasma membrane to form the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), within which it replicates during its intracellular cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref002">2</xref>]. Although the vacuole protects <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> from clearance by the innate immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref004">4</xref>], it also creates a barrier that the parasite must circumvent in order to effectively hijack the host and acquire essential nutrients. <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>’s ability to hijack and persist in the host is due in part to its secretion of effector proteins that modulate host cell pathways, including an unknown effector responsible for up-regulation of host c-Myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref012">12</xref>]. All effector proteins so far identified within the host cell are secreted from unique organelles in the parasite, namely the rhoptries and dense granules.</p>
<p>Two classes of dense granule effectors have recently emerged: the first class consists of proteins, such as MAF1, GRA15, and GRA6, that localize to the nanotubular network and/or PV membrane (PVM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref014">14</xref>], while the second class consists of proteins, such as GRA16, GRA24, and TgIST, that traverse the PVM and localize to the host cell nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref017">17</xref>]. GRA16 has been shown to affect p53 levels and PP2A-B nuclear translocation in the host. This key effector is predicted to be an intrinsically disordered protein with five nuclear localization signals and two internal repeats, one of which contains an “RRL” TEXEL (<underline><italic>T</italic></underline><italic>oxoplasma</italic> <underline>Ex</underline>port <underline>El</underline>ement) motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref011">11</xref>]. Cleavage of the TEXEL motif by <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> aspartyl protease V (ASP5) is essential for GRA16 export across the PVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>GRA24 includes an internal bipartite nuclear localization signal and two internal repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref015">15</xref>]. It does not possess a TEXEL motif but is nonetheless dependent on ASP5 for its export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref020">20</xref>]. GRA24 is also predicted to be an intrinsically disordered protein that interacts directly with p38α MAP kinase via a kinase-interacting motif (KIM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref021">21</xref>]. This interaction results in the autophosphorylation of p38 MAPK and consequent activation of multiple host pathways, including upregulation of IL-12 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines.</p>
<p>Although it is clear that GRA16 and GRA24 must cross the PVM to ultimately reach the host nucleus, how this happens has not yet been elucidated. In <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, effector translocation across the PVM has been shown to depend on the PTEX complex, which consists of an HSP101 AAA+ ATPase, EXP2, PTEX150, PTEX88, and a thioredoxin domain-containing protein, TRX2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref024">24</xref>]. PTEX substrates that are fused to dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) are still translocated into the erythrocyte cytosol; however, the addition of small molecules that stabilize the DHFR domain and prevent its unfolding effectively blocks transport, suggesting that substrates must be unfolded for translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref025">25</xref>]. Consistent with this, knockdown of HSP101 AAA+ ATPase abrogates effector translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>In <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, the protein and molecular components required for translocation across the PVM are not well understood. GRA17 and GRA23 form pores in the PVM that allow the diffusion of small molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref026">26</xref>], but these pores are not capable of translocating polypeptides and proteins. Using a mutagenesis screen, we recently identified a novel protein, MYR1, which is essential for effector translocation across the PVM and, thus, for parasite virulence in a mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref027">27</xref>]. This protein seemed unlikely to act alone, however, and so we expanded our screen to identify other proteins that are essential for effector translocation. Here we report the identification of two novel membrane proteins, MYR2 and MYR3, that are involved in effector translocation. Both proteins are found within the PV, and MYR3 stably associates with the previously identified MYR1 to form a novel complex. Furthermore, we show that the fusion of intrinsically disordered GRA16 to murine DHFR is sufficient to block its translocation, and this block affects the translocation of other effectors, which is consistent with a translocon model of effector transport.</p>

The HFFs were obtained from the neonatal clinic at Stanford University following routine circumcisions that are performed at the request of the parents for cultural, health or other personal medical reasons (i.e., not in any way related to research). These foreskins, which would otherwise be discarded, are fully de-identified and therefore do not constitute “human subjects research”. Infections included in this study were performed by scraping infected monolayers and lysing the host cells open using a 27-gauge needle. The released parasites were spun down at 1500 rpm for 5–10 min, resuspended, counted using a hemocytometer, and added to confluent HFFs at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) stated.</p>

Specifically, the pSAG1:U6-Cas9:sgUPRT vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref035">35</xref>] was modified by Q5 site-directed mutagenesis (NEB) to specify sgRNAs targeting exons in <italic>MYR2</italic> (F2) or <italic>MYR3</italic> (F3) or <italic>GRA16</italic> (F19).

The construct was then linearized with Bsu361, and the linearized plasmid was transfected as described above. The RH:<italic>MYR2-3xHA</italic><sub><italic>62</italic></sub> strain was generated by amplifying (F11, R11) a 740 bp gBlock (IDT) in which <italic>MYR2</italic> encodes a 3xHA tag starting at amino acid 62 and co-transfecting the purified product with pSAG1:U6-Cas9:sgMYR2-178 vector (F13) into RH<italic>Δku80Δhpt</italic> to create a double stranded break.

<p>To construct the pGRA1-HPT-3xHA vector, a 296 bp double stranded DNA gene block (IDT) was designed to contain the sequence of the original pGRA1-HPT-HA plasmid from the NsiI site to the NcoI site, a triple HA tag and stop codon after the NcoI site, and a PacI site after the stop codon.

The pGRA1:GRA16-DHFR plasmid was generated by amplifying murine DHFR coding sequence from a gBlock (IDT) and cloning it into the NcoI and PacI sites of pGRA1:GRA16-HA, effectively replacing the HA tag with mDHFR.

Briefly, bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) engineered to express GFP fused to c-Myc were infected with mCherry-expressing <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> tachyzoites that had been chemically mutagenized with ethylnitrosourea (ENU). Successive FACS sorts were performed to enrich for BMMs that were infected with tachyzoites incapable of modulating host c-<underline>My</underline>c <underline>r</underline>egulation (i.e., had a Myr<sup>-</sup> phenotype). Initial screening of these mutant populations yielded 3 independent mutants with a defect in GRA16 and GRA24 translocation across the PVM; whole genome sequencing revealed each of the 3 mutants had a distinct nonsense mutation in a gene dubbed <italic>MYR1</italic> (<italic>TGGT1_254470</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>The previously published work showed that MYR1 localizes to the PVM and is necessary for GRA16 and GRA24 effector translocation. Based on precedent in other protein translocation systems, however, we hypothesized that multiple proteins are involved and set out to identify these other proteins. To do this, we performed Western blots on 13 additional mutants isolated from the original Myr<sup>-</sup> population to test for the expression of full-length MYR1 protein, which indicates that they may be mutated in other crucial genes. Of these 13 clones, 8 appeared wild-type for <italic>MYR1</italic>, indicating they likely harbored a mutation in a different gene involved in the Myr<sup>-</sup> phenotype, and the presence of a wild-type <italic>MYR1</italic> locus was confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing of the <italic>MYR1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Three of these mutants (MFM1.6, MFM1.7, and MFM1.8) were chosen at random for whole-genome sequencing to identify the mutated genes that might underlie their Myr<sup>-</sup> phenotype.</p>

<p>Genomic sequencing revealed the expected range of 7 to 18 coding mutations in the three mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006828.t001">Table 1</xref>). Mutant MFM1.8 had no mutation in any gene that was also mutated in MFM1.7 and MFM1.6, but it did have a nonsense mutation in gene <italic>TGGT1_270700</italic> (Q174*). This appeared the most likely candidate for the phenotype-causing mutation in the MFM1.8 mutant given that it was the only stop codon acquired and <italic>TGGT1_270700</italic> is predicted to encode a novel, secreted protein. To test this hypothesis, we amplified the <italic>TGGT1_270700</italic> locus in the other 5 MYR1-wild-type Myr<sup>-</sup> mutants to see if any were independently mutated in this gene. We found that one such mutant, MFM1.13, had an independent nonsense mutation (Y274*) in <italic>TGGT1_270700</italic>. This strongly argued for <italic>TGGT1_270700</italic> being key to the c-Myc up-regulation phenotype. The MFM1.6 mutant also had a single nonsense mutation and this was in a gene, <italic>TGGT_237230</italic>, which initially appeared to be unaltered, in terms of coding mutations, in the other two sequenced mutants. On further inspection, however, it was apparent that <italic>TGGT1_237230</italic> was misannotated in ToxoDB and that a region originally called as an intron is in fact part of the coding region in the vast majority of transcripts. Using this corrected coding region and reanalyzing the MFM1.7 sequencing data revealed that MFM1.7 had a missense mutation in <italic>TGGT1_237230</italic> (1), strongly suggesting mutations in this gene are responsible for the Myr<sup>-</sup> phenotype in the MFM1.6 and MFM1.7 mutants. PCR sequencing of the loci described here in the remaining 4 <italic>MYR1</italic> wild-type mutants indicated all were clones of MFM1.7 and so these were not further pursued.</p>

<p>Having identified novel Myr<sup>-</sup> mutants, we next asked whether they are defective in effector translocation or in c-Myc up-regulation only. To test this, we independently transfected the MFM1.6, MFM1.7, and MFM1.8 mutants with a GRA16-HA plasmid and assessed effector protein localization by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The results showed that all three mutants have a defect in the translocation of GRA16 across the PVM to the host nucleus, indicating that these mutants are indeed defective in the machinery responsible for the translocation of effectors rather than in an effector that mediates host c-Myc upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>To verify that <italic>TGGT1_270700</italic> and <italic>TGGT1_237230</italic> are responsible for the Myr<sup>-</sup> phenotype, we generated strains disrupted in the first exon of each gene; specifically, we co-transfected CRISPR-Cas9 sgRNA plasmid modified to target the first exon of the relevant gene along with linearized pGRA1-HA-HPT plasmid, which contains the <italic>HXGPRT</italic> selectable marker, into RH<italic>Δhpt</italic> parasites (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g002">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g003">3A</xref>). Following selection with mycophenolic acid and xanthine, we cloned the populations by limiting dilution and confirmed disruptive integration of the vector in the first exon of each gene by performing PCR (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g002">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g003">3B</xref>) and submitting the product for sequencing. To assess the role of these genes in effector translocation, we transfected the parental strain and RH<italic>Δ270700</italic> and RH<italic>Δ237230</italic> strains with GRA24-myc plasmid and assessed GRA24 localization by IFA. The results show that <italic>TGGT1_270700</italic> and <italic>TGGT1_237230</italic> are indeed essential for effector translocation, and we therefore dubbed them <italic>MYR2</italic> and <italic>MYR3</italic>, respectively (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g002">2C, 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g003">3C and 3D</xref>).</p>

<p>The <italic>MYR2</italic>-disrupted line was complemented ectopically by transient expression of MYR2-3xHA off the <italic>GRA1</italic> promoter along with pHTU-GRA24-Myc. We first attempted to express MYR2-3xHA off the <italic>MYR2</italic> promoter, but we were unable to visualize the HA-tagged protein by this method, likely due to its low protein expression, as discussed below. GRA24 localization was then assessed by IFA and compared to wild-type and RH<italic>Δmyr2</italic> strains transfected with the pHTU-GRA24-Myc plasmid alone. The results showed that the parental and complemented parasites had robust GRA24 localization in the vacuole and infected host cell nucleus while RH<italic>Δmyr2</italic> had robust signal in the vacuole but not in the host nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). This confirmed <italic>MYR2</italic> as a gene necessary for protein translocation of effectors across the PVM.</p>
<p>RH<italic>Δmyr3</italic> parasites were ectopically complemented by co-transfecting the CRISPR-Cas9 construct targeting <italic>UPRT</italic> and a construct expressing MYR3-3xHA off its native promoter. Complemented lines harboring a disruption of <italic>UPRT</italic> and integration of <italic>MYR3-3xHA</italic> at the <italic>UPRT</italic> locus were enriched with FUDR selection.

The results showed a substantial defect in GRA24 nuclear localization in cells infected with RH<italic>Δmyr3</italic> parasites, but not parental or complemented parasites, confirming MYR3 is an essential component for effector translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>).</p>

<title>MYR1, MYR2, and MYR3 affect growth <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>GRA16, GRA24, and IST have not been shown to affect growth <italic>in vitro</italic>, and our previous work has shown that deletion of <italic>MYR1</italic> does not affect the number of parasites per vacuole <italic>in vitro</italic> 22 hours post infection (hpi). To determine if loss of <italic>MYR2</italic> or <italic>MYR3</italic> affects growth at a similarly early time point, we assessed the number of parasites per vacuole in HFFs infected with RH wild type, RH<italic>Δmyr2</italic>, RH<italic>Δmyr3</italic>, or RH<italic>Δmyr3</italic>::<italic>MYR3-3xHA</italic> tachyzoites 20 hpi. Consistent with our previous results for MYR1, we found no apparent defect in growth for RH<italic>Δmyr2</italic> and RH<italic>Δmyr3</italic> tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) at 20 hpi. This is a relatively early time point, however, and so to determine if loss of <italic>MYR1</italic>, <italic>MYR2</italic>, or <italic>MYR3</italic> have even a subtle effect on growth, we infected HFFs with tachyzoites from these same strains, fixed the monolayers at 6 days post infection, and measured plaque size. The results showed a small but significant defect in plaque size for <italic>Δmyr1</italic>, <italic>Δmyr2</italic>, <italic>and Δmyr3</italic> strains, that at least in the case of <italic>Δmyr1</italic> and <italic>Δmyr3</italic> was rescued by the relevant complementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>; we were unable to obtain a stable complement of the <italic>Δmyr2</italic> mutant). This indicates that MYR1, MYR2 and MYR3 are all necessary for fully wild type growth, even <italic>in vitro</italic>, and suggests that one or more effectors translocated by the MYR1/2/3-dependent machinery has a role in growth in HFFs.</p>

<p><italic>MYR2</italic> is located on chromosome VIII and is predicted by ToxoDB (v32) to have two introns and encode a protein of ~32 kDa, including a predicted N-terminal signal peptide (probability 0.672 by SignalP 2.0 HMM) and, by TMpred, two transmembrane (TM) domains between amino acids 43–60 and 261–279 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Microarray and RNA-Seq data available in ToxoDB (v32) show that this gene is expressed in tachyzoites and sporozoites (FPKM values of ~50–100) and to a lesser extent in bradyzoites (FPKM and microarray values about 1/10<sup>th</sup> those seen with tachyzoites) but it is essentially off in the enteroepithelial stages found in felines (FPKM &lt;2). Phosphoproteomics analysis indicates two potential phosphorylation sites on residues 162 and/or 167 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref037">37</xref>; ToxoDB v32]. BLAST analysis shows MYR2 has an orthologue in <italic>Neospora caninum</italic> (<italic>NCLIV_036070</italic>) although it shows only 39% amino acid identity to the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006828.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, the strongest conservation between the two orthologues is in the C-terminal-most 69 amino acids which are 71% identical and this region includes one of the two strongly predicted TM domains. The more N-terminal predicted TM domain (amino acids 43–60) is conserved in overall hydrophobicity and thus is still strongly predicted to be a TM in the <italic>Neospora</italic> sequence, but the exact amino acid sequences in this region are not well conserved. No orthologue of MYR2 is detected in <italic>Sarcocystis</italic> or the more distantly related genus, <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. Unlike MYR1, MYR2 does not appear to have a “RRL” TEXEL motif that would target it for cleavage by ASP5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref020">20</xref>].</p>

<p><italic>MYR3</italic> is located on chromosome X and is annotated by ToxoDB (v32) as having three introns; however, the first and third such predicted introns are spliced out in &lt;1% of the transcripts whereas intron 2 is removed from almost all this gene’s mRNAs. The ORF predicted by removal of just intron 2 encodes a protein of 192 amino acids with no signal peptide but a strongly predicted (by TMpred) TM domain between residues 79–101, which could act as an internal signal sequence to route the protein through the secretory pathway (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g005">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006828.s003">S2</xref>). RNASeq and microarray data show that <italic>MYR3</italic> is well expressed in tachyzoites and sporozoites (FPKM ~200–800 in both), less so in bradyzoites (FPKM ~60), and essentially off in the enteroepithelial stages (FPKM &lt;1; ToxoDB v32). Interestingly, a few of the non-canonical <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains show a deletion of ~250 bp in their 3’-UTR sequence relative to the well-studied RH, ME49 and VEG strains but the impact of this on the gene’s function is not known ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref038">38</xref>]; ToxoDB v32). Interestingly, MYR3 shows a high number of spectral counts for phosphorylated serine residues in the context of intracellular infection, but not in the purified parasites, suggesting that the protein is phosphorylated outside of the parasite’s boundaries [37; ToxoDB v32]. BLAST analysis indicated that, like <italic>MYR1</italic> and <italic>MYR2</italic>, <italic>MYR3</italic> has a somewhat conserved orthologue in <italic>Neospora caninum</italic> (<italic>BN1204_051095</italic>) with 35% identity over the N-terminal most 181 amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006828.s003">S2 Fig</xref>) and no detectable orthologue in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. The presence of a predicted TM domain is also conserved in the <italic>Neospora</italic> version of the protein at amino acids 83–99. As with MYR2, MYR3 does not have a recognizable “RRL” TEXEL motif.</p>

<title>MYR2 and MYR3 co-localize with MYR1 at the PV membrane and space</title>
<p>In a previous study, we showed that MYR1 is essential for effector translocation and is cleaved into two fragments, both of which are found within the PV space and at the PVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref027">27</xref>]. To determine if MYR1 (N)- and (C)-termini precisely co-localize, which was not previously done, we performed confocal immunofluorescence on RH:<italic>MYR1-3xHA</italic> strain, which has a 3xHA tag endogenously fused to the MYR1(C)-terminus, using anti-HA antibodies and antibodies raised to the native MYR1(N) domain to detect the two portions individually. The results show that MYR1 (N) and (C)-termini indeed co-localize at the PV membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the localization of MYR2, we endogenously modified the gene to express a 3xHA tag either immediately before the stop codon (RH:<italic>MYR2-3xHA</italic>) or after the predicted transmembrane domain, at amino acid residue 62 (RH:<italic>MYR2-3xHA</italic><sub><italic>62</italic></sub>). Although, as discussed further below, both parasite lines yielded a protein product migrating at about 40 kDa by Western blot, neither yielded a visible signal by standard IFA procedures.</p>
<p>The failure to detect the endogenously tagged MYR2 protein by IFA could be due to low protein expression levels. To overcome this, we expressed MYR2-3xHA ectopically off the GRA1 promoter by transient transfection, fixed infected monolayers with methanol, and probed its localization by IFA. The results showed that MYR2 localizes to the PV space and, to some degree, to the PV membrane; it also shows some co-localization with GRA7, a protein known to be localized to the intravacuolar network (IVN) and PVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref039">39</xref>], and with MYR1 in the PV space and membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). While these results were obtained with over-expression, they do strongly suggest that MYR2 is IVN- and PVM-associated.</p>
<p>To determine the localization of MYR3, we first generated the RH:<italic>MYR3-3xHA</italic> strain, in which a 3xHA tag is fused endogenously to the 3’-end of the sequence coding for the C-terminus of MYR3, and then used it to infect HFF monolayers. Infected monolayers were fixed with methanol at 12–16 hours, stained with antibodies against HA, MYR1, or GRA7, and then visualized by confocal microscopy. The results indicate that MYR3-3xHA has robust co-localization with GRA7 and MYR1 within the PV and at the PVM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g005">Fig 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>Given this localization, we then assessed whether correct localization of either MYR1, MYR2, or MYR3 depends on either of the other MYR proteins. To determine if MYR1 localization depends on MYR2 or MYR3, we infected monolayers with RH, RH<italic>Δmyr2</italic>, or RH<italic>Δmyr3</italic> tachyzoites and stained for MYR1(N) and, as a control, GRA7, using antibodies raised to recombinant versions of these proteins. The results showed that MYR1(N) localizes to the PV and PVM for all three strains with no detectable difference between them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006828.s004">S3 Fig</xref>), thereby indicating that MYR1’s localization is not dependent on MYR2 or MYR3.</p>
<p>To determine if MYR2 localization depends on MYR1 or MYR3, we transiently transfected RH<italic>Δmyr1</italic>, RH<italic>Δmyr2</italic>, and RH<italic>Δmyr3</italic> tachyzoites with a construct expressing MYR2-3xHA and assessed MYR2 localization by IFA with HA antibodies. We again found no apparent difference in MYR2-3xHA localization between the three strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006828.s005">S4 Fig</xref>), suggesting that MYR2 localization does not depend on MYR1 or MYR3. To assess MYR3 localization in RH<italic>Δmyr2</italic> parasites, we ectopically integrated <italic>MYR3-3xHA</italic> expressed off its natural promoter in RH and RH<italic>Δmyr2</italic> parasites and stained for MYR3-3xHA with HA antibodies. MYR3-3xHA similarly localized to the PV membrane and space in both strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006828.s006">S5 Fig</xref>), indicating that MYR2 is not necessary for correct localization of MYR3.</p>

<title>MYR1, MYR2, and MYR3 are membrane-associated outside of the tachyzoite’s boundaries</title>
<p>MYR1, MYR2, and MYR3 are all bioinformatically predicted to have transmembrane domains. Given their localization within the PV and at the PVM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g005">Fig 5</xref>), we next asked if they are indeed membrane-associated. To test this, we performed fractionation experiments in which HFFs were infected with the relevant RH tachyzoites for 20–24 hours, mechanically lysed in PBS to release the parasites, and then spun at 2500 x g to pellet intact parasites, host nuclei, and other debris. The resulting pellet, referred to as the low-speed pellet (LSP), was resuspended in lysis buffer, while the supernatant containing PV membranes and host cell material was fractionated at 100,000 x g to isolate the high-speed supernatant (HSS) and high-speed pellet (HSP) fractions. To first determine if MYR1 (C) and (N) are membrane-associated or soluble, we performed SDS-PAGE on the fractions from HFFs infected with RH:<italic>MYR1-3xHA</italic> parasites and blotted for the MYR1 C-terminus with HA antibodies and the MYR1 N-terminus with antibodies raised to the N-terminal domain of MYR1. The fractions were also blotted with antibodies against GRA7, an integral PVM protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref040">40</xref>] and GRA1, a soluble dense granule protein secreted by <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> into the PV space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref041">41</xref>], as controls. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) showed that, outside of the parasite, both MYR1 (C) and (N) fragments are in the HSP fractions. Importantly, GRA7, shown previously to be within PV membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref040">40</xref>], is also primarily in the HSP fraction, while GRA1 is in the HSS. To ensure that the pellet fraction consists primarily of PVM membranes and not intact parasites, we blotted with antibodies against SAG1, a GPI-anchored parasite surface antigen. The results showed that, as expected, almost no SAG1 is in the HSP, thereby indicating that MYR1’s presence in this fraction is not a result of contamination with intact parasites.</p>

<p>The presence of protein in the pellet may be the result of membrane association or protein aggregation. To determine whether MYR1 is released by detergents into the supernatant, which is consistent with membrane association, we sonicated the HSP in PBS or detergents, incubated it on ice for 45 minutes, and fractionated again at 100,000 x g. The resulting fractions were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed by Western blot. The results showed that both MYR1 fragments are released by detergents into the supernatant, indicating membrane association rather than protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine if MYR2 and MYR3 are also membrane-associated, we performed similar experiments on HFFs infected with RH tachyzoites endogenously HA-tagged at the <italic>MYR2</italic> or <italic>MYR3</italic> locus. The results showed that MYR2 and MYR3 are predominantly in the HSP fraction, not the HSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>), and the pelleted protein is released by detergents into the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). The somewhat slower-than-predicted mobility of MYR2 (it migrates as if 40 kDa whereas it is predicted to be about 32 kDa) may be related to its acidic pI (4.7) and/or phosphorylation, both of which can retard a protein’s mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref042">42</xref>]. Interestingly, MYR3 was detected as a doublet that is most visible in the pellet fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). To determine if the doublet is due to phosphorylation, we repeated the fractionation in the presence or absence of phosphatase inhibitors and analyzed the pellet fractions for MYR3-3xHA by Western blot. We found that the slower migrating band was substantially decreased in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors relative to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g006">Fig 6E</xref>), consistent with this upper band being a phosphorylated form, the existence of which was previously reported in phosphoproteome analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref037">37</xref>].</p>

<title>MYR1’s two domains associate in a disulfide-dependent manner</title>
<p>As previously shown, MYR1 is cleaved into N- and C-terminal fragments that run at approximately 80 kDa and 32 kDa, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref027">27</xref>]. Given that the two fragments co-localize and show similar fractionation patterns, despite MYR1(N) not having a predicted transmembrane domain, we assessed whether the two fragments stably associate. To do this, we performed immunoprecipitations using anti-HA antibodies on HFFs infected 20–24 hpi with RH:<italic>MYR1-3xHA</italic> tachyzoites expressing C-terminally tagged MYR1 or with untagged tachyzoites as a control. The resulting inputs and eluates were boiled in sample buffer containing dithiothreitol (+DTT), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and probed for MYR1(C) and MYR1(N) using antibodies to the corresponding recombinant fragment. The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) showed that MYR1(N) specifically co-precipitated with MYR1(C), indicating that the two proteins are stably associating (note that the migration of the C-terminal MYR1 domain is somewhat retarded by addition of the triple-HA tag, as expected); no such precipitation was seen using the untagged RH strain as a negative control. To check for specificity, we also blotted for MAF1, an integral membrane protein that localizes to the PV membrane and mediates mitochondrial association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref013">13</xref>]. As expected, MAF1 was not co-precipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).</p>

Omitting DTT from the sample buffer resulted in both the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments running at about the size of the uncleaved protein, indicating that N- and C-terminal domains of MYR1 associate in a disulfide-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).

<title>MYR3 but not MYR2 appears to associate stably with MYR1</title>
<p>To determine if MYR1 stably interacts with MYR2, we performed immunoprecipitations on HFFs infected with RH:<italic>MYR2-3xHA</italic><sub><italic>62</italic></sub> and an untagged RH control, as described above. The resulting inputs and eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed by Western blotting with antibodies to the HA-tag, MYR1(N) or MYR1(C). The results showed no evidence for association of either MYR1 domain with MYR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). We cannot rule out that MYR1 and MYR2 interact transiently, or that the apparent lack of an association is an artifact of the conditions used; however, the results suggest that MYR2 does not stably associate with MYR1.</p>
<p>To determine if MYR1 interacts with MYR3, we infected HFFs with RH:<italic>MYR3-3xHA</italic> or untagged RH tachyzoites and repeated the immunoprecipitations and Western blotting described above. Immunoprecipitation from MYR3-3xHA-infected cells is inefficient relative to immunoprecipitations using cells infected with the MYR1-3xHA and MYR2-3xHA-expressing parasites, and does not give a high yield in the eluate. Nevertheless, blotting with HA antibodies showed that some MYR3-3xHA is precipitated in the tagged eluate and that both fragments of MYR1 co-precipitate with MYR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). As a control for specificity, we also probed for MAF1 with anti-MAF1 antibodies and saw no detectable MAF1 co-precipitation, confirming that the interaction of MYR3 and MYR1 is specific. Interestingly, the ratio of the precipitated MYR1(C) fragment relative to the input is similar to the ratio for precipitated and input MYR3, suggesting that the interaction could be stoichiometric, although more careful biochemical studies will be needed to conclude this definitively.</p>

<title>Highly ordered domain blocks effector transport</title>
<p>Three of the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> effectors that are transported across the PVM, namely GRA16, GRA24, and IST, appear to be highly disordered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref016">16</xref>], which may be important for their translocation. Previous work has shown that fusion of GRA16 to DHFR, which rapidly folds into a highly structured domain, blocks GRA16 transport across the PVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref019">19</xref>], even in the absence of domain-stabilizing compounds. To determine if this block on GRA16-DHFR transport affects PVM translocation of other effectors, which would be predicted in a translocon-based model of protein transport, we expressed GRA16-DHFR ectopically and assessed the effect of this fusion on GRA16 and GRA24 transport. In good agreement with previous results, we found that whereas (non-DHFR-fused) GRA16-HA localized to the PV space and trafficked to the host nucleus, GRA16-DHFR accumulated in the vacuole and was rarely visible (&lt; 10%) in the host cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). To determine if this block on GRA16-DHFR transport affects translocation of other effectors, such as GRA24, we transiently transfected the parental and GRA16-DHFR-expressing strains with a Myc-tagged GRA24 plasmid and assessed GRA24 localization by IFA. We found that expression of GRA16-DHFR significantly reduced GRA24 localization to the host cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g008">Fig 8B</xref>), suggesting that either GRA16-DHFR impedes the translocation machinery or that GRA24 directly depends on a fully functional GRA16 for this process, e.g., through some sort of specific association or “piggy-backing”. Notably, unlike GRA16, GRA24 lacks the RRL motif cleaved by ASP5 and does not appear to be cleaved elsewhere, yet still depends on ASP5 for its transport across the PVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref019">19</xref>].

The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006828.g008">Fig 8C</xref>) showed no difference in GRA24 translocation between the strains, indicating that GRA24 translocation does not intrinsically depend on GRA16 and that the effect of GRA16-DHFR is through nonspecific blocking of the translocation machinery.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we have identified a novel membrane complex of at least 3 polypeptides—MYR1(N), MYR1(C), and MYR3—that is essential for effector translocation across the vacuolar membrane into the host cell. Specifically, we have identified two novel parasite proteins, MYR2 and MYR3, that are essential for effector translocation and show that they co-localize with GRA7 and MYR1 in the PV space and PVM. Consistent with their predicted transmembrane domains, MYR1, MYR2, and MYR3 all associate with membranes outside of the parasite’s boundaries. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that MYR1 (N)- and (C)-termini stably interact in a disulfide-dependent manner and that MYR3, but not MYR2, stably associates with MYR1, indicating a complex of at least 3 polypeptide chains. It is unclear why MYR1 is cleaved into two fragments that nonetheless associate in a disulfide-dependent manner, but this may play an important regulatory function. Although we did not see any interaction between MYR1 and MYR2, we cannot rule out that these proteins transiently interact and/or that the apparent lack of association is an artifact of the conditions used.</p>
<p>The precise role of MYR1, MYR2 and MYR3 in effector translocation is unclear, but given their localization and membrane association, MYR1 and MYR3 seem likely to form part of a novel complex that directly transports effector proteins across the membrane. The lack of stable association and the low protein abundance of MYR2 relative to MYR1 and MYR3 suggest that MYR2 may function differently, even though all three proteins are clearly essential for GRA16 and GRA24 translocation. Furthermore, MYR1, MYR2, and MYR3 show similar patterns of expression between different developmental stages of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> based on RNASeq and microarray data, consistent with a coordinated function.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found that MYR1, MYR2, and MYR3 are not necessary for normal growth within one lytic cycle, but their absence does have a measurable effect on growth over multiple lytic cycles. This suggests that one or more MYR-dependent effectors contributes to the parasite’s ability to grow in HFFs <italic>in vitro</italic>, but the identity of this effector remains to be determined. In our previous work, we showed that mice infected with Type I (RH) <italic>Δmyr1</italic> tachyzoites have a delayed time to death, while mice infected with Type II (ME49) <italic>Δmyr1</italic> tachyzoites show a significant decrease in virulence and survive infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref027">27</xref>]. These results are consistent with the important role that effectors whose translocation is dependent on MYR1, such as GRA16, have been reported to have on virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref016">16</xref>]. Given that mutants disrupted in <italic>MYR1</italic>, <italic>MYR2</italic> and <italic>MYR3</italic> all have essentially identical phenotypes with regard to <italic>in vitro</italic> growth and defective effector translocation, it is highly likely that they will also show similar virulence phenotypes in mice.</p>
<p>Like MYR1, clear orthologues of MYR2 and MYR3 are present in <italic>Neospora caninum</italic>, consistent with their function as a translocon. Surprisingly, however, the level of conservation between the two genera for all three proteins is modest: 45%, 39% and 35% for MYR1, MYR2 and MYR3, respectively. This suggests that the translocation machinery has been subject to selection for optimal efficiency with their respective cargoes. Interestingly, none of these MYR proteins have homologues in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and, similarly, the PTEX machinery that translocates secreted <italic>Plasmodium</italic> proteins across the PVM in an infected red blood cell is not functionally conserved in <italic>Toxoplasma;</italic> while there are two homologs of PfEXP2 in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, GRA17 and GRA23, these have recently been shown to function in the translocation of small molecules (&lt;1800 daltons) across the PVM, not proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>The requirements for translocation across <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>’s PVM are not well understood, but they appear to differ from those for <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. Fusion of PTEX substrates in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> to highly ordered domains such as DHFR and GFP does not significantly affect their transport unless a stabilizing molecule that prevents their unfolding is added; however, for <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, addition of a highly structured domain, such as DHFR, to the GRA16 effector is sufficient to block export even in the absence of additional stabilizing compounds, as reported here and elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref043">43</xref>]. Importantly, the fusion of GRA16 to DHFR also impedes the translocation of GRA24; this is similar to the “blockage” effects that have been reported for protein translocons in other systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006828.ref044">44</xref>] and is consistent with the existence of a translocon at the PVM rather than a less constrained mechanism for protein translocation across this membrane. Overall, our results show that a novel membrane protein complex is essential for translocation and is at the right time and place to be the PVM translocon; however, further work will be needed to definitively determine if the complex operates in this role or as part of an accessory complex that functions upstream or downstream of the actual translocon.</p>
