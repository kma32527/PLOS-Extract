<abstract>
<p><italic>Epichloë festucae</italic> is an endophytic fungus which systemically colonizes temperate grasses to establish symbiotic associations. Maintaining symptomless infection is a key requirement for endophytes, a feature that distinguishes them from pathogenic fungi. While pathogenic fungi extend their hyphae by tip growth, hyphae of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> systemically colonize the intercellular space of expanding host leaves via a unique mechanism of hyphal intercalary growth. This study reports that two homologous Rho GTPases, Cdc42 and RacA, have distinctive roles in the regulation of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> growth <italic>in planta</italic>. Here we highlight the vital role of Cdc42 for intercalary hyphal growth, as well as involvement of RacA in regulation of hyphal network formation, and demonstrate the consequences of mutations in these genes on plant tissue infection. Functions of Cdc42 and RacA are mediated via interactions with BemA and NoxR respectively, which are expected components of the ROS producing NOX complex. Symbiotic defects found in the <italic>racA</italic> mutant were rescued by introduction of a Cdc42 with key amino acids substitutions crucial for RacA function, highlighting the significance of the specific interactions of these GTPases with BemA and NoxR for their functional differentiation in symbiotic infection.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p><italic>Epichloë festucae</italic> is a fungus, which grows inside the plant tissue of temperate grasses in order to establish symbiotic associations. In contrast to disease causing fungi, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> does not trigger a defense response in the host plant. Strict control of the biomass, as well as the growth pattern in host plants are expected to be key requirements for avoiding a defense response by the plant. However, the mechanism by which this symbiotic infection is established, remains largely unknown. In this study, we report that two highly homologous Rho GTPases, Cdc42 and RacA, have distinctive roles in the regulation of the fungus’ growth inside the plant. It was observed that hyphal cells of the fungus are attached to plant cells via the extracellular matrix, and it grows via unique intercalary hyphal extension, rather than via hyphal tip growth, which is normally the case for standard filamentous fungi. <italic>cdc42</italic> mutants were able to colonize younger host tissue, but the hyphae were fragmented when tillers of the host plant elongated, indicating that Cdc42-mediated intercalary hyphal growth is a key event for systemic infection of the fungus in host plants. In contrast, RacA is involved in the establishment of the hyphal network in the intercellular spaces of the host plant, via formation of hyphal cell-cell fusion, which may be required to minimize stress on the host plant caused by the infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In nature, many plant species harbor various microbes inside their tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref001">1</xref>]. Below ground tissues of plants (i.e. the root system) are the major site for plant-microbe interactions, where arbuscular mycorrhiza, ectomycorrhiza and nitrogen fixing bacteria colonize the root system with beneficial consequences on the growth of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref002">2</xref>]. There are large numbers of endophytic microbes with no obvious benefit for the host plants, making it difficult to distinguish between parasitic or mutualistic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref001">1</xref>], as asymptomatic endophytes may protect the plants from pathogenic organisms in certain circumstances, by competing for nutrient acquisition and infection spaces, or by inducing weak defense reactions of host plants.</p>
<p>There are relatively fewer known endophytic microbes in aerial tissues of plants. One representative of aboveground endophytic fungi, is <italic>Epichloë</italic>, which systemically colonizes the intercellular spaces of leaf primordia, leaf sheaths, blades and tillers to establish symbiotic associations with temperate grasses of the subfamily Pooideae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref005">5</xref>]. The hyphae of <italic>Epichloë</italic> endophytes eventually grow into the inflorescence tissues of reproductive tillers to colonize the embryo of plant seeds, which enable <italic>Epichloë</italic> endophytes to propagate with the host plant. Colonization by <italic>Epichloë</italic> endophytes confers various benefits on host plant growth and fitness to environmental stresses through the production of distinct classes of biologically active metabolites (e.g. alkaloids) for improving plant resistance to a range of biotic and abiotic stresses, including drought, disease and animal/insect herbivores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref009">9</xref>]. The organization of alkaloid loci and abundant transposon-derived repeat blocks in the genome sequences of <italic>Epichloë</italic> suggest that <italic>Epichloë</italic> endophytes are under selection pressure for the production of diverse alkaloids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref010">10</xref>]. This is probably an important feature of <italic>Epichloë</italic> endophytic fungi to enhance fitness of host plants to variable environmental stresses.</p>
<p>Another key requirement for <italic>Epichloë</italic> endophytes is strict control of microbial biomass and growth pattern in host plant tissues to maintain symbiotic infection. In contrast to unrestricted extension of infecting hyphae of pathogenic fungi, it has been proposed that <italic>Epichloë</italic> endophytes have a unique mechanism to establish systemic infection in host plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref012">12</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In meristematic tissue of host plants, the endophytic hyphae extend by tip growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), but once the tiller of the host is colonized, the hyphae are attached to the plant cells and extend by intercalary growth, which enables the growth of the endophyte to be synchronized with that of the host plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). Endophytic hyphae <italic>in planta</italic> are interconnected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), which enables the establishment of a network between parallel-growing hyphae, and control of biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref013">13</xref>]. Hyphae of some <italic>Epichloë</italic> endophytes are able to grow from the inside of the plant tissue to the outside by means of an expressorium, a newly identified fungal structure that allows penetration of the cuticle, to form a hyphal net on the surface of the leaf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref014">14</xref>]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by NoxA, a specific NADPH oxidase (Nox) isoform, play a crucial role in the symbiotic colonization of the host plant by <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic>. Mutants of <italic>noxA</italic> have unrestricted growth inside the host plant, comparable to pathogenic fungi, which results in a severely stunted, and often lethal phenotype of the host plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref015">15</xref>]. These findings indicate that NoxA is required to synchronize the growth of <italic>Epichloë</italic> endophytes <italic>in planta</italic> with the host plant. <italic>noxA</italic> mutants are also defective in hyphal cell-cell fusion, a process that is important for establishing a hyphal network <italic>in planta</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref013">13</xref>]. Regulatory components of NoxA, NoxR (human p67<sup>phox</sup>-like protein) and a small GTPase RacA, are also essential for the establishment of symbiotic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref017">17</xref>]. Homologues of yeast proteins for polarity establishment, BemA and Cdc24, were identified as NoxR-interacting proteins, which suggests that both are potential regulators of ROS production in the fungal Nox complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref018">18</xref>]. <italic>noxR</italic> and <italic>racA</italic> mutants induced stunting of host plants, comparable to the <italic>noxA</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref017">17</xref>], while <italic>bemA</italic> mutants induce only a mildly stunted phenotype of the host plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref018">18</xref>]. <italic>noxR</italic> and <italic>racA</italic> mutants are also defective in hyphal cell fusion, whereas <italic>bemA</italic> mutants have a reduction in the frequency of hyphal fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref013">13</xref>], suggesting that BemA has an accessory role in the Nox complex. Similarly, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> ProA (a C6 zinc finger transcription factor) and So (a scaffold for a MAP kinase pathway) are involved in hyphal cell fusion, and infection with <italic>proA</italic> and <italic>so</italic> mutants caused stunting of host plants, with a severity similar to that observed in <italic>noxA</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref020">20</xref>]. Given that <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> Nox-1 (NoxA), Nor-1 (NoxR), Rac-1 (RacA), Adv-1 (ProA) and So have been previously reported to be involved in fusion between conidial anastomosis tubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref024">24</xref>], these results indicate that hyphal cell fusion is essential for controlling the growth of endophytes in host plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref013">13</xref>].</p>

<p>In this study, we investigated in culture and <italic>in planta</italic> functions of two closely related Rho GTPases, RacA and Cdc42, from the endophytic fungus <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic>. Although the functions of Rac and Cdc42 have been characterized in many fungal species, the present study reveals that <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> utilizes these very similar small GTPases in unique ways in the symbiotic interaction with the host plant. RacA and Cdc42 have positive and negative roles in the control of hyphal ROS production. Moreover, critical amino acid residues for specific interactions of small GTPase with BemA and NoxR were identified. Complementation of <italic>racA</italic> and <italic>cdc42</italic> mutants with modified Cdc42 and RacA revealed the significance of specific interactions of Cdc42 and RacA with BemA and NoxR for functional differentiation of these small GTPases in diverse biological processes.</p>

<title>Two closely related Rho GTPases, RacA and Cdc42, specifically interact with different components of the fungal Nox complex</title>
<p>Small GTPases are universal molecular switches for eukaryotic cells to regulate a broad range of physiological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref028">28</xref>]. In filamentous fungi, there are 5 subgroups of small GTPases, namely Rab, Arf, Rho and Ras and Ran. Thirty-one genes for small GTPases can be identified from the genome sequence of the endophytic fungus <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006840.s001">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006840.s015">S1 Table</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of small GTPases from Ascomycota fungi, including <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic>, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>crassa</italic>, <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic>, and <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic>, revealed that most members of the small GTPases form tight clusters, suggesting conserved functions of small GTPases in Ascomycota fungi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006840.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Rac is a multifunctional small GTPase belonging to the Rho subgroup. One of its conserved functions among mammalian, plant and fungal Rac, is the activation of NADPH oxidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref030">30</xref>]. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> RacA has been shown to interact with NoxR, an ortholog of the human Nox activator p67<sup>phox</sup>, which also has a key role in regulating ROS production during symbiotic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Seven genes encoding <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> Rho GTPases were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006840.s001">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006840.s015">S1 Table</xref>). As Rho GTPases share similar domain structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), we tested for possible interactions between the 7 Rho GTPases and NoxR by performing yeast two-hybrid assays. As cysteine residues near the C-terminus of Rho GTPases, could prevent the yeast two-hybrid assay (as they are geranylgeranylation sites necessary for plasma membrane localization, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref031">31</xref>], a cysteine to alanine mutation was introduced into each of the Rho GTPases. In this assay, an interaction between NoxR and RacA was observed, but not with the other Rho GTPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Interaction assays with BemA, another component of the Nox complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), and 7 Rho GTPases showed binding between BemA and Cdc42, a Rho GTPase very closely related to RacA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Further interaction assays for truncated BemA derivatives with Cdc42 showed that Cdc42 interacts with a domain between the second SH3 and the PX domain of BemA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006840.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). Further interaction assays of RacA, Cdc42, and Nox components confirmed that NoxR, BemA and Cdc24 can interact with each other as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref018">18</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006840.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), and RacA and Cdc42 specifically interact with NoxR and BemA, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006840.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate the interactions of BemA, NoxR, RacA and Cdc42 in hyphae of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic>, we fused the sequences of the N- or C-terminal portions of GFP (nGFP or cGFP) to the genes coding for these proteins, and then assessed their interactions in hyphal cells by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref032">32</xref>].

<p>By introducing a single amino acid substitution, constitutive-active (CA, GTP bound form) and -negative (CN, GDP bound form) forms of Rho GTPase can be produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref033">33</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Using CA and CN forms of RacA and Cdc42, interactions with NoxR and BemA were assessed by the yeast two hybrid assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Interactions between CA-RacA and NoxR, or CA-Cdc42 and BemA were detected, whereas the CN form of RacA and Cdc42 did not bind with NoxR and BemA respectively, indicating that only active Rho GTPases can interact with their effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Relatively weak binding between CA-RacA and BemA was also detected. CA or CN forms of RacA and Cdc42 were labeled with GFP and expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> under the control of a constitutive Tef promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref034">34</xref>]. The CA form, but not the CN form, of RacA and Cdc42 localized at hyphal tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). The vacuolar membrane was also labeled by GFP-CA-RacA and GFP-CA-Cdc42. Expression of both CA-RacA or CA-Cdc42 caused irregular swelling of hyphae near the hyphal septa, indicating that active RacA and Cdc42 share similar hyphal morphology functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Expression of CA-RacA or CA-Cdc42 also caused swelling of hyphae in <italic>noxR</italic> or <italic>bemA</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006840.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), indicating that induction of hyphal swelling by expression of CA-RacA or CA-Cdc42 is independent of NoxR and BemA. Hyphae expressing GFP-CN-RacA and GFP-CN-Cdc42 had a dispersed punctate pattern of fluorescence in hyphal cells, but there was no obvious effect on hyphal growth and morphology by the expression of these forms of the GTPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>

<title>Overlapping and contrasting phenotypes of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae racA</italic> and <italic>cdc42</italic> mutants on morphology and polarized growth of hyphae in axenic culture</title>
<p>To investigate the roles of Cdc42 and RacA in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> mycelial growth, as well as symbiotic infection and ROS production, a <italic>cdc42</italic> replacement construct, pNPP50 was prepared, and recombined into the genome of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> strain Fl1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006840.s004">S4A Fig</xref>).

<p>While mutation of <italic>racA</italic> causes a significant increase of aerial hyphae and reduced radial growth in axenic culture (as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref017">17</xref>]), the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant had only a slight decrease in radial growth and a slight increase in aerial hyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). Microscopic analysis revealed that the <italic>racA</italic> mutant had a significant increase in hyphal septation compared with wild type, while the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant showed a slight increase of septal formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).

<p>There were some morphological phenotypes specific to either the <italic>racA</italic> or <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant.

The amount of hyphal branching was increased in the <italic>racA</italic> mutant, but not significantly affected in the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Wild type <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> grown on water agar frequently undergoes hyphal cell-cell fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref013">13</xref>].

Since the regulation of the cytoskeleton is a common function of Rho-type small GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref035">35</xref>], the distribution of actin was monitored in wild type and mutant strains by expression of LifeAct-GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref036">36</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006840.s007">S7 Fig</xref>).

Previously, localized production of ROS at hyphal tips of the endophyte was detected by NBT staining in axenic culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref016">16</xref>]. By counting NBT-stained hyphal tips, production of ROS at hyphal tips was compared between wild type and mutant strains. While the ratio of NBT-stained hyphal tips was approx. 35% for wild type, the percentage of NBT-stained hyphal tips in the <italic>racA</italic> mutant was just 9% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), a result consistent with the reduced production of ROS in the <italic>racA</italic> mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref017">17</xref>]. In contrast, over 60% of hyphal tips in the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant were stained by NBT, indicating that deletion of <italic>cdc42</italic> enhances ROS production. To confirm the effects of <italic>racA</italic> and <italic>cdc42</italic> KO on ROS production, we performed luminol-mediated assays to detect ROS production.

<title><italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> Cdc42 is required for <italic>in planta</italic> hyphal growth of the endophyte synchronized with the host plant</title>
<p>To examine the effects of <italic>racA</italic> and <italic>cdc42</italic> KO on the colonization of the host plant, constitutively expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) was introduced into the wild type, <italic>racA</italic> and <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant strains. Perennial ryegrass infected with the <italic>racA</italic> mutant showed the typical stunted phenotype as previously observed with the <italic>racA</italic> mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref017">17</xref>], whereas inoculation with wild type and <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant caused no obvious growth phenotype in the host plant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006840.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Hyphal growth in these associations was examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Hyphae of the wild type strain expressing GFP were mainly orientated parallel to the longitudinal axis of leaf tissues, with occasional hyphal branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Hyphal growth of the <italic>racA</italic> mutant <italic>in planta</italic> showed a relatively unregulated pattern with hyphae distributed throughout the leaf from the pseudostem to the upper regions of the leaf blade, as found for wild type, but the pattern of growth was significantly altered. In contrast to wild type, hyphae of the <italic>racA</italic> mutant were frequently branched, were convoluted and unable to fuse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). In contrast, hyphae of the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant were observed only in the pseudostem and the lower part of the leaf blade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Although the growth pattern of the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant in the pseudostem was similar to that of the wild type strain, the biomass of the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant hyphae was relatively low. In the lower part of the leaf blade, hyphae of <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant were fragmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). In the meristematic tissue of host plants, the degree of hyphal colonization for wild type, <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant and <italic>racA</italic> mutant was comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). In younger tillers of the host plant, hyphae of the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant were detected in the upper, central and lower parts of the leaf blades as well as in the pseudostems, though occasional fragmentation of hyphae was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Given that vegetative hyphae of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> are proposed to extend by intercalary growth in the host leaf tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g001">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref011">11</xref>], fragmentation of the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant hyphae in older leaves may indicate that Cdc42 is required for endophyte-specific intercalary hyphal growth during the extension of host leaves. Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed that the biomass of the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant is significantly reduced in pseudostem and the lower part of leaf blades compared with that of wild-type, with no infection detected in the central and upper parts of the host plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), as was expected from the observed colonization phenotype. Unexpectedly, the overall biomass of the <italic>racA</italic> mutant was reduced compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), possibly because of an uneven distribution of the <italic>racA</italic> mutant in host tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Together, these results show that Cdc42 is required for systemic infection of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> within the growing host plant.</p>

<title>Identification of amino acids essential for specific interactions between Cdc42 and BemA or RacA and NoxR</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanisms that determine the distinct roles of RacA and Cdc42, we set out to identify amino acid residues essential for the binding of these small GTPases to Nox components. The 3D structures of RacA and Cdc42 are predicted to be very similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006840.s010">S10 Fig</xref>), as they contain the same set of conserved domains for functions of small GTPases. These conserved domains include the GTP-binding and hydrolysis domains (G1-G5), as well as a C-terminal CaaX motif (a, any aliphatic amino acid), which is predicted to allow association with the plasma membrane after geranylgeranylation of the cysteine residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g009">Fig 9</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref039">39</xref>]. A multiple sequence alignment of Cdc42 and RacA from 15 fungal species showed that there were 17 conserved amino acids in each of the proteins that distinguished Cdc42 from RacA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006840.s011">S11 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). To identify amino acids essential for specific interactions between Cdc42 and BemA or RacA and NoxR, yeast two-hybrid assays were carried out using various chimeric Cdc42 and RacA proteins. Cdc42 and RacA were divided into 3 portions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g009">Fig 9A</xref>, demarcated by 1 and 2), and chimeric genes with different combinations thereof were cloned into the bait vector pGBKT7. These chimeric genes were named, following a simple system which reflects the order of the constituent portions. For example, the name CRC defines the chimeric gene with an N-terminal fragment from Cdc42, a central portion from RacA and a C-terminal portion from Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). Interactions of NoxR with RCC, but not with CRC and CCR, were detected, indicating that the N-terminal portion of RacA is required for interaction with NoxR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). Similarly, BemA interacted with CRR, but not with RCR or RRC, indicating that the N-terminal portion of Cdc42 is required for interaction with BemA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). Given that 8 of the 17 conserved amino acid residues that distinguish RacA from Cdc42 were found in the N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g009">Fig 9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006840.s011">S11 Fig</xref>), RacA or Cdc42 derivatives with substitutions in these 8 amino acids were generated for further analysis. A mutated RacA with the first conserved amino acid substituted with the corresponding amino acid of Cdc42 was named RacA-C1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). Interaction assays of 8 mutated RacA derivatives with NoxR revealed that RacA-C1 (RacA A32K) and -C2 (RacA G35S), but not RacA-C3, -C4, -C5, -C6, -C7 and -C8, lost binding with NoxR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006840.s012">S12A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). Moreover, Cdc42-R12 (Cdc42 K30A, S33G) can interact with NoxR, which indicates that alanine 32 and glycine 35 in RacA are necessary and sufficient for interaction of RacA/Cdc42 with NoxR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). Interaction assays of 8 mutated Cdc42 derivatives with BemA revealed that only Cdc42-R8 (Cdc42 F59W), but no other Cdc42 point mutations, lost the ability to bind to BemA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006840.s010">S10B Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g009">Fig 9C</xref>), which indicates that the phenylalanine 59 is essential for interaction of Cdc42 with BemA. Interaction of RacA-C8 (W61F) with BemA did occur, although weaker than the interaction between wild type Cdc42 and BemA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). A series of interaction assays with various mutated RacA revealed that the valine 45 and isoleucine 49 in Cdc42 are also involved in the interaction between Cdc42 and BemA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g009">Fig 9C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006840.s012">S12B Fig</xref>).

Expression of Cdc42-R8 partially restored the colony growth defect of the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant, whereas colony growth of <italic>cdc42</italic>/RacA-C458 was comparable to the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g011">Fig 11B</xref>), which indicates that binding of Cdc42 to BemA is not important for the cell wall integrity function of Cdc42. Perennial ryegrass was inoculated with <italic>cdc42</italic>/Cdc42-R8 or <italic>cdc42</italic>/RacA-C458 to examine the importance of BemA-binding for the function of Cdc42 in symbiotic infection.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A large number of microbes can asymptomatically colonize the inside of plant tissues, but the mechanisms underlying the establishment of these symptomless infections are largely unknown. Key requirements for symptomless colonization by endophytic microbes must be; first, suppression or evasion of potential plant defense responses; and second, strict control of biomass and growth pattern in the host plant. In this study, we report that two highly homologous Rho GTPases, Cdc42 and RacA, have distinctive roles in hyphal growth of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> in its grass host. RacA is required for maintaining a normal pattern of growth <italic>in planta</italic>, including growth parallel to the leaf axis of host tillers and formation of hyphal network via cell-cell fusion.

<title>Strict control of hyphal growth regulated by small GTPases is required for symbiotic infection of endophyte in grass plants</title>
<p>In the interaction between perennial ryegrass and wild type <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic>, the majority of endophytic hyphae grow parallel to the growing axis of the host plant, with occasional branching and cell fusion to establish a network-like pattern of hyphae in the leaf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g012">Fig 12A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref014">14</xref>]. In the leaves, hyphae of wild type endophytes grow in the intercellular spaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref015">15</xref>], and branched hyphae also tend to grow between the short sides of host cells. In contrast, the growth pattern of the <italic>racA</italic> mutant is clearly abnormal, including frequent branching and convolution of hyphae. Hyphae of some cell fusion mutants (e.g. <italic>noxA</italic>, <italic>noxR</italic> and <italic>proA</italic> mutants) were more abundant in the intercellular space than the wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref020">20</xref>]. Infection of the <italic>noxA</italic> mutant resulted in enhanced expression of host defense genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref015">15</xref>]. Abnormal blebbing of the plant plasma membrane, adjacent to the multiple hyphae found in <italic>noxR</italic> mutant associations was frequently observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref016">16</xref>]. Observations such as these, indicate that unregulated growth of the cell fusion mutants in host plants may enhance plant stress responses, which is likely to be a cause of plant stunting. Thus, strict control of the growth pattern in the host plants is a key requirement for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> to maintain a mutualistic interaction with the host.</p>
<p>While infection of ryegrass plants with the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant caused no obvious host interaction phenotype, fragmentation of <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant hyphae was often observed in the lower parts of leaf tissues from the mature host plant, and colonization of the upper regions of mature leaf blades was rarely detected. In the smaller emerging leaves, systemic infection with the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant was observed, suggesting that fragmentation of <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant hyphae may be caused as a result of host elongation. The growth rate of tillers of perennial ryegrass is approx. 1 cm/day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref011">11</xref>], whereas the growth of wild type <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> strain Fl1 on PDA is approx. 3 mm/day. It thus follows, that the growth rate of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> would have to be at least 3 times faster in host plants than in culture. It is proposed that hyphal cells of the endophyte are attached to plant cells by an extracellular matrix, and extend by intercalary growth <italic>in planta</italic>, rather than tip growth, the commonly observed pattern of growth for filamentous fungi growing in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref011">11</xref>]. This mode of hyphal growth enables the endophyte to sustain the systemic infection in a fast-growing host plant. Examples of intercalary hyphal growth were reported in a wide range of fungal systems such as mushroom stipes, rhizomorphs, lichen thalli, asci and water mould hyphae [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref041">41</xref>], but the mechanisms for intercalary hyphal growth are mostly unknown. Hyphal fragmentation of the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant in the host plant suggests that Cdc42 is essential for intercalary hyphal growth. One of the known functions of Cdc42 is the regulation of intracellular vesicle transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref026">26</xref>]. In particular, Cdc42 controls the transport of vesicles near the site of the growing hyphal surface, by regulating the reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Therefore, Cdc42 may be involved in the transport of vesicles to the internal hyphal cells during intercalary extension of the hyphae in the host plant. During systemic infection, the phenotype of <italic>cdc42</italic> mutants could be partially recovered by the NoxR-binding form of Cdc42, as well as the BemA-binding form of RacA and even by additional expression of wild type RacA, which demonstrates that control of intercalary hyphal growth appears to be a common function among Cdc42 and RacA. However, the results suggest that Cdc42 plays the major role, since fragmentation of hyphae in the host plant is seldom observed for the <italic>racA</italic> mutant.</p>

<title>Roles of RacA and Cdc42 in ROS production in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic></title>
<p>While production of ROS was reduced in <italic>racA</italic> mutants, <italic>cdc42</italic> mutants had increased ROS production, which suggests that at least in culture, these Rho GTPases have opposite roles in the regulation of ROS production. In mammals, Rac is an essential positive regulator of Nox-mediated ROS production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref042">42</xref>]. Cdc42 acts as a negative regulator of ROS production both in cell-free systems, as well as in Nox-expressing mammalian cell lines. Mammalian Cdc42 cannot activate Nox, but can bind to flavocytochrome <italic>b</italic>558 (composed of Nox2/p91<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup> and p22<sup><italic>phox</italic></sup>) by an insertion domain similar to Rac, suggesting that Cdc42 may act as a negative regulator to maintain a low level of Nox activation by competing with Rac for binding with flavocytochrome <italic>b</italic>558 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref043">43</xref>]. Likewise, <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> Cdc42 may compete with RacA for binding with the Nox complex composed of NoxA and Pro41 and/or NoxB and Pls1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref046">46</xref>]. Alternatively, Cdc42 and RacA could compete for the common activator of these small GTPases, which is Cdc24. Cdc24 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) which is known to activate both Cdc42 and RacA in various filamentous fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref048">48</xref>]. Therefore, loss of Cdc42 may enhance Cdc24 activation of RacA, leading to enhanced production of ROS in the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant background.</p>

<title>Distinctive and overlapping functions of Cdc42 and RacA in hyphal growth</title>
<p>The <italic>racA</italic> mutant demonstrated a severe growth defect in culture, including convoluted hyphae, as well as increased branching and septation. Although growth of the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant on nutrient rich PDA was almost like wild type, irregular hyphal growth was also observed for <italic>cdc42</italic> mutants on nutrient poor water agar, suggesting that both RacA and Cdc42 are involved in the maintenance of hyphal polarity. Double knockout mutants of <italic>racA</italic> and <italic>cdc42</italic>, or knockout mutants of <italic>cdc24</italic> alone (probable common GEF for RacA and Cdc42) have never been isolated for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref018">18</xref>] and this study). Consistently, <italic>cdc24</italic> mutants or <italic>cdc42/racA</italic> double mutants are lethal in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>crassa</italic>, <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>nidulans</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref050">50</xref>], indicating that Cdc42 and RacA have overlapping function(s) essential for the viability (i.e. hyphal growth) of these fungi.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the width of hyphae was wider for the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae racA</italic> mutant and thinner for <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant compared to wild type, suggesting that RacA and Cdc42 have distinct roles in hyphal growth. Distribution of actin patches was affected by a knockout of <italic>racA</italic> and <italic>cdc42</italic>. Actin patches, which are intracellular vesicles surrounded by F-actin, are considered to mediate endocytosis in fungal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref051">51</xref>]. The altered distribution of actin patches in <italic>cdc42</italic> and <italic>racA</italic>, suggests there is a change of active vesicle trafficking near growing hyphal tips, which may affect the hyphal diameters of the mutants. Introduction of RacA-C12 (no binding with NoxR) into the <italic>racA</italic> mutant complemented the growth defect, which in turn suggests that RacA has another partner molecule, besides NoxR, for establishment of polarized hyphal growth. In contrast, RacA-C458 (BemA binding form), but not Cdc42-R8 (no binding with BemA), restored the hyphal growth defects of the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant, indicating that binding to BemA is essential and sufficient for the regulation of hyphal polarity by Cdc42/RacA in culture.</p>
<p>As previously indicated by Harris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref027">27</xref>], the contribution of RacA and Cdc42 to hyphal morphology is diverse among fungal species. Given that either <italic>racA</italic> or the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant showed increased branching and convoluted hyphal growth in a number of species ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref050">50</xref>] and this study), a shared function for RacA and Cdc42 is maintenance of hyphal polarized growth, in which both RacA and Cdc42 probably share common downstream effector(s). In contrast, it has been reported that <italic>N</italic>. <italic>crassa</italic> CDC-42 and RAC-1 have opposite roles in negative and positive chemotropism of conidial protrusions, namely germ tubes and conidial anastomosis tubes, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref052">52</xref>]. Endophyte Cdc42 and RacA have opposite roles in the regulation of ROS production. Such distinctive roles of Cdc42 and Rac could be determined by their interaction with specific downstream effectors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec017">
<title>Functional differentiation between Cdc42 and RacA is partly determined by specific binding with components of the Nox complex</title>
<p>In this study, amino acid residues essential for specific binding of RacA to NoxR and Cdc42 to BemA were identified. Based on the predicted structure of both small GTPases, the binding site of RacA to NoxR locates to the exposed loop between the first helix and the second strand just in front of switch I, while the binding site of Cdc42 to BemA is located inside of switch II (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006840.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Exchange of the GDP- to GTP-bound form induces a conformational change of switch I and II from being more flexible to becoming more ordered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref028">28</xref>]. As the CA (GTP-bound)-form of RacA and Cdc42 localize to the hyphal tip and intracellular (vacuolar) membrane, binding of GTP to the small GTPases is probably essential for enhancing their interactions with NoxR and BemA, and other partner components at intracellular membranes.</p>
<p>Dissecting the roles of the multifunctional factors with several partner components, like RacA and Cdc42, is particularly difficult as a simple KO of the target genes causes complex phenotypes which result from consequential effects on many downstream factors. Domain swaps and amino acid substitutions were generated that enable Cdc42 to bind to NoxR and RacA to bind to BemA, allowing us to analyze the importance of their specific interactions. From our results, there are two outcomes when the NoxR-binding form of Cdc42 is introduced into the <italic>racA</italic> mutant: 1) No detectable recovery of the defect is observed in the <italic>racA</italic> mutant (e.g. polarized hyphal growth), or 2) The Phenotype of <italic>racA</italic> mutant is restored to wild type (e.g. hyphal fusion, symbiotic infection). The explanations for these outcomes are: 1) RacA has another partner protein besides NoxR, to regulate the function or 2) NoxR is the essential and sufficient downstream regulator for the function. Similarly, there are three observed outcomes for complementation of the <italic>cdc42</italic> mutant with the BemA-binding form of RacA; 1) No detectable recovery of the defect (e.g. colony growth), 2) phenotype is recovered, resembling the wild type (i.e. polarized hyphal growth) or 3) The phenotype is partially recovered and similar to wild type (intercalary hyphal growth <italic>in planta</italic>). These outcomes are explained with: 1) Cdc42 has another partner molecule to regulate the function, 2) BemA is the essential and sufficient downstream regulator of Cdc42 function, and 3) Both Cdc42 and RacA are co-regulators of the function. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006840.g012">Fig 12B</xref> summarizes the distinct and overlapping functions of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>festucae</italic> RacA and Cdc42. The importance of small GTPase partner proteins (i.e. NoxR and BemA) for each function can be determined by the approach used in this study, but it should be taken into account that the introduced mutation may affect the interaction of these small GTPases with other, unidentified downstream components. Determining possible effects on downstream components requires further investigation.</p>
<p>The small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac are highly conserved in eukaryotes. The core downstream effectors for Cdc42 and Rac in mammals can be categorized into three distinct classes, namely protein kinases (e.g. PAKs and MEKK), actin binding proteins (i.e. WASPs, WAVEs and IQGAPs), and lipid modifying enzymes (e.g. PI3K, PLC and PLD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref053">53</xref>]. Homologues of these effectors can be identified in fungal genomes, thus some of them represent potential downstream effectors of fungal Cdc42 and Rac. Many of these downstream effectors interact with and are co-regulated by both Cdc42 and RacA via binding to the CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref054">54</xref>], which can be found in Cdc42/Rac binding proteins in fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref052">52</xref>]. There are also several mammalian downstream effectors, which specifically bind to either Rac (e.g. PIP5 Kinase, p67<sup>phox</sup>) or Cdc42 (e.g. MRC Kinase, DRF3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006840.ref053">53</xref>], but most fungal homologues of such Rac- and/or Cdc42-interacting factors have not been extensively analyzed.</p>
<p>The multi-functional nature of fungal Cdc42 and RacA, which is presumably caused by the sharing of multiple downstream effectors, requires further analysis, as an understanding of this functional network may elucidate how the activation of various cellular events are activated in a controlled fashion.</p>
