<abstract>
<p>Gammaherpesvirus (GHV) pathogenesis is a complex process that involves productive viral replication, dissemination to tissues that harbor lifelong latent infection, and reactivation from latency back into a productive replication cycle. Traditional loss-of-function mutagenesis approaches in mice using murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), a model that allows for examination of GHV pathogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>, have been invaluable for defining requirements for specific viral gene products in GHV infection. But these approaches are insufficient to fully reveal how viral gene products contribute when the encoded protein facilitates multiple processes in the infectious cycle and when these functions vary over time and from one host tissue to another. To address this complexity, we developed an MHV68 genetic platform that enables cell-type-specific and inducible viral gene deletion <italic>in vivo</italic>. We employed this system to re-evaluate functions of the MHV68 latency-associated nuclear antigen (mLANA), a protein with roles in both viral replication and latency. Cre-mediated deletion in mice of <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked <italic>ORF73</italic> demonstrated the necessity of mLANA in B cells for MHV68 latency establishment. Impaired latency during the transition from draining lymph nodes to blood following mLANA deletion also was observed, supporting the hypothesis that B cells are a major conduit for viral dissemination. Ablation of mLANA in infected germinal center (GC) B cells severely impaired viral latency, indicating the importance of viral passage through the GC for latency establishment. Finally, induced ablation of mLANA during latency resulted in complete loss of affected viral genomes, indicating that mLANA is critically important for maintenance of viral genomes during stable latency. Collectively, these experiments provide new insights into LANA homolog functions in GHV colonization of the host and highlight the potential of a new MHV68 genetic platform to foster a more complete understanding of viral gene functions at discrete stages of GHV pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Gammaherpesviruses (GHVs), including the human pathogens Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, establish lifelong infections that can lead to cancer. Defining the functions of viral gene products in acute replication and chronic infection is important for understanding how these viruses cause disease. Infection of mice with the related GHV, murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), provides a tractable small animal model for defining how viral gene products function in chronic infection and understanding how host factors limit disease. Here we describe the development of a new viral genetic platform that enables the targeted deletion of specific genes from the viral genome in discrete host cells or at distinct times during infection. We utilize this system to better define requirements for the conserved latency-associated nuclear antigen in MHV68 lytic replication and latency in mice. This work highlights the utility of this MHV68 genetic platform for defining mechanisms of GHV infection and disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gammaherpesviruses (GHVs) are large, enveloped, double-strand DNA viruses that include the human pathogens Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). GHVs establish lifelong, chronic infections in their hosts and are responsible for causing lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref001">1</xref>]. Like other herpesvirus subfamilies, infections by GHVs are characterized by two distinct stages: the productive or lytic replication cycle and latency. The lytic phase of infection involves expression of all kinetic classes (immediate-early, early, and late) of viral genes, production of infectious progeny, and viral dissemination, provoking inflammation and a potent antiviral immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref004">4</xref>]. In contrast, latency is characterized by the absence of readily detectable infectious virion production and minimal viral gene expression, allowing infected cells to evade the immune system. Establishment and maintenance of latency enables GHVs to persist indefinitely within the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref004">4</xref>]. Given a proper stimulus, latent GHVs can undergo reactivation, a re-entry into the lytic cycle, which likely serves as a mechanism for re-seeding latent reservoirs and infecting new hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref004">4</xref>]. Understanding the intricacies of GHV infection is imperative to deciphering the mechanisms that drive GHV disease.</p>
<p>Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) is a rodent GHV that is genetically and phenotypically related to EBV and KSHV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref004">4</xref>]. MHV68 replicates efficiently in cell culture and readily infects and establishes latency in inbred and outbred strains of mice. MHV68 tropism for cells in the infected animal, such as B cells during latency, is similar to human GHVs. Since both the virus and host are amenable to targeted genetic manipulation, MHV68 infection of mice provides a versatile small animal model for studying the functions of viral gene products in GHV infection and for defining host responses to infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Though the sequence of events is not completely defined, MHV68 is thought to follow a complex route of dissemination in order to colonize a host. Acute replication in airway alveolar epithelial cells is thought to seed CD11c<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells, which traffic virus from the primary site of infection to draining lymph nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref005">5</xref>]. Studies in which the MHV68 non-coding RNA TMER4 was disrupted suggest that trafficking from draining lymph nodes to the spleen occurs hematogenously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref006">6</xref>]. Although latency is established in splenic macrophages after IP inoculation of B cell-deficient MuMT mice, latency is not established in the spleens of these mice after IN inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref008">8</xref>]. Given that adoptive transfer of B cells into MuMT mice overcomes this defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref009">9</xref>], B cells appear to be required for establishment of splenic latency following IN inoculation and one model posits that B cells facilitate viral transit from draining LNs to the spleen via the blood. However, this has not been directly demonstrated. Considerably less is known about specific viral determinants that control viral mobility and tropism across different tissues during infection. One viral gene that potentially facilitates dissemination is the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA).</p>
<p>LANA is a conserved protein encoded by the <italic>ORF73</italic> gene in members of the <italic>Rhadinovirus</italic> genus of GHVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref011">11</xref>]. LANA is expressed as an immediate-early gene product during the lytic phase of infection and is also one of the few viral genes expressed during latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref015">15</xref>]. Numerous functions are described for LANA homologs in tissue culture systems, including transcriptional regulation of viral and host genes, inhibition of tumor suppressors and cell-cycle dysregulation, regulation of viral DNA replication during latency, and maintenance of the latent viral episome for long-term persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref016">16</xref>]. Studies using an mLANA-null MHV68 (73.STOP) defined functions for LANA <italic>in vivo</italic> in promoting efficient acute replication, establishment of latency, and reactivation from latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref023">23</xref>]. However, an inherent problem with this approach is that the absence of mLANA at early stages of infection may indirectly influence phenotypes observed at subsequent stages. For example, productive replication of mLANA-null MHV68 in the lungs of mice is significantly impaired, which may reduce the number of virus-seeded B cells capable of trafficking to the spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref019">19</xref>]. Consequently, this may indirectly reduce the number of latently infected splenocytes and thereby obfuscate identification of the function of mLANA in facilitating splenic latency.</p>
<p>To address this limitation of prior studies, we have developed a genetic platform that enables dissection of mLANA functions at discrete steps in the MHV68 infectious cycle. We engineered a recombinant MHV68 that contains <italic>loxP</italic> sites flanking <italic>ORF73</italic> (O73.loxP MHV68) to enable cell-type specific and inducible ablation of mLANA. We use this system to define requirements for mLANA in B cells, and in particular germinal center B cells, in colonization of the host by MHV68. We further test, by inducible deletion <italic>after</italic> the establishment of latency, the requirement of mLANA for maintenance of viral genomes during chronic MHV68 infection. Through these studies we delineate cell-type specific and temporal functions of mLANA in the establishment and maintenance of MHV68 latency and establish a more nuanced virus-host genetic approach to more precisely understand chronic GHV infection.</p>

<title>Development and validation of a genetic platform for conditional viral gene deletion</title>
<p>LANA homologs are multi-functional proteins that play roles in lytic replication, latency, and reactivation from latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref024">24</xref>]. In order to define roles for MHV68 LANA at discrete steps in the infection cycle, we developed a genetic platform to enable inducible deletion of viral genes <italic>in vivo</italic> in infected cells that express Cre recombinase. We first generated a new MHV68 BAC (termed FRT BAC) in which the <italic>loxP</italic> sites that flank the non-viral BAC vector sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref025">25</xref>] were replaced with <italic>FRT</italic> sites (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006865.s002">S1 Fig</xref></bold>). This allowed us to make use of <italic>loxP</italic> sequences elsewhere in the viral genome while preserving the ability to excise the non-viral BAC vector sequences using Flp recombinase (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006865.s003">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). MHV68 produced using the newly derived BAC exhibits WT levels of acute replication, latency establishment, and reactivation from latency when compared directly to virus derived from the original MHV68 BAC (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006865.s004">S3 Fig</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To enable conditional deletion of the mLANA-encoding <italic>ORF73</italic> gene, we made an MHV68 recombinant in which <italic>loxP</italic> sites were inserted flanking <italic>ORF73</italic> (O73.loxP MHV68, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). For comparative purposes, we also re-derived the previously characterized mLANA-null MHV68 [73.STOP, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref019">19</xref>]] in the newly generated FRT BAC. O73.loxP MHV68 replicated equivalently to WT MHV68 in tissue culture in both low- and high-MOI growth analyses (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>). To verify that the <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked (floxed) <italic>ORF73</italic> gene could be deleted from O73.loxP MHV68, we infected Cre-ERT2 3T3 fibroblasts, cells that constitutively express Cre recombinase fused to a modified estrogen receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref026">26</xref>], with WT MHV68, 73.STOP, or O73.loxP and then evaluated several MHV68 genomic loci by PCR. Though the <italic>ORF73</italic> locus was predominately intact in O73.loxP-infected cells treated with vehicle, only the <italic>ORF73</italic> deletion product was detected following activation of Cre by treatment of the cells with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g001">Fig 1C</xref></bold>). The spurious deletion observed in untreated cells is most likely the result of “leaky” Cre activity or homologous recombination between <italic>loxP</italic> sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref005">5</xref>]. <italic>ORF73</italic> of WT MHV68 and 73.STOP were unaffected by Cre activity. The adjacent <italic>ORF72</italic> gene and the distal <italic>ORF59</italic> gene were examined by PCR for off-target effects and found to be unaffected in all viruses tested (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006865.s005">S4 Fig</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g001">Fig 1C</xref></bold>, respectively). As expected, deletion of floxed <italic>ORF73</italic> by Cre induction resulted in an absence of detectable <italic>orf73</italic> transcripts in RT-PCR analyses (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006865.s005">S4 Fig</xref></bold>) and mLANA protein in immunoblot analyses (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g001">Fig 1D</xref></bold>). Importantly, mLANA was readily detected in vehicle-treated cells, demonstrating that the presence of <italic>loxP</italic> sites did not prevent mLANA expression. As with PCR analyses, non-target viral protein expression by O73.loxP remained unaffected by Cre induction. Importantly, transcription of the adjacent <italic>M11</italic> gene was not affected by <italic>loxP</italic> insertion at the 3’ end of <italic>ORF73</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006865.s005">S4 Fig</xref></bold>). These results confirm that Cre recombinase targeted to the <italic>ORF73</italic> locus efficiently deleted <italic>ORF73</italic> resulting in loss of mLANA production.</p>

<p>Given the critical role of mLANA in MHV68 chronic infection in mice, we tested the possibility that insertion of <italic>loxP</italic> sites flanking <italic>ORF73</italic> would subtly disrupt mLANA function and attenuate O73.loxP <italic>in vivo</italic>. To test for such a possibility, we evaluated mice at various stages of infection following inoculation with O73.loxP compared to WT MHV68 and mLANA-null 73.STOP control viruses. With respect to acute replication, seven days after IN inoculation of WT C57BL/6 mice mean titers of WT and O73.loxP MHV68 in lungs were similar (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>), while 73.STOP titers were modestly attenuated relative to WT MHV68, which is consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref019">19</xref>]. Latency establishment by O73.loxP also was equivalent to WT MHV68 16–18 days after IN inoculation of WT mice; as expected, 73.STOP was minimally detected (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006865.t001">Table 1</xref></bold>). Equivalent frequencies of WT MHV68 and O73.loxP genome-positive cells were detected in splenocytes following IP inoculation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>), which is a more permissive route of infection that presumably allows the virus direct access to target cells for latency in the spleen. 73.STOP was detected at a ca. 50-fold reduced level (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>), consistent with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref021">21</xref>]. The efficiency of O73.loxP reactivation from spleens, measured using an explant cytopathic effect assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref027">27</xref>], was impaired relative to WT virus following IN inoculation of WT mice (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006865.t002">Table 2</xref></bold>), but a defect was not observed following IP infection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g003">Fig 3D</xref></bold>). As expected, O73.STOP was undetected in both assays. Since mLANA is necessary for latency establishment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref019">19</xref>], these findings indicate that mLANA function is not impaired by the presence of <italic>loxP</italic> sites flanking <italic>ORF73</italic> in the MHV68 genome. Because mLANA also is necessary for MHV68 reactivation from the spleen following IP inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref021">21</xref>], these data also demonstrate that O73.loxP is not generally impaired for reactivation. However, the partial impairment of O73.loxP in reactivation from the spleen following IN inoculation suggests the possibility that homologous recombination between <italic>loxP</italic> sites may have occurred during latency establishment, or perhaps <italic>ex vivo</italic> during reactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref005">5</xref>]. Together these findings indicate that the presence of <italic>loxP</italic> sites flanking <italic>ORF73</italic> in O73.loxP does not impair MHV68 latency establishment or reactivation from the spleen following direct IP inoculation; however, reactivation of O73.loxP from the spleen following IN inoculation should be considered in light of a possible defect.</p>

<title>LANA functions in CD19<sup>+</sup> cells to facilitate MHV68 latency establishment</title>
<p>LANA-null 73.STOP MHV68 is attenuated in acute replication in the lungs and fails to establish latency in spleens of mice after IN inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref019">19</xref>]. RT-PCR analyses and experiments that employed an MHV68 recombinant virus encoding an mLANA-beta lactamase fusion protein to “mark” mLANA-expressing cells indicate that mLANA is expressed in B cells during MHV68 latency establishment and maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref015">15</xref>]. However, whether mLANA functions in B cells to facilitate MHV68 lytic replication or latency establishment in the spleen after IN inoculation is not known.</p>
<p>To define the relationship between mLANA expression in B cells and acute and latent infection, we evaluated O73.loxP and WT MHV68 infection in mice that express Cre recombinase under the control of the B cell-specific CD19 promoter [CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref028">28</xref>]] allowing deletion of floxed <italic>ORF73</italic> in B cells. Seven days after IN inoculation of CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice, titers of O73.loxP and WT MHV68 were equivalent in lungs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). In contrast, while WT MHV68 established latency in CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup> spleen at a frequency similar to that observed in WT mice (1 in 150 cells viral-genome positive), O73.loxP latency establishment was severely attenuated in the spleen following IN inoculation, with frequencies below the limit of detection of 1 in 10,000 cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). This approximates the latency establishment defect of mLANA-null 73.STOP after IN infection of WT mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). As expected, given the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, O73.loxP reactivation was severely impaired and below the limit of detection of 1 in 100,000 cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g004">Fig 4B</xref></bold>). PCR analyses of the <italic>ORF73</italic> and <italic>ORF59</italic> loci performed on DNA isolated from spleens of infected CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice demonstrated that floxed <italic>ORF73</italic> was deleted <italic>in vivo</italic>, while <italic>ORF59</italic> remained intact (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g004">Fig 4C</xref></bold>). These results indicate that functional deletion <italic>in vivo</italic> of <italic>ORF73</italic> in B cells is critical for latency establishment in the spleen following IN inoculation. Furthermore, the absence of a phenotype during acute infection suggests that mLANA expression in B cells is not a major contributor to acute viral replication in the lung.</p>

<p>After IP inoculation of CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice, O73.loxP MHV68 exhibited reduced latency establishment as measured by viral genome-positive cells in the spleen compared to WT virus, but no defect was observed in peritoneal exudate cells (PECs, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g004">Fig 4D and 4G</xref></bold>). Accordingly, in a non-quantitative analysis of viral gene deletion, detection of <italic>ORF73</italic> by PCR was reduced in DNA isolated from spleens, but not PECs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g004">Fig 4F and 4I</xref></bold>). O73.loxP reactivation was reduced for splenocytes in a manner that correlated directly with latent viral loads, but was not diminished for PECs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g004">Fig 4E and 4H</xref></bold>). These data indicate that deletion of <italic>ORF73</italic> from CD19<sup>+</sup> cells reduces MHV68 latency in the spleen, even after IP inoculation, but has no effect on latency in PECs. The latter interpretation is consistent with macrophages, and not B cells, serving as the primary latency reservoir for MHV68 in the peritoneal cavity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref008">8</xref>]. Together, these results demonstrate that mLANA function in B cells plays a critical role in MHV68 latency establishment, especially following IN inoculation.</p>

<title>mLANA facilitates hematogenous dissemination of MHV68 via B cells</title>
<p>MHV68 disseminates systemically via lymphatic and hematogenous routes after IN inoculation. Viral transit occurs through the stepwise infection of various cell types, including epithelial, myeloid, and lymphoid cells, at different anatomical sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref031">31</xref>]. A working model of MHV68 systemic dissemination is shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g005">Fig 5A</xref></bold>.

Given the cell-type-specific loss-of-function phenotype exhibited by O73.loxP in CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice, we reasoned that these infections could be harnessed to better define B cell roles and restriction points in the process of MHV68 dissemination following IN inoculation.</p>

<p>We therefore evaluated O73.loxP, 73.STOP, and WT MHV68 in kinetic analyses of infection in draining LNs (mediastinal LNs, MLN), blood leukocytes, and spleens following IN inoculation of CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice. In MLNs, all three viruses were detected on day 10 post-infection, with O73.loxP and 73.STOP present at approximately 5-fold lower frequencies than WT MHV68 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g005">Fig 5B</xref></bold>). By day 16 post-infection, the frequencies of cells harboring WT MHV68 or O73.loxP increased to similar levels (1 in 200 and 1 in 800, respectively). mLANA-null 73.STOP was slightly diminished compared to day 10, remaining close to the limit of detection of 1 infected cell in 10,000 total cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g005">Fig 5E</xref></bold>). A minimal amount of preformed infectious virus indicative of ongoing lytic viral replication was present in MLNs of mice day 10 post-infection (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006865.s006">S5 Fig</xref></bold>). It is possible that lytic replication occurring in the MLN contributes to seeding infection in this organ, but it is unlikely that this minimal amount of preformed infectious virus influenced frequency determinations. PCR analyses performed on DNA isolated from infected MLNs demonstrated that <italic>ORF73</italic> was deleted in MLNs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006865.s007">S6 Fig</xref></bold>). Though mLANA is not an absolute requirement for transit from lungs to spleens in severely immunocompromised mice lacking the type I interferon receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref020">20</xref>], the failure of 73.STOP to expand in MLNs demonstrates the importance of mLANA in initial steps of dissemination. By extension, the minimal reduction in MLN latency observed for O73.loxP relative to WT virus, suggests that B cells are not critically involved in viral deposition in the MLN and initial expansion. Alternatively, it is possible that B cells mediate initial latency expansion in MLNs in a manner that is not dependent on mLANA.</p>
<p>In the blood, the number of genome positive cells was generally low for all three viruses on day 10 post-infection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g005">Fig 5C</xref></bold>). Extrapolated frequencies of genome-positive cells of 1 in 16,000 and 1 in 41,000 were determined for WT virus and O73.loxP, respectively, while 73.STOP was not definable. Though the frequency of cells latently-infected with WT MHV68 increased to ca. 1 in 2800 by day 16 post-infection, latency in the blood for O73.loxP and 73.STOP was negligible (&lt; 1 in 100,000 genome-positive cells; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g005">Fig 5F</xref></bold>). Likewise, though WT MHV68 was present in the spleen at an extrapolated frequency of ca. 1 in 15,000 cells on day 10 post-inoculation, O73.loxP and 73.STOP were minimally detected (&lt; 1 in 100,000 and ca. 1 in 81,000 cells, respectively). Since O73.loxP established latency in MLNs but failed to efficiently spread through the blood, these data support a model in which B cells that express mLANA serve as a critical conduit for viral hematogenous dissemination and invasion of the spleen. By extension, these data indicate that MHV68 passage through B cells represents a critical bottleneck to hematogenous viral dissemination.</p>

<title>mLANA is required in AID-expressing splenocytes for MHV68 latency</title>
<p>MHV68 infects and exploits germinal center (GC) B cells to expand the number of latently-infected cells in the spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref035">35</xref>]. In addition, a high percentage of mLANA-expressing splenocytes are GC B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref015">15</xref>], and mLANA stabilizes c-myc, which may facilitate GC responses in infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref036">36</xref>]. LANA homologs facilitate maintenance of the viral episome during cell division, which appears to be a fundamental requirement for establishing and maintaining viral latency during the rapid cellular proliferation that characterizes GC reactions. As a direct test of the need for mLANA in GC reactions as a mechanism to establish latency, we evaluated O73.loxP latency after IN inoculation of AID<sup>cre/+</sup> mice, which encode Cre under control of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) gene promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref037">37</xref>].

<title>Selective deletion of mLANA after latency establishment impairs maintenance of splenic latency</title>
<p>Given that mLANA must be present in B cells for latency establishment following IN inoculation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g003">Fig 3</xref>) and that MHV68 genomes fail to form circular episomes after IP inoculation with 73.STOP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref020">20</xref>], it has not been possible to separate potentially distinct roles for mLANA in latency establishment and long-term maintenance of the viral genome <italic>in vivo</italic>. To test the hypothesis that mLANA is required for latency maintenance <italic>in vivo</italic>, we intranasally inoculated Cre-ERT2 transgenic mice, which encode a tamoxifen-inducible Cre gene in all tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref026">26</xref>], with O73.loxP. WT MHV68 and WT mice that do not encode Cre-ERT2 were infected as controls and to detect potential effects on latency resulting from tamoxifen treatment. Beginning on day 23 post-infection, after latency had been established in the spleen, tamoxifen was administered for five consecutive days to induce Cre activity and the resultant deletion of floxed <italic>ORF73</italic>. The schematic in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006865.g007">Fig 7A</xref></bold> outlines the timeline followed for this experiment. Two weeks after completing tamoxifen treatments (day 42 post-infection), spleens were harvested and the frequencies of latently infected cells were quantified by LD-PCR. For these analyses we used two different primer sets: one that amplifies <italic>ORF50</italic>, which should not be affected by <italic>ORF73</italic> deletion, and another that spans the 5’ end of <italic>ORF73</italic>, the 5’ loxP site, and adjacent sequence upstream of <italic>ORF73</italic>. This amplicon should be absent upon <italic>ORF73</italic> deletion, enabling a direct evaluation of cells that retain viral genomes (<italic>ORF50</italic><sup>+</sup>) despite loss of mLANA-encoding <italic>ORF73</italic>. Validation experiments in cultured cells confirmed that <italic>ORF50</italic>- and <italic>ORF73</italic>-specific primers were equally sensitive for detecting viral genomes and that <italic>ORF73</italic> primers did not amplify, while <italic>ORF50</italic> primers did amplify, a product upon <italic>ORF73</italic> deletion by Cre (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006865.s008">S7 Fig</xref></bold>).</p>

This system differs from traditional viral mutagenesis approaches in that it allows for cell-type specific and inducible deletion of a gene of interest rather than complete ablation. Since mLANA is a multifunctional viral protein that facilitates both lytic replication and latency establishment, we utilized this new reagent to better define mLANA’s functions in specific cell types and at certain stages of viral infection.</p>

<title>Experimental considerations</title>
<p>There are potential caveats to Cre-lox approaches to control the timing of viral gene deletion. Insertion of <italic>loxP</italic> sites within a viral genome may inadvertently impact transcription efficiency, impact splicing, or directly alter the function of overlapping noncoding RNAs. With regard to O73.loxP, the <italic>loxP</italic> sites flanking <italic>ORF73</italic> did not overtly influence viral replication or latency establishment in mice lacking Cre. Given the potent attenuation of mLANA-null and other <italic>ORF73</italic>-mutant viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref021">21</xref>], this shows that the <italic>loxP</italic> insertions did not disrupt mLANA expression. Although viral reactivation efficiency after IN inoculation was reduced for O73.loxP, reactivation occurred normally after IP inoculation. Given the necessity for mLANA in reactivation after IP infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref021">21</xref>], this indicates that mLANA in O73.loxP is capable of normal function during reactivation. In light of findings by Stevenson and colleagues indicating that homologous recombination between <italic>loxP</italic> sites within the MHV68 genome is possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref005">5</xref>], we reason that a similar phenomenon may be at work in our experiments following IN inoculation and after viral dissemination to the spleen.</p>
<p>Although it appears from our data that Cre-mediated excision of floxed viral genes is very efficient for cell-type-specific Cre expression, it remains possible that not every Cre-encoding cell will delete the targeted locus. And, while viral genomes were reduced in mice following tamoxifen induction of Cre, a proportion of cells infected with O73.loxP did not delete <italic>ORF73</italic>. Whether this represents an issue specifically in B cells, difficulty in targeting viral genomes that are potentially epigenetically modified, or an intrinsic inefficiency in the inducible Cre mice is not yet clear. Nonetheless, the dramatic phenotypes observed in our studies demonstrate the utility of this approach to better define the necessity of specific viral genes in a time- and tissue-specific fashion in a small animal model of GHV pathogenesis.</p>

<title>Functions of mLANA in latency establishment and maintenance</title>
<p>Previous studies using traditional mutagenesis approaches demonstrated that both the absence of mLANA and point mutations in the DNA binding domain of mLANA lead to a profound defect in latency establishment in the spleen after IN inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref021">21</xref>]. However, these mutations also result in defects in lytic viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref022">22</xref>]. Since lytic replication in the lung is important for MHV68 dissemination to the spleen after IN inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref040">40</xref>], it remained possible that defects in latency establishment observed with mLANA-null or mutant virus were indirect, the result of upstream defects in acute replication and dissemination. This idea was further supported by the observation that mLANA-null and mutant viruses establish and maintain splenic latency after IP inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref021">21</xref>]. The finding that viral titers in the lungs of CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice infected with WT or O73.loxP MHV68 were equivalent, yet O73.loxP latency in the same mice was strongly attenuated, indicates that defective lytic replication in the lung in the absence of <italic>ORF73</italic> is not the sole explanation for defective latency observed with 73.STOP.</p>
<p>Provided <italic>ORF73</italic> deletion occurs rapidly upon B cell infection, our results also suggest that B cells, which are infected by MHV68 in mouse lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref040">40</xref>], are not major contributors to productive viral replication in the lungs. Consistent with these observations, a study utilizing a recombinant MHV68 that encodes a switchable, floxed fluorescent marker confirmed that B cell-derived virus was undetectable in the lungs during the first 7–10 d post IN infection of CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref041">41</xref>]. It therefore is likely that mLANA functions in mucosal epithelial cells of the lung to promote efficient lytic replication.</p>
<p>Although it is clear from our studies that mLANA expression in B cells is necessary for dissemination from the lung (or MLN) to the spleen, it remains plausible that lytic replication and/or reactivation from B cells facilitates systemic infection. A direct test of this hypothesis is possible using an extension of the genetic platform described above. Conditional deletion of <italic>ORF50</italic> or <italic>ORF57</italic> in a virus in which <italic>ORF73</italic> is intact, with resultant defects in the establishment of latency in the spleen following IN infection of CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice, would provide strong evidence that lytic replication in B cells is necessary for systemic MHV68 infection.</p>
<p>Based on studies from the Stevenson laboratory demonstrating that floxed fluorescent loci in the MHV68 genome were recombined in mice expressing Cre in myeloid cells, indicating passage of MHV68 through that compartment, our working model depicts MHV68 trafficking from epithelial barriers to draining lymphoid organs via dendritic cells and/or macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref031">31</xref>]. Reduced latent infection of MLNs by mLANA-null virus, but only minimal impact on O73.loxP infection of CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice, suggests the possibility that mLANA functions in non-B cells to permit efficient trafficking to the lung, or is necessary for seeding and expansion of B cells in the MLN after trafficking. Our data are consistent with <italic>ORF73</italic> deletion not occurring until B cell expansion is underway in MLNs, or indicate that mLANA is not required for latency amplification in MLN B cells once a virus encoding mLANA is deposited in the lymph node via a non-B cell route. The latter point seems less likely given the importance of mLANA in maintaining viral genomes during cell division.</p>
<p>Since O73.loxP expanded in MLNs after IN inoculation of CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice, but failed to attain WT levels in blood, we propose that mLANA functions in B cells to permit efficient hematogenous dissemination and viral colonization of the spleen. A failure of O73.loxP MHV68-infected B cells to proliferate or a gradual loss or dilution of viral genomes resulting from a lack of mLANA-mediated episome maintenance during B cell expansion are possible mechanisms. Failed latency establishment by O73.loxP in AID<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice demonstrates the requirement for mLANA in GC B cells. Moreover, mLANA stabilizes c-myc to promote cellular proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref036">36</xref>], and, although not evaluated in B cells <italic>per se</italic>, ectopically expressed mLANA induces promoters for genes that drive cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref042">42</xref>]. Use of the H2b-YFP MHV68 recombinant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref033">33</xref>] coupled with floxed <italic>ORF73</italic> could directly evaluate proliferation and gene expression in peripheral B cells upon <italic>ORF73</italic> deletion.</p>
<p>Maintenance of the viral episome is perhaps the most extensively studied function of the KSHV LANA protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref043">43</xref>], and mLANA also supports the replication of plasmids containing a terminal repeat <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref024">24</xref>]. However, whether episome maintenance, primarily defined in cell culture, is required for maintenance of latency <italic>in vivo</italic> is unknown. The KSHV genome contains an autonomous replication element that is LANA-independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref044">44</xref>], and shRNA-mediated depletion of kLANA does not “cure” PEL cell lines of KSHV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref045">45</xref>]. Likewise, LANA-null and LANA DNA-binding mutant MHV68 are maintained long-term in splenic B cells after IP inoculation, despite a modest defect in early establishment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref021">21</xref>]. However, the severe latency establishment defect observed following infection of AID<sup>cre/+</sup> mice is most consistent with a model in which mLANA facilitates viral genome maintenance in rapidly proliferating GC B cells. Moreover, the reduction in O73.loxP infected splenocytes following induction of Cre activity <italic>after</italic> latency establishment supports the long-standing hypothesis that mLANA is necessary for genome maintenance during long-term chronic infection, although it is not yet clear whether infection is primarily depleted in the subset of GC B cells that remain infected long-term or in memory B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref035">35</xref>].</p>

<title>Further defining mechanisms of systemic infection</title>
<p>MHV68 spreads from epithelial barriers to draining lymph nodes via myeloid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref031">31</xref>]. However, cell types that mediate viral trafficking to the spleen and systemic infection are less clear. The observation that CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells constitute a much greater proportion of MHV68-infected cells in MLNs than do CD11c+ and CD11b+ myeloid cells (~100 to 1000 fold higher) suggests that B cell expansion in the LN precedes hematogenous spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref006">6</xref>]. This is in concordance with the necessity for B cells in splenic latency establishment after IN inoculation of MuMT mice mentioned above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref009">9</xref>]. The deficit in O73.loxP latency in blood-borne leukocytes of CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice adds new support to the hypothesis that B cells are the key vehicles for transport of MHV68 to the spleen. Once in the spleen, it is likely that MHV68 usurps GC reactions in order to facilitate latency establishment. Indeed, GC reactions supported by T follicular helper (T<sub>FH</sub>) cells and IL-21 are critical for the expansion of MHV68 latency in the spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006865.ref047">47</xref>]. The latency defect exhibited by O73.loxP MHV68 in AID<sup>cre/+</sup> mice emphasizes the importance of MHV68 passage through GC B cells in order to successfully colonize the host. Together, the defects in latency establishment by O73.loxP in CD19<sup>Cre/+</sup> and AID<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice add a viral-genetic component to models suggesting that MHV68 makes use of B cells for blood-borne dissemination and that infection of GC B cells is necessary for latency in the spleen.</p>

<p>pMSCV-Flp was generated by first amplifying the Flp recombinase ORF from pCMV14-Flp utilizing Flp-specific primers that also encode overhangs for restriction enzymes <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Eco</italic>RI (forward primer FlpR_BglII and reverse primer FlpR_EcoRI, <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006865.s001">S1 Table</xref></bold>). The resulting amplicon was digested with <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Eco</italic>RI along with pMSCV. Both the PCR product and pMSCV were resolved by gel electrophoresis, gel-purified, and ligated using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs; #M0202). Competent DH5α <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> were transformed with the ligated product, and after recovery, a small inoculum was plated on LB ampicillin plates. Positive clones were screened by restriction digest and sequenced to ensure proper insertion of the Flp ORF into pMSCV. All transfections were performed using Lipofectamine and Plus Reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<title>Modification of the MHV68 BAC to enable Cre-mediated deletion of viral genes.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic depicting the strategy for modifying the MHV68 BAC by first replacing the <italic>loxP</italic> sites that flanked the BAC cassette with <italic>frt</italic> sites, followed by insertion of <italic>loxP</italic> sites that flanked <italic>ORF73</italic>. (B) <italic>En passant</italic> mutagenesis was performed on the parental MHV68 BAC (lane 1) to generate a new WT MHV68 BAC (FRT BAC, lanes 2 and 3). A subsequent round of <italic>en passant</italic> mutagenesis was performed on the FRT BAC to generate O73.loxP (lane 4) and 73.STOP (lane 5) BACs. BAC DNA was digested with the indicated restriction endonucleases, and digestion products were resolved by agarose-gel electrophoresis to evaluate the gross genetic integrity of the newly derived BACs. The mutation in 73.STOP generates a new XbaI site that results in a ~8 kb digestion product (see lane 5) not present in the other BACs. (C) The parental Adler (lane 1) and FRT (lane 2) BACs were digested with the indicated restriction endonucleases, and digestion products were resolved by gel eclectrophoresis. Although a larger than expected band is present for Adler BAC digested with <italic>Eco</italic>RI, the double digest that includes <italic>Not</italic>I, an enzyme that cuts once in each copy of the terminal repeat, results in an identical banding pattern for both BACs. This indicates that the large DNA fragments produced by single digests of the Adler BAC are due to the presence of more copies of the terminal repeats relative to FRT BAC constructs.</p>

<p>3T12 fibroblasts or Vero cells constitutively expressing Cre recombinase were infected with WT MHV68 or O73.loxP MHV68 at an MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell. Cells were harvested on day 4 post-infection. Single-cell suspensions were serially diluted, and frequencies of cells harboring MHV68 genomes were determined using a limiting-dilution PCR analysis. In one set of analyses, primers specific for <italic>ORF50</italic> were used. In another set of analyses, primers specific for <italic>ORF73</italic> were used. Non-linear regression analyses were performed to determine the frequencies of cell harboring viral genomes. Viral genomes were equivalently detected by both primer sets in 3T12 fibroblasts lacking Cre. Viral genomes were detected with <italic>ORF50</italic> primers, but not <italic>ORF73</italic> primers, when cells expressing Cre were infected. Results are means of two independent experiments.
