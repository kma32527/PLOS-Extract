<abstract>
<p>Begomoviruses are exclusively transmitted by whiteflies in a persistent circulative manner and cause considerable economic losses to crop production worldwide. Previous studies have shown that begomoviruses accumulate in vesicle-like structures in whitefly midgut cells and that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is responsible for their internalization. However, the process by which begomoviruses are trafficked within whitefly midgut cells remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the roles of vesicle trafficking in the transport of <italic>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus</italic> (TYLCV), a begomovirus that has spread to over 50 countries and caused extensive damage to a range of important crops, within midgut cells of whitefly (<italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic>). By disrupting vesicle trafficking using RNA silencing and inhibitors, we demonstrated that the early steps of endosomal trafficking are important for the intracellular transport of TYLCV in the whitefly midgut. In addition, our data show that, unlike many animal viruses, TYCLV is trafficked within cells in a manner independent of recycling endosomes, late endosomes, lysosomes, the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum. Instead, our results suggest that TYLCV might be transported directly from early endosomes to the basal plasma membrane and released into the hemolymph. Silencing of the sorting nexin Snx12, which may be involved in membrane tubulation, resulted in fewer viral particles in hemolymph; this suggests that the tubular endosomal network may be involved in the transport of TYLCV. Our results also support a role for the endo-lysosomal system in viral degradation. We further showed that the functions of vector early endosomes and sorting nexin Snx12 are conserved in the transmission of several other begomoviruses. Overall, our data indicate the importance of early endosomes and the tubular endosomal network in begomovirus transmission.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Many plant viruses are vectored by insects in a persistent circulative manner. In this process, the transport of virus from the gut lumen into the hemolymph of the vector is an important step. Identification of vector components involved in this transport process could lead to new strategies to combat virus spread. Here, we demonstrate that the early steps of endosomal trafficking are important for the transport of begomoviruses across epithelial cells in the whitefly midgut. After internalization by midgut epithelial cells, begomoviruses are transported directly from early endosomes to the basal plasma membrane in a fast recycling route. We also identified several host processes that are involved in begomovirus transmission, including vesicle transport and membrane fusion events that promote virus trafficking. To our knowledge, this is the first report on mechanisms governing the intracellular transport of begomoviruses in their insect vector. Our study provides new insights into the transmission mechanisms of circulative plant viruses and gives direction to future research into begomovirus transmission blocking strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Insects transmit the majority of plant viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref003">3</xref>]. The process of virus transmission by an insect vector varies based on how the virus is acquired, retained, and inoculated into plants. Some plant viruses, such as members of the genera <italic>Caulimovirus</italic>, <italic>Cucumovirus</italic> and <italic>Potyvirus</italic>, are transmitted in a non-circulative manner, in which the viruses are acquired by feeding on infected plants, retained on the surface of the stylet, food canal, or foregut, and then inoculated into new host plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref006">6</xref>]. The coat proteins or non-structural proteins of some of these viruses aid their retention on the inner cuticular lining of the vector feeding apparatus via interactions with specific receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref009">9</xref>]. By contrast, persistent circulative viruses have developed much more complex interactions with their vectors. These viruses need to travel from the gut lumen into the hemolymph, move to the salivary gland, and finally be secreted from the salivary gland into new host plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref011">11</xref>]. Barriers to this transmission exist in the midgut and salivary gland, in which septate junctions are formed among epithelial cells to control the exchange of substances between hemolymph and midgut or salivary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref012">12</xref>]. In many cases, circulative viruses can be transmitted at higher rates after injection into the vector hemocoel than after oral acquisition, suggesting that delivery across the insect gut is a considerable barrier to virus transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Understanding the cellular processes that viruses exploit to facilitate their transport within vectors remains challenging. Animal viruses enter cells either via direct penetration through the plasma membrane or via endocytosis. The majority of animal viruses enter cells by hijacking the host cell’s clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref015">15</xref>]. Viral particles are then transported to early endosomes and sorted to various intracellular destinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref016">16</xref>]. After arrival in the lumen of specific vesicles, environmental cues such as acidified pH, changes in the redox environment, and proteolytic cleavage induce conformational changes in viral proteins and activate viral penetration into cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref019">19</xref>]. For instance, a significant proportion of Adeno-associated virus (AAV) particles are transported to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), whereas Ebola virus particles need to be transported from endosomes to lysosomes to complete their infection cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref021">21</xref>]. However, the intracellular routes plant viruses take within their vectors may differ significantly from those animal viruses take. How insect-vectored plant viruses exploit vector cells for delivery across the midgut is poorly understood.</p>
<p>In the past three decades, begomoviruses (genus <italic>Begomovirus</italic>, family Geminiviridae), one of the most important groups of plant viruses in tropical and subtropical regions, have caused considerable economic losses to a variety of crops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref024">24</xref>]. Begomoviruses are transmitted exclusively by the whitefly <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> in a persistent circulative manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref003">3</xref>], and the emergence of begomoviruses as important pathogens is closely related to the increasing prevalence of whiteflies worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref026">26</xref>]. A previous immuno-electron microscopy study using gold-labeled secondary antibodies showed that the begomovirus <italic>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus</italic> (TYLCV) can be detected in vesicle-like structures in the midgut cells of whitefly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref027">27</xref>]. Pan <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref028">28</xref>] further showed that TYLCV can be internalized into midgut cells through the clathrin-dependent pathway and that the endosomal system may play an important role in virus transport across the whitefly midgut. These results suggest that membranous vesicles are recruited by begomoviruses for their entry into vector midgut cells.</p>
<p>However, the process by which these viruses are trafficked in epithelial cells remains largely unknown. Many questions, including how begomoviruses are transported to the basal membrane of the epithelial cell and secreted into hemolymph, have not been answered. In this study, we explored begomovirus trafficking in whitefly midgut cells using immunofluorescence, inhibitors, and double strand RNA (dsRNA)-mediated RNA silencing. We showed that only early steps of endosomal trafficking are involved in the intracellular transport of begomoviruses, suggesting that viral particles might be transported directly from early endosomes to basal membranes.</p>

<title>Importance of vesicle trafficking in TYLCV transport</title>
<p>Animal viruses make extensive use of vesicle trafficking following endocytosis in their infection processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref017">17</xref>]. The Arp2/3 complex can facilitate endocytosis and vesicle trafficking through its functions in organizing actin filaments and regulating polymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref031">31</xref>]. To confirm their roles in the transmission of TYLCV by whitefly, <italic>Arp2</italic> and <italic>Arp3</italic> were subjected to dsRNA-mediated gene silencing analysis. The efficiency of dsRNA-mediated gene silencing was confirmed at the mRNA level by quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006866.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Silencing of <italic>Arp2</italic> or <italic>Arp3</italic> resulted in significant decreases in the quantity of TYLCV acquired by whiteflies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006866.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Next, whether Arp2 and Arp3 influenced the transport of viral particles across the midgut barrier was examined by quantifying virus abundance in the hemolymph. Virus abundance in hemolymph was significantly lower in the treatment groups than in the control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006866.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). To rule out the possibility that silencing <italic>Arp2</italic> and <italic>Arp3</italic> influences the ingestion of virus-containing phloem sap by whiteflies, the honeydew of whiteflies was collected and its total sugar content was quantified by the anthrone reaction. No significant difference was observed between the control and treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006866.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), suggesting that silencing <italic>Arp2</italic> or <italic>Arp3</italic> did not affect virus ingestion.</p>

<title>Inhibiting TYLCV acquisition by disrupting vesicle traffic.</title>
<p>(A-C) Silencing of <italic>Arp 2</italic> and <italic>Arp3</italic>. Genes were silenced by injecting dsRNA into hemolymph of whitefly. Whiteflies injected with dsRNA of GFP were included as a control. The insects were then kept on cotton plants. (A) Seventy-two hours after dsRNA injection, gene expression levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR (n = 4–5, n represents the number of samples). (B-C) The effect of the Arp2/3 complex on virus acquisition. Seventy-two hours after dsRNA injection, the treatment group and its control group were caged on two symmetrical leaves of the same TYLCV-infected plants. The abundance of virus in the whitefly whole body (B) and hemolymph (C) was measured after a 48 h acquisition access period (AAP) by quantitative PCR and compared with that in controls injected with dsRNA of GFP (for the whole body of whitefly, n = 4–8; for hemolymph, n = 8–24). (D-E) The quantity of honeydew excreted by whitefly. After RNA silencing or inhibitor feeding and 48 h AAP on tomato plant, the honeydew of whiteflies was collected from the surface of leaves and micro-cages and the content of sugar per whitefly per day was quantified (n = 5). (F) Effect of BrefA on virus acquisition. Whiteflies were fed with BrefA for 24 h and kept on TYLCV-infected plants for 48 h. Then, the abundance of virus in the whitefly whole body was measured by quantitative PCR and compared with that in ethanol-fed controls (n = 4). (G) Whiteflies were allowed to feed on TYLCV-infected plants for various AAP after feeding with BrefA or solvent ethanol. The abundance of virus in hemolymph was measured by quantitative PCR (n = 8–11). (H) Effect of BrefA on virus transmission. Whiteflies were first fed with BrefA and then transferred to TYLCV-infected plants for 12 h AAP. Next, the whiteflies were allowed to feed on tomato seedlings for 48 h and then removed. Percentages of tomato plants infected by the virus were calculated (n = 30). Data shown are mean ± SE. Statistically significant differences are indicated as *, P&lt;0.05; **, P&lt;0.01.</p>

<p>To further investigate the role of vesicle trafficking in TYLCV transmission, we fed whiteflies with Brefeldin A (BrefA), which can disrupt intracellular vesicle transport by a pleiotropic effect on the entire endosome system and the Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref032">32</xref>]. BrefA treatment induced the mislocalization of the trans-Golgi network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006866.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), confirming its effects in the whiteflies, and BrefA treatment did not affect whitefly feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006866.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). The acquisition of TYLCV by whitefly was significantly inhibited after BrefA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006866.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Feeding of BrefA inhibited the transport of virus across the midgut and led to a significant reduction in hemolymph virus abundance after 24 and 48 hours acquisition access period (AAP) on an infected plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006866.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Moreover, when whiteflies were used to transmit TYLCV from infected to uninfected host plants, BrefA treatment significantly decreased their transmission efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006866.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). Overall, our data suggest that vesicle trafficking is critical for the transport of TYLCV into vector hemolymph.</p>

<p>Lectins are oligomeric proteins with saccharide-binding sites that can recognize and bind particular sugar molecules. Usually, specific oligosaccharides are associated with a certain organelle, and lectins can thus serve to identify cellular components. Lectin WGA binds to <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyl residues and is used for staining the nuclear core, plasma membrane and sarcolemma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref037">37</xref>].

<p>The midgut of whiteflies that had a 72 h AAP on TYLCV-infected plants were dissected and prepared for immunofluorescence.

Midguts of whiteflies exposed to TYLCV-infected tomato plants for a 3 d AAP were dissected and prepared for immunofluorescence. TYLCV was identified using a specific antibody against its coat protein, the only known structural protein of TYLCV. Lectins GS-II, HPA, and WGA were used to label different kinds of glycoproteins. Colocalization between TYLCV and GS-II, WGA, and HPA-labeled structures were quantified as 0.04 ± 0.02, 0.08 ± 0.01, and 0.43 ± 0.02, respectively (Pearson’s coefficient, mean ± SE, n = 14–20). Scale bar, 5 μm. (B) Whiteflies that had been fed with BrefA and control whiteflies that had been fed with solvent ethanol were transferred to TYLCV-infected plants for 3 d AAP.

<p>Previous studies showed that BrefA can impair the functions of various vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref032">32</xref>]. We next investigated the effect of BrefA on the HPA-labeled structures and TYLCV. Whiteflies that had been fed with BrefA were transferred to TYLCV-infected plants for 72 h and prepared for immunofluorescence. BrefA had no visible effect on the formation of HPA-labeled structures; however, it disrupted the colocalization between HPA-labeled structures and TYLCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006866.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). This indicates that BrefA treatment can lead to disrupted localization of TYLCV.</p>
<p>Next, whiteflies were prepared for immunofluorescence after different AAP on TYLCV-infected plants. The accumulation of virus in HPA-labeled structures was observed as early as 1 day after transfer to infected plants. The quantity of virus in midgut cells gradually increased over time, and most viruses were localized within HPA-labeled vesicles from day 1 to day 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006866.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The strict colocalization between viral particles and HPA-labeled vesicles indicates that the majority of TYLCV accumulated in a single kind of vesicle and few (if any) particles were released into the cytoplasm. Since it has been reported that the terminal α-<italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosaminyl residues that lectin HPA selectively binds to are added in the cis-Golgi and then substituted in the trans-Golgi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref039">39</xref>], our results suggest that, after internalization, TYLCV might localize in the Golgi apparatus.</p>

<title>Lack of evidence for the involvement of Golgi apparatus in TYLCV trafficking.</title>
<p>(A) TYLCV trafficking was not influenced by silencing Golgi apparatus-related genes. After gene silencing, whiteflies were transferred to TYLCV-infected plants for virus acquisition. The abundance of virus in the whiteflies was quantified 48 h later and compared with that in controls injected with dsRNA of GFP (n = 4–7). (B) Effect of GolA on virus acquisition. Whiteflies were fed with GolA for 24 h to disrupt the function of the Golgi apparatus and transferred to TYLCV-infected plants. The abundance of virus in the whiteflies was measured after 48 h by quantitative PCR and compared with that in solvent-fed controls (n = 4). (C) Midguts of whiteflies exposed to TYLCV-infected tomato plants for a 3 d AAP were dissected and prepared for immunofluorescence. The ER and Golgi apparatus were identified using antibodies against ERp57 and alpha-mannosidase 2 (Man2), respectively. Colocalization between TYLCV and ERp57 or Man2 was quantified as 0.05 ± 0.01, 0.03 ± 0.01, respectively (Pearson’s coefficient, mean ± SE, n = 17–33). Scale bar, 5 μm.

<p>This result is surprising because retromer complex is essential for retrograde transport to the Golgi, and TYLCV was found to be colocalized strictly with an HPA-labeled structure, which is predicted to be the cis-Golgi apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref041">41</xref>].

Surprisingly, no appreciable colocalization was detected between virus and the Golgi apparatus or ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006866.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). We further investigated the spatial relationship between the Golgi apparatus marker protein and HPA-labeled structures and found no appreciable colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006866.g005">Fig 5D</xref>).

<title>Accumulation of viral particles in endosomes or lysosomes</title>
<p>To investigate what kind of vesicle this is, we conducted lectin affinity capture followed by mass spectrometry to identify proteins on virus-containing vesicles labeled by lectin HPA. Five proteins were captured by lectin HPA: glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein, myosin heavy chain, beta-actin, lysosomal associated membrane protein-1 (Lamp1) and sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-transporting ATPase (SERCA). GPI-anchored glycoprotein is localized mainly on the plasma membrane but can be endocytosed via caveolae or other plasma membrane components and then transported to endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref043">43</xref>]. The cytoskeleton and motor proteins are critical to vesicular movement, localization, and membrane fission. We speculated that myosin heavy chain and beta-actin were detected due to their interactions with proteins on vesicles, not their direct glycosylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref045">45</xref>].

In total, three kinds of vesicles were found: large vesicles with diameters ranging from 0.5 to 2 μm, which show great pleomorphism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006866.g009">Fig 9C–9E</xref>); small vesicles with diameters of 200 nm and precisely spherical shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006866.g009">Fig 9E and 9F</xref>); and vesicles with a tubular shape, which might be part of the tubular endosomal network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006866.g009">Fig 9G and 9H</xref>). Viral particles were associated with all three types of vesicles as well as with the basal plasma membranes of midgut cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006866.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). These results further confirmed that TYLCV virus particles are transported within vesicles in the cells of the whitefly midgut. Interestingly, most viral particles were localized close to the perimeters of vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006866.g009">Fig 9A–9E</xref>), indicating that viruses were recruited to vesicle membranes, likely by receptor-ligand interactions, rather than suspended in the fluid within vesicles.

<title>Sorting nexin (Snx) protein might aid in the secretion of TYLCV</title>
<p>The cargoes in endosomes are sorted depending on tubular-shaped membrane compartments, which allow the packaging of mainly membrane-bound components separately from luminal contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref058">58</xref>]. These tubules are induced and stabilized through a phosphatidylinositol-3-monophosphate (PtdIns3P) binding protein family, Snx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref059">59</xref>]. We searched the whitefly genome and identified four Snx genes: Snx2, Snx4, Snx6 and Snx12. Snx2 and Snx6, which form a membrane-deforming subcomplex of retromer complex, are involved in retromer-mediated retrieval transport from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus; Snx4 can regulate recycling transport of the transferrin receptor to the plasma membrane; and Snx12 is homologous to Snx3, which may be involved in the regulation of endocytosis, endosomal sorting, and signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref059">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref061">61</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The transport of virus from the gut lumen into the hemolymph of the insect vector is an important step in the circulative transmission of plant viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref014">14</xref>]. Brault and colleagues proposed that plant luteoviruses, which undergo circulative transmission, cross the aphid gut epithelium through a transcytosis process dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref064">64</xref>]. However, the detailed trafficking processes for plant viruses in their insect vectors are poorly understood. Our experiments in the present study demonstrated that vesicle trafficking plays important roles in TYLCV intracellular transport. We showed that TYLCV accumulates in HPA-labeled structures. Silencing the CORVET complex and Rab5 can inhibit virus acquisition, suggesting that the early steps of endosomal trafficking play important roles in virus transport. In addition, the transport of TYLCV is probably independent of the Golgi apparatus, late endosomes and recycling endosomes. These results suggest that TYLCV might be transported directly from early endosomes to the basal plasma membrane in a fast recycling route. Nevertheless, the present data cannot rule out the participation of other non-classical pathways. For example, Nonnenmacher <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref020">20</xref>] showed that AAV can be transported to the Golgi apparatus through a non-canonical retrograde transport pathway that is independent of the retromer complex. Thus, TYLCV may be transported to the Golgi apparatus through an unknown pathway and then rapidly secreted to the hemolymph once it arrives.</p>
<p>Many viruses need to be delivered between several kinds of vesicles during their infection process. However, we showed that the transmission of TYLCV was independent of the Golgi apparatus, late endosomes, lysosomes, and recycling endosomes. This suggests that the trafficking of TYLCV in vector cells might be a simpler process than the infection processes characteristic of pathogenic viruses. Pathogenic viruses need to take advantage of specific proteins or environmental conditions in vesicles to become infectious and release their hereditary material into the cytoplasm of host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref019">19</xref>]. For example, Ebola virus particles need to be transported from endosomes to lysosomes before their cytoplasmic release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref021">21</xref>]. After internalization, SV40 accumulates in the smooth ER as part of its productive infectious route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref065">65</xref>]. The lysosomal cholesterol transporter protein Niemann–Pick C1 and the misfolded protein response machinery in the ER are thought to aid the escapes of Ebola virus and SV40, respectively, from their vesicular compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref066">66</xref>]. However, TYLCV and other vectored plant viruses that undergo circulative transmission have a different destination: transport into the hemolymph, followed by secretion from the salivary gland into host plants. Therefore, the delivery of virus from early endosomes to other vesicles might be unnecessary.</p>
<p>Ultrastructural analysis of the virus-containing vesicles showed three types of vesicles that differ in the size and shape. The large vesicles may represent endosomes in which TYLCV has accumulated, and the small vesicles with spherical or tubular shapes might represent a previously described group of vesicles that bud from a donor compartment and are responsible for shuttling transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref057">57</xref>]. Since the basal plasma membrane but not the apical membrane of epithelial cells was labeled by lectin HPA, we hypothesize that shuttling vesicles bud from TYLCV-containing vesicles and are targeted to the basal plasma membrane or to other HPA-labeled vesicles. Interestingly, most viral particles were found near or connected to the membrane rather than being suspended in the lumen of vesicles. This indicates that TYLCV might be recruited to the membrane by specific receptor-ligand interactions and that this interaction could be important in its intracellular transport. It will be fascinating to clarify whether the same receptor is responsible for internalization and for intracellular transport. If so, this will raise the question of why and how this receptor is transported from the apical to the basal membrane of epithelial cells. If different receptors are involved, what mechanism promotes the disassociation of viral particles from the first receptor and its association with the second?</p>
<p>Our results also showed that inhibiting endosomal acidification leads to higher TYLCV content in whiteflies, suggesting that the virus may be transported to and degraded in lysosomes. However, no TYLCV particles were observed within late endosomes, and disrupting late endosomes or lysosomes by RNA silencing had no influence on virus content. In recent years, many studies have demonstrated that acidic degradation of extracellular cargo is not limited to lysosomes but can occur further upstream in the endo-lysosomal system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref067">67</xref>], suggesting that TYLCV could be degraded in early endosomes. However, because we did not have access to antibodies against lysosomes, it is still unclear which of these possibilities is correct.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results indicate that early steps of endosomal trafficking play important roles in begomovirus transport. Based on the present experiments and the studies of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref068">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref069">69</xref>], we conclude that begomoviruses are first delivered to early endosomes after clathrin-mediated endocytosis, then transported directly to the basal membrane of midgut epithelial cells. The fusion between virus-containing endocytic vesicles and early endosomes is mediated by Rab5 and the CORVET complex. Then, some of the viral particles may be transported to the basal membrane by tubular vesicles induced by Snx12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006866.g012">Fig 12</xref>). Whether some viral particles are transported to lysosomes remains uncertain.</p>

<title>Model of begomovirus trafficking in epithelial cells of whitefly midgut.</title>
<p>Following clathrin-mediated endocytosis, begomoviruses are first delivered to early endosomes in a process mediated by Rab5 and the CORVET complex. Next, some viruses are transported directly to the basal membrane of epithelial cells in a process dependent on tubular vesicles induced by Snx12. Inhibiting endosomal acidification leads to increased virus abundance in whitefly, indicating that acid hydrolases in the endo-lysosomal system are responsible for virus degradation. However, whether begomoviruses are transported to late endosomes or lysosomes remains uncertain.</p>

<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study regarding the intracellular trafficking of begomoviruses within their insect vectors. The exact transport pathway of begomoviruses in epithelial cells may be more complicated than the proposed model because these cells are polarized, with apical and basal domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref053">53</xref>]. For example, sorting to the apical and basal membranes are governed by different mechanisms and carried out by different vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006866.ref070">70</xref>]. Intriguingly, this virus is endocytosed on the apical membrane and exocytosed on the basal membrane. Observing virus transport in live cells may help future researchers better understand the process.</p>

<p>For stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, midguts were first immobilized on the bottom of Glass Bottom Cell Culture Dishes (NEST, China) and immersed in STORM imaging buffer containing cysteamine (MEA) and 2-mercaptoethanol (50 mM Tris-HCl pH = 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 10% Glucose, 5 mM MEA, 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 560 μg/ml Glucose Oxidase, 34 μg/ml Catalase). Prior to STORM imaging, a strong laser was used to inactivate most fluorophores. STORM acquisition was then started with imaging cycles containing one frame of activation laser illumination (405 nm) followed by eight frames of imaging laser illumination (561 nm, 657 nm). Typically, one STORM image containing more than 50,000 pictures was acquired per hour. These data were subsequently used for analysis of the locations of probes.</p>

<title>Lectin affinity capture and mass spectrometry</title>
<p>HPA lectin was conjugated to NHS Mag Sepharose magnetic beads (GE Healthcare, USA), following the manufacturer’s protocol. One g of whiteflies was ground in liquid nitrogen and dissolved in TBS (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) with 0.4% NP-40. Then, the solution was incubated overnight at 4°C with magnetic beads coupled with lectin HPA and washed three times with TBS. Finally, proteins on the magnetic beads were eluted using elution buffer (0.1 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.5) and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis at Shanghai Applied Protein Technology Co., Ltd. Magnetic beads that were not coupled with lectin HPA were included as a control.</p>

<sec id="sec023">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparisons of the relative abundance of virus in whitefly and the expression levels of genes. Goodness-of-fit test for independence was applied to comparisons of the transmission efficiency of TYLCV by whitefly. A P-value &lt; 0.05 was considered as the threshold for significant difference. All the statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 20.0 (SPSS Inc., USA).</p>

<p>(A) Confirmation of dsRNA-mediated gene silencing. Genes were silenced by injecting dsRNA into hemolymph of whitefly. Gene expression levels were measured by qRT-PCR at 72 h post injection (n = 4–5). (B) The quantity of honeydew excreted by whiteflies after dsRNA injection. (C) The quantity of honeydew excreted by whiteflies after feeding with GolA. The honeydew produced per whitefly per day was quantified based on its sugar content (n = 5–8). The lack of significant effects on honeydew production indicates that neither GolA nor RNA silencing of retromer complex influence whitefly phloem sap feeding. (D) Whiteflies that had been fed with GolA (right) or DMSO control (left) for 2 days were prepared for immunofluorescence. Data shown are mean ± SE.</p>
