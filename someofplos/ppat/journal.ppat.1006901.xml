<abstract>
<p>Stress granules (SGs) contain stalled messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes and are related to the regulation of mRNA translation. Picornavirus infection can interfere with the formation of SGs. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms and functions of picornavirus-mediated regulation of SG formation are not clear. Here, we found that the 2A protease of a picornavirus, EV71, induced atypical stress granule (aSG), but not typical stress granule (tSG), formation via cleavage of eIF4GI. Furthermore, 2A was required and sufficient to inhibit tSGs induced by EV71 infection, sodium arsenite, or heat shock. Infection of 2A protease activity-inactivated recombinant EV71 (EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup>) failed to induce aSG formation and only induced tSG formation, which is PKR and eIF2α phosphorylation-dependent. By using a Renilla luciferase mRNA reporter system and RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization assay, we found that EV71-induced aSGs were beneficial to viral translation through sequestering only cellular mRNAs, but not viral mRNAs. In addition, we found that the 2A protease of other picornaviruses such as poliovirus and coxsackievirus also induced aSG formation and blocked tSG formation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that, on one hand, EV71 infection induces tSG formation via the PKR-eIF2α pathway, and on the other hand, 2A, but not 3C, blocks tSG formation. Instead, 2A induces aSG formation by cleaving eIF4GI to sequester cellular mRNA but release viral mRNA, thereby facilitating viral translation.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>When cellular translation initiation is stalled, translation initiation complexes aggregate in cytoplasm. We call these aggregations stress granules (SGs), and they can be marked by components such as TIA-1. SGs are always considered to be antiviral structures during viral infection, but viruses also regulate SG formation to facilitate their survival. Here, we show that the 2A protease of EV71 induced TIA-1 foci formation, and we analyzed these TIA-1 foci and found that they were different from typical stress granules (tSGs); thus, we named them atypical stress granules (aSGs). 2A alone could block tSG formation, and we found that protease activity of 2A was required for aSG induction and tSG blockage, but functioned in different ways. When the protease activity of 2A in EV71 was blocked (EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup>), the tSGs but not aSGs appeared in infected cells. These tSGs contained cellular and viral mRNAs and translation initiation factors to inhibit viral translation, but aSGs contained only cellular mRNAs to promote viral translation. We propose a model revealing that EV71 escapes cellular antiviral response by manipulating SG formation: 2A transforms the overall translation shutdown system to a selective virally beneficial system by switching from tSGs to aSGs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Stress granules (SGs) form in response to a variety of stresses such as oxidative stress, heat shock (HS), hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref001">1</xref>]. During SG formation, messenger RNA (mRNA) translation initiation is inhibited, and polysomes are disassembled. Thus, SGs contain stalled pre-initiation complexes (PICs) consisting of translationally silent mRNAs, 40S ribosomal subunits, canonical eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) such as eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4A, eIF4B, and eIF3, and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Two aggregation-prone RBPs, T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen 1 (TIA-1) and the RasGAP SH3-domain binding protein 1 (G3BP), appear to be critical for SG formation and are recruited to SGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>SGs in general are considered to be transient and dynamic. Compounds such as cycloheximide (CHX) stabilize mRNAs on polysomes and inhibit SG formation and foster their disassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref005">5</xref>]. The SG formation induced by the phosphorylation of eIF2α is well characterized. The protein kinase R (PKR), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2), or heme regulated inhibitor (HRI) can phosphorylate eIF2α under different stress conditions. For example, PKR can be activated by viral dsRNA, and HRI can be activated by arsenite (AS) or HS. The phosphorylation of eIF2α interferes with the formation of the eIF2-GTP-tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> ternary complex and thereby stalls translation initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref008">8</xref>]. However, eIF2α-independent SG formation also exists and includes eIF4A inhibition by either pateamine A or hippuristanol and inhibition of eIF4G-eIF4E interactions during hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Thus, SG formation can be caused by a variety of mechanisms that impair translation initiation. Although SGs formed in response to diverse stresses share many of the same components, certain factors appear to be recruited in a stress-specific fashion. For example, HS protein 27 (HSP27) is found in SGs in HS cells but not in cells undergoing oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref013">13</xref>]; the p68 src-associated protein in mitosis (Sam68) is recruited to SGs in picornavirus-infected cells but not to those formed in response to oxidative stress or HS. Thus, SGs may be compositionally different depending on the type of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref014">14</xref>], and distinct SGs may be regulated differentially and have multiple roles. However, the mechanisms by which SGs form have not been identified completely.</p>
<p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a member of the <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family, is widely spread and causes severe hand-foot-mouth disease in infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref015">15</xref>]. Thus, understanding the host factors that influence viral pathogenesis is critical to designing improved antiviral strategies. The EV71 genome (∼7.5 kb) can be immediately translated into a single polyprotein via an internal ribosome entry sequence (IRES)-mediated, cap-independent mechanism of translation initiation, and this polyprotein is subsequently processed by proteases 2A and 3C into the structural and nonstructural proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref016">16</xref>]. Furthermore, the IRES can drive the viral genome translation in the absence of functional eIF4F complex, which is disrupted due to cleavage of eIF4G in picornavirus-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>SGs are thought to be antiviral, and many viruses have hence evolved various strategies to disrupt SG formation to maintain efficient translation of their proteins and to prevent their genomes and transcripts from being stalled in SGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref020">20</xref>]. Poliovirus (PV) infection was initially indicated by the recruitment of HuR and G3BP to SGs in early phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref010">10</xref>]. Subsequently, White et al. found that eIF4G and polyA-binding protein (PABP) were also recruited to SGs early in PV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref021">21</xref>]. However, further examination revealed that eIF4G, G3BP, and PABP were no longer found in SGs at later times, indicating that PV may actively disrupt SG formation at later times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref021">21</xref>]. Furthermore, the discovery that G3BP was cleaved by 3C, which coincided with SG disassembly in infected cells, provided a possible explanation for these findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref021">21</xref>]. White et al. suggested a model whereby PV initially induces SG formation but induces SG disassembly at later stages via cleavage of G3BP, thus preventing SG formation even in the presence of external stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>However, because most of the SG markers used in the study by White et al. can be cleaved by 2A or 3C, whether other SG components are also released from SGs is unclear. Therefore, Piotrowska et al. further examined SG formation in PV-infected cells and found that infection induced stable, compositionally unique SGs containing TIA-1 but lacking G3BP and eIF4G and that these SGs did not disassemble at late times in infected cells, which raised the possibility that PV might not induce the complete disassembly of SGs. As G3BP, eIF4G, and PABP are all cleaved by viral proteases, proteolysis may trigger their release from SGs. Alternatively, the release may be triggered by a mechanism not yet identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref014">14</xref>]. Furthermore, recent studies showed that 2A of picornaviruses induced SG formation and that no other viral proteins induced SG formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref022">22</xref>]. However, the molecular mechanism of these 2A-induced SGs and the cellular components that 2A targets to trigger SG formation remain unknown.</p>
<p>Therefore, several questions raised in the aforementioned studies have not been resolved. (1) How do picornaviruses induce SG formation at early times and block SG assembly at later times? (2) Is cleavage of G3BP by 3C critical for the inhibition of SG formation at later times during infection? (3) What is the molecular mechanism of 2A-induced SG formation? Are they typical stress granules (tSGs)? (4) What are the organization and role of 2A-induced SGs in picornavirus-infected cells?</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that the 2A protease of EV71 blocks tSG formation but induces atypical stress granule (aSG) formation to facilitate viral translation. These aSGs are induced by cleavage of eIF4GI and are different from tSGs in that they are devoid of G3BP and a series of eIFs, they are independent of eIF2α and PKR phosphorylation, they cannot be dissolved by CHX, and they can specifically sequester cellular mRNAs but not viral mRNAs. On the other hand, infection with a 2A protease activity-inactivated recombinant virus, EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup>, induces tSG formation via the PKR-eIF2α pathway, and these tSGs are antiviral structures. These findings provide a new conceptual mechanism for SG regulation during picornavirus infection.</p>

<title>2A induces aSG formation during EV71 infection</title>
<p>To explore the formation of SGs during picornavirus infection, we infected HeLa cells with EV71 for 6 hours (h) and visualized SGs via immunofluorescence (IF) with antibodies against Sam68, TIA-1, and G3BP. EV71 infection led to the formation of SGs containing Sam68 and TIA-1, but devoid of G3BP, and as a control, AS induced the formation of tSGs containing TIA-1 and G3BP, but not Sam68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>To explore EV71-induced SG formation in more detail, we tried to clarify the dynamics of SG assembly during EV71 infection and visualized SGs at different time points post-infection (pi). An antibody against EV71 was used to visualize EV71-infected cells, and TIA-1 and Sam68 were also visualized. When cells were mock- or EV71-infected for 2 hours, EV71 infection was undetectable via IF, and localization of TIA-1 and Sam68 did not change. As infection proceeded, IF revealed EV71 in 90% of the cells at 4 hpi and 95% of the cells at 6 hpi, TIA-1 and Sam68 assembled into foci and colocalized with each other in infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s001">S1A and S1H Fig</xref>). Therefore, the appearance of TIA-1 and Sam68 foci can be used as indicators of EV71 infection. However, although TIA-1-related protein (TIAR) aggregated and persisted in infected cells with TIA-1 and Sam68, the other tSG markers such as G3BP, PABP, 40S ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), eIF1a, eIF3a, eIF4G, eIF4A, and eIF4E aggregated in less than 30% of cells at 4 hpi and were evenly distributed at 6 hpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s001">S1B–S1H Fig</xref>). Similar results were observed in EV71-infected rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s001">S1H Fig</xref>), suggesting that the persistent SGs containing TIA-1, TIAR, and Sam68 might not be tSGs.</p>
<p>To confirm which protein of EV71 induced the formation of persistent SGs, we expressed all the viral proteins in HeLa and RD cells and found that only 2A protease induced the formation of TIA-1 foci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s002">S2A Fig</xref>), which also contained Sam68 and TIAR but did not contain PABP, G3BP, RPS3, eIF1a, eIF3a, eIF4G, eIF4A, or eIF4E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), suggesting that 2A expression alone is sufficient to trigger the formation of persistent SGs during EV71 infection and the formation of Sam68 or TIA-1 foci can also be used as an indicator of 2A expression.</p>
<p>Next, we sought to determine whether 2A-induced persistent SGs share features with tSGs. First, a previous study showed that tSGs are dynamic structures of which TIA-1 rapidly shuttles in and out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref023">23</xref>]. Thus, we analyzed the dynamics of TIA-1 in tSGs and persistent SGs via fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assay. To rule out the impact of size, typical and persistent SGs with similar size (1.5–2 μm in dimeter) were analyzed. We found that GFP-TIA-1 in typical and persistent SGs were rapidly recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), suggesting that persistent SGs are also dynamic structures. Second, previous studies also showed that stresses not only induce tSG formation but also induce adjacent processing body (p-body) formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref026">26</xref>]. Thus we also analyzed the location of the p-bodies in EV71-infected cells by using a widely used marker of p-bodies—mRNA-decapping enzyme 1A (DCP1A), and found that p-bodies were adjacent to EV71-induced persistent SGs at 4h post-infection, but disappeared at 6h post-infection, suggesting that EV71-induced persistent SGs were distinct from p-bodies but similar to tSGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s002">S2C and S2D Fig</xref>). Third, we evaluated the effect of eIF2α phosphorylation on the formation of TIA-1 foci and found that expression of eIF2α<sup>S51A</sup> (an eIF2α non-phosphorylated mutant) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref029">29</xref>] blocked AS-induced tSG formation but had no effect on EV71- and 2A-induced formation of persistent SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>), indicating that 2A induced the formation of persistent SGs in a phospho-eIF2α-independent manner. Fourth, we found that CHX dispersed AS-induced tSGs but had no effect on EV71- and 2A-induced persistent SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>). Therefore, we defined EV71- and 2A-induced persistent SGs as atypical stress granules (aSGs).</p>

<p>Furthermore, based on three facts, (1) both eIF4G and PABP were cleavage substrates of 2A and excluded from 2A-induced aSGs; (2) both eIF4GI and eIF4GII play similar functions in translation initiation, but cleavage of eIF4GI by 2A of picornaviruses is more sensitive than cleavage of eIF4GII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref033">33</xref>]; (3) the mRNA level of eIF4GI was previously shown to be much higher than that of eIF4GII in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref034">34</xref>], therefore, we hypothesized that cleavage of eIF4GI/PABP by 2A might be critical for 2A-induced aSG formation.</p>

<title>3C is dispensable for the blockage of tSG formation during EV71 infection</title>
<p>Because EV71 induced the formation of aSGs that were distinct from tSGs, we sought to determine whether tSG formation could be blocked during EV71 infection.

<p>Next, we sought to determine how EV71 blocks tSG formation. Previous studies reported that 3C protease of picornaviruses inhibited tSG formation by cleavage of G3BP, and G3BP<sup>Q326E</sup> (a 3C cleavage-resistant mutant of G3BP) restored SG formation competency in picornavirus-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref038">38</xref>]. We confirmed that GFP-G3BP<sup>Q326E</sup> was indeed cleavage-resistant upon EV71 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) or 3C expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s004">S4D Fig</xref>, left panel), and GFP-G3BP<sup>Q326E</sup> rescued tSG formation in 3C-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s004">S4D Fig</xref>, right panel). To determine whether EV71 inhibits tSG formation in a manner similar to that of previous reported picornaviruses, we assessed tSG formation in the presence of EV71 infection, GFP-G3BP or GFP-G3BP<sup>Q326E</sup> expression plus AS. At 2 hpi with EV71, GFP-G3BP and GFP-G3BP<sup>Q326E</sup> localized to AS-induced tSGs. As infection proceeded, AS-induced tSG formation was blocked in EV71-infected cells despite expression of GFP-G3BP<sup>Q326E</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>).

<p>To confirm whether 3C protease is required for the inhibition of tSG formation during EV71 infection, we used guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl, an ATPase inhibitor) to suppress viral replication to an extremely low level in HeLa and RD cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref040">40</xref>]. Under these conditions, viral proteins were undetectable, and the level of full-length G3BP in EV71-infected cells was comparable with that in uninfected cells, but eIF4G was remarkably cleaved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g003">Fig 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s004">S4F Fig</xref>), as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref041">41</xref>], indicating that 3C cannot work and the cleavage of eIF4G can be used to distinguish the infected cells.

<p>To further elucidate the critical role of 2A protease activity in blocking tSG formation and inducing aSG formation during EV71 infection, we generated recombinant EV71 with the 2A<sup>C110S</sup> mutation (EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup>). Since 2A is important for the viral life cycle, the replication activity of EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup> is much lower (50-fold less in viral titer) than that of EV71 and VP1 expression of EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup> was also much lower than that of EV71 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s006">S6A Fig</xref>).

Taken together, these data demonstrate that EV71 infection induces tSG formation independent of 2A protease activity, but 2A inhibits EV71-induced tSG formation and induces aSG formation.</p>

<title>EV71 induces tSG formation via the PKR-eIF2a pathway</title>
<p>We next sought to determine how EV71 infection induces tSG formation. Since EV71 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, it generates significant amounts of viral replication intermediate dsRNAs during replication. And the dsRNAs commonly activate PKR to phosphorylate eIF2α, which results in tSG assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref042">42</xref>]. To determine whether EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup> induces tSG formation via the PKR-eIF2α pathway, we generated HeLa cells with stable knockdown (KD) of PKR (shPKR-HeLa cells) and infected them with EV71 or EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup>. We found that KD of PKR decreased the phosphorylation levels of PKR and eIF2α in EV71- or EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup>-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). In shPKR-HeLa cells, the formation of EV71-induced aSGs was not affected, but the formation of EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup>-induced tSGs was blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). Furthermore, expression of eIF2α<sup>S51A</sup> blocked the formation of EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup>-induced tSGs but not EV71-induced aSGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that, unlike aSGs, tSGs are induced via the PKR-eIF2α pathway by viral dsRNAs during EV71 infection.</p>

<title>2A transforms from tSGs to aSGs to benefit viral translation</title>
<p>Next, we sought to determine why 2A blocks tSG formation but induces aSG formation. We hypothesized that it is a strategy by which the virus facilitates its own translation. Thus, we generated a Renilla luciferase mRNA reporter, the translation of which is driven by EV71-UTR to mimic EV71 translation (UTR<sup>EV71</sup>-Rluc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).

<p>Next, we sought to determine how aSGs benefit viral translation. We hypothesized that different mRNAs are sequestered in aSGs and tSGs to regulate viral translation. First, using poly(A) fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays, we confirmed that numerous mRNAs were present in the EV71- or 2A-induced aSGs and in the AS-induced tSGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Second, using RNA FISH assays, we evaluated the localization of viral mRNAs (positive-strand RNA, +vRNA) and cellular PABPC1 mRNAs (with high TIA-1 affinity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref043">43</xref>] in HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-TIA-1. In EV71-infected cells, PABPC1 mRNAs, but not +vRNA, efficiently localized in the aSGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g007">Fig 7E</xref>, top panel). In EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup>-infected cells, both PABPC1 mRNAs and +vRNA efficiently localized in the tSGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g007">Fig 7E</xref>, bottom panel). Furthermore, we generated a Renilla luciferase mRNA reporter, the translation of which is driven by PABPC1-UTR to mimic PABPC1 translation (UTR<sup>PABPC1</sup>-Rluc) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). We found whether the aSGs was blocked by eIF4GI<sup>G689E</sup> in EV71-infected cells or the tSGs was blocked by KD of PKR in EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup>-infected cells, the translation efficacy of UTR<sup>PABPC1</sup>-Rluc mRNA increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s007">S7B and S7C Fig</xref>), suggesting that both aSGs and tSGs inhibit PABPC1 mRNA translation. Taken together, our results suggest that tSGs stall both cellular and viral mRNAs to shut down overall translation, resulting in the inhibition of viral translation; however, 2A of EV71 blocked tSG formation but induced aSG formation to facilitate viral translation by stalling only cellular mRNAs.</p>

<title>2A-mediated induction of aSG formation and blockage of tSG formation are common among <italic>Picornaviridae</italic></title>
<p>The function of the 2A protease is highly conserved among <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>. Thus, we sought to determine whether its role in SG formation regulation is conserved among picornaviruses. We used Sam68 cytoplasmic re-localization as a marker of 2A expression in IF assays. Indeed, expression of 2A of EV71-BrCr, PV, and coxsackievirus A (CVA) also triggered Sam68 and TIA-1 to form aSGs that were devoid of G3BP and resistant to CHX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g008">Fig 8A</xref>, upper panel, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In previous studies, TIA-1 foci have been observed during picornavirus infection; however, the essence of these aggregates was ambiguous and controversial. The 2A-induced TIA-1 foci were thought to be tSGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref022">22</xref>]. We also found that 2A-induced TIA-1 foci share some features with tSGs, such as they are dynamic and adjacent to p-bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s002">S2C Fig</xref>), but they are different from tSGs and thus named them aSGs. The conclusion of aSGs different from tSGs is supported by multiple lines of evidence. First, the aSGs contained TIA-1, TIAR, and Sam68 but were devoid of G3BP, a series of eIFs and viral mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s001">S1A–S1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s002">S2B</xref> Figs and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). Second, the formation of aSGs was independent of PKR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>) and the phosphorylation of eIF2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). Third, the aSGs could not be disassembled by CHX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>). Fourth, EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup>-induced TIA-1 foci were tSGs, which contained TIA-1, G3BP, eIF4G, and viral mRNA, and could be completely dispersed by CHX, and the formation of which was dependent on PKR activation and the phosphorylation of eIF2α (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g005">5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g006">6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g007">7E</xref>).</p>
<p>Although both eIF4G and PABP were cleavage substrates of 2A, the cleavage efficiency of PABP is much lower than that of eIF4G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref044">44</xref>]. We found that the only eIF4GI<sup>G689E</sup> blocked the aSGs formation, indicating that 2A induces aSG formation by cleaving eIF4GI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s003">S3A–S3C Fig</xref>). PABP is also a cleavage substrate of 3C, but expression of 3C is unable to induce aSG formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). Therefore, we thought that even if the cleavage of PABP is more robust, cleavage of PABP should not result in aSG formation. We also found that 2A-induced aSGs are a common phenomenon in picornaviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g008">Fig 8</xref>), and the dynamics of TIA-1 in aSGs were similar to those of TIA-1 in tSGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Thus, it is possible that aSGs are also non-membrane-bound cellular compartments and formed via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), as is the case for tSGs. Although the details of LLPS are not clear, previous studies have shown that the high concentration of RBPs, which contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), triggers LLPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref047">47</xref>]. When the concentration of IDR-containing RBPs reaches a certain level, the LLPS of these RBPs can be spontaneously initiated by IDR-mediated interaction, thus promoting tSG formation. Furthermore, during molecular crowding, IDR-containing RBPs can initiate LLPS at lower protein levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref046">46</xref>]. The expression of 2A could shuttle many nuclear IDR-containing RBPs, including hnRNPs, TDP-43, HuR, and Sam68, to the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref051">51</xref>], thus resulting in increased concentrations of IDR-containing RBPs in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the cleavage of eIF4GI by 2A leads to the accumulation of stalled PICs, thus resulting in molecular crowding. In cells expressing eIF4GI<sup>G689E</sup> and 2A, translation is initiated, molecular crowding is inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref052">52</xref>], and tSG formation is blocked (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s005">S5F and S5G Fig</xref>), and aSGs are therefore unable to form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s008">S8 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In principle, the PICs rapidly exchange between tSGs and polyribosomes, the addition of CHX during AS and HS treatment inhibits the dissociation of polyribosomes and results in the disassembly of tSGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref005">5</xref>]. However, we found that aSGs could not be dissolved by CHX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>). Furthermore, we also found that the aSGs did not contain eIF1a, eIF3a, eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4G, and RPS3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s001">S1A–S1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s002">S2B</xref> Figs), indicating that the mRNAs in aSGs are not equipped with eIFs and 40S ribosomal subunits, and cannot participate in translation. Therefore, the mRNAs within aSGs cannot flow to polyribosomes and aSGs cannot be dissolved by CHX.</p>
<p>Piotrowska et al. found that poliovirus did not block HS-induced tSG formation at 4 hpi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref014">14</xref>], but we found that both AS- and HS-induced tSG formation were inhibited at 4 hpi and 6 hpi during EV71 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s004">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>). We speculate that poliovirus could not block HS-induced tSGs completely at 4hpi, but as infection proceeded, poliovirus blocked HS-induced tSGs eventually. To our knowledge, we are the first to find that tSGs are totally abrogated specifically by 2A, but not by 3C. Our conclusion is supported by three lines of evidence. First, EV71 and 2A still blocked tSG formation in cells expressing 3C cleavage-resistant G3BP (G3BP<sup>Q326E</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s004">S4D, S4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s005">S5D and S5E</xref> Figs), which contradicts previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref049">49</xref>]. We speculate that most of the viruses failed to replicate in cells expressing G3BP<sup>Q326E</sup>, because G3BP exhibits antiviral activity against several picornaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref053">53</xref>], thus resulting in an eight-fold reduction in viral titer and tSG formation rescue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref021">21</xref>]. Although tSG formation was inhibited in 3C-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s004">S4D Fig</xref>), we think this is just a phenomenon accompanying the cleavage of G3BP by 3C to inhibit the antiviral activity of G3BP in the late phase of EV71 infection, because tSG inhibition occurred much earlier than G3BP cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). Second, the addition of GuHCl in EV71-infected cells suppressed viral replication to an extremely low level, and the protease activity of 3C could not be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g003">Fig 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s004">S4F Fig</xref>), but tSG formation was still blocked in infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g003">Fig 3G and 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s004">S4F Fig</xref>), suggesting that 3C is not required for blocking tSG formation. Third, by using the EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup> mutant virus, in which 2A protease activity was abolished but 3C protease activity was intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), we found that EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup> induced tSG formation instead of inhibiting it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g005">Fig 5B–5D</xref>), demonstrating that 2A is indispensable for the EV71-mediated inhibition of tSG formation. We also tried to rescue recombinant EV71 with a catalytically inactive 3C mutation but failed, which may be attributed to the presence of many 3C cleavage sites in the viral polyproteins.</p>
<p>2A of EV71 was previously suggested to induce tSG formation, but the exact mechanism is unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref022">22</xref>]. To our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that EV71 induces tSG formation through the PKR-eIF2α pathway via dsRNA, but not 2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g006">Fig 6</xref>); on the contrary, 2A is indispensable for the blockage of tSG formation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Although both induction of aSG formation and blockage of tSG formation require 2A protease activity, the molecular mechanism of 2A contribution to induction of aSG formation and blockage of tSG formation is different. The aSG formation is accompanied by the tSG blockage in 2A-expessing or EV71-infected cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g003">3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g004">4A and 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s004">S4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s005">S5A</xref> Figs), but inhibition of 2A-induced aSGs by expression of eIF4GI<sup>G689E</sup> is unable to recover tSGs in the presence of AS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s005">S5F and S5G Fig</xref>); Furthermore, KD of PKR or expression of eIF2α<sup>S51A</sup> inhibits EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup>-induced tSG formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g006">Fig 6</xref>), but has no effect on EV71-induced aSG formation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g001">1D, 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g006">6B and 6C</xref>), suggesting that blockage of tSG formation and induction of aSGs by virus are independent to each other, not due to turning tSGs into aSGs. The molecular mechanism of how 2A prevents tSG formation should be more complicated.</p>
<p>EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup>-induced tSGs contained eIFs and both viral and cellular mRNAs (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g006">6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g007">7D and 7E</xref>) to inhibit viral translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). But EV71-induced aSGs did not contain a series of eIFs or viral mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006901.s001">S1A–S1H Fig</xref>, Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g006">6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g007">7D and 7E</xref>) and instead contained selectively confined host mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g007">Fig 7E</xref>) to facilitate viral translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). The mechanism of how viral RNA avoids being recruited to the aSGs is unclear, but we thought differences of RNA-binding proteins within aSGs and tSGs result in elimination of viral RNA from aSGs. It has been reported that many cellular mRNAs also contained IRES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref054">54</xref>], and if the binding proteins of IRES-containing cellular mRNAs are eliminated from aSGs, the aSGs should not stall these IRES-containing cellular mRNAs either.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings reveal the common molecular mechanisms and functions of picornavirus-mediated regulation of SG formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006901.g009">Fig 9</xref>). On one hand, host cells recognize viral dsRNA via PKR during EV71 infection, which activates the PKR-eIF2α signaling cascade and results in tSG formation. Both cellular and viral mRNAs are sequestered in tSGs, which leads to an overall shutdown of translation to inhibit viral translation. On the other hand, 2A protease of EV71 blocks tSG formation drastically to remove the antiviral effects of tSG formation from host cells. Furthermore, 2A induces aSG formation by cleaving eIF4GI to sequester cellular mRNA but releases eIFs and viral mRNA, which benefit viral translation. Thus, the blockage of tSG formation and induction of aSG formation are strategies used by EV71 to survive in host cells.</p>

<p>Further studies are needed to reveal the complete RNA and protein composition of aSGs and the mechanisms of EV71-induced blockage of tSG formation. Likewise, the full effect of the regulation of SG formation on aspects of cell physiology other than translation control of host mRNAs should be further explored. Previous studies have suggested that persistent SG formation is linked to some neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref055">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006901.ref057">57</xref>]. Research in these areas may offer fascinating new insights into cellular function and may also yield novel therapeutic strategies in picornavirus-induced disease.</p>

Other stably expressing cells (eIF4GI-HA-HeLa, eIF4GI<sup>G689E</sup>-HA-HeLa), cells with KD of PKR (shPKR-HeLa) or negative control (shNC-HeLa) cells derived from HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>For infection, HeLa or RD cells were infected with DMEM containing viruses with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 plaque-forming units (PFUs) or as indicated in the figure legends. After 1 h incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM with 4% FBS, and this time point was considered 0 hpi; cells were harvested for further analysis at 6 hpi or as indicated.

<title>SG induction, quantification, and drug treatment</title>
<p>For tSG induction, cells were treated with 200 μM AS (Sigma-Aldrich) or incubated at 43°C (HS) for 1 h (or otherwise as indicated) before being harvested for further analysis.</p>
<p>For quantification of the foci of different protein markers in EV71-infected or 2A-expressing cells, EV71- or Myc-tagged cells with Sam68 and TIA-1 foci were counted from cells containing EV71 or Myc tag, and others were counted from cells forming TIA-1 foci. For quantification of tSG formation in EV71-infected or 2A-expressing cells, G3BP was used as an AS- or HS-induced SG marker, and HSP27 was used as an HS-induced SG marker. Cells were considered tSG positive only if they had SGs containing the indicated marker, and the diameter of the biggest SGs in EV71-infected or 2A-expressing cells was at least 1.5 μm (the diameter of the biggest SGs in mock-treated cells was about 3–5 μm).</p>
<p>To distinguish tSGs and aSGs, we treated SG-formed cells with 50 μg/ml CHX (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h before fixation. The tSGs would disassemble, and aSGs would remain; as a positive control, cells were treated with AS (200 μM for 0.5 h) to induce tSG formation and then treated with both CHX and AS for another 1 h. In the GuHCl treatments, HeLa or RD cells were infected with 2 mM GuHCl (Sigma-Aldrich) after viral incubation for 1 h; for Western blotting assays, cells were harvested at 6 hpi, and for IF assays, cells were treated with 200 μM AS in the presence of GuHCl for the final 1 h and fixed at 6 hpi.</p>

To clone full-length eIF4GI (NCBI accession no. NM_001194947.1, isoform 6), the N-terminal coding region (1–203 aa) was generated by chemosynthesis, and the C-terminal coding region (204–1606 aa) was obtained from HeLa cells via RT-PCR; the full-length clone was generated via overlapping PCR and cloned into pHAGE (puro) vector (substituting fluorescent tag in pHAGE-CMV-MCS-IRES-ZsGreen [EvNO00061605] with puromycin) with an HA tag at the C-terminal. The GFP-PABP<sup>M490P/Q540N</sup> mutant was generated by using overlapping PCR; PABP<sup>M490P</sup> was cloned first, and then a Q540N mutation was added.</p>
<p>A plasmid, pCDNA3.0-EV71-CDS, containing completed CDS of EV71 (Hubei-Xiangyang-09, genotype C4) was obtained from Dr. K.L. Wu (State Key Laboratory of Virology, Wuhan University, China).

The 3’-UTR was obtained from the EV71-infected HeLa cells by using RT-PCR (GGAGAGATCCAGTGGGTTAAG and oligo[dT]<sub>18</sub>). A completed genome of the EV71 clone (pCDNA3.0-EV71) was generated via overlapping PCR and cloned into the pCDNA3.0 vector, and it was taken as a template for creating all other clones that contained the region of the EV71 genome. EV71 proteins were obtained via PCR and cloned into the pCAGGS vector. To generate a vector containing an IRES located in multiple clone sites upstream (pCDNA3.0-IRES), the 5’-UTR of EV71 was cloned into the EcoRI–ClaI sites in the pCDNA3.0 vector. The 2A protease and 2A<sup>C110S</sup> were obtained via PCR and cloned into the pCDNA3.0-IRES vector. To clone the 2A protease of EV71-BrCr (NCBI accession no. U22521), PV (NCBI accession no.

<title>Construction and generation of recombinant viruses</title>
<p>The full-length recombinant EV71 infectious clone was constructed into a pBS vector bearing a T7 promoter upstream of the virus genome (pBS-T7-EV71). The 2A protease activity-deficient EV71 infectious clone was constructed using site-directed mutagenesis via overlapping PCR (pBS-T7-EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup>). An IRES structure was inserted between the sequence of VP1 and 2A to counteract the 2A<sup>pro</sup> defect. Constructs were then linearized by restriction enzyme and purified by phenol:chloroform and ethanol precipitation. To package EV71 viruses, viral RNA was transcribed using the TranscriptAid T7 High-Yield Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The viral RNA (2 μg) transcripts were transfected into HeLa cells grown in a monolayer on 6-well plates by using Lipofectamine 2000 for 3 days. The supernatants were passaged on fresh RD cells for further amplification. After 3 days, the supernatants were collected and stored at -80°C, and the cells were collected and divided into two groups, one for Western blotting to confirm the viral infection and the other for RT-PCR and DNA sequencing to confirm the mutation. A single recovered recombinant EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup> was isolated by removing the agar plug during a plaque assay. The agar plug was dissolved in 500 μl of opti-MEM overnight at 4°C, and half was used for EV71-2A<sup>C110S</sup> amplification by infecting RD cell monolayers.
