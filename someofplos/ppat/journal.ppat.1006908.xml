<abstract>
<p>Amino-acid coevolution can be referred to mutational compensatory patterns preserving the function of a protein. Viral envelope glycoproteins, which mediate entry of enveloped viruses into their host cells, are shaped by coevolution signals that confer to viruses the plasticity to evade neutralizing antibodies without altering viral entry mechanisms. The functions and structures of the two envelope glycoproteins of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), E1 and E2, are poorly described. Especially, how these two proteins mediate the HCV fusion process between the viral and the cell membrane remains elusive. Here, as a proof of concept, we aimed to take advantage of an original coevolution method recently developed to shed light on the HCV fusion mechanism. When first applied to the well-characterized Dengue Virus (DENV) envelope glycoproteins, coevolution analysis was able to predict important structural features and rearrangements of these viral protein complexes. When applied to HCV E1E2, computational coevolution analysis predicted that E1 and E2 refold interdependently during fusion through rearrangements of the E2 Back Layer (BL). Consistently, a soluble BL-derived polypeptide inhibited HCV infection of hepatoma cell lines, primary human hepatocytes and humanized liver mice. We showed that this polypeptide specifically inhibited HCV fusogenic rearrangements, hence supporting the critical role of this domain during HCV fusion. By combining coevolution analysis and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, we also uncovered functionally-significant coevolving signals between E1 and E2 BL/Stem regions that govern HCV fusion, demonstrating the accuracy of our coevolution predictions. Altogether, our work shed light on important structural features of the HCV fusion mechanism and contributes to advance our functional understanding of this process. This study also provides an important proof of concept that coevolution can be employed to explore viral protein mediated-processes, and can guide the development of innovative translational strategies against challenging human-tropic viruses.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Several virus-mediated molecular processes remain poorly described, which dampen the development of potent anti-viral therapies. Hence, new experimental strategies need to be undertaken to improve and accelerate our understanding of these processes. Here, as a proof of concept, we employ amino-acid coevolution as a tool to gain insights into the structural rearrangements of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 during virus fusion with the cell membrane, and provide a basis for the inhibition of this process. Our coevolution analysis predicted that a specific domain of E2, the Back Layer (BL) is involved into significant conformational changes with E1 during the fusion of the HCV membrane with the cellular membrane. Consistently, a recombinant, soluble form of the BL was able to inhibit E1E2 fusogenic rearrangements and HCV infection. Moreover, predicted coevolution networks involving E1 and BL residues, as well as E1 and BL-adjacent residues, were found to modulate virus fusion. Our data shows that coevolution analysis is a powerful and underused approach that can provide significant insights into the functions and structural rearrangements of viral proteins. Importantly, this approach can also provide structural and molecular basis for the design of effective anti-viral drugs, and opens new perspectives to rapidly identify effective antiviral strategies against emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Flaviviridae</italic> such as Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Dengue Virus (DENV), Zika Virus (ZIKV) or West Nile Virus (WNV) are cause of several acute and chronic diseases worldwide. The continuous investigation of the molecular processes by which these RNA viruses infect and replicate into their host is critical to develop innovative anti-viral strategies and anticipate viral resistance to pre-existing drugs.</p>
<p>The high potency of viral genomes to mutate is often considered as a major limitation for the development of effective anti-viral strategies. Nevertheless, the high-mutation rate of RNA viruses represents a unique opportunity to decrypt viral protein functions and structures. Highly-evolving viral genomes are shaped by important evolutionary constraints to maintain genetic structure and proper protein folding. Amino-acid coevolution, which refers to mutations of different residues at a similar time frame, mirrors such constraints. Hence, the identification and characterization of coevolution signals imprinted within viral protein sequences can provide unique insights into viral protein functions and conformational changes, and ultimately guide the design of original anti-viral strategies.</p>
<p>Virus entry is a conserved, critical step during the viral life cycle and represents a valuable target for the development of antivirals and vaccines. The entry process of HCV is orchestrated by two envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2, which are incorporated onto the virion surface. During entry, E1E2 mediate viral particle attachment to cell surface receptors and induce the merging (called fusion) of endosomal and virus membranes at acidic pH, thus leading to release of viral RNA into the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref001">1</xref>]. Flaviviruses such as DENV, ZIKV or WNV harbor two envelope glycoproteins: E and PrM. E is a class-II fusion protein composed of three distinct domains (domain I, II and III; or DI, DII and DIII respectively) and carries both binding and membrane fusion properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref002">2</xref>]. Crystal structure of E at different pH allowed to draw a fusion model during which initial E dimers change conformation and fold back as trimer structures to induce membrane merging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref003">3</xref>]. In contrast, how HCV E1 and E2 mediate membrane fusion remains poorly defined. Our understanding of the HCV fusion process is strongly dampened by the absence of a well-defined pre- and post-fusion full-length E1E2 crystal structure. Few studies have attempted to computationally model pre-fusion E1E2 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref005">5</xref>] but their impact remain limited as they have to rely on partial structural and functional information that are often collected in a non-heterodimer context.</p>
<p>The structure of a large region of the E2 ectodomain (E2 core) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref007">7</xref>] exhibits a globular, non-extended fold divided into two distinct sheets: a front sheet composed of a front layer and a central Ig-fold domain, and a back sheet (or back layer, BL). Although the central Ig-fold domain represents a common structure among class-II fusion proteins, the BL harbors an original structure, thus undermining the possibility that HCV E2 is a classical fusion protein. It has been suggested through the resolution of the bovine viral diarrhea pestivirus (BVDV-1) E2 glycoprotein structure that HCV E1 may represent the HCV fusion protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref010">10</xref>]. Several studies have identified a hydrophobic region in E1 (CSALYVGDLC) that could represent the putative HCV fusion peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref016">16</xref>]. Another study also suggested that E1 proteins form trimeric structure at the virus surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref017">17</xref>]. However, the recent crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of HCV E1 ectodomain does not harbor the expected truncated class-II fusion protein fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref018">18</xref>], suggesting that HCV fusion might be a unique process.</p>
<p>Mutagenesis studies have shown that both E1 and E2 domains, as well as E1-E2 dialogs, are involved in the HCV fusion process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref021">21</xref>]. Thus, rather than being mediated by a single glycoprotein, HCV fusion appears to be mediated by complex intra- and inter-molecular E1-E2 dialogs that shape structural and conformational rearrangements of the heterodimer complex. Consequently, the characterization of interplays between E1 and E2 is critical to decipher the HCV fusion mechanism.</p>
<p>Here, using HCV fusion as a model of study, we aimed to provide a proof of concept that amino-acid coevolution and protein evolutionary constraints can shed light on viral protein functions and rearrangements. We hypothesized that detection of E1-E2 coevolution patterns can uncover their functional interplays as well as critical features of the HCV fusion mechanism.</p>
<p>We recently developed an original computational method, <bold>B</bold>locks <bold>I</bold>n <bold>S</bold>equences (BIS), that can robustly detect coevolution signals within conserved cellular and viral proteins using a limited number of protein sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref024">24</xref>]. Taking advantage of this methodology, we aim at establishing a map of E1-E2 coevolution patterns and test whether coevolution analysis can be employed to gain mechanistic insight into poorly characterized viral processes such as HCV fusion. BIS was able to accurately predict features of DENV glycoproteins structural organization onto viral particle, as well as E fusogenic conformational changes. When applied to HCV E1E2, BIS suggested that HCV E2 BL is a critical modulator of HCV fusion. Consistently, a soluble form of the E2 BL was able to inhibit HCV fusion. Moreover, coevolution signals between E1 and E2 BL/Stem predicted by BIS were found to regulate virus fusion <italic>in vitro</italic>. Beyond providing novel insights into the HCV fusion mechanism, our work also demonstrates that coevolution analysis can shed light on viral-mediated processes and can open avenues for the accelerated design of innovative anti-viral compounds against challenging human tropic-viruses.</p>

<title>A computational coevolution-based method recapitulates DENV glycoproteins structural organization</title>
<p>We have previously reported that BIS, a combinatorial-based coevolution analysis method (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s013">S1 Fig</xref></bold>), can accurately detect coevolution signals within a wide range of well-characterized cellular and viral proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref024">24</xref>]. As BIS has not been previously tested for its ability to predict viral envelope glycoproteins structural organization and rearrangements, we first performed a coevolution analysis of the well-characterized DENV envelope glycoproteins, E and PrM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref003">3</xref>]. During virus maturation, M protein (a mainly transmembranous protein) is associated to Pr, a peptide that protect the E fusion peptide and is cleaved prior viral budding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref025">25</xref>]. Briefly, the PrM-E complex protrude as trimer at the surface of immature viral particles in the endoplasmic reticulum, a neutral pH compartment. Immature particle then navigates toward the trans-Golgi network, a more acidic compartment, where PrM-E complex form dimeric structures that lie down onto the surface of the particles. Pr, which initially concealed E fusion peptide, is then cleaved by the Furin. This cleavage achieves the maturation of viral particles that are then released into the extracellular compartment. As M is mostly a transmembrane protein with only very partial structural information available, we aimed to determine whether BIS can recapitulate the diversity of E-Pr structural organization at the surface of immature viral particles. BIS analysis of 17 DENV PrM-E serotype 2 sequences led to the identification of 14 groups of coevolving residues (possibly organized in blocks of consecutive amino-acids), further referred as clusters (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s003">S1 Table</xref></bold>). Among those, three clusters (cluster 2, 7 and 9) displayed a strong statistical significance (with associated p values of 8e-5, 8e-5 and 7e-3 respectively) and involved coevolving blocks between E and Pr. When E is assembled as dimer at low pH condition, cluster 2 coevolving block positions supported the close proximity of E DIII and Pr (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g001">Fig 1A and 1B-left</xref></bold>). Similarly, cluster 7 also recapitulated the close proximity between Pr and E domain DII on a trimeric E-Pr structure that form at neutral pH in the endoplasmic reticulum (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g001">Fig 1A and 1B-center</xref></bold>). On a trimeric Pr-E structure (one dimer + one monomer of PrM-E) found at low pH when particles mature in the trans-Golgi, cluster 9 also supported a close proximity between Pr and E DII, but also between E dimers (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g001">Fig 1A and 1B-right</xref></bold>). Two other clusters (cluster 3 and 8) of strong statistical significance (with respective p values of 1.34e-5 and 4.11e-5) were identified by BIS but did not involve coevolving residues located within E protein (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s003">S1 Table</xref></bold>). Although cluster 8 was composed of two coevolving blocks located within M protein only, clusters 3 involved coevolving residues located within both M and Pr. As cluster 3, cluster 2 and 9 also supported the existence of interactions between Pr and M (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref></bold>). As M and Pr are the two cleavage products of a single PrM protein, these three clusters hence represent additional evidence of BIS ability to recapitulate biologically significant protein interactions. Taken together, our results demonstrate that BIS has the ability to accurately predict the tridimensional assembly of two viral proteins within different conformational states.</p>

<p>As DENV E has been demonstrated to mediate DENV viral fusion, we then aimed to study the intra-protein coevolution signals within DENV E only (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g002">Fig 2A</xref>;</bold> see new E numbering by BIS in comparison to <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>), and determined whether coevolution signals can also predict E fusogenic rearrangements. Using 17 different DENV E serotype 2 sequences, BIS identified 12 clusters (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s004">S2 Table</xref></bold>). Among them, nine clusters (clusters 2–8 and 11,12) displayed associated p-values ranging between 7e-3 to 2e-7 and two clusters (clusters 9 and 10) exhibited associated p-values of 0.058 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s004">S2 Table</xref></bold>). Cluster 1 and 2 were either conserved (p-value = 1) or too large respectively to be considered. Several clusters (3,4,6 and 7) displayed small blocks located within a single region of E both in the linear protein sequence and on the tridimensional structure, suggesting that coevolution signals might contribute to the structural organization of secondary protein sub-domains (such as internal loops) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s014">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). DENV E DI and DII are composed of two or three sub-domains that are distant on the linear protein sequence but form single structured domains in the protein tertiary structure. Cluster 8 blocks were mostly located within the two sub-domains of DII and were consistent with the tridimensional organization of this protein domain (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). Cluster 8 blocks located within the second sub-domain of DII (DII-2) of each E monomer were in close contact on the dimeric E structure (especially at the level of the DII α-helix), hence suggesting that coevolution signals can predict point of contacts between E monomers once organized as dimer (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). Despite lower statistical significance (p&lt;0.06), cluster 9 and 10 coevolving blocks also supported E structural organization as these blocks were distant on the linear structure but close on the E dimer structure (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s014">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). Finally, three clusters (5, 11 and 12) displayed coevolving blocks that were both distant on the linear and tridimensional E structure. During fusion, E DIII folds-over toward DII, and DII becomes at close proximity with the E transmembrane domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref003">3</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g002">Fig 2C</xref></bold>). Cluster 5 and 11 coevolving blocks organization were consistent with these structural rearrangements (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g002">Fig 2C</xref></bold>), suggesting that BIS can recapitulate viral glycoprotein fusogenic conformational changes.</p>

<p>Unlike Dengue E and PrM, the full panel of HCV E2 conformations still remain unknown and E2core only represent a single of these possible conformations, in a given biochemical context. When BIS coevolution analysis is applied to protein(s) for which only a fraction of its/their conformations have been characterized (which is the case for HCV E1 and E2), BIS coevolution clusters can thus only suggest, but not contradict a given conformational hypothesis, this unless the full panel of a protein conformations is known. Consequently, <italic>in vitro</italic> and/or <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments are then critical to ascertain the functional significance of a given conformational hypothesis.</p>
<p>Given this particular experimental context and in order to identify putative E1E2 rearrangements during HCV fusion, we thus adopted the following approach. First, we aimed to assign to each E1E2 cluster a given function by mapping clusters blocks with residues previously identified in the literature to impact E1E2 folding/heterodimerization, binding or fusion. Second, we sought to identify among BIS clusters classified as “fusion clusters” a putative protein rearrangement supported by several fusion clusters across multiple genotypes, prior experimental challenge through <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments.</p>
<p>We first focused our efforts on analyzing gt1a clusters. Detailed analysis of these clusters (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s006">S4 Table</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s015">S3 Fig</xref></bold>; note that BIS numbered E1 and E2 residues by considering the first amino acid of E1 as residue #1) showed E1 as coevolving systematically with all the E2 domains. Plotting the gt1a coevolving blocks onto reference sequences (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s016">S4 Fig</xref></bold>) revealed a strong correlation between blocks and residues previously identified in the literature to be important for heterodimer folding or viral binding site conformation (grouped both under the term “structural”) or fusion. This correlation allowed us to propose functions (structural, fusion, or multifunctional clusters) for most gt1a clusters (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s007">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s008">S6</xref> Tables</bold>). When plotted on the E2core structure (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold>), most fusion clusters involved blocks located within the E2 BL (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>)</bold> in contrast to structural or multifunctional clusters for which blocks were broadly distributed across E2 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s017">S5 Fig</xref></bold>). Interestingly, some of the fusion clusters involved distant blocks in both E1 and E2 (clusters 5,7,10; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref></bold>), highlighting that E1 terminal regions and the E2 BL could be in close proximity during fusogenic rearrangements. In addition, BIS also suggested an association between fusogenic rearrangements and a potential packing of E2 domains (clusters 8,10; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref></bold>). Thus, BIS proposed that interdependent rearrangements of E1 and BL could represent a hallmark of E1E2 fusogenic conformational changes.</p>
<p>Analysis of clusters from another HCV genotype (gt2) provided similar findings as fusion clusters also involved the BL (cluster 10,13) as well as distant blocks on E1 (cluster 6,10) and E2 (cluster 10,16) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g003">Fig 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s018">S6</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s020">S8</xref> Figs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s009">S7</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s011">S9</xref> Tables</bold>). Statistically significant coevolution networks between E1 and BL were also found among genotype 3 sequences (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s021">S9 Fig</xref></bold>). Similar networks were also found among sequences of genotype 4 to 6, but displayed poor statistical significance for the reason described above. Genotype 3 to 6a cluster positions are available through the webpages indicated in the data availability statement.</p>
<p>HCV E1 and E2 transmembrane were previously shown to be critical for E1E2 heterodimerization and correct E1E2 functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref028">28</xref>]. Consistently, BIS was also able to identify several coevolution clusters between the transmembrane of E1 and E2 using sequences of genotype 1 and 2 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s012">S10 Table</xref></bold>), hence strengthening the functional significance of BIS analysis.</p>
<p>In parallel, BIS also revealed several gt1a and gt2 structural and multifunctional clusters as supportive of the E2core central scaffold structure (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s017">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s020">S8</xref> Figs</bold>), reinforcing BIS as a relevant method to model viral protein conformations. The detailed analysis of all the clusters of gt1a and 2, regardless of their attributed function, can be found in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s002">S2</xref> Texts</bold> respectively.</p>
<p>Altogether, BIS coevolution analysis of E1E2 sequences suggested that E2 may adopt a pre-fusion structure distinct from E2core as well as yet unreported molecular rearrangements that could occur during fusion. We hence hypothesized that a movement of the BL (green; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>), through dialogs with E1, could mediate the evolution from a potential stretched E2 pre-fusion structure toward a domain-packed E2 post-fusion structure (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g004">Fig 4B</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>A soluble form of the back layer inhibits HCV infection</title>
<p>To challenge the potential role of the BL in E1E2 rearrangements, we generated a soluble 9kDa 6His-tagged BL domain (71 aa; named BLd-H77; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g004">Fig 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s022">S10A Fig</xref></bold>) from the H77 gt1a strain, detectable through Coomassie blue staining and Western immunoblotting (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref></bold>). Non-reducing SDS-Page electrophoresis and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) analysis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s022">S10B and S10C Fig</xref>)</bold> confirmed the homogeneity of the peptide in solution and suggested that BLd-H77 fold as a monomer. The far UV circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of BLd-H77 eluted from size exclusion chromatography displays the molar ellipticity per residue expected for a protein folded mainly in α-helix (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s022">S10D Fig</xref>).</bold> We next assessed its effect on HCV infection. Interestingly, BLd-H77 was able to inhibit, in a dose-dependent manner, infection of Huh7.5 cells by replicative hepatoma cell line-derived HCV particles (HCVcc) harboring envelope glycoproteins of gt1a (H77/JFH-1) but also gt2a (JC1) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g004">Fig 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s023">S11A Fig</xref></bold>). Although BLd-H77 was able to slightly inhibit HCVcc infection when pre-incubated with cells prior infection, it showed a strong potency to inhibit infection when present during the first four hours of infection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g004">Fig 4G</xref></bold>) thus suggesting that BLd-H77 might likely act on early steps of the virus life cycle. Consistently, BLd-H77 was able to efficiently inhibit infection of Huh7.5 by non-replicative retroviral pseudoparticles harboring HCV E1E2 (HCVpp) from different genotypes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g004">Fig 4H and 4I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s023">S11B Fig</xref></bold>). This inhibition was specific as BLd-H77 was not able to inhibit infection by pseudoparticles harboring VSVG envelope (VSVGpp). Time-course experiments using BLd-H77 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g004">Fig 4I</xref>)</bold> as well as two additional entry inhibitors, Bafilomycin A1 that acts on cell endosome acidification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref029">29</xref>]) and an anti-E2 neutralizing antibody (that binds to E1E2 complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref030">30</xref>]), demonstrated that BLd-H77 is an entry inhibitor that likely acts on viral particles (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s023">S11C Fig</xref></bold>) but not on cells. No effect of BLd-H77 on HCV cell entry receptors expression could be observed (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s023">S11D Fig</xref></bold>). Moreover, BLd-H77 was also able to inhibit cell-to-cell transmission (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s023">S11E Fig</xref></bold>) in addition to cell-free infection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g004">Fig 4F and 4G</xref></bold>). Altogether, these results highlighted that BLd-H77 likely inhibits a conserved mechanism during HCV entry without affecting cell susceptibility for infection. Importantly, BLd-H77 was able to inhibit HCVcc and primary human hepatocytes-derived HCVcc virus (or HCVpc) infection of primary human hepatocytes (PHH) and Huh7.5 respectively (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g004">Fig 4J and 4K</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s023">S11F Fig</xref></bold>). Finally, we assessed the ability of BLd-H77 to inhibit infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. BLd-H77 showed a potency to inhibit HCVcc JC1 infection over time in humanized liver mice treated with 150 μg of BLd-H77 under a prophylactic protocol (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g004">Fig 4L</xref></bold>). Despite their uneven infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref031">31</xref>], our results also suggested that BLd-H77 is able to inhibit patient-derived HCV particles infection in humanized mice p = 0.02 for all quantifiable values equal and above the detection limit) as well as in PHH (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s023">S11G and S11H Fig</xref></bold>). BLd-H77 had no impact on human hepatocyte viability in mice as assessed by serum albumin concentration over the course of infection (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s023">S11I Fig</xref></bold>).

<title>BLd-H77 binds viral particles via E2</title>
<p>We then sought to elucidate how BLd-H77 blocks HCV entry. By pre-incubating viral particles with BLd-H77 and diluting the mix prior to infection to reach a BLd-H77 concentration below its efficient neutralizing activity (determined in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g004">Fig 4F and 4H</xref></bold>), we showed that BLd-H77 could irreversibly neutralize HCV particles regardless of mix dilution, hence suggesting that BLd-H77 can bind native viral particles prior viral entry (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g005">Fig 5A</xref></bold>). To assess the presence of an interaction between HCV particles and the BLd-H77, we constructed a transmembrane form of BLd-H77 (called BLd-tm) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g005">Fig 5B</xref></bold>). Following lentiviral transduction, BLd-tm expression was detectable at Huh7.5-BLd-tm surface (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s024">S12A Fig</xref></bold>), and did not impact HCV receptor expression (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s024">S12B Fig</xref></bold>). BLd-tm expression at Huh7.5 surface, but not expression of a similar construct encoding for an anchored HIV-1 fusion inhibitor (namely C46), inhibited HCVcc propagation both in a cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission manner (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s024">S12C Fig</xref></bold>). HCVpp entry, but not VSVpp entry, (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g005">Fig 5E</xref></bold>) was inhibited following infection of Huh7.5-BLd-tm, hence highlighting that BLd-H77 specifically inhibits HCV entry likely through binding of E1E2 glycoproteins. Consistently, more HCVpp were detected at Huh7.5-BLd-tm cell surface 4h post infection in comparison to Huh7.5 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s024">S12D Fig</xref></bold>), suggesting a potential containment of HCV particles by BLd-tm at the cell surface. The ability of recombinant soluble E2 (sE2) to bind more efficiently Huh7.5-BLd-tm cells than Huh7.5 cells in a dose dependent manner (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g005">Fig 5F</xref></bold>) further suggested that virus entry is inhibited through an interaction between E2 and BLd-tm. In order to explore more precisely a putative interaction between E2 and BLd-H77, we designed an ELISA assay to quantify the ability of sE2 to be captured by coated BLd-H77. Our result showed a significant ability of sE2 to bind coated-BLd-H77 and coated-anti-E2 antibody AR3B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref032">32</xref>] but not a coated-mouse IgG isotype (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g005">Fig 5G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s024">S12E Fig</xref></bold>).

<title>BLd-H77 inhibits virus fusion</title>
<p>Next, we explored which step of HCV entry is inhibited by BLd-H77. BLd-H77 had no significant effect on attachment of HCVcc (HCVcc JC1, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g005">Fig 5H</xref></bold>), HCVpp-H77 particles or soluble E2 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s025">S13A Fig</xref></bold>) on Huh7.5 cells. Using a highly specific and previously established HCVpp binding assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref021">21</xref>], we confirmed that BLd-H77 does not abrogate HCVpp binding to either human CD81 or SR-BI when used at a highly neutralizing concentration (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s025">S13B–S13D Fig</xref></bold>). Moreover, BLd-H77 neutralizing activity was not competing with the activity of a neutralizing anti-E2 antibody known to inhibit viral particle binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref030">30</xref>], and their use in combination showed a synergistic neutralization effect (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s025">S13E Fig</xref></bold>). Consistently, BLd-H77 could bind viral particles following their binding at the cell surface, and was shown to have its more potent neutralizing activity during post-binding steps (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g005">Fig 5I</xref></bold>). Using a cell-cell fusion assay, we showed that BLd-H77 could strongly inhibit cell-to-cell fusion in comparison to control envelope glycoproteins (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g005">Fig 5J</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s026">S14A Fig</xref></bold>). Importantly, cell-to-cell fusion was only inhibited when cells were incubated with BLd-H77 before low pH exposure that activate membrane fusion (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s026">S14B Fig</xref></bold>), underlining BLd-H77 ability to specifically binds E1E2 pre-fusion conformations. Finally, using a HCVpp fusion assay with liposomes, which are devoid of any receptors or cell factors, the BLd-H77 inhibited fusion in a dose-dependent manner (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g005">Fig 5K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s026">S14C Fig</xref></bold>).

<title>E1E2-BL dialog is critical for fusion</title>
<p>Beside highlighting potential E1E2 rearrangements during fusion, BIS can identify pairs of residues that need to mutate in concert to guarantee structural compensations and proper viral fitness. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated how HCV entry depends on strain-specific dialogs between particular E1 and E2 domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref021">21</xref>]. Thus, we aimed at addressing whether BIS is able to unveil specific dialogs between residues of E1 and the E2 BL that modulate HCV fusion. The BIS predictions identified the multifunctional gt2 cluster 5 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s009">S7</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s011">S9</xref> Tables</bold>) as an interesting candidate for supporting E1 and E2 dialogs, BL movements and transition from E1E2 pre-fusion to post-fusion states. This cluster, similar to gt1a fusion cluster 5, linked two central blocks in E1 (residues 104, 105, and 109) and one block in E2 BL (residues 427 to 436; orange; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g006">Fig 6A</xref></bold>). In order to challenge its potential role during fusion, we used cluster 5 blocks to guide the rational design of E1E2 chimeric constructs. The E1 region containing two cluster 5 blocks (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g006">Fig 6B</xref></bold>; Region 1) and E2 BL regions containing the other cluster 5 block (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g006">Fig 6B</xref></bold>; Region 2) or not (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g006">Fig 6B</xref></bold>; Region 3, non-coevolving cluster 5 block as a control of specificity) were swapped between two E1E2 heterodimers from different gt2 strains, one allowing efficient HCVpp entry (J6) and another one mediating sub-optimal HCVpp entry (2b1) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s027">S15A and S15B Fig</xref></bold>). All chimeras were similarly expressed and incorporated (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s027">S15C Fig</xref></bold>). Although J6 chimera carrying 2b1 cluster 5 regions (J6-1/2) displayed a poor entry efficiency, similar to 2b1 parental glycoproteins, a 2b1 chimera carrying J6 cluster 5 regions (2b1-1/2) exhibited &gt;10-fold improved entry ability (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g006">Fig 6C</xref></bold>). In contrast, 2b1 chimera carrying J6 Region 1 and 3 (2b1-1/3; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g006">Fig 6C</xref></bold>) were not optimal for entry, hence suggesting that the E1 cluster 5 blocks and the N-terminal half of the BL domain are involved in a dialog regulating virus entry. Production and titration of HCVcc particles harboring these different chimeric envelopes confirmed these results (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g006">Fig 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s027">S15D Fig</xref></bold>). Interestingly, 2b1-1/2 also displayed improved ability to mediate cell-to-cell fusion (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g006">Fig 6E</xref></bold>) as well as higher fusion efficiency at neutral pH than at acidic pH (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g006">Fig 6F</xref></bold>), suggesting that this chimera exhibited an E1E2 conformation already primed for fusion at neutral pH. In contrast, J6-1/2 chimera did not increase J6 fusion efficiency and abrogated E1E2 sensitivity to low pH at levels similar to those of 2b1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref></bold>). Altogether, consistently with BIS predictions, these results suggest that conserved interplays between the central region of E1 and the N-amino-terminus region of the BL likely govern E1E2 fusogenic conformational states. Our results also support the maintenance of such dialogs through coevolution as they appeared to be mediated by genotype-specific regions of E1 and the BL.</p>

<title>BIS identify genotype 1 coevolving amino acids in E1 and the Stem region that regulate HCV fusion</title>
<p>To extend our transfer between the bioinformatics identification of coevolving amino acid clusters to the functional linkage of these domains, we tested the ability of BIS to pinpoint specific amino acids located in other regions than BL and furthermore, in the context of another genotype than genotype 2 (studied above).

We employed two poorly divergent genotype 1a E1E2 sequences, H77 and A40, that displayed two E1 (SI/GM; position 112 and 117) and one E2 (D/N; position 462) amino acid differences located at the borders of the gt1a fusion cluster 5 blocks (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g007">Fig 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s028">S16A Fig</xref></bold>). Unlike J6 and 2b1, the level of functionality of H77 and A40 were relatively close (2.4x10<sup>4</sup> and 1.6x10<sup>4</sup> GFP i.u. per ml respectively) despite being significantly different (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g007">Fig 7B</xref></bold>), hence making it challenging to predict the influence of residue swaps on envelope functionality. H77 chimera harboring both swapped E1 and E2 A40 residues significantly impacted HCVpp infectivity, although swapped E1 or E2 residues alone did not impact H77 functionality (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g007">Fig 7B</xref></bold>) despite similar E1E2 expression and incorporation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g007">Fig 7C</xref></bold>).

Altogether, consistently with BIS predictions, our results suggest that these E1 and E2 residues −and to larger extend the E1 central region and the E2 stem− are part of a coevolving network that regulates the fusogenic properties of gt1a viral envelope.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>Flaviviridae</italic> are cause of many health concerns worldwide. A better understanding of the molecular processes regulating the life cycle of these viruses is critical for the design of potent anti-viral therapies. By taking advantage of the high-mutation rate of these viruses, coevolution analysis represents a valuable approach to decrypt viral protein functional rearrangements and provide basis for their inhibition. Here, we employed a recent coevolution analysis method, BIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref024">24</xref>] to provide a proof of concept of such approach.</p>
<p>Coevolution signals detected within DENV E and Pr recapitulated several structural features of DENV E/E-Pr protein complexes in different conformational states, hence highlighting the structural accuracy of BIS predictions. Coevolution analysis of HCV E1E2 sequences from several genotypes and sub-types led to the identification of several coevolution signals in HCV E1E2 and suggested that E1 and E2 are strong coevolving partners that refold interdependently during fusion (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g008">Fig 8</xref></bold>). Importantly, the E2 BL emerged as a key element of these rearrangements that could mediate the transition of E1E2 complex from a pre-fusion to a post-fusion conformation. We propose that during this transition, the endogenous E2 BL packs with the front sheet of E2. Thus, a recombinant soluble BLd-H77 could compete with the endogenous E2 BL and block HCV fusogenic rearrangements, then leading to inhibition of membrane fusion (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g008">Fig 8</xref></bold>). Such competition is consistent with the idea that E2 may harbor a stretched pre-fusion structure exposing internal epitopes. The existence of other E2 structures is also supported by the ability of neutralizing antibodies to target an epitope that is not exposed in the E2core structure (i.e. aa305-324 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref033">33</xref>]). Whether the entire BLd-H77 or specific BL amino acids regions are sufficient to inhibit HCV fusion remain to be determined. However, a recent study aiming to screen E2-derived peptide inhibiting HCV infection did not identify peptides within the BL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref034">34</xref>], suggesting that a large fraction of the BL, instead of a specific amino acid region, is likely to be required to inhibit HCV entry. This hypothesis reinforces the idea of a physical, but not functional, competition between the endogenous BL and BLd-H77. Our work also suggests that the E2 BL acts in close collaboration with E1 and that these domains are probably in close proximity in E1E2 heterodimer. Indeed, E2core structure is highly concealed by glycans at the exception of the BL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref007">7</xref>]. This, combined with the fact that E1 and BL do not seem to represent preferential targets of anti-HCV neutralizing antibodies, suggests that the BL region and E1 may conceal respective epitopes. The critical interplay between BL and E1 during fusion was also demonstrated at the amino acid level, as BIS was able to accurately identify coevolution signals between specific residues of E1 and the BL that tightly regulate HCV fusion (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g008">Fig 8</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>BIS as a methodology to decrypt virus entry mechanisms.</title>
<p>Schematic representation of the experimental approach employed in this study, from BIS computational analysis to the design and challenge of a mechanistic model of viral fusion. Following sequence analysis, matrix of E1E2 amino-acid coevolution were generated by BIS for different HCV genotypes. Plotting of matrix coevolution networks onto E2core structure unveiled a potential scenario of E1 and E2 rearrangements during HCV fusion, which involved the BL domain of E2. At the protein domain level, the construction of a soluble form of the BL and the conduction of several experimental assays supported such hypothesis. In parallel, at the amino acid level, the experimental validation of coevolution signals between specific residues of E1 and of the BL highlighted the critical role of E1-BL networks in regulating fusogenic rearrangements (and more generally, the critical role of coevolving networks between E1 and E2 C-terminal regions). Altogether, this approach allows us to propose a HCV fusion model where BL movements and E1 refolding are critical in the induction of E1E2 interdependent, fusogenic rearrangements. By being applicable to other viral proteins and viruses, such approach provides opportunities to uncover undescribed viral-mediated mechanisms and design innovative translational strategies for their inhibition.</p>

<p>By employing an original multi-disciplinary approach combining computational analysis and experimental assays, our work sheds light on potentially important structural and functional features of the HCV fusion mechanism. Although the clear roles of E1 and E2 during the HCV fusion process still remain to be better defined through the structural resolution of the E1E2 heterodimer at different pH, our work initiates a path toward an experimentally-supported model for HCV-cell fusion.</p>
<p>In this putative model, E1 would play the role of a fusion protein protruding onto the virus surface whereas E2 would be a receptor binding protein and a fusion chaperone concealing E1 epitopes. Although E2core is a truncated E2 protein and may not exhibit full E2 properties, E2core does not respond to pH variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref006">6</xref>]. This, combined with the fact that E2 does not harbor fusion protein structural features, could suggest that E2 needs to be associated with E1 to undergo conformational changes and to chaperone E1 fusion-promoting rearrangements. Interestingly, non-conserved E1 residues swapped between the J6 and 2b1 envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g006">Fig 6</xref>) were located at a very close proximity upstream of the putative E1 fusion peptide (CSALYVGDLC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref016">16</xref>]. This result may suggest that the interaction of these E1 residues with E2 BL could participate to critical E1-E2 rearrangements leading to the fusion peptide insertion into the endosomal membrane. Following receptor priming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref035">35</xref>] and insertion of a putative E1 fusion peptide into the endosomal membrane, HCV fusion could be triggered by a fold-over of the C-terminal domain of E1 toward its N-terminal domain. This rearrangement could be mediated by E2 BL movements, or alternatively, could promote E2 BL movements. Overall, this interdependent refolding would result in the packing of the BL and of the E2 C-terminal region toward the E2 front sheet, and to the fusion of the host and viral membranes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g008">Fig 8</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>The Ig-fold β-sandwich structure of E2core has been proposed to display similarities with domain III or B from class II fusion proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref007">7</xref>]. By chaperoning E1 fold-over and membrane fusion, our results support that E2 function could be related to a domain III-like, as recently suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref036">36</xref>]. Further structural studies aiming to resolve the full structure of the entire HCV heterodimer in pre- and post-fusion conformations will be needed to decipher the integral fusogenic rearrangements. Despite the fact that the structural differences detected for pestivirus E2 vs. HCV E2 glycoproteins makes unlikely that these viruses harbor a similar fusion mechanism, it is possible that their E1 proteins could be derived from a common ancestor and represent so far a potential new class of fusion protein as suggested by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref018">18</xref>]. Thus, although the resolution of the E2core structure has undermined the role of E2 as a fusion protein, HCV fusion is likely mediated by two interdependent partners that display original structures and conformational changes. To our knowledge, our data provide unique evidence that a component (in this case, the BL) derived from a receptor-binding protein with no fusion peptide can modulate viral fusion rearrangements, hence highlighting HCV fusion as a unique mechanism among known enveloped viruses.</p>
<p>A primary limitation of current coevolution analysis approaches relies on the availability of a large number of sufficiently divergent evolutionarily-related sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref037">37</xref>]. Such sets of sequences constitute the bottleneck for today’s coevolution analysis methods. We have shown previously that BIS can overcome these limitations and can address coevolution of conserved sequences such as viral genotype sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref024">24</xref>]. Consistently, we failed to detect coevolution signals within our sets of E1E2 sequences when employing other existing coevolution methods (such as DCA, PSICOV and EVcouplings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref040">40</xref>]), methods that we previously discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>In strong contrast to our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref023">23</xref>] that was critical to understand the computational power of coevolution analysis applied to viral sequences, our current study goes beyond the speculative and computational predictions and is fundamental is several ways. First, exploring coevolution signals when no or little structural and functional information are available remain highly challenging and hamper the delineation of undescribed viral protein-mediated processes. As coevolution signals imply structural or functional associations between coevolving residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref023">23</xref>], our work shows that the BIS method is able to successfully highlight E1E2 contacts that likely orchestrate structural rearrangements of the heterodimer complex. In this respect, our work constitutes an important demonstration of BIS ability to decode structural features of major conformational change in proteins families characterized by few and conserved sequences. Hence, our work provides evidence that computational analysis of coevolution with BIS can be fruitfully used to find direct (and possibly indirect) contacts between proteins where the three-dimensional structure and rearrangements of protein complexes are not known. Second, it demonstrates that coevolution analysis can highlight the existence of conformational changes in proteins through pairs of coevolving residues that are not in contact in the known crystal structure. Many of the coevolution analysis tools developed in recent years (such as DCA and DCA-like approaches) are detecting “direct contacts” and justify their success by using the 3D crystal as their evidence of true positive predictions. In our study, we show that this idea only represents a part of the truth. Proteins are more complex systems, undergoing different structural conformations during their lifetime, and that evolutionary signals code not only for direct interaction but also for intermediate folding states and alternative structural conformations. Third, we advance in the comprehension of how computational techniques can be used to help revealing protein “contacts” that are biologically interesting, within and among structures. Finally, we provide experimental evidence of the biological significance of the coevolution signals for viral genotype sequences, hence allowing for a rapid identification of critical residue contacts regulating protein functions and conformations.</p>
<p>Beyond uncovering important features of the HCV fusion mechanism, our study provides altogether a proof of concept that coevolution can be successfully harnessed to decrypt viral protein rearrangements and interactions, as well as to expand our knowledge of viral proteins-mediated biological processes. Virus entry mechanisms and envelope glycoproteins conserved epitopes represent valuable targets for the development of drugs and innovative vaccine strategies against challenging human pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref046">46</xref>]. By unscrambling key protein interactions or rearrangements, our work demonstrates that coevolution predictions can be of considerable value for stimulating a fast-tracked design and screening of innovative translational approaches and antiviral strategies unimpeded by virus plasticity.</p>

<title>BLd-H77 construction</title>
<p>In order to construct a relevant BLd soluble peptide derived from a genotype 1a sequence, we took into account the BL borders previously suggested (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006908.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold>, see also reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref007">7</xref>]), but also aimed to refine these borders using the locations of BIS coevolution networks of genotype 1a. Indeed, BIS suggested that a 15 amino acids extension from residue 390 to 405, classified previously as an undefined domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref007">7</xref>] between the central Ig scaffold and the E2 BL, contained blocks (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s016">S4 Fig</xref></bold>, block 7–1) that coevolve with another region of the BL (block 7–2), forming altogether a fusion cluster (cluster 7). Hence, in order to rigorously challenge BIS predictions that suggested a potential redefinition of the BL, we constructed a soluble BLd peptide from residue 390 to 460. Hence, DNA sequence of HCV E2 coding for the residues 390 to 640 was amplified from a genotype 1a envelope H77 (AF009606) cDNA sequence. This sequence was subcloned into a phCMV plasmid to fuse the last 18 amino acids from the C-term part of HCV core that act as a signal peptide, and a CH3-terminal 6 Histidine-tag was added. The resulting peptide of 77 amino acids (71+6) was then named as BLd-H77.</p>

<p>PHH were washed and infected by JC1 HCVcc virus at different m.o.i. (0,005; 0,001; 0,05; 0,1). 4 days post infection, cell culture supernatants were harvested and used to infect naïve Huh7.5. Infectious titers were revealed through NS5A immunostaining 4 days post infection as described above. Indirect titrations were performed as infected PHH were poorly detectable through NS5A immunostaining, making the indirect titration the only accurate method to quantify the amount of infectious viral particles (and not physical viral particles) in a PHH-cell culture supernatant. For neutralization assay, JC1 virus or JC1-derived HCVpc were pre-incubated with BLd-H77 (10, 20 and 40 μg/ml) or with PBS for 1h prior PHH (m.o.i. 0,05) or Huh7.5 infection respectively (m.o.i. 0,01 and 0,02). 4 days post infection, infectious titers of PHH cell culture supernatants were determined by infecting Huh7.5 as described above. In parallel, infectious titers of JC1-derived HCVpc following Huh7.5 infection were quantified as described above. Sera containing HCV particles were used to infect PHH at a m.o.i. of 0,1 following BLd-H77 (30 μg/ml) or PBS preincubation for 1h at room temperature. 4 days post infection, cell culture supernatants were harvested and viral loads (RNA copies number/ml) were determined by RT-qPCR using a clinical diagnostic kit (Abbot Real Time™ HCV assay) with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 12 IU/mL (i.e. 51.6 HCV RNA copies/ml). Given a serum dilution of 1:100 in PBS, LOQ = 5160 HCV RNA copies/ml.</p>

<p>Binding assays were performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref021">21</xref>]. Briefly, 50μl of concentrated virus (100x) or 100 ul of concentrated soluble E2 (100x) were pre-incubated with BLd-H77 (50 μg/ml) or with PBS for 1h at room temperature. Then, pseudoparticles or soluble E2 were mixed with Huh7.5, BRL, BRL-CD81 or BRL-human SR-BI in presence of 0.1% sodium azide for 1h at 37°C. Cells were then washed with PBFA (PBS, 2% fetal bovine serum, and 0.1% sodium azide). Bound viruses were detected using the mouse H53 anti-HCV E2 antibody and soluble E2 was detected using either the H53 antibody or a rabbit 6His-tag antibody for 1h at 4°C. After washing, primary antibodies were quantified by flow cytometry (FACS Canto II, BD Biosciences) using APC goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin-G. In parallel, concentrated HCVpp were pre-incubated with 50 μg/ml of BLd-H77 and used to infect Huh7.5 in order to verify the neutralizing effect of BLd-H77 on the entry of concentrated HCVpp. For BLd-H77 binding assay, BLd-H77 (50 μg/ml) or PBS were mixed with Huh7.5 for 1h at 37°C prior 6His-tag staining using a rabbit 6His-tag antibody.</p>

Because of their lethal phenotype, mice are maintained on 8 mg/l of NTBC (nitro-4-trifluoro-methylbenzoylcyclohexanedione) in the drinking water. 48h prior the engraftment, adult (6–10 weeks old) mice were injected intravenously with 2x10<sup>9</sup> p.f.u. of an adenoviral vector encoding the uPA transgene. 7x10<sup>5</sup> to 1x10<sup>6</sup> PHH (BD Biosciences) were injected intrasplenically as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref055">55</xref>]. Immediately after engraftment, the NTBC was progressively withdrawn as follow: 2 days at 10% of colony maintenance concentration, then 2 days at 5%, 2 days at 2.5%, then the NTBC was completely removed. During the phase without NTBC, mice were weighted every two days. After 2–6 weeks, mice with clinical symptoms (lethargy, hunched posture) or severe weight loss (&gt;15%) were put again on NTBC for 3 days before second withdrawal (cycling). Cycling was repeated until clinical symptoms resolved. In order to prevent the development of a murine hepatocellular carcinoma, highly reconstituted mice selected for infectious experiments were subjected to further NTBC treatment (3–4 weeks w/o NTBC and 3 days with 100%).</p>

<title>BIS coevolution analysis of HCV E1E2 sequences.</title>
<p>Ten groups of sequences were assembled and analyzed independently with the BIS method. Groups were constituted of E1E2 sequences from HCV types and sub-types from genotype 1a to 6a. Groups of sequences from genotypes 1 and 2 were constituted by pools of sequences from subtypes 1a and 1b (50 sequences) and sequences of genotypes 2a and 2b (30 sequences). Total numbers of detected clusters for each genotype and sub-type is reported, as well as the number of statistically significant clusters among them (when p&lt;0.05). For each group of sequence, we also report the number of statistically significant clusters only involving E1 positions (“intra-E1”), the number of clusters only involving E2 positions (“intra-E2”), and the number of clusters across E1 and E2 (“inter-E1-E2”). The assignment of a given cluster block to E1 or E2 was determined by mapping the reference genome sequence of genotype 1b (accession: AJ238799) to the multiple sequence alignment, for each genotype. E1 and E2 were identified on AJ238799 at positions 192–383 and 384–746, respectively.

Genotype 1a clusters harboring blocks that mapped residues previously reported in the literature to have a specific function (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006908.s016">S4 Fig</xref></bold>) are classified. The known role(s) are indicated: Folding or heterodimerization (blue), viral binding site conformation (green) or fusion mechanism (red). According to these roles, clusters are categorized into three different categories: structural (Folding, heterodimerization and viral binding site conformation), fusion or multifunctional cluster.

<title>BIS methodology for coevolution analysis.</title>
<p>Coevolution analyses require the identification of sequence variability and they are usually realized on families of homologous protein sequences, typically very divergent and represented by a large number of sequences. In contrast, studying viral sequences requires methods that can analyze serotypes and genotypes, usually constituted by a limited number of conserved sequences. BIS allows to track small parallel changes likely corresponding to compensatory patterns preserving the structure and function of the protein. Given a sequence alignment, the coevolution analysis method Blocks In Sequences (BIS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref024">24</xref>] identifies groups of residues where mutations are present, at the same time, in the same sequences. BIS allows to track small parallel changes likely corresponding to compensatory patterns preserving the structure and function of the protein. BIS first detects coevolution among each pair of alignment positions (left) and associates a coevolution score to the pairs. At different colors match different coevolution scores (from red for high coevolution score to blue for none). A coevolution score matrix between all alignment positions is constructed (top right) and clustered in such a way that groups of positions displaying the same coevolution scores with all other positions in the alignment are identified (bottom right). The schema illustrates two clusters made of four blocks (cluster A and B). Each cluster is composed of blocks displaying a similar pattern of coevolution scores (here represented by a similar color pattern). Cluster A is constituted by six positions organized in four blocks, three of them corresponding to single residue positions and one of them made of three consecutive residue positions. Cluster B is made of four positions organized in four blocks, one of them corresponding to single residue positions and three of them to two or three consecutive residue positions. For both clusters, blocks belong to either E1 or E2 protein. An illustration of how these blocks can be displayed on a linear sequence (E1) or on a protein structure (E2core) is shown. This figure has been adapted from the figure 2 of the reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006908.ref023">23</xref>].</p>

<title>BLd-H77 transmembranous form inhibits HCV infection.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cell surface staining of C46 and BLd-tm following transduction of Huh7.5. Expression of C46 and BLd-tm (white) was measured by flow cytometry using an anti-hinge human IgG2 antibody and compared to the level of expression within non-transduced Huh7.5 (Grey). (<bold>B</bold>) CD81, SR-BI, Claudin-1 and Occludin expression within Huh7.5 (left column) and Huh7.5 expressing the transmembranous form of the BLd-H77 (Huh7.5-BLd-tm) (right column) cells. Cells were fixed, permeabilized (only for Occludin staining) and stained for the different HCV receptors with (white areas) or without (grey areas) receptor-specific antibody. Expression levels were then determined by flow cytometry. Data are representative of two independent experiments. (<bold>C</bold>) Effect of BLd-tm expression on cell-to-cell viral spread. Huh7.5, Huh7.5-C46, Huh7.5-BLd-tm cells were infected by H77/JFH-1 HCVcc. Four days post-infection, average number of cells per foci were determined for each cell type (mean ± SD; n = 3). ***<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, ns non-significant. (<bold>D</bold>) Retention of HCVpp particles at the Huh7.5-BLd-tm cell surface. Huh7.5 (left) and Huh7.5-BLd-tm (right) were infected with H77 HCVpp particles. Presence of HCV E2 at the cell surface was quantified by flow cytometry using anti-E2 H53 antibody. Gating were set up on non-infected Huh7.5 (left) and Huh7.5-BLd-tm (right). Data are representative of two independent experiments. (<bold>E</bold>) Interaction between BLd-H77 and sE2 detected by ELISA. Different amounts of mouse IgG isotype, AR3B and BLd-H77 were coated overnight into 96-well plates. Coated peptides and antibodies were then incubated with 10ng of soluble E2 (sE2). After washing, soluble E2 was detected using the anti-E2 antibody 3/11 or a rat isotype IgG antibody. Following incubation with an anti-rat HRP antibody, 3/11 binding specificity to E2 was determined by calculating the ratio of O.D. between condition using 3/11 antibody and the rat isotype IgG antibody, for each coating condition (mean ± SD; n = 3). ****<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, ns non-significant.</p>

Statistical significances represent the significant differences between pH5 and pH7 condition, for each viral envelope and treatment (PBS or BLd-H77). (<bold>B</bold>) Inhibitory effect of the BLd-H77 prior and following pH shock. Co-cultures were either pre-incubated with BLd-H77 (50μg/ml, 2) for 1h prior pH shock (pH5), for 24h following pH shock (50μg/ml, 3) or both (4). As a control, co-cultures were pre-incubated with PBS for 1h prior pH shock, followed by an additional 24h incubation (1). 24h later, cells were washed and incubated for 48h. Relative fusion efficiency at pH5 between control (pre- and post-treated by PBS) and the different BLd-H77 incubation periods are indicated (mean ± SD; n = 3). Statistical significances <italic>(</italic>*<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, ***<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, ns non-significant) were determined for each experimental condition versus control condition (100%). (<bold>C</bold>) Specificity of HCVpp-liposome fusion assay. No enveloped HCVpp, H77 HCVpp, fusion mutant E1E2 HCVpp particles and HANApp particles (Retroviral particles pseudotyped with Influenza Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase) were mixed with R18-labelled liposomes. Dequenching of R18 was quantified following sample acidification (pH5) over 5 minutes (300 seconds). Data are represented as non-linear polynomial fitted curves and display the evolution of the fusion rate from the time of acidification, relatively to the HCVpp-H77 fusion rate which has been normalized at 100% at 300s post acidification. Curves are representative of three independent experiments.</p>
