<abstract>
<p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RNA synthesis occurs in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (IBs) in which all the components of the viral RNA polymerase are concentrated. In this work, we show that RSV P protein recruits the essential RSV transcription factor M2-1 to IBs independently of the phosphorylation state of M2-1. We also show that M2-1 dephosphorylation is achieved by a complex formed between P and the cellular phosphatase PP1. We identified the PP1 binding site of P, which is an RVxF-like motif located nearby and upstream of the M2-1 binding region. NMR confirmed both P-M2-1 and P-PP1 interaction regions in P. When the P–PP1 interaction was disrupted, M2-1 remained phosphorylated and viral transcription was impaired, showing that M2-1 dephosphorylation is required, in a cyclic manner, for efficient viral transcription. IBs contain substructures called inclusion bodies associated granules (IBAGs), where M2-1 and neo-synthesized viral mRNAs concentrate. Disruption of the P–PP1 interaction was correlated with M2-1 exclusion from IBAGs, indicating that only dephosphorylated M2-1 is competent for viral mRNA binding and hence for a previously proposed post-transcriptional function.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract illness in infants. Since no vaccine and no potent antivirals are available against RSV, it is essential to better understand the mechanisms of viral replication to develop new antiviral strategies. Here we have investigated the mechanisms by which two essential components of the viral RNA polymerase machinery, the phosphoprotein P and the M2-1 transcription factor, interact and function. We identified the amino acid residues of P critical for this interaction and showed that they are required for P recruiting M2-1 to cytoplasmic inclusions, where viral polymerase complex proteins concentrate and viral RNA synthesis occurs. We also showed that M2-1 dephosphorylation, required for viral transcription, is achieved by a complex formed between P and the cellular phosphatase PP1. The region of P binding to PP1 is located nearby and upstream of the M2-1 binding domain. This is the first report showing that the phosphoprotein of a negative strand RNA virus can hijack a cellular phosphatase to modulate the phosphorylation state of its partners. These two P regions interacting with M2-1 and PP1 are also potential targets for future antiviral therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of severe respiratory tract infections in infants worldwide and the primary cause of infant hospitalization for respiratory infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref001">1</xref>]. In addition, RSV is increasingly recognized as a significant cause of disease in the elderly population and can often be fatal for patients with a compromised immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref002">2</xref>]. The virus belongs to the <italic>Orthopneumovirus</italic> genus of the <italic>Pneumoviridae</italic> family, order <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref003">3</xref>]. The RSV genome is a single strand, negative sense RNA of about 15 kb that is packaged by the nucleoprotein (N) and maintained as a left-handed helical N-RNA ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref006">6</xref>]. This RNP is the template for two distinct activities: RNA replication that generates genomic and antigenomic RNA, which is encapsidated by N immediately after synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref008">8</xref>], and RNA transcription that generates 10 capped and poly-adenylated mRNAs, which are not encapsidated by N. Both activities are carried out by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex (RdRp) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref009">9</xref>]. The viral N, P (phosphoprotein) and L (large polymerase) proteins are the essential components of the RdRp. RSV P is the main cofactor of the large polymerase L protein. In particular, by interacting with L and the RNP, P is essential to properly position the L protein for RNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>RSV transcription is dependent on a fourth viral protein, M2-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref011">11</xref>]. The transcriptase complex first engages promoter sequences that lie at the 3’ end of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref012">12</xref>]. Transcription proceeds through sequential stop-and-restart events, in which the RdRp recognizes gene start (GS) and gene end (GE) sequences, that flank each gene and direct initiation and termination of transcription, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref013">13</xref>]. The transcriptase complex has the propensity to dissociate from the RNP template, but cannot reinitiate at a downstream gene after a premature termination. This leads to a decreasing gradient of mRNA from the 3’ to the 5’ end of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref014">14</xref>]. In contrast, the highly processive replicase bypasses GS and GE signals to produce complete genomic and antigenomic RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref015">15</xref>]. The exact mechanism of how RdRp differentiates between transcription and replication still remains unknown.</p>
<p>By increasing the processivity of the RdRp complex, RSV transcription antiterminator protein M2-1 prevents premature transcription termination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref017">17</xref>]. For this activity, M2-1 has to be recruited to cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (IBs), which contain other components of the RdRp complex, notably N, P and L, and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref020">20</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref021">21</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref022">22</xref>]. Moreover we recently showed that IBs are a place of viral RNA synthesis and that M2-1 and viral mRNAs concentrate in IB substructures called IB associated granules (IBAGs), from which N, P, L and genomic RNA are absent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref020">20</xref>]. M2-1 is a 22 kDa basic protein that forms stable tetramers in solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref024">24</xref>]. Each protomer features an N-terminal zinc finger domain, an α-helical tetramerization motif, and a C-terminal α-helical core domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref024">24</xref>]. M2-1 is an RNA binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref025">25</xref>] that binds preferentially to RSV mRNAs and A-rich sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref026">26</xref>]. RSV M2-1 can also interact with RSV P. We showed previously that substitution of M2-1 residues involved in the M2-1–P interaction prevented the recruitment of M2-1 to IBs, suggesting that formation of a P–M2-1 complex is critical for M2-1 recruitment to IBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref019">19</xref>]. Since M2-1 interacts with RNA and P in a competitive manner through the core domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref023">23</xref>], it is expected that these interactions are regulated in a cyclic manner.</p>
<p>In RSV-infected cells M2-1 exists in different phosphorylation states, resulting in its migration as two major bands in SDS-PAGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref029">29</xref>]. The slower-migrating species contains phosphorylated M2-1, whereas the faster-migrating species lacks significant phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref027">27</xref>]. In RSV infected cells or when co-expressed with P, M2-1 protein remains mainly unphosphorylated, whereas M2-1 is mainly phosphorylated when expressed alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref025">25</xref>]. Using recombinant (unphosphorylated) M2-1 produced in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, it has also been shown that M2-1 can be phosphorylated <italic>in vitro</italic> by casein kinase I on serines S58 and S61 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref026">26</xref>]. Abolishing phosphorylation of these residues by alanine substitution impaired the antitermination function of M2-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref026">26</xref>]. However, the P–M2-1 interaction appears to be independent of the phosphorylation status of M2-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref023">23</xref>]. On the other hand, phosphorylated M2-1 has reduced RNA binding capacities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref025">25</xref>]. All these data point to the critical role of dynamic and reversible M2-1 phosphorylation for its function in transcription.</p>
<p>Neither P nor M2-1 produced in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> are phosphorylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref031">31</xref>]. These two unphosphorylated proteins interact together and have been used previously to study the P–M2-1 interactions <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref032">32</xref>]. In P, the region encompassing residues 100–120 and more specifically residues L101, Y102, and F109 were reported to be critical for the M2-1–P interaction and for efficient transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref033">33</xref>]. It was also shown that P residue T105 is probably involved in M2-1 binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref034">34</xref>]. P can be phosphorylated on several serine and threonine residues with different turnover rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref039">39</xref>]. In particular phosphorylation of T108, which occurs with a high-turnover, would prevent M2-1 binding. However, the role of P phosphorylation remains unclear, since phosphorylation is not required for viral transcription or replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref041">41</xref>]. Here we further investigated structural and functional aspects of the M2-1–P interaction. We show that a region encompassing residues 93–110 of P is required for the presence of M2-1 in IBs. We further identified another element, located upstream of this region which is responsible for M2-1 dephosphorylation. We show that this region is involved in the binding of the cellular protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) to P, but not in M2-1 binding, and that the complex formed by P and PP1 is responsible for M2-1 dephosphorylation, a key process for efficient viral transcription.</p>

<title>Mapping of M2-1<sub>core</sub> interaction regions on P by NMR</title>
<p>We previously mapped the interaction surface of RSV P on the core domain of M2-1 (M2-1<sub>core</sub>, residues 58–177) by NMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref019">19</xref>], by observing spectral perturbations, at a residue-specific level, induced by unlabeled P on <sup>15</sup>N-labeled M2-1<sub>core</sub>. RSV P forms highly stable tetramers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref043">43</xref>], with large N- and C-terminal intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) flanking the oligomerization domain (residues 126–163) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref032">32</xref>]. We recently analyzed the propensities of these IDRs to form transient secondary structures and to transiently associate, either with each another or with the N protein, also by NMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref044">44</xref>]. Here we proceeded to determine the M2-1 binding region in P.</p>
<p>Both P and M2-1, produced in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, were unphosphorylated. We compared <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N spectra of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled P in the absence and presence of unlabeled M2-1<sub>core</sub>. The presence of M2-1<sub>core</sub> induced a significant decrease of NMR signal intensities, or line broadening, in a region spanning residues 90–120 in the N-terminal IDR of P, upstream of the oligomerization domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). This finding is in agreement with the previous localization of residues critical for M2-1 binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref034">34</xref>]. The binding region includes an extremely transient α-helix detected in free P (α<sub>N2</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref044">44</xref>]. It is expected that in the M2-1–P complex, the α<sub>N2</sub> region adopts the molecular tumbling properties of the globular M2-1<sub>core</sub>, which results in increased transverse relaxation and hence line broadening. But this cannot explain that the signal is fully broadened out. A Kd of 3 μM was previously determined for the M2-1–P complex by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref019">19</xref>]. It is compatible with exchange on a μs-ms timescale between free and M2-1<sub>core</sub>-bound P, which contributes to line broadening. Additional broadening probably arises from conformational exchange taking place between partially folded states of the α<sub>N2</sub> helix, which may all contribute to M2-1<sub>core</sub> binding.</p>

<p>We also carried out NMR interaction experiments between M2-1<sub>core</sub> and two <sup>15</sup>N-labeled P fragments, P[1–126] and P[1–163], which were designed for previous characterization and interaction experiments with N by NMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref044">44</xref>]. They both comprise the 90–120 region. P[1–126] is a monomeric fragment that represents the N-terminal IDR of P. P[1–163] additionally contains the oligomerization domain of P and displays a similar behavior to full-length P, with nearly complete line broadening in the α<sub>N2</sub> region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Surprisingly, in P[1–126] a second region is perturbed at the N-terminus of P (residues 23–37) at a lesser extent. This region overlaps with the N<sup>0</sup>-binding site of P, which contains another transient α-helix (α<sub>N1</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref045">45</xref>]. Notably, in N<sup>0</sup>-P interaction experiments using RNA-free N, we had observed the symmetrical scenario: N not only induced line broadening in the N<sup>0</sup>-binding region, but also to a lesser extent in the M2-1-binding region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref044">44</xref>]. We cannot rule out that a direct interaction takes place in both cases at a second binding site. However, since we evidenced transient contacts between these two regions in free P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref044">44</xref>], the perturbations observed at the second site may indirectly arise from breaking of internal contacts to expose the primary binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref044">44</xref>]. Finally, from the interaction experiment with P[1–126], it appears that the primary interaction region is probably restricted to residues 90–112, since residues 113–120 are no longer completely broadened out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The presence of the oligomerization domain in full-length P and P[1–163] can affect nuclear relaxation in this region by restricting motions due to steric hindrance or by promoting an extension of either α<sub>N2</sub> or the coiled-coil helices of the oligomerization domain.</p>

<title>Effect of targeted P gene substitutions on M2-1 controlled transcription</title>
<p>In order to identify the P residues critical for P–M2-1 interaction, we used a functional assay based on a firefly luciferase (Luc) reporter RSV minigenome. In this system transcription of the second gene coding for Luc is absolutely dependent on the P–M2-1 interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref023">23</xref>]. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on residues V85 to E115, encompassing the P93-D110 region. Ala substitution of seven mainly hydrophobic residues, F87, F98, L101, Y102, T105, I106 and F109, had a drastic effect on RSV transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Western blot shows that the drop in transcription efficiency was not due to a defect in expression of the P variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Among these, L101, Y102, T105 and F109 had been shown previously to be involved in the P–M2-1 interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref034">34</xref>]. The phosphomimetic T108D variant impaired transcription, in contrast to T108A.

<title>Impact of mutations of P on the intracellular localization of M2-1</title>
<p>When co-expressed in the absence of other viral proteins, RSV P and N proteins induce the formation of cytoplasmic IBs similar to those observed during RSV infection, where N and P co-localize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref018">18</xref>]. When co-expressed with P and N, M2-1 also localizes preferentially in these IBs, which has been linked to its interaction with P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref019">19</xref>]. We thus analyzed the impact of the P mutations identified as critical for RdRp activity on the intracellular localization of M2-1 by fluorescence microscopy. Cells were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding P (WT and variants), N and M2-1-mCherry. All tested P variants were able to induce the formation of IBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The M2-1-mCherry fusion protein accumulated in IBs in the presence of wild type (WT) P. M2-1 was also present in the IBs in the presence of P variant T108A, which did not impact transcription in the minigenome assay. In contrast, M2-1 was absent from the IBs for P variants that were defective for RdRp activity, F98A, L101A, Y102A, T105A, T105D, I106A, T108D and F109A, with the notable exception of F87A. It must be specified that mCherry fusion at the C-terminus of M2-1 does not affect the polymerase activity in the context of the minigenome, since ~ 70% of activity was recovered, as compared to WT M2-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006920.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). These results show that there is a good correlation between the presence of M2-1 in IBs and RdRp activity, except for F87A.

<p>We hypothesized that the M2-1 binding region in P, which displays helical propensity in solution folds into a stable helix upon M2-1—P complex formation, and we docked a structural model of the P helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, green) onto the structure of M2-1<sub>core</sub> under constraints obtained by mutagenesis and NMR interaction data. We have shown previously that the P binding site on M2-1 forms a groove between helices α4 and α6 and that the interaction surface on M2-1 is composed of hydrophobic residues (V127, L152, V156), neutral (N129, T130, S133) and basic residues (R126, R151) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref019">19</xref>]. M2-1 R126D and L148A variants completely impaired P binding as well as its recruitment to cytoplasmic IBs. Critical P residues determined in the present study are rather hydrophic or neutral. However a 50% decrease in minigenome activity was observed for P variants D95A and D110A. These two acidic residues are at the edge of the P region involved in the interaction with M2-1 and could thus also play a role in this interaction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Altogether our observations strongly suggest that the binding surfaces of P and M2-1 involve both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions.</p>
<p>To clarify the differences observed between F87A and the mutations affecting the P–M2-1 interaction, we performed immunoprecipitation after co-transfecting BSRT7 cells with plasmids encoding N, M2-1 and HA-P (WT and variants impairing <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription) and by precipitating with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody. The precipitated complexes were analyzed by Western blot using anti-P and anti-M2-1 polyclonal sera. As expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref029">29</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref028">28</xref>], two main bands, corresponding to phosphorylated (upper band) and unphosphorylated (lower band) M2-1, were observed in cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). However, whereas M2-1 in the complex with WT P was mainly unphosphorylated, M2-1 was almost exclusively phosphorylated in the presence of all the P variants tested. Even more surprisingly, whereas only the unphosphorylated form of M2-1 co-precipitated with WT P, the F87A mutant was able to precipitate phosphorylated M2-1 as well. M2-1 remained phosphorylated with F98A, L101A and T105A P variants, which do not bind any form of M2-1, suggesting that the M2-1–P interaction is involved in M2-1 dephosphorylation. Taken together, these observations indicate that both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of M2-1 can interact with P, and that the interaction between P and M2-1 favors M2-1 dephosphorylation. They also reveal that the F87A mutation impairs M2-1 dephosphorylation without impeding P–M2-1 binding.</p>

<title>RSV P binds the cellular protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) by a "RVxF"-like motif</title>
<p>Since RSV P is required for M2-1 dephosphorylation, we hypothesized that P could associate with a cellular phosphatase, that in turn would be responsible for M2-1 dephosphorylation. For Ebola virus, which belongs to the <italic>Filoviridae</italic> family in the <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> order, it was recently shown that VP30, which shares functional and structural similarities with RSV M2-1, is dephosphorylated by PP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref046">46</xref>], and that VP30 dephosphorylation is critical for viral transcription. PP1 does not recognize specific sequences on its target protein. Instead, substrate binding depends on its association with PP1-interacting proteins (PIPs) that function as targeting subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref047">47</xref>]. A majority of known PIPs contain a short PP1-binding motif "RVxF" (R/K-K/R-x(0,1)-V/I-x-F/W/Y). RSV P contains a <sup>81</sup>RKPLVSF<sup>87</sup> sequence, which conforms to the "RVxF" motif. Sequence alignment of <italic>Pneumoviridae</italic> P shows high conservation of a "R/x-K-x-x-V-T/S-F" motif, which reduces to "R-K-P-x-V-T/S-F" for pneumoviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). RSV P thus harbors a degenerate "RVxF" motif containing the residue F87 and is most likely a PIP.</p>

<p>To determine whether P could associate with endogenous PP1, cells were co-transfected with pHA-P and p-N, and P was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using an anti-HA antibody. The presence of cellular phosphatases was then analyzed by Western blot. The presence of PP1 was clearly revealed in the precipitated products using WT P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). With the P F87A variant, PP1 was no longer precipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), emphasizing the role of this residue. Of note, for unclear reasons, the F87A P variant was overexpressed as compared to WT P.</p>
<p>We then investigated whether RSV P could directly interact with PP1 by using NMR interaction experiments. We observed the perturbations in <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N correlation spectra (BEST-TROSY) of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled P[1–126] in the presence of unlabeled GST-PP1α. GST-PP1α induced line broadening of NMR signals, i.e. a decrease of intensity, notably in a region spanning residues K76-D90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g006">Fig 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006920.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Control experiments in the presence of GST alone did not reveal any intensity perturbation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006920.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The 76–90 region contains the degenerate "RVxF" motif identified above. It is adjacent to the M2-1 binding site, but was not perturbed by M2-1<sub>core</sub> in P[1–126] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The 76–90 region had already drawn our attention owing to more efficient <sup>15</sup>N transverse relaxation than in adjacent IDRs and to its β-strand propensity in free P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref044">44</xref>]. Since PPI RVxF" motifs adopt an extended β-strand conformation in complex with PP1, it was tempting to hypothesize that 76–90 region forms a primary PP1 binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref048">48</xref>]. Similarly to M2-1<sub>core</sub>, GST-PP1α also perturbed the N<sup>0</sup>-binding region in P[1–126]. In contrast to M2-1<sub>core</sub>, when we performed interaction experiments with full-length P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g006">Fig 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006920.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), perturbations in the vicinity of α<sub>N1</sub> were still observed, so that we cannot rule out that they reflect direct binding to a second binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref048">48</xref>]. The presence of GSH in the buffer did not affect intensities.</p>
<p>The ability of PP1 to interact specifically with P was thus investigated by GST pulldown using GST-PP1α and recombinant P, WT or F87A mutant, all produced in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g006">Fig 6D</xref>, only WT P was efficiently pulled down by GST-PP1.

<p>By studying the ultrastructure of IBs, we recently found that M2-1 colocalizes with viral neo-synthesized mRNA in IBAGs, revealed by a poly(dT) probe, and from which genomic viral RNA, N, P and L proteins are excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref020">20</xref>]. We thus wondered if the absence of a P-PP1 complex could affect the localization of M2-1 in IBs. As the formation of IBAGs requires viral mRNA synthesis, we first verified that viral transcription can occur in the absence of M2-1 activity in our system. For that purpose, we engineered a new minigenome in which the first gene was replaced by the Gaussia luciferase coding sequence, upstream from the firefly luciferase gene. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006920.s003">S3 Fig</xref>, whereas no Firefly luciferase activity was detected in the absence of M2-1, the Gaussia luciferase activity was still detectable although reduced to ~15%. This confirmed that M2-1 is not absolutely required for expression of the first gene but increases expression of this gene. Based on this result, transfected cells were prepared for FISH using poly(dT) probes and analyzed by confocal microscopy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g007">Fig 7</xref> shows that, in contrast to what was observed with WT P, in the presence of the F87A P mutant M2-1 was present throughout the IBs, where it colocalized with P, but absent from IBAGs as revealed by a poly(dT) probe. These results indicate that phosphorylated M2-1, which is still competent for P-binding, cannot associate with neo-synthesized viral poly-adenylated mRNAs.</p>
<p>In a previous report we observed that IBAGs are not detected when using an oligo(dT) probe in the absence of M2-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref020">20</xref>]. These results suggested that either M2-1 is needed for the formation of IBAGs, or that M2-1 binds to mRNAs and is carried to the IBAGs as a passenger, not as a required chaperone. To clarify this point, we used two different probes, an oligo(dT) and probes targeting the first transcription unit of the M/Luc minigenome (the NS1-M chimeric mRNA), and compared the presence of IBAGs in the absence or presence of either P WT or P F87A. Some pictures representing the trend of what we observed are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g008">Fig 8</xref>; in the absence of M2-1, some IBAGs were detected when using NS1/M probes but not with an oligo(dT) probe. Similar results were observed with either WT or F87A P. Thus these results indicate that (i) transcription of the first gene can occur either in the absence of M2-1 or in presence of phosphorylated M2-1, as revealed by NS1 probes; (ii) poly-adenylation is affected in the absence of M2-1 but not in the presence of phosphorylated M2-1; and (iii) IBAGs revealed by either NS1 or oligo(dT) probes can form in the absence of M2-1 or in the presence of phosphorylated M2-1 which is excluded from them. In conclusion these results suggest that M2-1 is not essential for the formation of RNA aggregates calles IBAGs, and could be involved in mRNA poly-adenylation. They also suggest that a defect in M2-1 dephosphorylation does not affect mRNA poly-adenylation but binding of M2-1 to poly(A) RNAs after their synthesis.</p>

<p>The efficient activity of the RSV RdRp complex depends on regulated and highly specific protein-protein interactions, which are potential targets for antiviral therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref049">49</xref>].

<p>Furthermore, we found a perfect correlation between the capacity of P to interact with M2-1, RdRp activity and the presence of M2-1 in IBs.

<title>Dephosphorylation of M2-1 is mediated by a P-PP1 complex</title>
<p>M2-1 is mainly unphosphorylated in the context of an RSV infection, whereas the phosphorylated state is predominant when M2-1 is expressed alone in cells, S58 and S61 being the main sites of phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref026">26</xref>]. Previous experiments showed that phosphoablatant substitutions S58A/S61A as well as phosphomimetic substitutions S58D/S61D reduced RSV transcription activity to less than 20% and to ∼40% as compared to WT M2-1, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref026">26</xref>]. These data suggest that a cyclic turnover of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of M2-1 is required for efficient RSV transcription.</p>
<p>Here we observed that unphosphorylated M2-1 was predominant in cell lysates when co-expressed with WT P. A reverse situation was observed when M2-1 was co-expressed with P variants F98A, L101A, T105A that do not interact with M2-1, M2-1 being mainly phosphorylated, suggesting that P binding induces M2-1 dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). The finding that M2-1 is predominantly phosphorylated in the presence of another P variant F87A, which efficiently pulled down M2-1, confirmed that P is capable of interacting with both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of M2-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref023">23</xref>]. Altogether these results indicated that (i) P mediates M2-1 dephosphorylation or prevents M2-1 phosphorylation and that (ii) a P region adjacent to the M2-1 binding region comes into play for this activity.</p>
<p>Previous studies suggested that RSV P could be a target of cellular phosphatases PP1 and PP2A in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref051">51</xref>]. PP1 is a well-characterized and conserved Ser/Thr phosphatase holoenzyme. It is composed of a variable regulatory subunit that determines the localization, activity, and substrate specificity of the phosphatase and of one of three highly homologous catalytic phosphatase subunits PP1α, PP1γ, or PP1β/δ (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref048">48</xref>]). PP1 is the most widely expressed and abundant Ser/Thr phosphatase and is estimated to catalyze about one third of all protein dephosphorylations in eukaryotic cells. It dephosphorylates hundreds of key biological targets by associating with nearly 200 regulatory proteins to form highly specific holoenzymes. Of note, many of the &gt; 200 established PIPs are predicted to be intrinsically disordered like RSV P.</p>
<p>The defect in M2-1 dephosphorylation observed for the P F87A variant mainly argued in favor of the hypothesis of the recruitment by P of the PP1 cellular phosphatase through a RVxF-like motif, upstream of the M2-1 binding site. This hypothesis was consolidated by several complementary approaches showing that (i) WT P, but not the F87A variant, could bind PP1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in cellula;</italic> (ii) PP1 colocalized with WT P, but not with the F87A variant, in IBs; and (iii) overexpression of PP1 increased the unphosphorylated/phosphorylated M2-1 ratio. Altogether, our data show that RSV P can be considered as a PP1-interacting protein (PIP), targeting PP1 to the M2-1 substrate.</p>

Notably, M2-1 protein is unique to <italic>Pneumoviridae</italic> and present in all members of this virus family. It was shown that residues S57 and S60 of hMPV M2-1 protein, which are equivalent to RSV M2-1 S58 and S61, are also critical for virus replication, consistent with the critical role of cyclic phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of hMPV M2-1 for efficient RNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref052">52</xref>]. It is thus expected that hMPV and RSV present the same mechanism of regulation of M2-1 dephosphorylation.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that PP1 was previously shown to play a significant role in the replication of several viruses, including papovavirus, adenovirus, human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and 2, Ebola virus (EBOV), and Rift Valley Fever virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref054">54</xref>]. Within <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>, the VP30 protein from filoviruses is the only protein that shares structural and functional similarity with the M2-1 protein from <italic>Pneumoviridae</italic>. It was shown that the phosphorylation status of VP30 was also regulated by PP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref046">46</xref>]. It has also been demonstrated that PP1 regulates the innate immune responses for numerous RNA viruses, such as influenza virus, Sendai virus, dengue virus, and picornavirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref055">55</xref>]. The V protein of measles virus was shown to interact directly with PP1α/γ, via a canonical PP1-binding motif, <sup>288</sup>RIWY<sup>291</sup>, preventing PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of MDA5, a cytosolic sensor crucial for innate immune defense against various RNA viruses, thereby impairing its activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref056">56</xref>].</p>

<title>Potential role of cyclic M2-1 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation</title>
<p>Previous reports indicated that the phosphorylation state of M2-1 regulates the affinities with its partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref025">25</xref>]. The highest affinities of RSV M2-1 (produced as recombinant protein in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, i.e. unphosphorylated) for RNA were found with poly(A) (Kd~20 nM) and sequences present on viral mRNAs that are complementary to GE signals (Kd ~ 46 nM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref024">24</xref>]. We previously determined that the phosphomimetic S58D/S61D substitution decreased the RNA binding affinity as compared to WT M2-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref024">24</xref>]. This is consistent with the crystal structure of full-length tetrameric RSV M2-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref024">24</xref>], where S58 and S61 are located on a flexible loop, facing the RNA binding region located in M2-1<sub>core</sub>. Addition of a negative charge on these residues by phosphorylation could thus affect the interaction with RNA. Recombinant tetrameric P and M2-1 proteins (produced in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, i.e. unphosphorylated) form a complex with a 1:1 stoichiometry and a Kd of ~ 8.1 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref032">32</xref>]. The affinities of P and RNA for M2-1 are therefore comparable, which would be in line with a switch of M2-1 between the two M2-1–RNA and M2-1–P complexes.</p>
<p>This assumption was confirmed by comparing the organization of IBs in the presence of WT or F87A P variant in our minigenome assay. We previously observed a distinct compartment in IBs that contains concentrated viral mRNAs and M2-1 (IBAG). The rest of the IBs holds all the other proteins of the RSV polymerase complex together with the genomic RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref020">20</xref>]. When the P F87A variant was used, PP1 was absent from IBs, and M2-1, which was found mainly in a phosphorylated form (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), was no longer associated with IBAGs. The M/Luc minigenome we used for fluorescence microscopy studies has two transcription units (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec016">materials and Methods</xref>); the first one can be transcribed in the absence of M2-1, although with a 5 to 7 fold reduction (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006920.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), while the second one coding for Firefly luciferase fully depends on a functional M2-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref057">57</xref>]. It is thus likely that the poly(A) RNA seen in IBs when P F87A was used represents transcription from the first gene. These results also indicate that IBAGs form in the absence of dephosphorylated, competent for mRNA binding, M2-1. Finally, by using two different RNA probes, i.e. NS1 and poly(dT), we observed different effects on viral RNA poly-adenylation when M2-1 was either absent or co-expressed with P F87A and thus in the absence of PP1; in the first case some residual transcription was detected with the NS1 probe but not with the poly(dT) probe; in the second case (phosphorylated M2-1 only), both probes could detect some IBAGs. Together these results suggest that (i) poly-adenylation of the first transcription unit is impaired in the absence of M2-1 and (ii) phosphorylated M2-1 can help poly-adenylation, although it is excluded from IBAGs after transcription.</p>
<p>To summarize, RSV P can be considered as a newly identified PIP, targeting PP1 to the M2-1 substrate. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing such a mechanism of regulation of <italic>Pneumoviridae</italic> transcription. Recently, we have shown that, in RSV-infected cells, viral RNA synthesis occur in IBs, M2-1 and viral mRNAs concentrating in IB sub-compartments called IBAGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref020">20</xref>]. The data indicated that IBAGs are dynamic structures, allowing the sorting of viral mRNAs and their transport to the cytoplasm together with M2-1. Accordingly, we propose the following model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006920.g010">Fig 10B</xref>): in the cytoplasm of infected cells the P protein binds PP1 and the phosphorylated form of M2-1 allowing their recruitment into IBs. M2-1 works as an anti-terminator of transcription in IBs and could intervene as a poly-adenylation factor. Once dephosphorylated by PP1, M2-1 has a higher affinity for RNA, in particular for GE and poly(A) sequences at the end of the transcripts. Terminated mRNAs concentrate in IBAGs and drag M2-1 along. M2-1 could act in a manner similar to the cellular poly(A) binding protein, protecting mRNA from degradation and perhaps playing a role in the transport of mRNAs from IBAGs to the cytosol in order to translate viral mRNAs, and possibly playing an active role in translation. M2-1 phosphorylation could then occur in the cytosol, resulting in the detachment of M2-1 from the poly(A) tail of mRNA, before being recycled by P and redirected to IBs for a new round of transcription.</p>

<title>Plasmid constructs</title>
<p>All viral sequences were derived from the human RSV strain Long. The full length or segments of the P gene were PCR amplified by using <italic>Pfu</italic> DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Les Ulis, France) and cloned into pGEX-4T-3 bacterial expression vector (GE Healthcare) at BamHI-SmaI sites to engineer the pGEX-P and derived plasmids. The M2-1 cDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref023">23</xref>] was subcloned into pET-22b+ (Novagen) to allow bacterial expression of full-length M2-1 with a C-terminal poly-histidine tag. Plasmids for eukaryotic expression of the human RSV (Long strain) proteins N, P, M2-1, and L, designated pN, pP, pM2-1, and pL, respectively, and pM/Luc have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006920.ref023">23</xref>]. The pM/Luc minigenome has two transcription units; the first ORF is a chimera between NS1 (327 first nucleotides) and M genes (138 last nucleotides), and transcription termination depends on a N Gene End sequence. The second ORF codes for firefly luciferase and ends with a SH Gene End sequence The first and second mRNA expressed by this minigenome are 698 and 1897 nucleotides in length, excluding the poly(A) tail, respectively. A second minigenome containing Gaussia and Firefly luciferases was engineered and synthesized by Genscript. This pGaussia/Firefly minigenome is similar to the pM/Luc minigenome excepted that it contains the Gaussia luciferase gene upstream in place of the NS1-M chimeric gene (complete sequences available on demand). Point mutations were introduced in the P sequence by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To generate the plasmid pHA-P, complementary oligonucleotides encoding a hemagglutinin (HA) tag epitope (MYPYDVPDYA) were annealed and inserted at the BamHI restriction site in frame at the 5’ end of the P gene in pP. For the eukaryotic expression of a M2-1–mCherry fusion protein, the mCherry gene was amplified by PCR from the pmCherry vector (Clontech) and cloned in frame at the 3’ end of the M2-1 gene at BglII-XhoI sites in pM2-1. To engineer the pP-BFP vector, first a NheI site was introduced at nucleotides 741–746 of the P sequence; then, the BFP gene was PCR amplified from the pTagBFP-Tubulin vector (Evrogen) and inserted at the NheI restriction site, between P residues 73–74. The eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP(C1)-PP1α was purchased from Addgene. The PP1A insert (residues 7–300) was subcloned into pGEX-4T-3 at BamHI-XhoI sites. Sequence analysis was carried out to check the integrity of all the constructs. All the oligonucleotide sequences are available on request.</p>
