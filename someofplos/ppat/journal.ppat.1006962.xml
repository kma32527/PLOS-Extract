<abstract>
<p>Despite their genetic similarities, enteric and respiratory enteroviruses (EVs) have highly heterogeneous biophysical properties and cause a vast diversity of human pathologies. <italic>In vitro</italic> differences include acid sensitivity, optimal growth temperature and tissue tropism, which reflect a preferential <italic>in vivo</italic> replication in the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract and are thus key determinants of EV virulence. To investigate the underlying cause of these differences, we generated chimeras at the capsid-level between EV-D68 (a respiratory EV) and EV-D94 (an enteric EV). Although some chimeras were nonfunctional, EV-D94 with both the capsid and 2A protease or the capsid only of EV-D68 were both viable. Using this latter construct, we performed several functional assays, which indicated that capsid proteins determine acid sensitivity and tropism in cell lines and in respiratory, intestinal and neural tissues. Additionally, capsid genes were shown to also participate in determining the optimal growth temperature, since EV-D94 temperature adaptation relied on single mutations in VP1, while constructs with EV-D68 capsid could not adapt to higher temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that EV-D68 maintains residual binding-capacity after acid-treatment despite a loss of infectivity. In contrast, non-structural rather than capsid proteins modulate the innate immune response in tissues. These unique biophysical insights expose another layer in the phenotypic diversity of one of world’s most prevalent pathogens and could aid target selection for vaccine or antiviral development.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Enteroviruses (EV) are one of the most frequent human pathogens worldwide, causing a broad spectrum of diseases, ranging from the common cold to fatal flaccid paralysis. Surprisingly, this vast phenotypic diversity is not reflected at the genetic level, where despite intensive research, the factors contributing to these variations remain poorly understood. By generating novel chimeric viruses derived from a respiratory (EV-D68) and an enteric (EV-D94) EV, we highlight the crucial role of capsid proteins in acid sensitivity, <italic>in vitro</italic> tropism and optimal growth temperature. We also show that while capsid proteins are central to the biophysical viability of EV, they elicit only minor effects on the innate immune response. This work identifies key players in the pathogenesis of these highly prevalent viruses, which not only improves our understanding of their biology, but may also better guide the selection of new targets for vaccine and antiviral innovations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Enteroviruses (EVs) represent one of the leading causes of human disease worldwide and are associated with a broad spectrum of clinically distinct syndromes. While most infections are benign or asymptomatic, a small proportion may lead to life-threatening disease. Apart from the successful vaccines against poliovirus, there are currently no efficient antiviral treatments or prophylaxes against these common and potentially fatal pathogens.</p>
<p>Classified in the <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family, the <italic>Enterovirus</italic> genus is composed of over 300 different genotypes distributed among 13 species (EV-A to EV-J and RV-A to RV-C), seven of which include human pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref001">1</xref>]. These divisions are based primarily on nucleotide and amino acid homology rather than the phenotypic presentation of human infection. Their positive-stranded RNA genome of 7’200 to 7’500 nucleotides is packed into a 30 nm icosahedral capsid. The 5’ end of the genome is covalently linked to the small viral protein, VPg, and contains a highly structured untranslated region (5’UTR) composed of <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements necessary for replication and translation. An internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) is required for cap-independent translation, which gives rise to a precursor polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into 11 mature proteins by viral proteases. This precursor polyprotein encompasses 3 major regions (P1-P3). The P1 region encodes capsid proteins (1A to 1D or VP4 to VP1), while the P2 and P3 regions encode non-structural proteins (2A to 2C and 3A to 3D). The 3’UTR is marked by a poly-A tail and contains elements involved in the regulation of replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref002">2</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Although closely related at a genetic level, viruses within the EV genus have distinct transmission routes and replication sites. They also display remarkably different phenotypic characteristics and associated clinical syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref004">4</xref>]. Based on their primary replication site, the respiratory or gastrointestinal mucosa, EVs can be divided in respiratory EVs (which also include all rhinovirus (RV) types) and enteric EVs, although gastrointestinal diseases are rarely caused by EV infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref003">3</xref>]. Respiratory EVs are transmitted via the respiratory route, have an infectious tropism restricted to the respiratory tract and rarely disseminate. By contrast, enteric EVs are mostly transmitted via the fecal-oral route, replicate predominantly in the gastrointestinal mucosa from where they can disseminate and infect a wide range of different organs, including the central nervous system. Differences between these 2 groups of viruses also exist <italic>in vitro</italic>: for example, unlike enteric EVs, respiratory EVs exhibit particle instability at low pH, a lower optimal replication temperature, and a restricted cell tropism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite intensive research, the genetic roots of this phenotypic variability are still poorly understood. Acid treatment of RVs was shown to result in a loss of infectivity due to a conformational change in the capsid proteins, leading to the expulsion of VP4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref006">6</xref>]. Studies conducted in the 1970’s revealed that acidification followed by neutralization of RV particles produced 2 subviral components (“A”, containing RNA without VP4 and “B”, with neither RNA nor VP4): a transformation that made the RV particles defective in attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref007">7</xref>]. There are numerous determinants of viral tropism, but as capsid proteins contain the receptor-binding site, they are thought to play a significant role. Other viral proteins potentially important in this process are those interacting with the host innate defenses as well as elements of the translation and replication machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref008">8</xref>]. With regard to optimal growth temperature, various mutations across the genome have been described in cold-adapted viruses and shown to impact the growth of EVs <italic>in vivo</italic>; however, the exact genomic regions providing resistance to higher body temperatures have not yet been defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref010">10</xref>]. Similar uncertainty exists regarding the determinants of the diversity in immune responses and complex immune evasion strategies between the various EVs. While innate pattern recognition and evasion strategies have been linked to distinct viral proteins such as 2A, 2C and 3C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref011">11</xref>], the precise roles of structural and non-structural proteins in these processes are yet to be elucidated.</p>
<p>The aim of this work is to identify the genetic regions responsible for differences in key determinants of viral viability (namely, acid sensitivity, optimal growth temperature, tissue tropism and induction of innate immunity) through the creation of unique viral chimeras. We thus exchanged the viral capsid proteins between respiratory and enteric EVs. As only intraspecies chimeric combinations are viable at the polyprotein level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref012">12</xref>], we selected 2 viruses from the same species that are different in acid sensitivity and tissue tropism: EV-D68 as a representative of respiratory EVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref013">13</xref>], and EV-D94 as a representative of enteric EVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref014">14</xref>]. Unlike most non-RVs EVs, EV-D68 virions are acid-labile, replicate optimally at low temperatures, are spread mainly via the respiratory route and cause mild to severe respiratory disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref015">15</xref>]. Because of their physicochemical properties reminiscent of RVs, they were initially misclassified as human RV-87 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref016">16</xref>]. Other EVs with a preferred respiratory tropism such as CVA-21 or the recently identified EV-C104, EV-C105, EV-C109, EV-C117 and EV-C118, may also share these properties but as most of these EV-C viruses do not grow in standard culture, their phenotypic characterization remains difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref003">3</xref>]. While recent EV-D68 isolates have shown neurotropic potential in animal models, the tropism of the original prototypic Fermon strain used in this study is restricted to the respiratory tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref017">17</xref>]. The selected enteric virus, EV-D94 is a recently characterized EV-D type that was isolated concurrently from sewage specimens collected in Egypt and from fecal specimens of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) patients in the Democratic Republic of the Congo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref014">14</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> examinations revealed a stability of the virion under acidic conditions and a remarkably wide tissue and cell tropism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref014">14</xref>]. EV-D94 and most EV-D68 strains depend on sialic acid for binding and infection of susceptible cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref019">19</xref>]. ICAM-5/telencephalin was also recently described as a receptor required for entry and replication of sialic acid-dependent and -independent EV-D68 strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>We thus exchanged the capsid regions of EV-D68 and EV-D94 and assessed the viability, tropism (<italic>in vitro</italic> using cell lines and <italic>ex vivo</italic> with reconstituted human tissues), acid sensitivity, temperature adaptation and finally interplay with host innate immunity of the chimeras. Taken together, this work clarifies the diverse biophysical and immunogenic roles of capsid proteins in EV pathogenesis and may guide the search of therapeutic targets.</p>

<title>Viability, fitness and adaptation of chimeric EV-D68/EV-D94 viruses</title>
<p>Chimeras were generated by interchanging genomic regions between EV-D68 and EV-D94. Exchanged regions comprised either the capsid region alone (P1), both the capsid and protease regions together (P1 and 2A) or VP1. The following 4 permutations were studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g001">Fig 1</xref>): A) EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> which integrated the P1 region of EV-D68 into the framework of EV-D94, B) EV-D68/D94<sub>P1</sub> which integrated the P1 region of EV-D94 into the framework of EV-D68, C) EV-D94/D68<sub>P1-2A</sub> which integrated both the P1 and 2A regions of EV-D68 into the framework of EV-D94 and finally D) EV-D94/D68<sub>VP1</sub> with VP1 of EV-D68 integrated into the framework of EV-D94. After <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription and cell transfection, 2 blind passages were performed and virus viability was assessed by cytopathic effect (CPE) examination and confirmed by immunofluorescence (IF). EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> and EV-D94/D68<sub>P1-2A</sub> gave rise to viable replicating viruses, causing CPE in HeLa cells; however, although EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> growth was similar to EV-D94 and EV-D68, only few cells were infected with EV-D94/D68<sub>P1-2A</sub> and viral loads measured by quantitative PCR after the first passage was more than 100’000 times higher for EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> than for D94/D68<sub>P1-2A</sub>. The full genomes of EV-D94, EV-D68 and EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> obtained in HeLa cells after 3 passages were sequenced and several adaptation mutations were observed, particularly for EV-D94 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Since EV-D94/D68<sub>P1-2A</sub> was not fully adapted, we did not analyze mutations of the viral stock by sequencing. No other constructs were viable as shown by absence of CPE, negative IF signal and absence of viral RNA amplification measured by RT-qPCR after 2 passages. The non-viability of EV-D68/D94<sub>P1</sub> was unexpected since the reverse construct was fully fit. To exclude the presence of unnoticed deleterious mutation in the construct, we generated it again using several different approaches; manually, using a fusion PCR-based procedure and also by ordering the full-length construct. A cell adaptation mutation (VP1<sub>H284Y</sub>) observed in the P1 region of the parental EV-D94 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) was also inserted in the chimera to try to boost the potentially unfit virus. However, none of these methods produced viable progeny.</p>

<title>Capsid proteins are the only determinants of acid sensitivity in EVs</title>
<p>Based on viral fitness, EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> was used in functional assays, and together with its parental viruses (EV-D68 and EV-D94), underwent acid sensitivity testing. A standard protocol was used to test particle stability after acid (pH 3) exposition. While EV-D94 infectivity was unchanged, acid pre-treatment of EV-D68 resulted in a total loss of infectivity. Interestingly, the chimera carrying the EV-D68 P1 region (EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub>) was similarly affected by acid pre-treatment. To identify the step of the viral cycle impaired by acid treatment, we performed several assays to test the binding, entry and replication steps based on time post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Whereas EV-D94 infectivity was not significantly impaired at any step by acid treatment, entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and subsequently replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) of EV-D68 and EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> were blocked after acid exposure. In contrast, binding was only partially affected for EV-D68 and EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). To assess the specificity of this residual attachment post acid-treatment, the same binding assay was run on cells pretreated or not with sialidase. Sialidase treatment further inhibited attachment of acid-treated EV-D68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), indicating a significant and specific binding to sialic acid after acid pretreatment.</p>

Infections of HeLa (human cervical carcinoma), RD (human rhabdomyosarcoma), A549 (human lung carcinoma), Caco-2 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma), Vero (African green monkey kidney) and SH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma) cells were carried out. EV-D94 was able to replicate in all cell types, while EV-D68 replicated only in HeLa, RD, A549 and Caco-2 cells but not in Vero or SH-SY5Y. EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> exhibited the exact same cellular tropism as EV-D68. The ability of EV-D68 to infect Caco-2 cells, at even higher levels than EV-D94, was not expected considering the colorectal origin of these cells and the restricted respiratory tropism of this virus.</p>

<p>To better replicate viral tropism in humans, the same infection assays were performed on complex tissue models <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted from human primary cells that mimic the upper respiratory tract, small intestine, neurons or neural tissues composed of neurons and glial cells. For respiratory and gut tissue models grown at an air-liquid interface, cells were infected apically with 10<sup>8</sup> viral particles (normalised based on RNA quantification) of each viral stock and, after extensive washing at 4 hpi, apical viral release was measured daily as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref022">22</xref>].

<p>Between 0.5x10<sup>7</sup> and 10<sup>8</sup> viral particles were used to infect primary neurons or engineered neural tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref023">23</xref>]; but as these cultures are fragile, the viral inoculum was not washed out and replication was assessed by comparing the amount of cell-associated virus directly after inoculation and 4 days later.</p>
<p>In respiratory tissues, viral production peaked between day 1 and 3 for all viruses. However, viral replication of both EV-D68 and EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> was significantly higher than EV-D94 from day 1 to day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> panel). This higher viral replication was paralleled by an inhibition of mucociliary clearance (MCC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> panel). Similarly, we observed a decrease in cilia beating frequency from day 3 in EV-D68 and EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> infected tissues while neither MCC nor cilia beating were affected by infection with EV-D94. These findings can be linked to the massive loss of ciliated cells observed by IF at 4 dpi caused by EV-D68 and EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> as opposed to EV-D94 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g003">Fig 3A</xref> 3<sup>rd</sup> panel).</p>
<p>The opposite situation occurred in intestinal tissues where viral loads measured 4 dpi for EV-D94 were around 4 log higher than those of EV-D68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Once again, EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> exhibited the same characteristics of its EV-D68 P1 donor parent strain in the intestinal tissue model. The same replication profile was observed in <italic>in vitro</italic>-reconstituted neural tissues, where no increase in cell-associated virus was measured 4 dpi with EV-D68 and the chimera EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> in either neuron monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) or complex 3D engineered neural tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Interestingly, EV-D94 could infect both tissues, supporting a potential neurotropism of this newly reported EV. The absolute viral loads of EV-D94 measured in the different tissues 4 dpi were significantly higher in intestinal tissues.</p>

<title>Non-structural proteins modulate IFN induction levels</title>
<p>To investigate the implication of structural and non-structural proteins in induction and/or interference with the antiviral response, IFN induction by the different constructs was investigated both in <italic>in vitro-</italic>reconstituted respiratory epithelia and cell lines. IFN induction was not compared in intestinal or neural tissues as both EV-D68 and the chimera replicated poorly in these tissues. First, infected respiratory epithelia were examined 3 dpi at the mRNA level for IFN-β and IFN-λ in tissue lysates by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>), and at the protein level for IFN-λ in supernatant by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). IFN-β was not analyzed by ELISA since we previously reported a poor induction of this cytokine in respiratory tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref022">22</xref>]. Interestingly, IFN induction by EV-D68 and EV-D94 differed significantly both at the protein and mRNA levels; EV-D68 strongly induced both type I and type III IFN, whereas expression levels in EV-D94 and EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> infected tissues were comparable to uninfected controls. This differential induction did not correlate with differences in viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g004">Fig 4D</xref>).

<title>Capsid sequences determine sensitivity to high temperatures</title>
<p>To identify the key genetic region implicated in temperature sensitivity, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcripts of EV-D94, EV-D68 and EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> were transfected at 33°C and 37°C. While the 3 viruses could be recovered after transfection and passages at 33°C, only EV-D94 was recovered after transfection at 37°C. Of note, transfection of EV-D94 and of other unrelated RNAs (such as siRNAs or pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) RNAs for RIG-I) was systematically more efficient at 33°C than at 37°C (D. Garcin personal communication). Titration of viral stocks prepared at 33°C revealed a systematic growth advantage over those prepared at 37°C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006962.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We then tried to adapt EV-D68 and EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> stocks obtained at 33°C to higher growth temperature. The two viruses were able to grow at 37°C but with limited fitness and they did not shift their optimal growth temperature to 37°C, despite repeated attempts for EV-D68.</p>
<p>In contrast, EV-D94 viral stocks adapted to 33°C or 37°C could be obtained in HeLa cells after transfection of the original infectious clone and only 6 passages at these 2 temperatures. These viruses presented different optimal growth temperature not only in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g005">Fig 5</xref>) but also in RD, A549 and Vero but to lesser extent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006962.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Whole genome sequencing was performed on these adapted stocks to identify temperature adaptation mutations. Five non-synonymous mutations (VP1<sub>H284Y, A241T</sub>, 2A<sub>K47E, P76S</sub> and 3D<sub>H40Q</sub>) were observed in EV-D94 adapted to 33°C when compared to the original plasmid construct (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g001">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g005">5A</xref>). To find out if some of these mutations were responsible for the improved growth at 33°C, the VP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) and 2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g005">Fig 5C</xref>) mutations were introduced independently in the original EV-D94 infectious clone. These 2 derivatives showed a similar optimal growth temperature of 33°C, indicating that none of these mutations was responsible for this phenotype. Since none of these two constructs has the 3D<sub>H40Q</sub> substitution, an implication of this mutation in the adaptation at 33°C was also excluded. Of note, presence of only the 2A adaptation mutations considerably reduced viral fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g005">Fig 5C</xref>) implying that the VP1 mutations play a critical role for growth in HeLa cells. To identify mutations resulting in optimal growth at 37°C, the genome of the virus adapted at 37°C was compared with that of the original infectious clone. Two mutations in VP1 (VP1<sub>G94D, P165R</sub>) and 1 mutation in 2A (2A <sub>A144V</sub>) were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Introduction of the 2A mutation alone in the original EV-D94 clone resulted in a drastic fitness loss but a similar growth at 33 and 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). In contrast, introduction of the VP1 mutations reduced viral fitness but did not suppress the growth advantage of the virus at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), suggesting a key role of these mutations in the adaptation to 37°C. To confirm this hypothesis, these 2 VP1 mutations were introduced in the genetic framework of the virus adapted to 33°C and they drastically shifted its optimal growth temperature from 33°C to 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006962.g005">Fig 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006962.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>EV genotypes are co-circulating in humans and are responsible for a wide variety of diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref004">4</xref>]. The phenotypic diversity of their pathogenesis extends to their biophysical characteristics <italic>in vitro</italic> but is curiously not reflected at the genetic level as is exemplified by members of the EV-D species. By investigating chimeric EV constructs among members of this species, we were able to identify the genomic regions responsible for the key elements of the functional diversity in EV pathogenesis. Using a fully viable chimeric EV-D94 (expressing EV-D68 capsid-encoding genes), we demonstrate that capsid-encoding genes determine viral tropism and acid sensitivity. We also show that EV-D68 capsid presents a major obstacle to adaptation to higher growth temperature while EV-D94 capsid does not. We finally highlight a significant and differential modulation of innate immune response by non-capsid proteins, and thus clarify mechanisms of several layers of EV pathogenesis from biophysical properties to host-pathogen interaction.</p>
<p>The first novel finding in this study is the limited intraspecies compatibility within the EV-D species. Intertypic intraspecies recombination is a frequent event in nature, especially in non-RV EVs. While viable recombinants within the EV-A, -B and -C species have been reported to occur (both <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref025">25</xref>]), no similar observation has been reported for EV-D. To explore the role of capsid proteins in EV pathogenesis, we created several variants of capsid-chimeras, containing either the full capsid, full capsid and 2A, or VP1 alone. Out of all the constructs, only the exchange of the entire EV-D68 P1 region within the genomic framework of EV-D94 was as viable and fit as the parental viruses. Restrictions of viability were not further explored; however, it may be hypothesised that it was due to the highly ordered structure of icosahedral capsids where mosaic capsids constructions (within P1), can be expected to be poorly viable as was revealed in previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies on poliovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref027">27</xref>]. Further, recent natural recombination events within P1 are virtually non-existent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref028">28</xref>]. The fact that P1 from EV-D68 in the genomic framework of EV-D94 gave rise to a viable chimera, whereas its reverse counterpart did not (despite various methods of fabrication) was more surprising. This chimera could not be made viable even with the addition of cell-adaptation mutations in the capsid-encoding EV-D94 region. One possible explanation for this limitation could be an incompatibility at the encapsidation step, which is controlled by 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>. This enzyme is believed to interact directly with the VP3 capsid protein to incorporate newly synthesised genomes and a highly specific protein-protein interaction has been shown to be an important constraint of recombinant compatibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref029">29</xref>]. Sequencing of our EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> viral stocks revealed a non-conservative mutation in VP3, mapping to the interior of the viral capsid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006962.s006">S6A Fig</xref>) and possibly reflecting a rescue of a defective encapsidation. However, similar compensatory mutations did not occur for the reverse chimera EV-D68/D94<sub>P1</sub> despite numerous transfection attempts. This suggests that the incompatibility between structural and non-structural proteins of different genotypes may be unilateral. Of note, we did not observe such incompatibilities when we generated intraspecies chimeric RVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref012">12</xref>], although in this case reciprocal chimeras were not created. Other non-structural proteins, such as VPg, also interact with the capsid at critical points of the viral growth cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref030">30</xref>] and may cause similar limitations to chimeric constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref032">32</xref>]. Finally, one cannot exclude that unrecognized <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements, critical for EV-D68 replication may lie in the capsid-coding region.</p>
<p>The chimeric virus EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> exhibited identical acid sensitivity to that of its P1 donor virus, EV-D68, proving the essential involvement of capsid proteins in this biophysical characteristic. While acid treatment completely inhibited viral entry, we showed that sialic-acid dependent binding was still effective. Our observation that binding of acid-treated EV-D68 virions could be further reduced by sialidase cell-treatment contradicts previous studies in RV-A2, concluding that acidity induces a conformational change in the capsid (forming subviral “A” and “B” particles) that makes it incapable of cell binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref007">7</xref>]. However, recent studies with the same virus established that acid-induced conformational changes were confined to particle “A” transformations, involving the release of VP4 and exposure of N-terminal part of VP1, but that it was not sufficient to provoke RNA release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref034">34</xref>]. In these conditions, binding is still possible, albeit diminished. Furthermore, the capsid of EV-D68 may present a different conformation change after acidic treatment than the capsid of RV-A2. Nevertheless, despite a retained ability to bind sialic acid, the conformational change induced by acid treatment definitively prevented viral entry. This may rely on the inability of the virus to bind an entry receptor distinct from sialic acid. Alternatively, the irreversible conformational change induced by acidity may preclude proper viral internalisation and/or uncoating.</p>
<p>As the cellular tropism of EV-D68 was completely transferred to the EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> chimera, we were able to conclude that tropism is probably determined by virus-receptor interactions of the capsid proteins. Both EV-D68 and EV-D94 are known to bind sialic acid on cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref019">19</xref>]; while some sialic acid-independent strains have been reported for EV-D68, the Fermon strain is sialic acid-dependent. Additionally, ICAM-5/telencephalin (a neuron-specific molecule but also largely present in the respiratory tract), has been recently proposed as the entry receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref020">20</xref>]. Our results suggest the existence of a virus-specific receptor (which could be ICAM-5/telencephalin for EV-D68) responsible for the differential tropism observed between EV-D68 and EV-D94. In addition, acid sensitive viruses may have a facilitated uncoating in compartments with low pH when compared to acid-resistant viruses, and thus rely less on conformational changes induced by capsid-receptor interactions. Accordingly, EV-D68 and EV-D94 probably have different entry mechanisms. Additional experiments in diverse cell lines as well as improved knowledge on EV-D receptor usage will be necessary to better define the different entry pathways of EV-D68 and EV-D94.</p>
<p>As until now no animal model is able to accurately replicate the EV pathogenesis in humans, this makes <italic>in vitro</italic>-reconstituted human tissue models essential to EV research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref035">35</xref>]. Indeed, even <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have limitations, as can be seen by our observation that the <italic>in vivo</italic> EV cellular tropism of both EV-D68 and EV-D94 was not reflected in their respective immortalized cell lines. Although <italic>ex vivo</italic> models do not fully reproduce the complexity of human physiology, the first steps of infection can be still accurately studied. As expected, EV-D68 proved to be an efficient respiratory virus, reaching 1000-fold higher titres than EV-D94 in respiratory tissues. The fact that these high replication levels were transferred to the EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> chimera further underlines the essential role of the P1 capsid region in the EV-D68 phenotype. This similarity between EV-D68 and the EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> chimera was also seen in ciliated cell toxicity and impaired mucociliary clearance, which is in line with our recently published work on these tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref022">22</xref>]. Interestingly, EV-D94 did not have the same repercussions and as innate immunity induction of EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> was comparable to EV-D94, replication levels rather than collateral damage by the host immune response likely explain the pathogenesis observed.</p>
<p>In line with the expected tropism of EV-D94, this virus was able to infect both neural and gastrointestinal tissues, supporting its probable role in AFP cases in humans. While a potential causal role of EV-D68 in AFP has been suggested by epidemiological studies, recent murine models have suggested that only recently emerged strains (and not the Fermon prototypic strain used in this study), have this neuroinvasion ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref017">17</xref>] which was confirmed in our study, where neither EV-D68 nor the EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> chimera were able to efficiently infect the neural tissue models. Of note, absolute replication levels vary considerably among tissue types. Though these values are not directly comparable due to different experimental settings linked to differences in tissue composition (monolayer, pseudo-stratified, stratified), EV-D94 was shown to reach the highest viral loads in intestinal tissues. This correlates with preferred replication of enteric EVs in the gastrointestinal tract. Taken together, these experiments show that, in contrast to immortalised cell lines, <italic>ex vivo</italic> model systems are reliable surrogates to investigate the early stages of EV pathogenesis and, more importantly, reveal the central involvement of capsid proteins in determining tissue tropism.</p>
<p>Since respiratory tissues sustain important and comparable replication of both EV-D68 and EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub>, studies investigating the innate immune response were standardised in this model. As EV-D68 was the only virus to induce both type I and III IFN, whereas EV-D94 and EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> did not lead to strong IFN induction either at the protein or the mRNA level, we could conclude that this feature is not determined by the P1 genomic region. Chimeras with exchanges of non-structural proteins could help to identify the elements involved in the innate immune response. Of note, innate immunity was not induced at all in cell lines, showing again the limitations of this model.</p>
<p>Similarly to the other observations, the fact that neither EV-D68 nor EV-D94/D68<sub>P1</sub> could be transfected or adapted to 37°C, strongly implicates the P1 capsid region in EV thermal stability. Concerning EV-D94, our selected strain (E210) was only passaged once in L20B cells and was thus not adapted to grow in HeLa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref014">14</xref>]. Acquisition of improved growth in HeLa cells was nevertheless a very quick process and only 6 passages allowed the emergence of 2 temperature-adapted versions of EV-D94 with 5 mutations accumulated upon growth at 33°C and 3 at 37°C. Different combinations of the 33°C adaptation mutations decreased viral fitness but without changing the virus optimal growth temperature. This indicates that the better growth at 33°C is not associated with specific viral mutations but rather represents a default condition linked to higher tolerance of the cells to viral infection at this temperature. This may be related to reduced innate immunity at cold temperature as has been previously demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref037">37</xref>] and could explain why RNA transfection is more efficient at 33°C also for non-viral RNA molecules such as siRNA or RNA PAMPs. In contrast, with the same approach, we identified 2 mutations in VP1 (D94G and P165R) that were critical for optimal growth in cells at 37°C. G94D maps to the VP1 BC loop, while P165R is located in the canyon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006962.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). Both the VP1 BC loop and the canyon are known to be involved in virus adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref039">39</xref>] and receptor binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref040">40</xref>] and the BC loop was further shown to modulate CVB3 thermolability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref041">41</xref>]. In agreement with these published data, these 2 mutations were also important for viral fitness in HeLa cells and it is not clear whether the 2 phenotypes are related. Of note, we did not repeat independent adaptation at 37°C and cannot confirm that these 2 mutations are the only ones conferring improved fitness at higher temperatures. It is also very likely that in the genomic framework of another EV or in another cell type, other mutations may emerge and fill the same function.</p>
<p>To conclude, using recombinants produced <italic>in vitro</italic> between EV-D68, a respiratory EV and EV-D94, an enteric EV, we proved that capsid proteins are both necessary and sufficient to determine the acid sensitivity and restricted tropism of the respiratory EV, as well as its optimal growth temperature. In contrast, we showed that innate immunity induction is rather modulated by non-structural proteins. The same experimental approach could be effective to explore the role of other EV proteins and exchanges between other pairs of EVs could help to generalize our findings to all EVs. Such approaches open the door to an improved understanding of these highly prevalent but poorly understood pathogens.</p>

<title>IFN induction in cell lines.</title>
<p>RD, Hela and A549 cells were infected with the indicated virus. For HeLa and RD cells, RNA was extracted from cell lysate 24 hpi and IFNβ and λ mRNAs were quantified by quantitative real-time PCR. The IFN Ct values were normalized to those of the RNAse P housekeeping gene (3416844, Applied Biosystems/ThermoFischer, USA) and relative quantification was calculated using the 2<sup>-ΔΔCt</sup> method. In A549/pr(IFN-β) GFP reporter cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006962.ref050">50</xref>], IFN induction was measured by FACS 18 and 24 hpi.
