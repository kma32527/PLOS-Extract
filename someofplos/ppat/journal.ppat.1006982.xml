<article-title>The Cryptococcus neoformans Titan cell is an inducible and regulated morphotype underlying pathogenesis</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>The pathogenic fungus <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> exhibits morphological changes in cell size during lung infection, producing both typical size 5 to 7 μm cells and large titan cells (&gt; 10 μm and up to 100 μm). We found and optimized <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions that produce titan cells in order to identify the ancestry of titan cells, the environmental determinants, and the key gene regulators of titan cell formation. Titan cells generated <italic>in vitro</italic> harbor the main characteristics of titan cells produced <italic>in vivo</italic> including their large cell size (&gt;10 μm), polyploidy with a single nucleus, large vacuole, dense capsule, and thick cell wall. Here we show titan cells derived from the enlargement of progenitor cells in the population independent of yeast growth rate. Change in the incubation medium, hypoxia, nutrient starvation and low pH were the main factors that trigger titan cell formation, while quorum sensing factors like the initial inoculum concentration, pantothenic acid, and the quorum sensing peptide Qsp1p also impacted titan cell formation. Inhibition of ergosterol, protein and nucleic acid biosynthesis altered titan cell formation, as did serum, phospholipids and anti-capsular antibodies in our settings. We explored genetic factors important for titan cell formation using three approaches. Using H99-derivative strains with natural genetic differences, we showed that titan cell formation was dependent on <italic>LMP1</italic> and <italic>SGF29</italic> genes. By screening a gene deletion collection, we also confirmed that <italic>GPR4/5-RIM101</italic>, and <italic>CAC1</italic> genes were required to generate titan cells and that the <italic>PKR1</italic>, <italic>TSP2</italic>, <italic>USV101</italic> genes negatively regulated titan cell formation. Furthermore, analysis of spontaneous Pkr1 loss-of-function clinical isolates confirmed the important role of the Pkr1 protein as a negative regulator of titan cell formation. Through development of a standardized and robust <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, our results provide new insights into titan cell biogenesis with the identification of multiple important factors/pathways.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is a yeast that is capable of morphological change upon interaction with the host. Particularly, in the lungs of infected mice, a subpopulation of yeast enlarges, producing cells up to 100 μm in cell body diameter–referred to as titan cells. Along with their large size, the titan cells have other unique characteristics such as thickened cell wall, dense capsule, polyploidization, large vacuole with peripheral nucleus and cellular organelles. The generation of a large number of such cells outside the lungs of mice has been described but was not reproducible nor standardized. Here we report standardized, reproducible, robust conditions for generation of titan cells and explored the environmental and genetic factors underlying the genesis of these cells. We showed that titan cells were generated upon stresses such as change in the incubation medium, nutrient deprivation, hypoxia and low pH. Using collections of well characterized reference strains and clinical isolates, we validated with our model that the cAMP/PKA/Rim101 pathway is a major genetic determinant of titan cell formation. This study opens the way for a more comprehensive picture of the ontology of morphological changes in <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> and its impact on pathobiology of this deadly pathogen.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ubiquitous environmental yeast <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is a basidiomycetous yeast that has been estimated to cause over 200,000 new cases of meningoencephalitis with greater than 180,000 deaths per year worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref001">1</xref>], occurring mostly in immunocompromised individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref002">2</xref>]. The natural history of most of the cases of this invasive fungal infection proceeds through 3 stages: (i) primary infection via inhalation of desiccated yeasts or basidiospores, with development of sub-clinical pneumonia and spontaneous resolution via granuloma formation; (ii) latency of dormant yeast cells, as demonstrated epidemiologically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref003">3</xref>] and biologically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref004">4</xref>] and (iii) reactivation and dissemination upon immunosuppression, with meningoencephalitis as the most severe clinical presentation of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref005">5</xref>]. From the environment to interactions with hosts, the yeasts experience drastic changes that reflect a capacity to rapidly adapt and survive in host tissues and cause disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref009">9</xref>]. In hosts, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> is exposed to various stresses including high temperature, nutrient deprivation, low pH, hypoxia and high levels of free radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>In response to the host environment, morphological changes are required to survive and cause disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref011">11</xref>]. Specifically, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> alters its morphology and produces enlarged cells referred to as giant or “titan cells” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref013">13</xref>]. This phenomenon has been observed in animal and insect models of cryptococcosis, as well as in human lung and brain infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref016">16</xref>]. Titan cells have increased cell body size, ranging from 10 μm up to 100 μm in diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref021">21</xref>] as compared to the 5–7 μm size of typical cells. Studies exploring titan cell biology have revealed that these are: (i) uninucleate polyploid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref020">20</xref>]; (ii) possess a large single vacuole; (iii) are surrounded by a thick cell wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref022">22</xref>]; and (iv) have a dense and highly crosslinked capsule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref022">22</xref>]. Titan cells also exhibit increased resistance to various stresses including phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref021">21</xref>], oxidative and nitrosative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref021">21</xref>], and resistance to the antifungal drug fluconazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref020">20</xref>]. Importantly, titan cell production also enhances dissemination, survival and virulence in a mouse model of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref019">19</xref>]. Titan cell formation is known to be regulated by the G-protein coupled receptors Gpr5 and Ste3a, that signal through the Gα subunit protein Gpa1 to trigger the cyclic adenosine monophosphate / protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref026">26</xref>]. The cAMP/PKA pathway is critical for regulation of other virulence factors in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>, including capsule formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref024">24</xref>], notably through its action on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref027">27</xref>]. Pka1 is known to be negatively regulated by the protein Pkr1, and <italic>pkr1Δ</italic> mutant strains exhibit enlarged capsule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref023">23</xref>]. Further studies show that titan cells formation is increased by high <italic>PKA1</italic> expression or low Pkr1 activity and is decreased by low <italic>PKA1</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref006">6</xref>]. Downstream of the PKA pathway, Rim101, a major transcription factor that again controls production of many virulence factors, is also necessary for titan cell production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>To date, studies of titan cell formation have been hindered by an inability to consistently and reproducibly generate large quantities of titan cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Although several methods have been reported for inducing large cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, there have been persistent problems in easily and consistently implementing these protocols across laboratories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref017">17</xref>], presumably because the variables that contribute to titan cell inducing conditions are not well understood.</p>
<p>In this study, we identified robust <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions that generate enlarged cells with many of the <italic>in vivo</italic> titan cell characteristics and used this protocol to explore environmental and genetic factors involved in titan cell formation. The genetic determinants of titan cell formation have been investigated through a genotype-phenotype correlation study in H99-derivative laboratory reference strains, through analysis of deletion and complementation in reference strains, and analysis of genetic defects in clinical isolates using whole genome data and complementation.</p>

<title>Titan cells generated <italic>in vitro</italic> had similar characteristics to <italic>in vivo</italic> titan cells</title>
<p>While growth in minimal medium using standard growth conditions had no effect on cell size, we identified growth conditions that stimulated the production of enlarged yeast cells and optimized this experimental protocol, referred to as our <italic>in vitro</italic> protocol, using the reference strain H99O (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Observation of these <italic>in vitro</italic>-generated large cells by microscopy shows many characteristics of titan cells including increased cell body size (diameter &gt;10 μm), refractive cell wall, large central vacuole, and peripheral cell cytoplasm distribution, similar to <italic>in vivo</italic> titan cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Our <italic>in vitro</italic> protocol proved to be reproducible with H99O reference strains generating titan cells in three different laboratories throughout the world, although some variability in the overall proportion of titan cells generated was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Specifically, the proportion of titan cells was 39.4% [interquartile range (IQR), [34.1–40.7] in Lab 1, 21.0% [12.5–26.8] in Lab 2 and 29.9% [23.1–48.5] in Lab 3. The distribution of yeast cell body size from the <italic>in vitro</italic> protocol varied from 3.7 to 16.3 μm (median 10.2 [8.5–11.5]), whereas <italic>in vivo</italic> it varies from 3.6 to 41.8 μm (median 14.8 [11.2–18.45]) with 84% of the yeasts classified as titan cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>Titan cells differ from typical cells in various characteristics including capsule size budding rate, DNA content, cell wall and capsule structure, and the extent of melanization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref022">22</xref>]. Comparison of <italic>in vitro</italic> titan cells (TC) to typical cells (tC) showed a significant increase in capsule size (median 4.8 μm in titan cells vs 2.7 μm in typical cells, p&lt;0.001) similar to that observed <italic>in vivo</italic> (median 10.5 μm in titan cells vs 8.0 in typical cells, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). The capsule thickness of <italic>in vivo</italic> titan cells was increased compared to the <italic>in vitro</italic> titan cells. The budding rate of <italic>in vitro</italic> titan cells was also significantly increased (median 82.5 m per bud) compared to typical cells (median 89.0 m per bud) (p = 0.018), whereas it was similar for titan and typical cells produced <italic>in vivo</italic>. Interestingly, overall budding rate was faster <italic>in vivo</italic> than <italic>in vitro</italic> cells (68 and 89 m per bud, p&lt;0.001)). The budding rate of both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> tutan cells and typical cells were faster than cells grown in stationary phase (111.5 and 124.5 m per bud in minimal medium (MM) and YPD, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s014">S1 Movie</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s015">S2 Movie</xref>). To analyze DNA content, yeasts obtained at the end of the <italic>in vitro</italic> protocol were stained with propidium iodide (PI) and DNA content of titan (TC, FSC/SSC<sup>high</sup>) and typical (tC, FSC/SSC<sup>low</sup>) cells was compared to haploid (H99O) and diploid (AD7-77) strains grown in Sabouraud medium. DNA content was higher in titan (FSC/SSC<sup>high</sup>) than typical (FSC/SSS<sup>low</sup>) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), with an increase in the proportion of polyploid cells in the titan cell population as observed by a PI fluorescence greater than the diploid control strain (red arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). In contrast, the typical cells had the same PI fluorescence pattern as the haploid H99O cells. Similarly, a reverse gating strategy based on PI intensity shows yeasts with the highest PI intensity were large titan cells (red arrows, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Calcofluor white (CFW) staining was used to analyze cell wall chitin content. After multispectral imaging flow cytometry—gating on the titan and typical cell populations under both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>)—CFW fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>) showed significantly increased fluorescence of titan cells compared to typical cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (322539 ± 3072 vs 123062 ± 20727, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (144909 ± 38487 vs 27622 ± 7412, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Cell sorting based on CFW staining and fluorescence microscopy allowed us to validate that cells exhibiting the higher CFW intensity were titan cells (FSC/SSC<sup>high</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Measurements of chitin content using fluorescence microscopy also showed significant increases in titan cells compared to typical cells (fluorescence intensity/pixel/cell 87.9 [71.7–107.7] vs 66.5 [51.7–79.4], respectively, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). Chitin levels were also assessed by N-acetylglucosamine (Gluc-NAc) content. Gluc-NAc levels were higher in titan cells (156.3 mM/g [153.7–203.7]) than typical cells (97.7 [87.2–119.3]), (p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s004">S4B Fig</xref>).

<p>To examine temporal changes in cell size induced by our protocol, we measured yeast cell sizes at 0, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 120 h using automated analysis. This automated analysis correlated with manual size measurements (Interclass correlation = 0.99) and titan/typical cell classification (Kappa test = 0.81±0.07).

<title>Generation of titan cells <italic>in vitro</italic> was influenced by environmental conditions</title>
<p>We tested several parameters affecting steps 2 and 3 of our protocol described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s001">S1 Fig</xref> and identified parameters that significantly influenced titan cell generation, as measured by cell size distribution and proportion of titan cells. The first parameter we tested was the growth medium and transition between different growth media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Initial culture in YPD (step 2) then transfer to MM (step 3) resulted in the highest median cell size at 9.1 μm [6.9–11.1]. Initial culture MM followed by transfer to MM produced fewer titan cells, 25.5% (118/463) vs 39.5% (182/461), although the titan cells tended to be larger with cell body diameters over 20 μm. Light exposure during step 3 also increased both median cell size and proportion of titan cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In the light, median cell size was 9.4 μm [7.3–11.4] vs 8.4 μm [7.1–9.9] in the dark, with a titan cell proportion of 41.6% (983/2362) vs 24.3% (1072/4399), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Incubation temperature at 30°C at step 3 increased cell size distribution compared to 37°C (9.4 μm [7.3–11.4] vs 7.0 μm [6.2–8.2]) as well as the proportion of titan cells (41.6% (983/2362) vs 8.1% (297/3652)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The pH of the minimal medium at step 3 also influenced cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), with pH = 5.5 producing significantly larger cells and proportion of titan cells (9.1 μm [6.9–11.2] and 38.6% titan cells), compared to either lower pH (pH = 4: median 5.1 μm [4.4–5.8] (0%)) or higher pH (pH = 7: 8.2 μm [7.2–9.4] (16.4%), or pH = 8.5: 6.9μm [5.9–7.9] (0.7%)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Finally, hypoxia at step 3 also increased median cell size compared to normoxia (7.5 μm [5.9–9.7]), with chemically induced hypoxia yielding higher median cell sizes compared to physically induced hypoxia] (10.1 μm [7.8–12.5] vs 8.9 μm [7.3–10.9, p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g004">Fig 4E</xref>).

<p>To understand if an alteration in yeast metabolism induced by ergosterol, protein or nucleic acids inhibition affected titan cell formation, we tested the effect of co-incubation of fluconazole (inhibitor of ergosterol synthesis) and flucytosine (inhibitor of nucleic acids formation and transcription) and cycloheximide (translation inhibitor) at step 3. Fluconazole (FLC) exposure resulted in significantly smaller median cell sizes compared to the drug-free control (7.1 μm [6.2–8.3]) at 1 mg/L, 6.8 μm [5.9–7.8] at 2 mg/L, and 6.5 μm [5.6–7.2] at 4 mg/L vs 9.4 μm [7.5–11.3] in the control, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g005">Fig 5D</xref>) and a significantly smaller proportion of titan cells (5.9% (124/2073) at 1 mg/L, 2.9% (55/1919) at 2 mg/L and 1.0% (19/1877) at 4 mg/L vs 40.9% (877/2146) in the control, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Flucytosine exposure significantly decreased the mean yeast cell size at all concentrations tested (6.5 μm [5.9–6.9] at 1 mg/L, 6.5 μm [6.1–6.9] at 2.5 mg/L, and 6.4 μm [5.9–6.8] at 5 mg/L compared to control (8.3 μm [6.8–10.3], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g005">Fig 5E</xref>) with no titan cells observed upon flucytosine exposure. Cycloheximide exposure at 0.1 μg/mL also significantly decreased the mean cell size from 9.0 μm [6.3–12.7] to 6.1 μm [5.5–6.9] (p&lt;0.0001) and the proportion of titan cells from 43.3% (797/1840) to 0.1% (20/1663) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g005">Fig 5F</xref>).

<p>We also tested if iterative subcultures with or without the presence of active molecules (CFW or fluconazole) affected titan cell formation, assuming that the cell wall and the global metabolism of the sub-cultured progeny would be impaired in the presence of high concentrations of the cell wall toxic drug (CFW) or fluconazole, respectively. We analyzed the impact of repeated sub-culture of the cells prior to step 1 on titan cell production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Sub-culture on Sabouraud agar eight times (8 Sub) spanning a one-month period significantly decreased the median cell size (8.60 μm [7.02–10.07]) compared to the initial culture (0 Sub) (9.17 [6.99–10.90]) (p&lt;0.0001). Addition of CFW to induce cell wall stress during sub-culture (8Sub+CFW) significantly decreased the median cell size (8.03 μm [6.82–9.46]) compared to the 8Sub control. Thus, iterative exposure to fluconazole during sub-culture significantly increased the median yeast cell size to 10.15 μm [8.04–13.23] (8Sub+FLC) compared to the 8Sub control (p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s007">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>Two genes, <italic>LMP1</italic> and <italic>SGF29</italic>, are dramatically affected by SNPs/indels in the H99 derivatives; <italic>LMP1</italic> has a frameshift deletion (H99W and H99 CMO18) and <italic>SGF29</italic> is deleted (KN99α and H99L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref035">35</xref>]. To determine if these genes are involved in titan cell production, we analyzed <italic>lmp1Δ</italic> and <italic>sgf29Δ</italic> deletion mutants for <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> titan cell formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g007">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s008">S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s009">S9</xref> Figs, respectively). <italic>In vitro</italic>, the <italic>sgf29Δ</italic> mutant in the H99O background had half the titan cell formation of the H99O wild-type strain [8.1% (49/600) to 4.2% (25/600), p&lt;0.0001]. The <italic>sgf29Δ</italic> mutant in the hypervirulent H99S also manifested no titan cells generation, as did an <italic>lmp1Δ</italic> mutant in this background. Complementation of <italic>LMP1</italic> and <italic>SGF29</italic> in this H99S mutant restored titan cells generation to that found in the parental strain; 1.2% (13/935) and 1.4% (7/600), respectively vs H99S 1.6% (25/1540) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Importantly, the same trend was observed for <italic>in vivo</italic> titan cell formation. <italic>In vivo</italic>, the <italic>lmp1Δ</italic> H99S mutant produced only 3.5% (21/600) titan cells compared to 14% for H99S (84/600), p&lt;0.0001, and this decrease in titan cell production was restored in the <italic>lmp1Δ</italic>:<italic>LMP1</italic> H99S strains (9.5% (57/600)) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s008">S8B Fig</xref>). The <italic>sgf29Δ</italic> mutant in the H99O background reduced titan cell formation <italic>in vivo</italic> from 18.8% (113/600) to 9.3% (37/400) (p&lt;0.0001). In H99S, complementation of Sgf29 <italic>(sgf29Δ</italic>:<italic>SGF29</italic>) in H99S restored titan cell generation to wild-type H99S levels from 5% (30/600) to 19.8% (237/1200) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s008">S8B Fig</xref>) (p&lt;0.0001).</p>
<p>SREBP is a gene involved in response to hypoxia, so we tested titan cell formation in the <italic>sre1Δ</italic> mutant. The proportion of titan cells was significantly decreased in the <italic>sre1Δ</italic> mutant at 5.1% (53/920) compared to KN99α [14% (337/2358)] (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s010">S10 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> titan cell generation requires signaling through the Gpr/PKA/Rim101 pathway</title>
<p>The signal transduction pathway Gpr/PKA/Rim101 regulates titan cell formation <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref018">18</xref>]. Briefly, the G-protein coupled receptor 5 and Ste3<bold>a</bold> pheromone receptor signal through Gpa1 to trigger the cAMP/PKA signaling cascade, ultimately activating the Rim101 transcription factor. This pathway regulates virulence factors such as capsule or melanin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref037">37</xref>].</p>
<p>To determine if this same pathway was critical for titan cell generation <italic>in vitro</italic>, we examined cell enlargement in the <italic>gpr4Δ</italic>, <italic>gpr5Δ</italic>, <italic>gpr4Δ</italic>/<italic>gpr5Δ</italic>, <italic>rim101Δ</italic>, and <italic>cac1Δ</italic> mutants and their complemented strains in both the H99 and KN99α genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). In the H99O genetic background, Rim101 function was similar to that observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, with little titan cell formation in the <italic>rim101Δ</italic> mutant (1.9% (51/2600)) and full restoration of titan cell production in the complemented strain (9.2% (239/2600) (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). In KN99α, the <italic>rim101Δ</italic>, <italic>gpr4Δ/gpr5Δ</italic>, and <italic>cac1Δ</italic> mutants had no titan cell formation, but surprisingly both of the single <italic>gpr4Δ</italic> and <italic>gpr5Δ</italic> mutants also lacked titan cell formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). This is in contrast to <italic>in vivo</italic> where titan cell production was rescued by GPR5 alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref018">18</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggest that signaling through both Gpr4 and Gpr5 via the cAMP/PKA pathway to Rim101 is required for titan cell production <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<p>To determine whether the Gpr/PKA/Rim101 pathway can impact titan cell formation in clinical isolates, we also screened a total of 56 clinical isolates for their ability to produce titan cells. Two isolates (AD2-06a and AD2-02a) produced a more titan cells relative to H99O (ratio of clinical strain/H99O of 2.6±0.3 and 1.4±0.3, respectively). Three additional isolates (AD4-37a, AD1-95a, AD4-43a) produced fewer titan cells than H99O (ratio = 0.4±0.3, 0.2±0.1, 0.1±0.0, respectively). Titan cell production in the other clinical isolates was close to zero (ratio between 0.1 and 0.01% for five, less than 0.01% for six, and no titan cells at all for the remaining 39 isolates) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g008">Fig 8A</xref>).</p>

(<bold>E</bold>) Strains with <italic>PKR1</italic> loss-of-function mutation showed a variable ability to produce titan cells, as compared to H99O (grey bar). The clinical isolate AD2-07, which produces significantly less titan cells was recovered from the CSF of an HIV-positive patient on d 13 of amphotericin B treatment while AD2-06a, which produced the highest proportion of titan cells, was recovered from the initial CSF sample of the same patient.

Experiments A, F and G were done in triplicate, B twice (screening). To compare the experimental conditions to H99O, Khi2 analysis was performed (*p&lt;0.0001, **p&lt;0.05).

<p>The complete genome sequence was obtained for 41 of the 68 screened clinical isolates and a phylogenetic tree of these strains and the H99O reference strain shows high genetic diversity including VNI, VNII, VNBII isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006982.t002">Table 2</xref>). Compared to H99O, the high titan cells generating strain AD2-06a harbored 31,229 SNPs and was closely related to AD3-55a (31,171 SNPs) and AD3-41a (28,599 SNPs), which were both unable to produce titan cells. A total of 19 genes, including CNAG_00570 (<italic>PKR1</italic>), were disrupted in AD2-06a and not in AD3-55a and AD3-41a (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s017">S1 Table</xref>). Of note, no common genetic mutation, insertion or deletion was observed in the 3 strains that produced a significant (&gt;1%) proportion of titan cells (H99O, AD2-06a, AD1-95a) as compared to all the other examined isolates. Duplication of chromosomal regions were observed in the French sequenced clinical isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s018">S2 Table</xref>) with AD2-06a harboring a large duplication of chromosome 9 (Chr9, region 465–665kb). To assess whether the Chr9 duplicated region could be responsible for titan cell formation, we explored a larger collection of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> strains with complete genome sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref038">38</xref>] and discovered five additional clinical isolates (Ug2459, CCTP20, FFV14, WM-148, WM-626) harboring partial duplications on chr9 duplication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). We analyzed titan cell formation in these 5 isolates, but only the Ug2459 strain generated titan cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and only at a low proportion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s011">S11 Fig</xref>), suggesting that genes located within in the AD2-06a Chr9 duplication are not involved by themselves in titan cell formation.</p>

<p>AD2-06a was isolated from the initial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample of an HIV-infected patient at baseline (diagnosis of cryptococcosis). Another isolate, AD2-07, was recovered from the CSF of the same patient after 13 d of amphotericin B treatment. Thus, AD2-06a and AD2-07 are closely related with only 137 different SNPs and 40 indels. AD3-55a is in the same clade and also very similar with 370 different SNPs and 64 indels, although recovered from another patient and in another place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g008">Fig 8B and 8C</xref>). By contrast, these three isolates differ from H99O by 29,000 SNP and 3,386 indels. AD2-07 and AD3-55a were both unable to produce titan cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g008">Fig 8A, 8B and 8E</xref>), allowing a more fine-scale analysis of SNPs linked to titan cell formation in these closely related strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Specifically, AD2-07 produced 1.0% (31/3047) titan cells compared to 39.1%, (639/1633) in AD2-06a and 15.2% (304/2001) in H99O (p&lt;0.0001). The median cell size of AD2-07 was significantly decreased compared to AD2-06a and H99O (5.9 μm [5.2–6.6] for AD2-07, 8.5 μm [7.0–13.0] for AD2-06a, and 7.7 μm [6.5–9.2] for H99O, p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s012">S12 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Comparison of the AD2-06a, AD2-07, and AD3-55a genomes identified four genes with loss-of-function mutations in AD2-06a but not in AD2-07 or AD3-55a: CNAG_00570 (PKR1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g008">Fig 8D</xref>), CNAG_07475 (hypothetical protein), CNAG_01240 (hypothetical protein) and CNAG_05335 (hypothetical protein). More precisely, AD2-06a had a frameshift mutation at glycine 125 in the CNAG_00570 (<italic>PKR1</italic>) leading to a truncated protein of 138 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Pkr1 is the cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit that interacts with Pka to regulate the phosphorylation activity of Pka. To further explore <italic>PKR1</italic> in clinical isolates, we analyzed additional, previously sequenced, clinical isolates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s019">S3 Table</xref>) that harbored mutations leading to Pkr1 truncation (Bt156, Bt58, 8–1, Bt77, Bt117, Ug2462) for titan cell formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref039">39</xref>]. Specifically, a frameshift mutation at amino acid 14 introducing a premature stop codon at position 96 for Bt156, as well as stop codons introduced at positions 130 for AD2-06a, 258 for Bt58, 302 for 8–1, 439 for Bt77, 441 for Bt117, and 445 for Ug2462 were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g008">Fig 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006982.t003">Table 3</xref>). We hypothesized that the strains with highly impacted/truncated Pkr1 protein would produce more titan cells, similar to the AD2-06a isolate. AD2-06a and Bt156, the strains with the largest truncation, had high levels of titan cell formation with a ratio of 2.8±1.0 for AD2-06a and 1.3±0.6 for Bt156 compared to H99O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g008">Fig 8E</xref>), and titan cell proportions and median cell sizes of 39.1% (639/1633) (median 8.5μm [7.0–13.0]) and 17.9% (469/2614) (median 7.7μm [6.4–9.4]), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s012">S12 Fig</xref>). For the other strains, the ratio, proportion of titan cells, and median size were decreased compared to H99O: 0.2±0.0, 3.6% (89/2464) and 6.9 μm [6.0–7.8] for 8–1 strain; 0.2±0.1, 2.9% (110/3834) and 6.5 μm [5.8–7.1] for Bt77; 0.1±0.0 0.9% (27/3081) and 6.4 μm [5.7–7.2] for Bt117; and 0.1±0.1, 1.5% (54/3628) 5.4μm [4.7–6.1] for Ug2462, p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g008">Fig 8E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s012">S12 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>To directly test whether the truncated Pkr1 protein impacted titan cell production in strain AD2-06a, the functional KN99α allele of the <italic>PKR1</italic> gene was introduced into the strain (AD2-06a:<italic>PKR1</italic>) and titan cell formation analyzed. Titan cell production was significantly decreased by complementation (p&lt;0.0001) with 44.9% (574/1279) for AD2-06a:<italic>PKR1</italic> as compared to 64.6% (700/1083) for AD2-06a and 23.2% (555/2363) for H99O (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g008">Fig 8F</xref>).</p>
<p>To further explore the function of <italic>PKR1</italic> in titan cell formation, we also tested the ability of <italic>pkr1Δ</italic> in a KN99α background to generate titan cells compared to KN99α, and found that <italic>pkr1Δ</italic> produced more titan cells with a ratio of 4.9±1.6 compared to the parental strain KN99α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g009">Fig 9</xref>). The <italic>pkr1Δ</italic> median cell size (8.1 μm [6.7–9.5]) exceeded that of KN99α (6.4 μm [5.5–7.2]) p&lt;0.0001) with a significant increase in the proportion of titan cells at 28.5% (695/2436) for <italic>pkr1Δ</italic> vs 4.6% (121/2614) for KN99α (p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). We also analyzed titan cell production in two additional independent <italic>pkr1Δ</italic> and complemented <italic>pkr1Δ</italic>:<italic>PKR1</italic> strain in the H99 background. The <italic>pkr1Δ-1</italic> and complemented <italic>pkr1Δ</italic>:<italic>PKR1-1</italic> gave ratios of 2.9±1.5 and 1.8±0.7, respectively, while the <italic>pkr1Δ-2 and</italic> complemented <italic>pkr1Δ</italic>:<italic>PKR1-2</italic> ratio were 1.9±0.8 and 1.4±0.4, respectively, compared to the H99 parental strains (1.0±0.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). In both strains, complementation significantly reduced the proportion of titan cells generated (p&lt;0.0001) from 29.8% (685/2493) for <italic>pkr1Δ-1</italic> to 18.8% (593/3217) for <italic>pkr1Δ</italic>:<italic>PKR1-1</italic>; and from 19.9% (422/2364) for <italic>pkr1Δ-2</italic> to 13.9% (359/2588) for <italic>pkr1Δ</italic>:<italic>PKR1-2</italic> with H99 at 10.3% (357/3674). We also tested the role of <italic>PKA1</italic> and <italic>PKR1</italic> using the galactose-inducible and glucose-repressible versions of <italic>PKA1</italic> and <italic>PKR1</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref006">6</xref>]. In these mutants, when incubated in galactose minimal medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g009">Fig 9C</xref>), the genes are turned on whereas when incubated in glucose minimal medium the genes are turned off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g009">Fig 9D</xref>). In galactose minimal medium, P<sub>GAL7</sub>::PKA1 and P<sub>GAL7</sub>::PKR1 had titan cell production ratios of 5.6±1.1 and 0.6±0.5 compared to H99, respectively. The proportion of titan cells was significantly increased upon <italic>PKA1</italic> induction [46.9% (794/1724)] and reduced by <italic>PKR1</italic> induction [4.7% (222/5031)] compared with H99 in galactose minimal medium at 14.8% (402/3108) (p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). In glucose minimal medium, P<sub>GAL7</sub>::<italic>PKA1</italic> and P<sub>GAL7</sub>::<italic>PKR1</italic> had titan cell production ratios of 0.0±0.0 and 2.4±1.0, respectively. The proportion of titan cells was significantly decreased upon <italic>PKA1</italic> repression [0.2% (6/4156)] and increased by <italic>PKR1</italic> repression [25.4%(527/2425)] compared with H99 at 10.3% (357/3674) (p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g009">Fig 9D</xref>).</p>

<p>At least 2 other genes (<italic>TSP2</italic>, <italic>USV101</italic>) have been linked to titan cells formation <italic>in vivo</italic> although their role is less clear, so we directly explored their phenotypes in our <italic>in vitro</italic> protocol. To examine the role of tetraspanin 2 (Tsp2) in titan cell formation <italic>in vitro</italic>, we analyzed three independent tetraspanin 2 deletion mutants (<italic>tsp2Δ-1</italic>, <italic>tsp2Δ-2</italic> and <italic>tsp2Δ-3</italic>) and two complemented mutants (<italic>tsp2Δ-1</italic>:<italic>TSP2-1</italic> and <italic>tsp2Δ-1</italic>:<italic>TSP2-2</italic>) for their titan cell formation compared to the wild-type KN99α. Titan cell production was significantly increased in the deletion mutants (23.9% (518/2161) for <italic>tsp2Δ-1</italic>, 55.7% (990/1778) for <italic>tsp2Δ-2</italic>, 44.3% (714/1610) <italic>tsp2Δ-3</italic>, 4.6% (119/2576)) compared to the wild-type and complemented strains (<italic>tsp2Δ-1</italic>:<italic>TSP2-1</italic>, 5.8% (228/3877) for <italic>tsp2Δ-1</italic>:<italic>TSP2-2</italic> and 4.9% (173/3472) for KN99α) (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g009">Fig 9E</xref>). Similarly, <italic>usv101Δ</italic> median cell size (10.6 μm [8.7–12.7]) was higher than the parental strain KN99α (7.6μm [6.6–8.8]) and the proportion of titan cells was 62.7% (1260/2008) for <italic>usv101Δ</italic> vs 10.5% (238/2262) for KN99α (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s009">S9 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We finally selected additional sequenced clinical isolates that harbored mutations leading to Usv101 or Cac1 truncation. Bt88 showed a truncation of Usv101 and an increased titan cells formation ratio of 0.6±0.4 whereas the other isolates belonging to the VNBII lineage harboring a <italic>CAC1</italic> mutation (Bt133 and Bt31, Bt40, Bt89 and Bt105) did not show increased titan cells formation (ratio 0.0±0.0) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006982.s013">S13 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We identified and validated a new protocol allowing robust generation of titan cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. This protocol was discovered serendipitously while testing conditions that could induce dormancy in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref004">4</xref>]. We observed yeast cell enlargement under defined growth conditions, then optimized those conditions for titan cell production. It is important to note that the utility of other published protocols to generate titan cells <italic>in vitro</italic> are hindered by issues with inter-laboratory reproducibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref031">31</xref>]. To establish the inter-laboratory transferability of our protocol, we independently tested it in two other laboratories (K. Nielsen and A. Casadevall) and observed that the protocol produced similar results in all laboratories, although slight variations of the materials and equipment used produced subtle variability in the percentage of titan cells generated in the 3 labs. Interestingly, titan cell production <italic>in vitro</italic> was also optimized by Ballou et al. 2017 and Zaragoza et al. 2017, using a different set of growth conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref041">41</xref>]. Exploration of the similarities and differences between these protocols will likely identify the critical environmental conditions that trigger titan cell production <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Titan cells obtained <italic>in vitro</italic> exhibited many of the characteristics of <italic>in vivo</italic> titan cells recovered from the lungs of infected mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref017">17</xref>]. Similar to previous work on <italic>in vivo</italic> titan cells, we defined the <italic>in vitro</italic> titan cells as having a cell body size &gt; 10 μm and typical cells with a cell body size ≤ 10 μm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref021">21</xref>]. Titan cells generated with our <italic>in vitro</italic> protocol were also polyploids, as previously shown <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref013">13</xref>]. Melanization was increased in <italic>in vitro</italic> titan compared to typical cells. Capsule size was slightly increased in the <italic>in vitro</italic> titan cells compared to typical cells, but this difference was lower than previously shown <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref013">13</xref>]. We also demonstrated that, regardless of the capsule size differences between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> titan cells, the structure of the <italic>in vitro</italic> titan cell capsule was different to that in typical cells, a phenomenon also observed <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref022">22</xref>]. The cell wall was thicker in <italic>in vitro</italic> titan cells compared to typical cells, as previously analyzed <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref042">42</xref>]. The increased chitin in the titan cell wall results in a detrimental immune response that exacerbates disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref042">42</xref>]. These findings suggest a fundamental difference in titan and typical surface structure that may contribute to reduced titan cell phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref021">21</xref>]. These cell surface differences also underscore the complex regulation of these major virulence factors and shows intricate adaptation of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> to both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions.</p>
<p>Titan cell generation <italic>in vitro</italic> allowed a detailed kinetic analysis that revealed titan cells are formed between 4 and 8 h. Using calcofluor white staining to follow cell fate and cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref030">30</xref>], we showed that titan cells were exclusively derived from cells present in the initial inoculum that evolved progressively toward the titan cell phenotype. In contrast, typical cells were a mixture of cells from the initial inoculum and new cell replication. Titan cell division produced typical sized haploid cells, as shown previously for <italic>in vivo</italic> titan cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref013">13</xref>] and confirmed in our study. We published <italic>in vivo</italic> data that validate this observation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref004">4</xref>]: using yeasts recovered from the lung of mice at one week after inoculation of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> stained with calcofluor and multispectral imaging flow cytometry, we showed that the Calcofluor<sup>High</sup> population was associated with yeast cells harboring high cell size parameters compatible with titan cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref004">4</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, titan cell generation coincided with the appearance of a large vacuole in the yeast cells at 4 and 8 h of incubation. Recent evidence places vacuoles at the center of networks enabling nutrient resources to be degraded, sorted and redistributed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref043">43</xref>]. As the vacuole volume occupies much of the total volume of the titan cell body, one can imagine that cell-cycle regulation could be impacted, ultimately leading to polyploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>The fact that our <italic>in vitro</italic> protocol consistently produced titan cells also allowed us to test factors that influenced their appearance. In terms of environmental factors, we showed that titan cell production was influenced by pre-culture medium, initial pH, light exposure, temperature, type of medium and hypoxia. A metabolic switch between YPD (rich medium) pre-culture and minimal medium (poor medium) incubation was a key factor to induce titan cell generation. This switch is a stress that induces many metabolic modifications and has been studied extensively in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref044">44</xref>]. Hypoxia is another stress factor encountered by human pathogenic fungi during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref045">45</xref>], and a strong signal for titan cell production <italic>in vitro</italic>. Oxygen levels in healthy human tissues are 20–70 mmHg (2.5–9% O<sub>2</sub>), but can be less than 10 mmHg (∼1% O<sub>2</sub>) in hypoxic or inflamed tissues or inside granulomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref046">46</xref>]. We know from previous work on pulmonary aspergillosis that hypoxia has been observed in infected lungs of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref047">47</xref>]. Titan cells have been reported in human pulmonary cryptococcosis and well-studied in murine pulmonary infection following inhalation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref021">21</xref>], although they are also observed in mouse lungs after intravenous inoculation of animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref004">4</xref>]. These observations lead us to hypothesize that low oxygen levels in the lungs could be a signal for titan cell formation. A major transcriptional regulator of the fungal hypoxia response is the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (Srebp) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref048">48</xref>]. Deletion mutants of the <italic>SREBP</italic> gene (<italic>sre1Δ</italic>) in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> display defects in adaptation to hypoxia, ergosterol synthesis, susceptibility to triazole antifungal drugs and cause a reduction of virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref048">48</xref>]. Importantly, the <italic>sre1Δ</italic> mutant also showed defects in titan cell production <italic>in vitro</italic>, highlighting the role of hypoxia in titan cell production.</p>
<p>Interestingly, quorum sensing is also involved in titan cell production. Indeed, the initial concentration of yeasts in minimal medium dramatically impacted titan cell generation, with 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL being the optimal cell concentration to generate titan cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. No titan cell formation was observed with a starting concentration of 10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL, likely due to rapid consumption of the nutrients preventing metabolic modifications needed to generate titan cells. Alternatively, addition of the quorum Qsp1 peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref049">49</xref>] to wild type cultures (already producing Qsp1) decreased titan cell production, suggesting that Qsp1 negatively regulates titan cell production. Cleavage and internalization of Qsp1 were critical because the <italic>qsp1Δ</italic>, <italic>pqp1Δ</italic>, <italic>opt1Δ</italic> mutants all showed increased titan cell production. Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) has also been implicated in quorum sensing in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref032">32</xref>]. Addition of pantothenic acid dramatically increased titan cell formation at concentrations between 0.125 and 12.5 μM. These results demonstrate that intercellular communication is important for titan cell formation and that this sensing process involves cell-cell communication instead of simple nutrient sensing.</p>
<p>Induction of titan cells due to the presence of host factors such as temperature, addition of lipids, presence of serum, and antibodies was also tested. The presence of E1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref050">50</xref>] and 18B7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref051">51</xref>] anti-capsular IgG antibodies decreased titan cell production. This decrease could be related to changes in yeast metabolism induced directly by anti-capsular antibodies, as shown previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref052">52</xref>], and provides a new mechanism by which antibodies could alter the course of infection. One could imagine that specific anti-capsular antibodies may not reach cryptococcal cells in the alveolar space at sufficient concentration to impair enlargement. The presence of surfactant protein-D, considered as an opsonin in the lung, could impair antibody fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref053">53</xref>], thus inhibiting the inhibitory effect of IgG antibodies and allowing titan cell formation in the lung. Interestingly, addition of serum (5% FCS) or L-α-phosphatidylcholine decreased titan cell production, which is different from other protocols for titan cells generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref041">41</xref>]. This difference may be because our protocol induces titan cells through parallel or independent pathways to those triggered by serum or lipids. Overall, these results imply the existence of numerous triggers for titan cell formation mediated through independent signaling pathways. How these pathways ultimately interact, both positively and negatively, to regulate titan cell production still needs to be explored.</p>
<p>Titan cell production was inhibited by addition of fluconazole, flucytosine and cycloheximide—even at concentrations that or below the MIC of the drug. Fluconazole is known to inhibit the 14-alpha-demethylase (Erg11) involved in ergosterol synthesis, leading to plasma membrane instability and accumulation of toxic precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref054">54</xref>]. Flucytosine is a base analogue leading to inhibition of DNA replication and protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref055">55</xref>]. Cycloheximide is known to impact protein synthesis through inhibition of translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref027">27</xref>]. Thus, titan cell production likely involves an active process requiring protein and nucleic acid production, as well as plasma membrane integrity (normal ergosterol quantity). Conversely, serial passage in the presence of fluconazole increased titan cell production, suggesting compensatory changes in response to fluconazole also impacted titan cell production. These data have profound implications for <italic>in vivo</italic> titan cell production, as prolonged drug therapy could prevent or enhance titan cell formation. In previous studies, exposure of titan cells to fluconazole selected for aneuploidy and drug resistance in the daughter cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref020">20</xref>]. In contrast, our studies show exposure to cell-wall stress, induced by serial passage on CFW agar, decreased titan cell production. In these sub-culture experiments, we did not investigate subsequent genomic or metabolic changes that arise under these stress conditions. Serial sub-culture could have induced genetic rearrangements (aneuploidy, SNPs, indels) or epigenetic variation that altered titan cell production.</p>
<p>Our protocol is easy to implement for study of the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying titan cell generation. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> assay allowed us to identify host, environmental and yeast factors that impact titan cell production. By taking advantage of strains harboring genetic differences and clinically relevant genetic truncations, we were able to assess genetic factors modulating titan cell production. However, these studies also highlight that variability in titan cell formation cannot be completely explained by the acquisition of genetic events, with H99-derivative strains showing diversity in titan cell production that does not fully correlate with genetic modifications. The observation that titan cell formation in KN99α differs <italic>in vitro</italic> (lower than H99O) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (equivalent to H99O) highlights this issue and suggests further strain adaptation that are yet to be characterized.</p>
<p>We uncovered new genes involved as positive or negative regulators of titan cell production. Sgf29, is a component of the SAGA complex that binds H3K4me2/3 and recruits histone deacetylases in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref056">56</xref>]. The <italic>LMP1</italic> gene is known to be involved in virulence in a mouse model and in mating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref034">34</xref>]. We showed here that both genes are positive regulators of titan cell formation, although their mechanism of action remains unclear. We also showed <italic>in vitro</italic> the critical role of the Gpr/PKA/Rim101 pathway in titan cell formation, previously characterized <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref018">18</xref>]. Gpr5 signals through Gpa1 to trigger the PKA pathway that activates the transcription factor Rim101 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref036">36</xref>]. In addition, we identified three genes that are negative regulators of titan cell formation, including <italic>PKR1</italic> (known to act as a regulatory subunit in the PKA pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref023">23</xref>], <italic>TSP2</italic> that encodes a glucose repressor of laccase in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref057">57</xref>], and <italic>USV101</italic> that is a pleiotropic transcription factor in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> known to regulate capsule formation and pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref058">58</xref>].</p>
<p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the Pka1/Pkr1 complex is a heterotetramer with 2 catalytic subunits and 2 regulatory units. This complex is dissociated in the presence of cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref059">59</xref>]. Moreover, the architecture of the functional domains of <italic>Pkr1</italic> include one interaction domain/dimerization at amino acids 2 to 40 and two cAMP binding domains at amino acids 219 to 351 and 353 to 473, based on INTERPRO data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Consequently, the cAMP binding domain on Pkr1 is critical for the dissociation of the PKA1/PKR1 complex. Analysis of differences in titan cell production, combined with complete genome sequencing, allowed us to identify naturally occurring mutations in the <italic>PKR1</italic> gene that impact titan cell production. Both <italic>PKR1</italic> mutations have a stop codon (Gly125fs for AD2-06 and Asp14fs for Bt156) that reduces the protein length. Interestingly, AD2-06a was the incident clinical isolate and a recurrent isolate recovered after 13 days of amphotericin treatment (AD2-07) did not harbor this PKR1 mutation. In addition, a <italic>PKR1</italic> mutation leading to intron retention was found in a relapse isolate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref060">60</xref>] and shown to be associated with less virulence than the incident isolate. Whether the virulence differences observed with the relapse isolates are linked to titan cell formation needs to be further investigated.</p>
<p>We identified <italic>TSP2</italic> as a negative regulator of titan cell formation based on deletion mutants and complemented strains. <italic>TSP2</italic> is known to interact with the cAMP/PKA pathway—<italic>tsp2Δ</italic> mutant strains phenotype are reversed by the addition of cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref057">57</xref>]. These data suggest that <italic>TSP2</italic> inhibits the cAMP pathway and reinforces the major role of cAMP in titan cell formation. No natural <italic>TSP2</italic> mutants were observed in our collection of clinical isolates.</p>
<p>Interestingly, all isolates from the VNBII have a mutation in the <italic>CAC1</italic> gene leading to the functional defect of the Cac1 protein. Out of the six VNBII isolates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006982.t003">Table 3</xref>), only Bt88 that harbored an additional functional abolition of Usv101 was able to produce as much titan cells as H99O did. Therefore, in Bt88, titan cell formation resulted in the equilibrium between the abolition of CAC1 (positive regulator) and USV101 (negative regulator).</p>
<p>Altogether, these results show proof of concept that our <italic>in vitro</italic> protocol can be used to identify and characterize genes required for titan cell production. Our preliminary analysis only identified a handful of genes involved in titan cell production, but it is likely that many more are involved in generation of this complex cell morphology. Our data provide new insights into the genesis of titan cells and the environmental, host and genetic factors that influence their production. Finally, our data show that this <italic>in vitro</italic> protocol can be used to reproducibly generate titan cells that have similar characteristics to titan cells generated <italic>in vivo</italic>. The conditions identified for titan cell formation provide a robust system that could be invaluable to dissect the molecular mechanisms that underlie titan cell formation and allow the identification of naturally occurring mutations that regulate titan cell formation. These studies will enhance our understanding of the impact and mechanisms of yeast morphological changes on pathobiology.</p>

<title>Chitin content and capsule structure quantification</title>
<p>Multispectral flow cytometry was used to quantify chitin content after calcofluor white staining (CFW, fluorescent brightener 28, 0.0001 μg/mL CFW in PBS) and capsule structure after immunostaining of three anti-capsular antibodies (E1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref050">50</xref>], both 2D10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref029">29</xref>] and 13F1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref029">29</xref>] IgM monoclonal antibody 30 m at 10 μg/mL) and then incubation with FITC coupled anti-IgG or -IgM secondary antibodies (15 m at 1:1000 concentration in PBS). The antibody 18B7 has not been used for this specific experiment because it produces aggregation that prevented ImagestreamX testing. Pictures were taken in flow and analyzed using various existing algorithms. We used ImageStreamX with the INSPIRE software (Amnis Corporation). Cell suspensions were adjusted to 10<sup>7</sup> in 200 μL and 10,000 cells were recorded at 40-fold magnification in 3 different channels including the bright field channel (BF) and 2 fluorescence channels (channel 1: 430-505nm [CALCO]; channel 2: 470-560nm [Anticapsular antibodies]). Data analysis was performed using the IDEAS software (Amnis Corporation) after fluorescence compensation procedures. The first step consists in the definition of a mask that delineates the relevant pixels in each picture. Then, 54 algorithms (calculations made for each event within a defined mask) are available to analyze size, texture, location, shape or signal strength. Using basic algorithms, unfocused events, yeasts aggregates were excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1006982.ref004">4</xref>]. First titan cells (TC) and typical cells (tC) were selected based on a dot plot Area/Diameter. We decided to avoid overlap between populations and select well separated population based on their size after control using the bar added on the picture of the yeasts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006982.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>).
