<abstract>
<p>The accumulation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in rice is important in its interaction with the rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> during which the pathogen scavenges ROS through the production of extracellular enzymes that promote blast. We previously characterized the MoYvh1 protein phosphatase from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> that plays a role in scavenging of ROS. To understand the underlying mechanism, we found that MoYvh1 is translocated into the nucleus following oxidative stress and that this translocation is dependent on MoSsb1 and MoSsz1 that are homologous to heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) proteins. In addition, we established a link between MoYvh1 and MoMrt4, a ribosome maturation factor homolog whose function also involves shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Moreover, we found that MoYvh1 regulates the production of extracellular proteins that modulate rice-immunity. Taking together, our evidence suggests that functions of MoYvh1 in regulating ROS scavenging require its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and the partner proteins MoSsb1 and MoSsz1, as well as MoMrt4. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanism by which <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> responds to and subverts host immunity through the regulation of ribosome biogenesis and protein biosynthesis.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>ROS accumulation is important for the interaction between the blast fungus <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> and its rice host. The protein phosphatase MoYvh1 affects the scavenging of host-derived ROS that promotes <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> infection. We found that MoYvh1 is translocated to the nucleus under oxidative stress by a mechanism that is dependent on its interactions with MoSsb1 and MoSsz1. MoYvh1 triggers the release of MoMrt4 from the ribosome in the nucleus that contributes to ribosome maturation. Importantly, we have provided evidence to demonstrate that MoYvh1 is important for the synthesis of extracellular proteins that are involved in ROS scavenging. Our findings provide insight into the mechanism by which <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> responds to host immunity through MoYvh1 that regulates ribosome function to evade the host defense response.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> is the causal agent of rice blast and also an established model organism to study plant-pathogen interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref002">2</xref>]. In a previous study, we have characterized MoYvh1 as a homolog of the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> protein phosphatase Yvh1 that regulates growth, sporulation, and glycogen accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref003">3</xref>]. We found that MoYvh1 not only plays a similar important role in vegetative growth and conidia formation but also regulates virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref004">4</xref>]. In addition, we found that deletion of <italic>MoYVH1</italic> results in an increased accumulation of the host-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref004">4</xref>]. ROS levels are known to govern the pathogen and host interaction, how MoYvh1 regulated growth and virulence is linked to its role in affecting ROS levels remains an interesting but unresolved research subject.</p>
<p><italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> Yvh1 is known to also have a role in ribosome maturation and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref005">5</xref>]. In eukaryotic cells, mature ribosomes are composed of five different proteins that include Rpp0 and two copies of each of proteins P1 and P2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref008">8</xref>]. Rpp0 interacts directly with the 60S ribosome subunit to form the base of the stalk for binding to P1 and P2 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref010">10</xref>]. Also in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, the ribosome assembly factor and the nucleolar protein Mrt4 are closely related to Rpp0, based on the conserved N-terminal ribosome binding domain they shared with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Eukaryotic cells respond to environmental stresses, including elevated temperatures, via a family of well-characterized heat-shock proteins (Hsp) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref013">13</xref>]. As ubiquitous molecular chaperones that function in a wide variety of cellular processes, Hsp70s act by reversibly binding and releasing the short hydrophobic stretches of amino acids in a nucleotide-dependent fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref015">15</xref>]. Hsp70 heat shock proteins are known to affect ribosomal function and protein biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref016">16</xref>]. For example, the ribosomal L31 protein binds to chaperone Zuo1 that in turn anchors Hsp70 Ssz1 and Hsc70 proteins to regulate polypeptide translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Given the multifaceted role of MoYvh1 previously established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref004">4</xref>], further addressing of MoYvh1 functional mechanisms would promote our understanding of the rice blast mechanisms. We here showed that MoYvh1 is translocated to the nucleus under the oxidative stress condition and that MoYvh1 functions through interactions with Hsp70 protein homologs MoSsb1 and MoSsz1. In addition, we showed that MoYvh1 is required for proper translocation of the ribosomal maturation factor homolog MoMrt4, since the loss of MoYvh1 caused MoMrt4 mislocalization to the cytoplasm resulting in virulence defects.</p>

<p>We have identified MoYvh1 as a homolog sharing amino acid sequence conservation with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> Yvh1 that in turn shares homology with the dual-specificity phosphatase from vaccinia virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref022">22</xref>].

To address whether MoYvh1 exhibits a cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling ability, similar to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> Yvh1, we constructed the strains expressing MoYvh1-GFP, in which the expression of the C-terminal GFP fusion protein is under the control of the native <italic>MoYVH1</italic> promoter. Notably, MoYvh1 was present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in conidia, which is the expected default steady-state distribution pattern. Treated with 5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 2 hours (h), an enhanced nuclear localization was observed in conidia (68.42 ± 7.31%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In the aerial hyphae, however, no changes were seen under the same stress condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Plants generate a vast array of oxidative agent in response to pathogen invasion including superoxide radical and hydroxyl radical.

<title>Nuclear translocation of MoYvh1 under oxidative stress requires functions of MoSsb1 and MoSsz1</title>
<p>To understand MoYvh1 functions associated with its nuclear translocation, we identified MoSsb1 and MoSsz1 that are heat-shock 70 (Hsp70) protein homologs following screening a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library constructed with RNA pooled from various stages including conidia and infections (0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). We then validated these interactions by co-introducing the <italic>MoYVH1</italic>-FLAG and <italic>MoHSP70s</italic>-GFP fusion constructs into the protoplasts of the wild type strain Guy11. Total proteins were extracted from conidia of the putative transformants, and MoYvh1, MoSsa1, MoSsb1, and MoSsz1 were detected using the anti-FLAG and anti-GFP antibodies. In proteins eluted from MoSsb1 and MoSsz1 anti-GFP beads, MoYvh1 was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).

The <italic>MoYVH1-GFP</italic> fusion construct was introduced into Δ<italic>Mossb1</italic>, Δ<italic>Mossz1</italic>, and Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutants. In the resulting transformants, GFP signal was observed in both the cytosol and the nucleus.

To further evaluate the nuclear translocation of MoYvh1 in these strains, we separated nuclear proteins from cytoplasmic ones and performed Western blotting analysis.

<title>MoYvh1 competes with MoMrt4 onto the ribosome for its function</title>
<p>MoMrt4 is normally accumulated in the nucleus of the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). To study how MoMrt4<sup>G69D</sup> and MoMrt4<sup>G69E</sup> suppress the defects of the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant, we assessed the effect of MoYvh1 on the subcellular localization of MoMrt4. As expected, MoMrt4<sup>G69D</sup> and MoMrt4<sup>G69E</sup> were predominantly nuclear localized, while MoMrt4 was mostly cytoplasmic, in the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). As MoMrt4<sup>G69D</sup> and MoMrt4<sup>G69E</sup> mutation showed similar roles in the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant, we used the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic>/<italic>MoMrt4</italic><sup><italic>G69E</italic></sup> strain to determine whether its affinity for the ribosome was compromised. We found that binding of MoMrt4<sup>G69E</sup> to the ribosome was more sensitive to 100 and 500 mM NaCl than MoMrt4 that was largely unaffected. 500 mM NaCl caused the majority of MoMrt4<sup>G69E</sup> to be dissociated from the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Therefore, MoMrt4<sup>G69E</sup> showed weaker affinity for ribosomes than MoMrt4, implying easier separation from the ribosome. We further speculated that the affinity for ribosomes between MoYvh1 and MoMrt4 is important for the normal function of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>. To test this hypothesis, we assessed whether MoMrt4 competes with MoYvh1 in ribosome binding. Western blotting analysis showed that MoYvh1 bound to the ribosome in both the wild-type and the Δ<italic>Momrt4</italic> mutant. However, the MoMrt4 recruitment to ribosomes in the presence of MoYvh1 was significantly reduced in the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), suggesting that MoYvh1 and MoMrt4 indeed compete for binding to the ribosome.</p>

<title>MoYvh1 is nuclear translocated in response to ROS</title>

<title>MoYvh1 plays a role in the biosynthesis of extracellular proteins that suppress host defense responses</title>
<p>At the early stages of infection, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> secretes numerous effector proteins to suppress plant defense responses and modulate host cellular processes that promote infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref026">26</xref>]. Since MoYvh1 has a role in ribosome maturity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g005">Fig 5D</xref>) and the ribosome is important for the synthesis of proteins, we tested whether the production of extracellular proteins was compromised in the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant. The extracellular fluid (EF) was prepared as described by Patkar and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref027">27</xref>]. Conidia from Guy11 and the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> strains were inoculated on a hydrophobic glass sheet and EF was harvested following 24 h incubation. We first detected the localization of MoYvh1 under this condition and the results showed that MoYvh1 was present in both nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating MoYvh1 functions in the nucleus during the appressorium formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007016.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). EF extracts from wild type were subsequently added to the rice leaf sheaths following infection by the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant. We found that native EF, but not that denatured by boiling, rescued the defects in host cell invasion and ROS scavenging at the infected sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). Our previous study showed that deletion of <italic>MoYVH1</italic> resulted in reduced peroxidase and laccase activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref004">4</xref>], so we further assayed the peroxidase and laccase activities in both EF harvested from the wild type and Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant strains. The enzyme activity assay was performed as described by Chi and associates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref028">28</xref>] by using the EF from both Guy11 and Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant. We observed very low levels of laccase and peroxidase activities in the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant when compared with Guy11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). We further performed the spray and drop assays on rice leaves. Conidia of the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant were collected with 5 ml of the EF or boiled EF of Guy11. The conidial suspensions of each treatment were sprayed onto rice leaves. After inoculation for 7 days, the results showed that the EF of Guy11 could suppress the defects of the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant in pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g007">Fig 7D and 7E</xref>). The conidial suspensions of each treatment were also drop inoculated onto detached rice leaves and the results revealed that the EF of the wild type strain partially rescues the defect in pathogenicity on the detached rice leaves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007016.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). These results indicated that the EF of Guy11 contains candidate proteins that are important for infection.</p>

<p>To identify candidate proteins in EF regulated by MoYvh1, we compared the EF production through SDS-PAGE analysis and found that the amount of EF proteins in Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> EF was significantly less than that of wild type Guy11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). In addition, mass spectrometry (MS) analysis revealed the presence of over 70 proteins with signal peptides in EF of the wild type strain but not of the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant. To address whether the absence of these proteins is caused by the defect in ribosomal biogenesis, we randomly chosen 30 of them to evaluate the transcriptional difference between Guy11 and the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant in the conidia after 24 h incubation on a hydrophobic glass sheet. Among these genes, only three were significantly reduced in transcription (p &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007016.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). In 70 identified proteins, 13 were associated with oxidoreducation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g007">Fig 7G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007016.s013">S2 Table</xref>). Thus, the defect in scavenging host-derived ROS of the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant was associated with the defect in the production of extracellular proteins.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Virulence in the rice blast fungus <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> is a multifaceted trait contributed by not only the complex circuitry in the pathogen side but also that of the host. In dissecting molecular events leading to virulence, we have previously characterized the dual specificity phosphatase MoYvh1 that shares sequence conservation and functional mechanisms to certain degree with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> Yvh1. Importantly, we found that MoYvh1 plays a role in not only growth, conidia formation, but also virulence in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref004">4</xref>]. Here, we provided mechanistic evidence to show that MoYvh1 undergoes cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation in response to oxidative stress and that MoYvh1 affects ribosome maturation. Our findings reveal a novel link between ribosome biogenesis and fungal virulence that is mediated by MoYvh1.</p>
<p>In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, Yvh1 is a shuttling protein that could remain in the nucleus if fused with a nuclear localization sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref029">29</xref>]. Previous studies also found that Yvh1 binds with the pre-60S ribosome subunit to export it to the cytoplasm. Once arrives there, Yvh1 is released from the pre-ribosome following mature ribosomal protein P0 binding to the ribosomal stalk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref031">31</xref>]. How Yvh1 is translocated into the nucleus remains unclear. Through studies of MoYvh1 here, we provided evidence that MoYvh1 exhibits similar nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling ability and that it functions through interactions with MoSsb1 and MoSsz1.</p>
<p>An unexpected finding is that the interaction between MoYvh1 and MoSsb1 and MoSsz1 differs from aerial hyphae to conidia and the infection stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007016.s002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007016.s011">S11</xref> Figs). Similar differentiated interactions were seen before. A BiFC assay showed that Pth11 and Rgs1 interacted <italic>in vivo</italic> during early pathogenesis but not during vegetative growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref032">32</xref>]. The interaction between MoCap1 and MoMac1 was weak during vegetative growth but was enhanced during appressorium formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref033">33</xref>]. In addition, Liu and colleagues showed that MoAtg4 interacts with MoAtg8 only under the nitrogen starvation condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref034">34</xref>]. In view of these findings, we hypothesized that 1) the interaction occurs only under oxidative stress, and 2) MoYvh1 and Hsp70s interactions are developmental stage specific. In agreement with these hypotheses, the YFP fluorescence signal was transferred to the nucleus only following treatment with 5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that MoSsb1 and MoSsz1 recruitments to MoYvh1 to facilitate its nuclear translocation upon oxidative stress during specific growth stages in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic>. Further evidence showed that MoYvh1 is not accumulated in the nucleus when MoSsb1 and MoSsz1 are not interacted with MoYvh1 during the aerial hyphae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007016.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). And also, deletion of <italic>MoSSB1</italic> or <italic>MoSSZ1</italic> which interdicted the interaction caused cytoplasmic-MoYvh1 not translocated into the nucleus even in the conidia and infection stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007016.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007016.s007">S7</xref> Figs). These results further confirmed that the accumulation of MoYvh1 in the nucleus under oxidative stress is dependent on the interaction between MoSsb1 and MoSsz1. Upon the exposure to oxidative stress, MoYvh1 nuclear translocation is accelerated by its interaction with MoSsb1 or MoSsz1 during the conidial and infection stages. Since MoYvh1 still could be detected in the nucleus in the Δ<italic>Mossb1</italic> and Δ<italic>Mossz1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007016.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), we postulated that additional translocation facilitators of MoYvh1 that are independent of oxidation stress may also exist.</p>
<p>We found that MoYvh1 and MoMrt4 bind with ribosomes in a competitive manner. To further examine the relationship between MoYvh1 and MoMrt4, we characterized the function of MoMrt4 by generating a Δ<italic>Momrt4</italic> mutant, which is significantly attenuated in growth, conidia production, and pathogenicity. However, the lesions produced by the Δ<italic>Momrt4</italic> mutant on rice leaves were fewer and smaller than those of the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant. A DAB assay suggested that deletion of <italic>MoMRT4</italic> did not affect the scavenging of ROS accumulated around the infection sites. Our analysis further suggested that MoYvh1 binds to pre-ribosomes and thereby helps to release MoMrt4. Thus, ribosome immaturity resulted in pathogenicity defects in the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant but not the Δ<italic>Momrt4</italic> mutant. The ribosome extract assay confirmed that cells continue to synthesize ribosomes in the absence of MoMrt4. This finding is consistent with studies in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> in which the deletion of <italic>MRT4</italic> causes defects in growth but no blocking in ribosome synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> secretes a wide array of factors into the host to facilitate invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref037">37</xref>]. However, host plants have evolved to recognize these effectors and counteract by activating defense responses to limit pathogen spreading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref041">41</xref>]. Small-molecule phytohormones, such as jasmonates, salicylic acid and brassinosteroids, play key roles in regulating this defense response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref044">44</xref>]. Our recent findings showed that the scavenging of host-derived ROS at the infection site is important for virulence of the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant, as deletion of <italic>MoYVH1</italic> causes virulence defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref004">4</xref>]. Consistent with the findings, the EF of the wild-type scavenges ROS accumulated around the sites of infection, in contrast to the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant, where the restricted invasion is the result of ROS accumulation due to lack of extracellular proteins in EF. When treated with ROS, MoYvh1 in the cytoplasm is translocated into the nucleus causing an enhanced nuclear localization in both the conidia and invasion hyphae (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g007">7C and 7D</xref>). In the mycelium, however, the cytoplasmic location pattern of MoYvh1 remained unchanged. These results suggested that the differential localization patterns of MoYvh1 might be developmentally regulated and it may be relevant to virulence. Since H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress blocks the formation of appressorium, the glass surface was not subjected to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stress allowing conidia to germinate, and under this condition MoYvh1 was present in both nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007016.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Here, we found that the EF of non-induced Guy11 rescued the defects in invasion and ROS scavenging around the infected sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>), suggesting that original MoYvh1 in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007016.s008">S8 Fig</xref>) without treatment regulated the ribosome maturation that provides abundant extracellular proteins to inhibit host-derived ROS. Under ROS stress, MoYvh1 in the cytoplasm translocates into the nucleus and accelerates ribosome synthesis to produce more extracellular proteins, which inhibits host-derived defense and promote infection.</p>
<p>Why does the wild-type EF suppress the defects of the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant and does the EF contain necessary ribosome or other proteins? In <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, Rpp0 is loaded onto the 60S ribosome subunit to assemble the mature stalk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref024">24</xref>]. In this study, deletion of <italic>MoYVH1</italic> led to the separation of MoRpp0 from the ribosome, suggesting a ribosomal maturation defect in the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant which would impair the production of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). During the early stages of infection, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> secretes various extracellular proteins to suppress plant immunity for promoting colonization. Blockage of secreted <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)" xlink:type="simple">protein synthesis</ext-link> due to immature ribosome in the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant likely results in the defect in virulence. Indeed, we showed that EF from the wild type strain restored pathogenicity of the Δ<italic>Moyvh1</italic> mutant when added to the conidia suspension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g007">Fig 7A and 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007016.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). These findings indicated that MoYvh1 has a role in the production of EFs that inhibit rice immunity.</p>
<p>We therefore present a model for how MoYvh1 functions in growth, virulence, and host immune avoidance in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007016.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that during <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> infection, rice produces an ROS burst to suppress pathogen invasion. Under this stress, MoSsb1 and MoSsz1, together with MoYvh1, are translocated to the nucleus, where MoYvh1 has a role in ribosome maturation through the release of MoMrt4 from the pre-ribosome. Mature ribosomes promote EF synthesis and secretion to scavenge ROS and modulate the rice defense response. Our model reveals an important pathway by which <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> recruits a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling phosphatase, MoYvh1, in response to host immune response. Further studies of MoYvh1-mediated response and the identification of EFs regulated by MoYvh1 would promote the understanding of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>oryzae</italic> pathogenesis mechanisms.</p>

Appressorium induction and formation rates were obtained also as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref051">51</xref>].</p>
<p>For infection, conidia were harvested from 10-day-old SDC agar cultures, filtered, and resuspended to a concentration of 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> spores /ml in a 0.2% (w/v) gelatin solution. For the leaf assay, leaves from two-week-old seedlings of rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic> cv. CO39) and 7-day-old seedlings of barley were used for spray inoculation. For rice leaves, 5 ml of a conidial suspension of each treatment was sprayed. Inoculated plants were kept in a growth chamber at 25°C with 90% humidity and in the dark for the first 24 h, followed by a 12 h /12 h light /dark cycle. Lesion formation was observed daily and recorded by photography 7 days after inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007016.ref053">53</xref>].</p>

<title>HPLC analysis</title>
<p>Mycelia were harvested and ground into powder in liquid nitrogen. 1 mg mycelium was mixed with 20 μl 6% TCA solution, centrifuged (1700 g, 15 min), and top layers were collected. After washing twice with five volumes of anhydrous ether, pellets were collected and subjected to HPLC analysis using a programmable Agilent Technology zorbax 1200 series liquid chromatography. The solvent system consisted of methanol (90%): water (10%), at a flow rate of 1 ml /min. 0.1 mg/ml cAMP solution was eluted through the column (SB-C<sub>18</sub>, 5 μl, 4.6 × 250 mm) and detected at 259 nm UV. Samples were loaded through the column in turns.</p>

<title>Separation of nuclear proteins and cytoplasm proteins during infection stage</title>
<p>Conidia of indicated strains were harvested from 10-day-old SDC agar cultures, filtered, and resuspended to a concentration of 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> spores /ml in a 0.2% (w/v) gelatin solution. 4 ml of the suspension was sprayed onto rice leaves and harvested 24 hpi. 5 g of Leaves were ground into powder in liquid nitrogen. The powder was transferred to a 50 ml tube and mixed with 20 ml M1 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 8.0),10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM PMSF, 1 M NaCl, 0.07% β-mercaptoethanol and 0.4 M Sucrose) using a chilled spoon. After agitated the tube in ice box for 10 min. The suspensions were filtered through Miracloth (Calbiochem) into a 50 ml tube and the supernatants containing cytoplasmic proteins were collected following centrifugation at 1000 x g for 20 min at 4°C. Remove the supernatant for the cytoplasm protein. Five ml of M2 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 8.0), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM PMSF, 1 M NaCl, 0.07% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 M Sucrose and 1% TritonX-100) was added to the pellet portion, re-suspended, and tubes re-centrifuged at 12000 x g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and the step was repeated 3 times. Finally, 300 μl Nuclei Lysis Buffer (P0013B, Beyotime Biotech) was added to the pellet and the suspension (nuclear proteins) was recovered.</p>

<title>Extraction and identification of extracellular fluid proteins</title>
<p>After 7 days cultivation, conidia were collected and suspended in 100 ml of distilled water in a concentration of 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> spores /ml. 50 ml of the conidia were centrifuged at 3600 g for 10 min to extract the protein for equalization of protein amounts. The rest of 50 ml of conidia were divided into 200 μl (1 x 10<sup>5</sup> spores/ml) and placed onto the hydrophobic glass sheet at 28°C for 24 h. Suspensions harvested from the hydrophobic glass sheet were centrifuged at 3600 g for 10 min and the supernatants were recovered. For HLPC-MS/MS analysis, a 100 μg protein suspension was harvested. The suspension was mixed with 2.5 μg trypsin for digestion at 37°C for 4 h. 2.5 μg trypsin was added again and incubated for another 8 h. The peptides were then dechlorinated by Strata X and separated by a 65 min gradient elution at a flow rate 300 nl/min with the LC-20AD nano-HPLC system (Shimadzu, Japan), which was directly interfaced with Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Mobile phase A consists of 0.1% formic acid and 2% acetonitrile, and mobile phase B consists of 0.1% formic acid and 98% acetonitrile. The mass spectrometer was operated in the DDA (data-dependent acquisition) mode and there was a single full-scan mass spectrum in the Orbitrap (350–1600 m/z, 70,000 resolution).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Results were presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of at least three repeats. The significant differences between samples were statistically evaluated by using SDs and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS 2.0. The data between two different treatments were then compared statistically by ANOVA, followed by the F-test, if the ANOVA result is significant at <italic>P</italic>&lt; 0.01.</p>
