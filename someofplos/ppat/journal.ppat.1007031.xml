<abstract>
<p>Parasite egress from infected erythrocytes and invasion of new red blood cells are essential processes for the exponential asexual replication of the malaria parasite. These two tightly coordinated events take place in less than a minute and are in part regulated and mediated by proteases. Dipeptidyl aminopeptidases (DPAPs) are papain-fold cysteine proteases that cleave dipeptides from the N-terminus of protein substrates. DPAP3 was previously suggested to play an essential role in parasite egress. However, little is known about its enzymatic activity, intracellular localization, or biological function. In this study, we recombinantly expressed DPAP3 and demonstrate that it has indeed dipeptidyl aminopeptidase activity, but contrary to previously studied DPAPs, removal of its internal prodomain is not required for activation. By combining super resolution microscopy, time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, and immunoelectron microscopy, we show that <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> DPAP3 localizes to apical organelles that are closely associated with the neck of the rhoptries, and from which DPAP3 is secreted immediately before parasite egress. Using a conditional knockout approach coupled to complementation studies with wild type or mutant DPAP3, we show that DPAP3 activity is important for parasite proliferation and critical for efficient red blood cell invasion. We also demonstrate that DPAP3 does not play a role in parasite egress, and that the block in egress phenotype previously reported for DPAP3 inhibitors is due to off target or toxicity effects. Finally, using a flow cytometry assay to differentiate intracellular parasites from extracellular parasites attached to the erythrocyte surface, we show that DPAP3 is involved in the initial attachment of parasites to the red blood cell surface. Overall, this study establishes the presence of a DPAP3-dependent invasion pathway in malaria parasites.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Malaria remains one of the most devastating infectious diseases and its clinical manifestation is caused by the exponential multiplication of parasites in patients. This asexual replication cycle consists of red blood cell invasion, intracellular parasite multiplication, and release (also known as egress) of daughter parasites for further red blood cell invasion. Host cell invasion is therefore essential for parasite replication and the only moment in this cycle when parasites are exposed to the immune system. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that control red blood cell invasion might not only lead to the identification of novel antimalarial targets but also to the development of better invasion blocking vaccines. DPAP3 is a druggable cysteine protease that was previously believed to be essential for parasite egress. In this study, we show that parasites lacking DPAP3 activity are unable to efficiently invade red blood cells but escape the confines of the host cell normally. Overall, this study increases our understanding of the proteolytic pathways that govern host cell invasion by the malaria parasite.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Malaria is a devastating infectious disease caused by Apicomplexan parasites of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> genus and is transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes during a blood meal. After an initial asymptomatic liver infection, parasites are released into the blood stream where they replicate within red blood cells (RBCs). This asexual exponential growth is responsible for all the pathology associated with malaria, causing close to half a million deaths every year[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref001">1</xref>]. Over the last 15 years, the world has seen a significant decrease in malaria incidence mainly due to the distribution of insecticide-impregnated bed nets and the introduction of ACT (artemisinin-based combination therapy) as the standard of care for uncomplicated malaria[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref002">2</xref>]. However, the recent emergence of artemisinin resistance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref003">3</xref>] has made the identification of viable therapeutic targets extremely important[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> is the most virulent <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species accounting for most of malaria mortality. Its 48 h asexual erythrocytic cycle consists of RBC invasion, intraerythrocytic parasite growth and division into 16–32 daughter merozoites, followed by parasite egress for further RBC invasion. Parasite egress and RBC invasion are key for parasite replication and blocking either one of these processes would lead to a quick drop in parasitemia and malaria pathology. Proteases have been shown to play essential roles in both processes and might therefore be viable therapeutic targets[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>RBC invasion is a multistep process involving initial recognition of RBC receptors by adhesin proteins on the surface of the merozoite (invasive extracellular parasite form), tight attachment to the RBC membrane (RBCM), reorientation of the merozoite apical end towards the RBCM, active invasion driven by an actin-myosin motor with invagination of the RBCM and formation of the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), and finally, sealing of the RBCM and PV membrane (PVM)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref008">8</xref>]. The PV is a membrane-bound vacuole within which the parasite grows and replicates isolated from the RBC cytosol. Rupture of the PV and RBC membranes is required for parasite egress and is mediated by proteases. In particular, subtilisin-like protease 1 (SUB1), an essential serine protease residing in apical secretory organelles known as exonemes, is released into the PV right before egress where it processes several proteins important for egress and invasion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref013">13</xref>]. These include cleavage and likely activation of serine repeat antigen 6 (SERA6)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref014">14</xref>], an essential papain-fold cysteine protease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>In a forward chemical genetic approach, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 3 (DPAP3) was identified as a potential regulator of parasite egress acting upstream of SUB1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref018">18</xref>]. DPAPs are papain-like cysteine proteases that cleave dipeptides off the N-terminus of protein substrates[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref019">19</xref>]. In that study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref018">18</xref>], the vinyl sulfone inhibitor SAK1 was shown to preferentially inhibit DPAP3 over other cysteine proteases. This compound arrests parasite egress at mid-micromolar concentrations, blocks processing of SUB1 substrates, and prevents proper expression and maturation of SUB1 and apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1), a micronemal protein secreted onto the merozoite surface that is essential for RBC invasion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref021">21</xref>]. These results led to the hypothesis that DPAP3 might act as a general maturase of secretory proteins involved in egress and invasion. However, while the function (or essentiality) of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> DPAP3 has not been validated genetically, in the rodent parasite <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic>, DPAP3 knock out (KO) parasites are viable but replicate significantly slower[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we combine chemical, biochemical and conditional genetic approaches to show that DPAP3 is an active protease that resides in apical secretory organelles, and that its activity is critical for efficient RBC invasion. We also provide very strong evidence showing that DPAP3 does not play a significant function in parasite egress.</p>

<title>DPAP3 activity is important for parasite viability</title>
<p>Using single homologous recombination we were able to replace the endogenous catalytic domain of <italic>dpap3</italic> with a C-terminally tagged (GFP, mCherry or HA) version. However, our multiple attempts to replace the DPAP3 catalytic Cys with a Ser failed despite using the same homology region upstream of the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s005">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). Our attempts to KO <italic>dpap3</italic> by double homologous recombination also failed. These results strongly suggest that DPAP3 activity is important for parasite development. Parasites containing differently tagged <italic>dpap3</italic> were cloned by limited dilution, and the clones selected for this study will be referred to as DPAP3-GFP, DPAP3-mCh, and DPAP3-HA. Analysis of parasite extracts by western blot (WB) using a polyclonal antibody that targets the C-terminal half of DPAP3 showed a shift in migration pattern in accordance with the tag molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>PfDPAP3 localizes to an apical secretory organelle</title>
<p>In all our tagged lines, DPAP3 consistently localizes to the apical pole of merozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). To determine when it is expressed, tightly synchronized DPAP3-HA and DPAP3-mCh parasites were collected every 3 h throughout the erythrocytic cycle and were either lysed and analyzed by WB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), or fixed for immunofluorescence analysis (IFA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g001">Fig 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s005">S1C Fig</xref>). Consistent with its transcription profile[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref025">25</xref>], DPAP3 is most abundant in late schizonts and merozoites, but could also be detected in rings and trophozoites by WB. To confirm that the small amount of DPAP3 observed by WB at ring stage is not due to schizonts contamination in our cultures, we analyzed 50 fields of five Giemsa-stained thin blood smears at 1 hour post invasion (h.p.i.), i.e. around 75,000 RBCs. We did not observe any schizonts in these slides, only ring stage parasites at around 5% parasitemia. Also, WB analysis using an MSP1 (merozoite surface protein 1) antibody as a marker of schizogony showed no significant staining at ring or trophozoite stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s005">S1D Fig</xref>). Although we could detect multiple processed forms of DPAP3 by WB, these processed forms are rarely observed in live parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) and are likely an artefact of parasite lysis (see below).</p>
<p>By IFA, DPAP3 was first detected in young schizonts (6–8 nuclei) and seems to be expressed at the same time as rhoptry (rhoptry neck protein 4, RON4, and high molecular weight rhoptry protein 2, RopH2) and inner membrane complex (glideosome-associated protein 45, GAP45) proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g001">Fig 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s005">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s006">S2</xref> Figs). During schizont maturation, DPAP3 and rhoptry proteins localization changes from a diffuse and granular cytosolic staining to a clear punctuated apical staining in daughter merozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s005">S1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s006">S2</xref> Figs), probably reflecting protein trafficking and organelle biogenesis. By contrast, exonemal (SUB1) and micronemal proteins (AMA1) are expressed and localize to their apical organelles at a later stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g001">Fig 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s006">S2 Fig</xref>). Note that the diffuse staining observed at 39 h.p.i. for DPAP3, RON4 and RopH2 is not background fluorescence signal given that no staining was observed in these same slides for the few parasites that were lagging behind in development, i.e. infected RBCs (iRBCs) with a single nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s006">S2A Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Using standard confocal microscopy, we could not observe consistent colocalization of DPAP3 with any apical organelle marker tested: AMA1 and EBA175 (erythrocyte binding antigen 175) for micronemes, SUB1 for exonemes, RON4 and RopH2 for rhoptries, and Exp2 (exported protein 2) for dense granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g001">Fig 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s006">S2B Fig</xref>). We therefore decided to increase the resolution of our images by using structured illumination microscopy (SIM). By SIM we could clearly observe DPAP3 staining in small but well-defined dot-like structures at the apical pole of each merozoite in the DPAP3-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g001">Fig 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s007">S3A Fig</xref>) and DPAP3-GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s007">S3B Fig</xref>) lines. Although we did not observe colocalization with exoneme (SUB1), microneme (EBA175) or rhoptry (RON4, RopH2) protein markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g001">Fig 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s007">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>), DPAP3 seems to be closely associated with RON4, suggesting that it resides in apical organelles that surround the neck of the rhoptries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g001">Fig 1H</xref>).</p>

<title>PfDPAP3 is secreted after PVM breakdown</title>
<p>Timely discharge of proteins from the different apical organelles is crucial to regulate parasite egress and RBC invasion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref026">26</xref>]. Secretion of exonemal and micronemal proteins is mediated through activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG), which takes places 15–20 min before egress[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref009">9</xref>]. Release of SUB1 into the PV leads to parasite egress. Secretion of micronemal proteins, such as AMA1 or EBA175, onto the parasite surface is essential for merozoite attachment to the RBCM and invasion. To determine whether DPAP3 is secreted, we used the DPAP3-HA line to compare the level of DPAP3 present within parasites, in the PV and RBC cytosol, and in the culture supernatant at three different stages of egress: schizonts arrested before exoneme/microneme secretion with the PKG reversible inhibitor compound 2 (C2), schizonts arrested between PVM and RBCM breakdown using the general cysteine protease inhibitor E64, and free merozoites collected after egress. In E64-arrested schizonts, the erythrocyte is still intact but the RBCM is highly porated allowing leakage of RBC and PV proteins into the culture supernatant[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref027">27</xref>]. Parasite pellets, PV and RBC cytosol proteins, and proteins secreted in the culture supernatant under these three conditions were collected after treating the cultures with the fluorescent activity-based probe FY01[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref028">28</xref>]. FY01 is a cell-permeable probe that covalently modifies the catalytic Cys of cysteine proteases including DPAP3[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref018">18</xref>]. Fluorescently labelled DPAP3-HA can then be visualized by in-gel fluorescence in a SDS-PAGE gel as a band running around 130 kDa that matches the WB band observed with a HA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s008">S4A Fig</xref>). DPAP3 was mainly detected in the culture supernatant and saponin soluble fraction of E64-arrested or rupturing schizonts, but not in C2-arrested schizonts, indicating that it is secreted downstream of PKG activation but before merozoites become extracellular. The presence of DPAP3 in E64-arrested schizont pellets and free merozoites suggests only partial secretion before egress. To confirm proper fractionation of our samples, we used SERA5, BiP (binding immunoglobin protein) and Hsp70 (heat shock protein 70) as PV, ER, and cytosol protein markers, respectively, in WB analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Processing of SERA5 was also used to confirm that C2 or E64 treatments arrested parasite development at the expected stage. Upon exoneme secretion, SUB1 sequentially cleaves SERA5 into a 73 and 56 kDa forms. This processing is blocked by C2 since exoneme secretion is regulated by PKG. SERA5 is further processed into a 50 kDa form by an unknown cysteine protease that is inhibited by E64. Two additional biological replicates showing secretion of DPAP3 are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s008">S4B and S4C Fig</xref>.</p>

<title>DPAP3 is secreted at the time of egress.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) C2-arrested schizonts (DPAP3-HA) were either left on C2, treated with E64 after C2 wash out, or allowed to egress for 1 h in the presence of FY01. Parasite pellets from free merozoites and schizonts (insoluble fraction obtained after saponin lysis), proteins precipitated from the culture supernatant, and PV and RBC cytosol components (soluble saponin fraction), were run on a SDS-PAGE. The presence of DPAP3-HA in each fraction was visualized as a fluorescent band at around 130kDa, which correspond to the band identified by WB using an anti-HA antibody (See also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s008">S4A Fig</xref>). Hsp70 and BiP antibodies were used as WB markers of intracellular proteins (cytosol and ER, respectively), and SERA5 as a PV marker. (<bold>B</bold>) Mature DPAP3-mCh schizonts were arrested with C2 for 3 h, and egress observed by live video microscopy after C2 wash out (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s016">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s018">S3</xref> Videos).

<p>To determine the timing of DPAP3 secretion, DPAP3-mCh schizonts were arrested with C2 and parasite egress monitored by live microscopy after C2 wash out. Using this assay, PVM breakdown is clearly observable on the DIC channel when merozoites become more spread out within the RBC and their shape is better defined[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref027">27</xref>]. This is followed by RBCM rupture and merozoites dispersal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s016">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s018">S3</xref> Videos). Quantification of fluorescence signal in these egress videos shows a 40% decrease in mCherry signal right after PVM breakdown but before RBCM rupture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Interestingly, conditional KO (cKO) of SUB1 has recently been shown to prevent breakdown of the PVM but not AMA1 secretion, suggesting that microneme secretion takes place before PVM breakdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref017">17</xref>]. This implies that DPAP3 secretion probably takes place downstream of microneme secretion and coincides with PVM breakdown.</p>
<p>To confirm that DPAP3 is secreted into the RBC cytosol after PVM breakdown, we performed immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) on DPAP3-GFP schizonts collected at the time of egress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s007">S3D and S3E Fig</xref>). In schizonts containing an intact PVM, DPAP3-GFP staining was observed at the apical end of merozoites, and in some sections, in close proximity to the rhoptries or enclosed within membrane bound vesicles, thus supporting our IFA results. In IEM images collected on schizonts after PVM breakdown, immunostaining was mainly observed in the RBC cytosol. Almost no DPAP3 staining was detected in the PV of schizonts with an intact PVM.</p>

<title>Full-length DPAP3 has proteolytic activity</title>
<p>DPAPs are generally processed from a zymogen form (full-length protein after removal of the signal peptide) into an active form through removal of an internal prodomain and cleavage of the catalytic domain into two polypeptides[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref030">30</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s009">S5A Fig</xref>). Three different isoforms of DPAP3 (p120, p95, and p42) consistent with the canonical processing of DPAPs were previously shown to be labelled by FY01 in merozoite lysates[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref018">18</xref>]. However, we have now shown that this processing is an artefact of parasite lysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s009">S5B–S5D Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s001">S1 Text</xref>). In addition, our WB and FY01-labelling experiments show that full length DPAP3 (p120) is the predominant form found in live parasites (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s009">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether this full-length p120 form is active, we recombinantly expressed wild type (WT) and mutant (MUT, replacement of the catalytic Cys504 to Ser) DPAP3 in insect cells using the baculovirus system[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref031">31</xref>]. Expression and purification of recombinant DPAP3 (rDPAP3) from insect cells culture supernatant yielded predominantly the p120 and p95 forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s009">S5B Fig</xref>). While WT DPAP3 is able to efficiently cleave the VR-ACC fluorogenic DPAP substrate[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref032">32</xref>], no activity was observed with MUT DPAP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). We also show that rDPAP3 is active under mild acidic conditions with an optimal pH of 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Importantly, in one of our purifications we were able to separate the p120 form from a fraction containing a mixture of the p95 and p120 forms. We used these fractions to show that the p120 form is fully active (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s009">S5E Fig</xref>). This result strongly suggests that the predominant DPAP3 form present in live parasites (p120) is the one performing a biological function.</p>

<title>Generation of DPAP3 cKO and complementation lines</title>
<p>Since we were unable to directly KO DPAP3, we generated DPAP3 cKO lines on the 1G5 parasite line background that endogenously expressed DiCre[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref033">33</xref>]. In the DiCre system, Cre recombinase is split into two domains fused to rapamycin (RAP) binding domains.

We used this system to conditionally truncate the catalytic domain of DPAP3 rather than excising the full gene to prevent potential episomal expression of DPAP3 after excision.</p>
<p>Two independent strategies, which differ in how the first <italic>loxP</italic> site was introduced within the <italic>dpap3</italic> open reading frame (ORF), were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s010">S6A Fig</xref>).

Schizonts collected after DMSO or RAP treatment were stained with anti-mCherry and anti-SUB1 antibodies. SUB1 staining was used as a marker of schizont maturity. The amount of mCherry positive schizonts was quantified in relation to the total amount of mature schizonts. In DMSO treated parasites, all mature schizonts were mCherry positive (100%). The amount of non-excised parasites after RAP treatment was &lt;5% in all biological replicates for all the cKO and complementation lines tested. Each circle corresponds to a different biological replicate (&gt;100 schizonts were analyzed per biological isolate). Filled circles correspond to F8cKO and its complementation lines, and empty ones to the A1cKO line.

Mature schizonts from the F8cKO+WT<sub>dpap3</sub>, F8cKO+MUT<sub>dpap3</sub>, F8cKO+WT<sub>ama1</sub>, and F8cKO+MUT<sub>ama1</sub> were fixed and stained with anti-HA (red) and anti-mCherry (green).

Only 60–80% of mature schizonts show positive HA staining with no difference between DMSO and RAP treated parasites. More than 100 schizonts per biological replicate were analyzed. (<bold>D</bold>) FY01 labelling of cKO and complementation lines. After DMSO or RAP treatment at ring stage, C2-arrested schizonts were collected, lysed, and labelled with FY01. Labelling of chromosomal DPAP3-mCh is clearly visible as a band around 150kDa along with some post-lysis degradation products indicated by asterisks. The loss of this 150kDa upon RAP treatment is observed in all lines except the E7ctr. Episomal WT DPAP3-HA is labelled by FY01 independently of RAP treatment and co-migrates with one of the degradation products of DPAP3-mCh at 125kDa. No labelling of MUT DPAP3-HA was observed. DPAP1 labelling by FY01 is shown as a loading control.</p>

<p>To confirm that any phenotypic effect observed upon conditional truncation of DPAP3 is due to the loss of DPAP3 activity, A1cKO and F8cKO parasites were transfected with plasmid expressing WT or MUT DPAP3-HA under the control of the <italic>dpap3</italic> or <italic>ama1</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s010">S6A Fig</xref>), resulting in the following complementation lines: F8cKO+WT<sub>dpap3</sub>, F8cKO+MUT<sub>dpap3</sub>, F8cKO+WT<sub>ama1</sub>, F8cKO+MUT<sub>ama1</sub>, A1cKO+WT<sub>dpap3</sub>, A1cKO+WT<sub>ama1</sub>, and A1cKO+MUT<sub>ama1</sub>. All complementation lines grew normally before RAP treatment and showed no apparent delay in parasite development.</p>
<p>IFA analysis confirmed colocalization between chromosomal DPAP3-mCh and episomal DPAP3-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g005">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s010">S6C Fig</xref>). Episomal expression was only high enough to be detected by IFA in 60–80% of schizonts, but was independent of RAP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). This is probably due to different levels of episomal expression and plasmid segregation in schizonts. Efficient, but not complete, truncation of DPAP3-mCh was observed in all our complementation lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

<title>Conditional knock out of DPAP3 reduces viability of blood stage parasites</title>
<p>To measure the effect of DPAP3 truncation on parasite proliferation, we used the recently published plaque assay[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref016">16</xref>] where the wells of a 96-well flat bottom plate containing a thin layer of blood were seeded with ~10 iRBCs/well. After 10–14 days, microscopic plaques resulting from RBC lysis can be detected with an inverted microscope. RAP treatment of our cKO lines resulted in 90% less plaques, an effect that could be partially rescued through episomal complementation with WT but not MUT DPAP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s002">S1 Table</xref>).

<p>To test this hypothesis, we perform standard parasite multiplication assays after RAP or DMSO treatment. To prevent parasite overgrowth, cultures were diluted 10-fold in fresh blood and media whenever parasitemia reached 5%. RAP treatment of DPAP3cKO parasites results in a 10- to 15-fold decrease in parasitemia after 3–4 cycles, corresponding to an overall 50% decrease in multiplication rate per cycle compared to DMSO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). However, these values underestimated the importance of DPAP3 on parasite replication since 5 cycles after RAP treatment, 60% of iRBC are non-excised parasites expressing DPAP3-mCh (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s011">S7A Fig</xref>). This result proves that the small fraction of non-excised parasites quickly outcompetes the excised ones. After RAP treatment, parasites complemented with WT DPAP3 grew significantly faster than those complemented with MUT DPAP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Importantly, our multiple attempts to clone DPAP3KO parasites after RAP treatment failed, indicating that DPAP3 activity is required for parasite proliferation under our culturing conditions.</p>
<p>To determine which point of the erythrocytic cycle is disrupted by the loss of DPAP3, a tightly synchronized culture of A1cKO parasites at ring stage was treated with DMSO or RAP for 3 h, and the culture monitored for the following 80 h. Samples were collected every 2–4 h, fixed, stained with Hoechst, and analyzed by FACS. No significant difference in DNA staining was observed between WT and KO parasites, suggesting that DPAP3 is not required for intracellular development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g006">Fig 6E</xref>, left graph). Quantification of iRBCs belonging to the first or second cycle after treatment shows that DPAP3KO parasites egress at the same time as WT but produce <bold>~</bold>50% less rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g006">Fig 6E</xref>, right graph). This suggests that DPAP3 is only important for RBC invasion, which is in direct contradiction with its previously suggested role in egress[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref018">18</xref>].</p>

<p>Despite being expressed early during schizogony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), we did not observe any delay in parasite development between 36–48 h.p.i.

No significant difference was observed between DMSO and RAP treatment of cKO or complementation lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s011">S7B Fig</xref>). Importantly, proper localization of MSP1, SUB1, AMA1, EBA175, RON4, and RopH2 was observed in all RAP-treated cKO lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g004">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s011">S7C and S7D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Previously published work using the SAK1 inhibitor showed arrest of egress upstream of SUB1 activation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref018">18</xref>]. This result suggested that DPAP3 might be important for parasite egress. Although we have been able to reproduce these results, we show that SAK1 treatment of schizonts 6 h before egress arrests schizogony upstream of SUB1 and AMA1 expression rather than parasite egress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s012">S8 Fig</xref>). This explains why no SUB1 or AMA1 could be detected by WB in the previous study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref018">18</xref>]. In addition to SAK1, we also synthesized a more selective DPAP3 inhibitor by replacing the nitro-tyrosine N-terminal residue of SAK1 with <italic>L-</italic>Trp (<italic>L</italic>-WSAK) and its diastereomer negative control containing <italic>D-</italic>Trp (<italic>D-</italic>WSAK). To test the specificity of these inhibitors, merozoite or schizont lysates were pre-incubated with a dose response of compound followed by 1 h labelling with FY01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Although SAK1 blocks labelling of DPAP3 at lower concentration than <italic>L-</italic>WSAK, it also inhibits all the falcipains (FP1, FP2, and FP3) above 5 μM. <italic>L-</italic>WSAK only inhibits other targets above 200 μM. As expected, the <italic>D-</italic>WSAK control compound is unable to inhibit any of the labelled cysteine proteases and is at least 100-fold less potent than <italic>L-</italic>WSAK at inhibiting DPAP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). We then compared the effect of these inhibitors in parasite egress on the A1cKO line. Surprisingly, all compounds blocked egress independently of RAP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), and no difference in potency between <italic>L-</italic> and <italic>D-</italic>WSAK was observed.

Quantification of the different parasite stage populations over time clearly shows a decrease in the number of rings upon RAP treatment, with an inversely proportional increase in the number of free merozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g008">Fig 8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s013">S9A Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The RBC population showing similar levels of DNA signal as free merozoites is mainly composed of ring stage parasites but likely contains a small proportion of extracellular merozoites tightly attached to the surface of the erythrocyte. These two populations were differentiated by staining the samples with a monoclonal MSP1 antibody (m89.1), whose epitope is within the portion of MSP1 that is shed during invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Using this assay, we did not observe a significant difference in the number of attached merozoites relative to the number of rings between DMSO and RAP treatment of our cKO lines. This suggests that after DPAP3KO parasites tightly attach to the RBC surface they invade as efficiently as WT parasites. Therefore, DPAP3 is likely important for the initial recognition of and attachment to RBCs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study provides the first characterization of the biological function of DPAP3 in parasite development. We have shown that DPAP3 is important for efficient RBC invasion and parasite proliferation. DPAP3 is expressed early during schizogony, it localizes to small apical organelles that are closely associated with the neck of the rhoptries, and it is secreted at the time of PVM breakdown but before parasite egress. We have also demonstrated that DPAP3 has dipeptidyl aminopeptidase activity but contrary to other DPAPs, removal of the prodomain is not required for activation. Our cKO and complementation studies provide strong evidence that DPAP3 activity is only required for efficient RBC invasion, but not for intracellular parasite development or parasite egress. Importantly, we have proven that the block in egress phenotype previously reported using vinyl sulfone inhibitors is not due to DPAP3 inhibition but rather to off-target or toxicity defects. Two cysteine proteases have been shown to play an important role in egress: human calpain-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref039">39</xref>] and SERA6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref017">17</xref>]. It is therefore possible that the block in egress phenotype might be due to inhibition of either one of these two proteases. This study illustrates the importance of using negative control compounds when trying to associate a specific phenotype to the inhibition of a particular target, as well as the need to genetically validate functional information obtained through chemical methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref006">6</xref>]. Interestingly, in a recently published study, the Koning-Ward lab used the <italic>glmS</italic> riboswitch system to conditionally knockdown DPAP3 in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref040">40</xref>]. However, they did not observe any significant effect in parasite proliferation, nor in egress or RBC invasion. We think that this is likely due to the fact that they only achieved partial knockdown of DPAP3, and that the residual level of DPAP3 activity was sufficient to perform its function. That said, their localization studies are consistent with ours and confirm that DPAP3 resides in novel apical secretory organelles, and that it does not colocalize with rhoptry, microneme, or dense granule markers.</p>
<p>Our initial characterization of the invasion defect associated with the loss of DPAP3 suggests that this protease might play a role in the attachment of merozoites to the RBC surface. Indeed, in our invasion assays we observed a significant increase in the number of free merozoites upon cKO of DPAP3. Moreover, while DPAP3 KO results in a significant decrease in the number of rings, the ratio between merozoites attached to the RBC surface and those that have successfully invaded RBCs is the same between WT and KO parasites, suggesting that the decrease in invasion efficiency is likely upstream of merozoite attachment and tight junction formation, and that DPAP3 is likely important for the initial recognition of RBCs. We think it is unlikely that DPAP3KO parasites might be less efficient at forming a tight junction since we predict that such a defect would result in an increase of attached parasites relative to the total number of invaded RBCs. However, this is a possibility that we cannot completely rule out at this moment.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we observed a wide variation in the decrease of invasion efficiency upon cKO of DPAP3, ranging from 25 to 75% inhibition. This variation is much larger than the experimental variation observed with our E7 control line, and it is likely due to heterogeneity among the different batches of blood used to perform invasion assays. This observation suggests that DPAP3 activity might be important to recognize host cell receptors that are differentially expressed in the human population, and is consistent with our propose role of DPAP3 in RBC attachment.</p>
<p>The facts that DPAP3 is expressed early during schizogony, that it localizes in secretory apical organelles, and that it is active under mild acidic conditions (pH 5–7, maximum activity at pH 6), suggest that DPAP3 might process its substrates within the apical organelle where it resides. However, at this stage we cannot discard the possibility that DPAP3 might process its substrates at neutral pH, either during trafficking (in the ER or Golgi), extracellularly after secretion, or even during secretion of proteins from apical organelles. Micronemes are trafficked to the merozoite apex underneath the inner membrane complex before releasing their protein cargo, thus coming in very close proximity to the neck of the rhoptries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref042">42</xref>]. It is therefore possible that DPAP3 might interact with proteins of other secretory organelles as they are secreted, similarly to how micronemal CyRPA (cysteine rich protective antigen) and Ripr (Rh5 interacting protein) come together with rhoptry Rh5 (reticulocyte binding protein homologue 5) at the merozoite apex after egress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref043">43</xref>]. Finally, we think it is unlikely that DPAP3 acts extracellularly on RBC surface proteins because co-culturing equal amounts of WT and DPAP3KO parasites did not rescued the DPAP3KO invasion defect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s013">S9B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>It is difficult to speculate about the nature of DPAP3 substrates since we could not colocalize this protease with any of the tested apical markers. However, its substrates are likely to be proteins in the secretory pathway that are directly or indirectly important for invasion. Also, given that DPAPs cleave N-terminal dipeptides from protein substrates, DPAP3 likely recognizes the N-terminus of its substrates after they have been cleaved by another protease. Most proteins secreted into the PV or onto the merozoite surface are processed during traffic or after secretion, thus exposing one or multiple N-termini that might be potential DPAP3 substrates. For example, DPAP3 might trim the N-terminus of its substrates after signal peptide removal, thus potentially affecting their localization or stability. Indeed, the N-terminal sequence downstream of the signal peptide has been shown to be important for proper localization of rhoptry and micronemal proteins both in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref045">45</xref>] and <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref047">47</xref>]. Interestingly, two recent studies have shown that the aspartyl protease plasmepsin IX (PMIX) is essential for RBC invasion and that it acts as a maturase of rhoptry proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref049">49</xref>]. In both studies, PMIX was shown to localize at the apical end of merozoites either within or, similarly to DPAP3, in close proximity to the rhoptries. This similar localization raises the possibility that DPAP3 might trim the N-terminus of rhoptry proteins after being processed by PMIX. Finally, most surface proteins that are involved in RBC invasion (EBAs, Rhs, MSPs, AMA1, RON2, etc) expose one or more extracellular N-termini[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref050">50</xref>], and the N-terminal domains of some of these proteins have been shown to be important in mediating protein-protein interactions and biological function. Interestingly, in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> extracellular trimming of the N-terminus of surface proteins has been well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref052">52</xref>]. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> also expresses DPAPs in secretory organelles[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref053">53</xref>], and a recent proteomic study has shown evidence that the N-terminus of certain secreted proteins, such as TgSUB1 and TgMIC11, is trimmed through the removal of dipeptides[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref054">54</xref>]. It is therefore possible that DPAP3-mediated trimming of the N-terminus of certain parasite surface proteins might modulate their affinity towards host cell receptors.</p>
<p>Our biochemical studies have shown that DPAP3 is an unusual papain-fold protease since removal of its prodomain is not required for activation. Most proteases prodomains act as endogenous inhibitors and internal chaperones. Although the prodomain of DPAP3 might be required for proper folding of this large protein (941aa), we cannot discard the possibility that it might have other biochemical functions, such as recognizing substrates or binding to cofactors that modulate DPAP3 activity. Interestingly, the pro-form of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> DPAP1 has been shown to localize to the PV in mature schizonts[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref030">30</xref>], and processing of recombinant DPAP1 from its ‘zymogen’ form to is fully processed form only increases its activity 2–3 fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref032">32</xref>], suggesting that similarly to DPAP3, the ‘zymogen’ form of DPAP1 is active and might be able to process the N-terminus of PV or merozoite surface proteins. Therefore, both DPAP1 and DPAP3 are secreted before egress, raising the possibility that they might play redundant or complementary functions during RBC invasion.</p>

<title>Design of expression constructs</title>
<p>Three synthetic genes codon-optimized for insect cells were synthesized by Genewiz and cloned into the puc57 vector backbone: puc57-rDPAP3-Nt, puc57-rDPAP3-Ct-wt, and puc-rDPAP3-Ct-mut. The first one codes for the N-terminal portion of DPAP3 (Met1-Asp469) and the other two for the C-terminal portion (Lys455-Stop941) containing the catalytic domain of DPAP3 and harboring either the catalytic cysteine Cys504 or the C504S inactivating mutation. All synthetic sequences contained a C-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag and were flanked with the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites at the 5’ and 3’ end, respectively. A ClaI restriction site is present in the 45 bp overlapping sequence (Lys455-Asp469) between puc57-rDPAP3-Nt and puc57-rDPAP3-Ct-wt/mut. Digestion of these plasmids with BamHI, HindIII, and ClaI, followed by ligation of the N- and C-terminal products into the puc57 backbone yielded puc57-rDPAP3-WT and puc57-rDPAP3-MUT. The BamHI and HindIII restriction sites were used to clone full length <italic>dpap3</italic> into the pFastBacHT vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for expression of WT or MUT DPAP3 (pFB-rDPAP3wt and pFB-rDPAP3mut) in insect cells.</p>

<title>Recombinant expression of DPAP3</title>
<p>rDPAP3 was expressed in Sf9 insect cells using the baculovirus system. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> DH10Bac cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with pFB-rDPAP3wt and pFB-rDPAP3mut following the manufacturer recommendation. Baculovirus DNA was extracted using the BACMAX DNA purification kit (Epicentre) and transfected into a 5 mL culture of Sf9 cells (2x10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL) using Cellfectin (Thermofisher). After 3 days, the culture supernatant containing baculovirus particles was collected (P1 stock). To increase the viral load of our stocks, 1 mL of culture supernatant was serially passage twice into 25 mL of Sf9 cultures at 2x10<sup>6</sup> cell/mL for 3 days to obtain P2 and P3 viral stocks, which were stored at 4°C or frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub> in the presence of 10% glycerol. Insect cells were grown in SF-900-II serum free medium (Gibco) at 27°C under shaking conditions.</p>
<p>For rDPAP3 expression, Sf9 cells at 2x10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL were infected with 0.4 mL of P3 viral stock per liter of culture. The supernatant containing rDPAP3 was collected 72 h after infection, supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 μM pepstatin, 1 μM bestatin, and 10 μM E64), and its pH adjusted by adding 50 mM TrisHCl from a 1 M solution at pH 8.2; 10% glycerol was added before storage at -80°C. Note that despite being a general Cys protease inhibitor, E64 does not inhibit DPAP3.</p>
<p>A three steps purification consisting of ion exchange, affinity, and size exclusion chromatography was used to purify rDPAP3. First, culture supernatant was passed 3 times through 0.05 volumes of Q-sepharose (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A (50 mM Tris pH 8.2 containing the above-mentioned protease inhibitors). The resin was washed with 5 volumes of Buffer A and 2.5 volumes of 50 mM NaCl in Buffer A, and rDPAP3 eluted with 400 mM NaCl in Buffer A. Fractions containing rDPAP3 were pooled, diluted 1:1 into Buffer B (100 mM sodium acetate, 100 mM NaCl, pH6, and the protease inhibitors mentioned above), and passed through 0.05 volumes of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). The resin was washed with 10 volumes of Buffer B, and rDPAP3 eluted by lowering the pH of Buffer B to 5. Fractions containing rDPAP3 were pooled, concentrated using a Centricon Plus-70 Centrifugal Filter Unit (Millipore), loaded on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL size exclusion column, and run on an AKTA FPLC with Buffer A.

<title>Design of targeting and complementation constructs</title>
<p>All constructs designed to integrate into the <italic>dpap3</italic> locus by single-crossover recombination (tagged or cKO lines) contained either a 1065bp C-terminal homology region fused to GFP, or a 1210bp homology region upstream of the catalytic Cys504 (Asp39-Glu392) fused to a recodonized C-terminal region (Lys393-Stop941) tagged with mCherry or triple HA tag (HA<sub>3</sub>). The recodonized region contained either WT Cys504, or the C504S mutation. The construct designed to generate the DPAP3-HA, DPAP3-mCh, and DPAP3-GFP tagged lines we obtained as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s014">S10A and S10B Fig</xref>. Briefly, the <italic>dpap3</italic> C-terminal homology region was inserted into the pPM2GT plasmid to generate pPM2GT-DPAP3Ct-GFP. The N-terminal region of <italic>dpap3</italic> in the pFB-rDPAP3-wt/mut vector was replaced with the homology region to generate pFB-chDPAP3-wt/mut. The <italic>dpap3</italic> ORF was then introduced into the pHH1-SERA5ΔCt-HA—obtained after removal of the C-terminal part of SERA5 in the pHH1-SERA5-loxP-DS_PbDT3’[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref033">33</xref>]—resulting in plasmids pHH1-chDPAP3-wt/mut-HA, which harbor a C-terminal HA<sub>3</sub> tag and a <italic>loxP</italic> site downstream of the Pb3’ UTR. The HA<sub>3</sub> sequence of pHH1-SERA5ΔCt-HA was replaced with mCherry—amplified from the pREST-B plasmid[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref055">55</xref>]—to generate the pHH1-SERA5ΔCt-mCh, and the ORF of WT or MUT DPAP3 introduced into this plasmid to generate the pHH1-chDPAP3-wt/mut-mCh constructs.</p>
<p>To conditionally truncate <italic>dpap3</italic> we used two different approaches. The first approach introduced a <italic>loxP</italic> site within the ORF of <italic>dpap3</italic>, in an Asn-rich region (Asn414-Asn444) upstream of the catalytic domain, resulting in replacement of Asn430-Asp434 with a <italic>loxP</italic> coding peptide (ITSYSIHYTKLFTG). To make the pHH1-chDPAP3_loxP-mCh construct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s014">S10C Fig</xref>), the N- and C-terminal portions of DPAP3 were amplified from the pHH1-chDPAP3-wt-mCh, which contains a 3’UTR <italic>loxP</italic> site, and ligated into the plasmid backbone. A <italic>loxP</italic> site was introduced in the backward primer used to amplified the N-terminal region. The second approach inserted a <italic>loxPint</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref036">36</xref>] between the homology and recodonized regions. A synthetic 1600bp sequence (GeneWiz) containing the <italic>loxPint</italic> fragment flanked by targeting sequences was introduced into construct pHH1-chDPAP3-wt-mCh to generate the pHH1-chDPAP3_loxPint-mCh plasmid.</p>
<p>Finally, for episomal complementation of the cKO lines, plasmids pHH1-chDPAP3-wt/mut-HA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s014">S10A Fig</xref>) were modified in order to express full-length WT or MUT DPAP3 under the control of the <italic>dpap3</italic> or <italic>ama1</italic> promoters. Firstly, to select for parasites containing the complementation plasmids after transfection, the puromycin N-acetyltransferase (pac) gene, which confers resistance to puromycin, was amplified from mPAC-TK (a kind gift of Alex Maier) and subsequently ligated into pHH1-chDPAP3-wt/mut-HA plasmids. The homology region of this plasmid was replaced with a recodonized N-terminal <italic>dpap3</italic> amplified from puc57-rDPAP3-Nt, resulting in pHH1-rDPAP3-wt/mut-HA plasmids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s014">S10D Fig</xref>). The <italic>dpap3</italic> and <italic>ama1</italic> promoters (970 and 1456bp upstream of the start codon, respectively) were amplified from genomic DNA and ligated into these plasmids to generate the pHH1-<italic>dpap3-</italic>rDPAP3-wt/mut-HA, and pHH1-<italic>ama1-</italic>rDPAP3-wt/mut-HA complementation constructs.</p>

<p>Saponin pellets of parasites from different erythrocytic stages as well as samples from culture supernatant harvested during egress and invasion were syringe filtered (Minisart, 0,2 μm, Sartorius), boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer under reducing conditions, run on a SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred to Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in PBS, probed with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s004">S3 Table</xref> for antibodies used in this study), and followed by application of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce). The signal was detected using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific) and a ChemiDoc MP imager (BioRad).</p>

<title>Diagnostic PCR</title>
<p>PCR was performed using GoTag (Promega), Advantage 2 (Clontech), or Q5 High-Fidelity (NEB) polymerases. Diagnostic PCR to detect integration of targeting constructs was performed using extracted genomic DNA as template. Primer pairs specific for detection of integration, namely P21 and P22 for integration of pHH1-chDPAP3-mCh and pHH1-chDPAP3-HA, and II-inte_F and II-wt_R for integration of pPM2GT-DPAP3Ct-GFP, were designed such that the forward primer hybridized in a genomic region upstream of the plasmid homology region, and the second in a region unique to the introduced plasmid. Primer pairs P21 and P23 were designed to detect presence of the unmodified <italic>dpap3</italic> locus. To assess whether <italic>dpap3-mCh</italic> had been excised after RAP treatment, diagnostic PCR was performed using extracted genomic DNA as template. Primers P24 and M13 were used to detect non-excision <italic>dpap3</italic> at the genomic locus and hybridize upstream and downstream of the second <italic>loxP</italic> site, respectively. Primers P25 and SP6 were used to detect presence of excision and hybridize upstream and downstream of the first and second <italic>loxP</italic> sites, respectively.</p>

<p>(Related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g002">Fig 2</xref>) (<bold>A</bold>) WB analysis showing that the FY01-labelled band at 130kDa correspond to DPAP3-HA. C2-arrested schizonts were either left on C2, treated with E64 after C2 wash out, or allowed to egress for 1h in the presence of FY01 (Same samples as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Parasite pellets from free merozoites and schizonts (insoluble fraction obtained after saponin lysis), proteins precipitated from the culture supernatant, and PV and RBC cytosol components (soluble saponin fraction), were run on a SDS-PAGE. DPAP3 labelling by FY01 can be observed as a fluorescent band at 130kDa, which correspond to the band identified by WB using an anti-HA antibody. Note that FY01 is also able to label other papain-fold cysteine proteases such as the falcipains (FP1-3) or DPAP1 (indicated by arrowheads). (<bold>B</bold>) Rupturing (DMSO) and C2- or E64-arrested 3D7 schizonts were labelled under intact conditions with FY01 in the presence or absence of the DPAP3 inhibitor SAK1. Proteins secreted in the culture supernatant, free merozoites, and the soluble and insoluble fractions of saponin lysed schizonts, were run on an SDS-PAGE gel. Fluorescent bands at 130 and 100 kDa that disappear in the presence of SAK1 correspond to the p120 and p95 forms of DPAP3-HA. The small proportion of p95 DPAP3 is likely produced after parasite lysis. (<bold>C</bold>) C2-arrested schizonts (DPAP3-HA line) were either left on C2 or allowed to egress for 30 min after C2 wash out.

<title>Removal of the prodomain of DPAP3 is not required for activation.</title>
<p>(Related for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g003">Fig 3</xref>) (<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of DPAPs processing. The signal peptide (SP), exclusion domain (ED), prodomain (PD), and the N- and C-terminal portions of the catalytic domain (Nt-CD and Ct-CD) are shown in different colours. Cleavage sites for removal of the SP and PD, and for processing of the CD are indicated by chevrons. A representation of fully processed monomeric DPAP1 and tetrameric CatC are shown. The predominant p120 DPAP3 active form is produced after removal of the SP. We propose that the p95 DPAP3 active form is produced after cleavage of the ED. The regions recognized by anti-Nt-DPAP3 and anti-Ct-DPAP3 antibodies, and the position of the catalytic Cys covalently modified by FY01 are shown above the full-length protein scheme. (<bold>B</bold>) Western blot analysis of DPAP3 processing in schizonts. Supernatant of insect cell cultures expressing rDPAP3, lysates of DPAP3-HA schizonts, and 3D7 mature schizonts directly boiled into loading buffer without previous lysis were analysed by WB using the α-DPAP3Ct, and with α-HA after stripping the same blot. Lysis of schizonts before addition of loading buffer results in processing of DPAP3 from the p120 form to the p95 and p40 forms (N- and C-terminal portion of the CD, respectively). However, if schizonts are directly boiled in loading buffer, only the physiologically relevant p120 form is observed (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Note that the p120 and p95 forms obtained from rDPAP3 are very similar to the ones that are observed in parasite lysates. Asterisks indicate non-specific labelling by α-DPAP3Ct. (<bold>C</bold>) Representative data showing DPAP3 processing is an artefact of parasite lysis. Merozoite lysates were incubated for several hours under neutral (PBS, pH 7.2) or acidic (acetate buffer, pH 5.5) conditions before adding 1 μM of FY01 for 1 h. Under acidic conditions, we observed a time dependent processing of the p120 form to the p95 and p42 forms. Coomassie staining of the gel is shown as a loading control. This experiment was repeated four time: 2 biological replicates with two technical replicates each. (<bold>D</bold>) Quantification and normalization of the fluorescent signal for the different labelled forms of DPAP3. The fluorescent intensity of each band was quantified using ImageJ and normalized to the sum of fluorescence intensities measured at time zero. Error bars represent standard error of the mean (N = 4). For all replicates, only the p120 band was observed at neutral pH. At acidic pH we see a time dependent decrease and increase of the p120 and p42 forms, respectively, and an accumulation of the p95 form at intermediate time points. (<bold>E</bold>) Michaelis Menten plots showing VR-ACC turnover rate for two consecutive Ni-NTA elution fractions (E2 and E3). The gel image showing FY01 labelling indicates that E2 contains predominantly the p120 form, and E3 a mixture of the p95 and p120 forms. VR-ACC turnover was normalized to the sum of p120 and p95 labelling shown in the gel image. The identical Michaelis Menten plots indicate that the p120 and p95 forms are equally active, thus showing that removal of the signal peptide is sufficient to activate DPAP3.</p>

Upstream of the recodonized sequence was a 1210 bp endogenous 3D7 sequence (homology region, HR, that excludes the 58 bp sequence coding for the signal peptide) to drive single cross-over homologous recombination at the <italic>dpap3</italic> locus. White block arrows in the scheme indicate PCR amplification and black block arrows ligation after digest with the indicated restriction enzymes. The 1210 bp targeting fragment (HR, white box) was created by amplifying <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> 3D7 genomic DNA using primers P5 (forward, has BamHI site) and P6 (reverse, has PstI site) and ligated into pFB-rDPAP3 or pFB-rDPAP3mut after restriction digest with BamHI and PstI resulting in plasmids pFB-chDPAP3 and pFB-chDPAP3mut, respectively. Plasmid pHH1-SERA5-loxP-DS_PbDT3’, which harbors the coding sequence for a C-terminal HA<sub>3</sub> tag (light blue box), a <italic>loxP</italic> site (orange arrow) downstream of the Pb3’ UTR, and a <italic>hdhfr</italic> resistance cassette (black box)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref033">33</xref>], was digested with BglII and XhoI (deleting the C-terminal part of SERA5 in this plasmid), blunted, and re-ligated in order to create a BglII restriction site at the 3’ end (resulting in plasmid pHH1-SERA5ΔCt-HA). The sequence for mCherry (red box) was amplified from plasmid pREST-B mCherry[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref055">55</xref>] with primer P7 (forward, has SalI and XhoI sites) and P8 (reverse, has SpeI and NotI sites) and ligated into plasmid pHH1-SERA5ΔCt-HA after digestion with XhoI and NotI, resulting in exchange of HA<sub>3</sub> with <italic>mCherry</italic> and plasmid pHH1-SERA5ΔCt-mCh. The chimera DPAP3 and DPAP3mut fragments were subsequently amplified from pFB-chDPAP3 and pFB-chDPAP3mut plasmids using primers P9 (forward, has KpnI and HpaI sites) and P10 (reverse, has XmaI and BglII sites) and ligated into plasmids pHH1-SERA5ΔCt-HA or pHH1-SERA5ΔCt-mCh after restriction digest with HpaI and BglII, resulting in plasmids pHH1-chDPAP3-HA, pHH1-chDPAP3mut-HA, pHH1-chDPAP3-mCh and pHH1-chDPAP3mut-mCh. (<bold>B</bold>) Constructs pPM2GT-DPAP3Ct-GFP was designed to integrate by single-crossover homologous recombination into the 3D7 <italic>dpap3</italic> locus, reconstituting the coding sequence of the endogenous gene with a gene that expresses a wildtype DPAP3 protein fused to GFP (green box). A 1065bp endogenous 3D7 sequence piece, excluding the STOP codon (white box, HR) was used to drive single cross-over homologous recombination at the <italic>dpap3</italic> locus. The HR fragment was amplified from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> 3D7 genomic DNA using primers II-DPAP3Ct_F (forward, has XhoI site) and II-DPAP3Ct_R (reverse, has AvrII site) and ligated into pPM2GT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref058">58</xref>] after restriction digest with XhoI and AvrII, resulting in plasmid pPM2GT-DPAP3Ct-GFP. (<bold>A-B</bold>) The constructs were transfected into 3D7 parasites. (<bold>C</bold>) To obtain conditional truncation of the <italic>dpap3</italic> gene, we used two different approaches. One introduced a <italic>loxP</italic> site (orange arrow) into the ORF of the <italic>dpap3</italic> gene within a sequence coding for an asparagine-rich region upstream of the catalytic domain, resulting in a partial replacement of the endogenous sequence (left side). The second approach made use of a silent <italic>loxP</italic> site within a heterologous <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> intron (called <italic>loxPint</italic>, orange arrow within yellow box), which was inserted in the sequence <bold>AGAT</bold> (see below) 50 bp before the sequence coding for the above-mentioned Asn-stretch (right side). The <italic>loxPint</italic> system has been described in detail elsewhere[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref036">36</xref>]. Using these two approaches, we created two slightly different truncations of DPAP3 (F8cKO and F3cKO, <italic>loxPint</italic>; and A1cKO, <italic>loxP</italic>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007031.s010">S6A Fig</xref>). For the first approach (left side), two PCR fragments coding for the N- and C-terminal part of the protein were amplified using primers P11 and P12 (including KpnI and AgeI+loxP, respectively; N-term), and P13 and P14 (including AgeI and SmaI, respectively; C-term), and introduced into construct pHH1-chDPAP3-mCh using restriction sites KpnI, AgeI and SmaI to generate plasmid construct pHH1-chDPAP3_loxP-mCh. For the second approach (right side), a ~1600 bp sequence corresponding to the <italic>loxPint</italic> fragment and flanked by targeting sequence at the 5ˊ and 3ˊ ends <bold>(</bold>…AAAGAAGA<bold>AG</bold>-loxPint-<bold>AT</bold>CATCAACA…) was synthesized (GeneWiz) and introduced into construct pHH1-chDPAP3-mCh using restriction sites KpnI and ClaI to generate plasmid construct pHH1-chDPAP3_loxPint-mCh. All constructs were transfected into 1G5-DiCre parasites[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007031.ref033">33</xref>]. (<bold>D</bold>) For episomal complementation of the cKO lines, plasmids pHH1-chDPAP3-HA and pHH1-chDPAP3mut-HA (<bold>A</bold>) were modified in order to express full length WT or MUT <italic>dpap3</italic> under the control of either <italic>dpap3</italic> or <italic>ama1</italic> promoters. Firstly, the puromycin N-acetyltransferase drug selection marker (pac, purple box) was amplified from mPAC-TK (a kind gift of Alex Maier) using primers CVO140 and CVO141, and ligated into pHH1-chDPAP3-HA and pHH1-chDPAP3mut-HA after digestion with BamHI and HindIII, thereby replacing the <italic>hdhfr</italic> gene. To avoid integration at the mutated <italic>dpap3</italic> locus in our cKO lines, the DNA sequence of the entire gene was recodonized in the resultant plasmid. To do that, the sequence for rDPAP3-Nt was amplified by PCR from plasmid puc57-rDPAP3-Nt (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">material and methods</xref> for details about this plasmid) using primers P15 and P16, and ligated into the pHH1-chDPAP3-HA and pHH1-chDPAP3mut-HA vectors after restriction digestion with KpnI and ClaI, resulting in plasmids pHH1-rDPAP3-HA and pHH1-rDPAP3mut-HA. The <italic>ama1</italic> and <italic>dpap3</italic> promoter regions were amplified from <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> 3D7 genomic DNA using primers P17 and P18 (<italic>ama1</italic>) and P19 and P20 (<italic>dpap3</italic>), and ligated into pHH1-rDPAP3-HA and pHH1-rDPAP3mut-HA after digestion with HpaI and KpnI, resulting in transfection plasmids pHH1-<italic>ama1</italic>-rDPAP3-HA (parasite line cKO+WT<sub>ama1</sub>), pHH1-<italic>ama1</italic>-rDPAP3mut-HA (parasite line cKO+MUT<sub>ama1</sub>), pHH1-<italic>dpap3</italic>-rDPAP3-HA (parasite line cKO+WT<sub>dpap3</sub>) and pHH1-<italic>dpap3</italic>-rDPAP3mut-HA (parasite line cKO+MUT<sub>dpap3</sub>). All constructs were transfected into A1cKO or F8cKO parasites. All final construct sequences were verified by nucleotide sequencing on both strands.</p>

<title>DPAP3 knock-out parasites egress from erythrocytes.</title>
<p>(Related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007031.g007">Fig 7C</xref>) F8cKO parasites were treated with DMSO (upper panel) or RAP (lower panel) at ring stage and cultured for 44 h to allow schizont development. The schizonts were Percoll-enriched, returned to culture and allowed to mature for 4–5 h in the presence of C2, then washed in warm medium without C2, and immediately observed by time-lapse DIC and fluorescent microscopy, taking images at 5 and 25 s intervals in the DIC (left videos) and mCherry (right videos) channels, respectively. Imaging started 6 min following C2 removal. As can be seen one parasite on the RAP treated population has not gone through excision and expresses DPAP3-mCherry. Time after start of microscopy is indicated on the top right corner of the video. No differences were noticed in the number of parasites that egressed, nor on the timing of egress between DMSO and RAP treated parasites. Identical results were observed for the A1cKO lines (videos not shown).</p>
