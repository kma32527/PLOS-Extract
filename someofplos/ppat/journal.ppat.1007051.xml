<abstract>
<p>Pathogens hijack host endocytic pathways to force their own entry into eukaryotic target cells. Many bacteria either exploit receptor-mediated zippering or inject virulence proteins directly to trigger membrane reorganisation and cytoskeletal rearrangements. By contrast, extracellular <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> elementary bodies (EBs) apparently employ facets of both the zipper and trigger mechanisms and are only ~400 nm in diameter. Our cryo-electron tomography of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry revealed an unexpectedly diverse array of host structures in association with invading EBs, suggesting internalisation may progress by multiple, potentially redundant routes or several sequential events within a single pathway. Here we performed quantitative analysis of actin organisation at chlamydial entry foci, highlighting filopodial capture and phagocytic cups as dominant and conserved morphological structures early during internalisation. We applied inhibitor-based screening and employed reporters to systematically assay and visualise the spatio-temporal contribution of diverse endocytic signalling mediators to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry. In addition to the recognised roles of the Rac1 GTPase and its associated nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) WAVE, our data revealed an additional unrecognised pathway sharing key hallmarks of macropinocytosis: i) amiloride sensitivity, ii) fluid-phase uptake, iii) recruitment and activity of the NPF N-WASP, and iv) the localised generation of phosphoinositide-3-phosphate (PI3P) species. Given their central role in macropinocytosis and affinity for PI3P, we assessed the role of SNX-PX-BAR family proteins. Strikingly, SNX9 was specifically and transiently enriched at <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry foci. SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> cells exhibited a 20% defect in EB entry, which was enhanced to 60% when the cells were infected without sedimentation-induced EB adhesion, consistent with a defect in initial EB-host interaction. Correspondingly, filopodial capture of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> EBs was specifically attenuated in SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> cells, implicating SNX9 as a central host mediator of filopodial capture early during chlamydial entry. Our findings identify an unanticipated complexity of signalling underpinning cell entry by this major human pathogen, and suggest intriguing parallels with viral entry mechanisms.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p><italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> remains the leading bacterial agent of sexually transmitted disease worldwide and causes a form of blindness called trachoma in Developing nations, which is recognised by the World Health Organisation as a neglected tropical disease. Despite this burden, we know comparatively little about how it causes disease at a molecular level. <italic>Chlamydia</italic> must live inside human cells to survive, and here we study the mechanism of how it enters cells, which is critical to the lifecycle. We study how the bacterium exploits signalling pathways inside the cell to its own advantage to deform the cell membrane by reorganising the underlying cell skeleton, and identify new factors involved in this process. Our findings suggest intriguing similarities with how some viruses enter cells. A better understanding of these processes may help to develop future vaccines and new treatments.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>An essential early event in the lifecycle of many human and animal pathogens is entry into non-phagocytic host epithelial cells. Viruses, bacteria and parasites all engage with host cell surfaces prior to inducing the reorganisation of the plasma membrane and underlying cytoskeleton to promote their internalisation. Invasive bacteria like <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Listeria</italic> species are typically &gt; 1 μm in diameter and promote their internalisation either by injecting virulence effector proteins that subvert host signalling to reversibly induce cytoskeletal reorganisation, or through surface ligand mimicry hijack receptor-mediated endocytosis, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref001">1</xref>]. By contrast, the infectious extracellular form of <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, termed the elementary body (EB), is much smaller in diameter (~400 nm) than its archetypal Gram-negative cousins. Nevertheless, EBs must also induce actin-dependent internalisation into non-phagocytic cells, a pivotal step in the lifecycle of this obligate intracellular bacterium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>How <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> promotes cell entry is incompletely understood, but it is often considered as an example of the trigger mechanism epitomised by the enteroinvasive bacterium <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>. <italic>Salmonella</italic> employs a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject multiple, semi-redundant effectors into host cells that coordinate the reorganisation of the host actin cytoskeleton. Two effectors reversibly stimulate the cellular Rho-family GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1, two effectors bind to actin directly to modulate filament dynamics, and a further effector acts as a phosphoinositol phosphatase mimic, modulating membrane plasticity and co-stimulating the Rho GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref007">7</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> EBs also exploit a T3SS and deliver effectors into the host cell that reversibly stimulate Rac1. Although the mechanism remains incomplete, a major factor is the T3SS effector <underline>t</underline>ranslocated <underline>a</underline>ctin <underline>r</underline>ecruiting <underline>p</underline>hosphoprotein (TARP) that nucleates polymerisation directly by binding to actin, and indirectly upon tyrosine phosphorylation by acting as a scaffold for Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref011">11</xref>]. A second effector post-translationally modifies the GTPase itself, possibly to subsequently downregulate signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref012">12</xref>]. A number of host receptors have also been linked to cell entry by different chlamydial species. For instance, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>pneumoniae</italic> Pmp21 binds epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to induce EB entry by receptor-mediated endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref013">13</xref>], an event more reminiscent of the zipper mechanism exemplified by <italic>Listeria</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref014">14</xref>]. The role of receptors in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry is however less clear, as none are essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Although Rac1 stimulation is sufficient for the formation of lamellipodia, this signalling activity cannot exclusively account for the complex actin ruffles, pedestal-like structures and filopodia present at EB entry sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref016">16</xref>]. This view was further reinforced by our cryo-electron tomography of early interactions between <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> EBs and cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref017">17</xref>], when EBs were captured in association with phagocytic cups, trapped by actin-rich filopodia and present within membrane ruffles reminiscent of macropinosomes. These combined data support a view that multiple or redundant entry pathways are likely to operate in parallel. As expected, chlamydial entry thus shares many similarities with other bacterial entry pathways. However, there are also striking parallels with viral entry mechanisms. The small size of EBs, their association with filopodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref002">2</xref>], entry-associated phosphorylation and signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref019">19</xref>], and also the requirement for protein disulphide isomerase-associated reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref020">20</xref>] and promiscuous receptor interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref023">23</xref>] are all factors common to viral entry mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref028">28</xref>]. In this study we have quantified the cytoskeletal rearrangements and membrane reorganisation at <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry foci, and systematically investigated the underlying signalling pathways, initially by employing inhibitor screens in a manner analogous to studies of viral entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref030">30</xref>].</p>

<title>Filopodial association is an early event during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry</title>
<p>Although our cryo-electron tomography revealed an unexpected diversity of cellular structures at <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref017">17</xref>], this technique did not enable the visualisation of sufficient events to statistically distinguish whether they represent sequential assemblies or distinct pathways. Consequently, we exploited confocal microscopy to categorise a significantly larger number of bacterial entry foci, initially by observing F-actin recruitment during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> infection of human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE1) cells. Telomerase-immortalised RPE1 cells are widely applied to study endocytic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref032">32</xref>], and are permissive to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref033">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Distinct F-actin structures could be defined using light microscopy that correlated with those observed by cryo-electron tomography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref017">17</xref>]. Differential fluorescence staining was used to discriminate extracellular and intracellular bacteria (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and Methods</xref></bold>). From 10 minutes post-infection, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> LGV2 EBs were captured in association with filopodia, F-actin cup, tail or ring-like assemblies (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and additional examples in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). To examine the progression of these events over time, cells were additionally fixed 30 and 120 minutes post-infection. The most striking phenotype was the difference in the number of EBs in association with filopodia, which decreased from 33 ± 3% at 10 minutes to 13 ± 6% after 120 minutes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>). This revealed that filopodial association is a significant early event during EB entry into cultured RPE1 cells.</p>

<p>(A) Representative immunofluorescence images of F-actin recruitment to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> EBs during early interaction with RPE1 cells. Cultured RPE1 cells were infected with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> LGV2 for 30 minutes prior to fixation with 1% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were stained with an anti-<italic>Chlamydia</italic> primary antibody and an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells were permeabilised with 0.05% Triton X-100 (v/v) and the bacteria stained using the same anti-<italic>Chlamydia</italic> primary antibody and an Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated secondary antibody. Intracellular bacteria were labelled with only Alexa Fluor 633 (dark blue; ‘intracellular and extracellular’ panel), extracellular bacteria were labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 633 (green + blue, cyan; ‘extracellular’ and ‘intracellular and extracellular’ panels).

<p>To determine whether filopodial association is a conserved early event, F-actin structures were next equivalently quantified following the infection of HeLa cells with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> LGV2 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s003">S3A Fig</xref></bold>). The frequency of filopodial association at 10 minutes post infection was even higher in these cells, at 51 ± 4% EBs, decreasing significantly by 120 minutes post infection to 23 ± 3% (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s003">S3B Fig</xref></bold>).

<p>Filopodia are induced by the activation of the GTPase Cdc42 and the associated actin nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) N-WASP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref035">35</xref>], although additional efficiency factors are also required including IRTKS- and Ena/VASP-family proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref037">37</xref>]. However, previous studies have shown Rac1-WAVE-Arp2/3 signalling is clearly required for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> invasion, whereas Cdc42 is not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref039">39</xref>]. To evaluate whether additional host factors are required for filopodial association and EB uptake, cells were infected in the presence of small molecule inhibitors targetting a broad panel of cellular factors known to influence actin dynamics and endocytic processes. Initially, to facilitate high-throughput screening, cultured RPE1 cells were infected with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> LGV2 for two hours in the presence of three different concentrations of each inhibitor, where the mid concentration was the established IC<sub>50</sub> or effective concentration. Inhibitors were then removed by washing, and the infection allowed to proceed until 24 hours post-infection (hpi), when the infected cells were fixed and the number of inclusions present in comparison to control, mock-treated cells enumerated. Based on the initial results, a second smaller-scale inhibitor screen was conducted to directly assess the effects of a subset of the inhibitors, which influenced inclusion formation in the first screen, on bacterial entry by applying differential fluorescence staining to discriminate extracellular and intracellular bacteria directly. This allowed effects on entry and nascent inclusion formation to be distinguished. For the initial screening at 24 hpi, effects were arbitrarily considered as significant when the mid-concentration of an inhibitor reduced the number of inclusion-containing cells to ≤ 75% of the control (this threshold is represented by a dotted line on plots in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s006">S6 Fig</xref></bold>). Inclusion morphology was also examined following each treatment by parallel immunofluorescence (of which selected examples are shown in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s007">S7 Fig</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Consistent with the major roles for the Sos/Abi1/Eps8 and Vav2 guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) in the activation of the small GTPase Rac1 during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref011">11</xref>], the EHop inhibitor that specifically prevents Vav2-mediated Rac1 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref040">40</xref>] induced a clear and significant dose-dependent decrease in the number of inclusion-containing cells, whereas NSC that alternatively targets Rac1-specific GEFs TrioN and Tiam1 had a lesser effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref041">41</xref>] (compare <bold>EHop</bold> and <bold>NSC</bold> in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s006">S6 Fig</xref></bold>). Unexpectedly, inhibitors targeting the GTPase Cdc42 resulted in significant reduction in inclusion number (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s006">S6 Fig</xref></bold>, <bold>ML141</bold> and <bold>Casin</bold>). Conversely, the inhibition of RhoA and Arf GTPases did not reduce inclusion formation to ≤ 75% of the control, our significance criteria (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s006">S6 Fig</xref></bold>, <bold>RhoA</bold> and <bold>Arf6</bold>), in agreement with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref038">38</xref>], although Arf6 activity has been implicated in the internalisation of the related <italic>C</italic>. <italic>caviae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref042">42</xref>]. Finally, all three dynamin inhibitors tested decreased inclusion formation significantly and dose-dependently, with dynasore and MiTMAB preventing inclusion formation at the highest concentration (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, Dynasore, MiTMAB</bold> and <bold>OcTMAB</bold>), in agreement with the established role of dynamin in mediating lipid transport early during inclusion biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite the well-recognised requirement for actin reorganisation, equivalent assays performed using small molecule inhibitors that target actin dynamics exhibited contrasting effects on inclusion formation in RPE1 cells. Cytochalasin D treatment induced a dose-dependent decrease in inclusion formation, with an 88 ± 4% reduction at mid concentration (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, actin polymerisation cytoD</bold>), whereas cells treated with latrunculin B only exhibited a 16 ± 7% decrease at the highest concentration tested (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, actin polymerisation latB</bold>), despite the fact that both cytochalasin and latrunculin are classical inhibitors of actin polymerisation, albeit via distinct modes of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref045">45</xref>]. Jasplakinolide, which stabilises F-actin, prevented inclusion formation at the mid concentration (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, actin stabilisation</bold>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref046">46</xref>]. Consistent with a role for Rho GTPase signalling, CK636 and CK548 that target the Arp2/3 actin nucleation complex and inhibit actin polymerisation either by preventing the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits of the complex entering their active conformation or by binding to the hydrophobic core of Arp3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref047">47</xref>], induced a dose-dependent reduction in inclusion formation, reflected by a 37 ± 8% and 48 ± 9% decreases at the mid concentration, respectively (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, CK636</bold> and <bold>CK548</bold>). In addition to Arp2/3-directed nucleation of branched F-actin networks, unbranched filament nucleation by formins apparently also contributes, as the formin inhibitor SMIF induced a 76 ± 6% reduction in inclusion formation at the mid concentration, although this was excluded from further analysis as it did not reduce inclusion formation ≤ 75% of the control (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, SMIF</bold>). These data demonstrate that our assays using <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> LGV2 and cultured RPE1 cells specifically recapitulate previous findings implicating the specific stimulation of Rac1 via a subfamily of cellular GEFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Given the early role of filopodia (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold>), we investigated the potential contribution of the NPF N-WASP, which stimulates filopodia formation by activating the Arp2/3 complex via Cdc42-dependent and -independent pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref049">49</xref>]. We exploited wiskostatin that specifically inhibits N-WASP activity by stabilising the auto-inhibited conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref050">50</xref>]. Intriguingly, N-WASP inhibition resulted in 49 ± 12% and 92 ± 5% decreases in inclusion formation at the mid-IC<sub>50</sub> and high-concentrations, respectively (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, wiskostatin</bold>). These data implicate N-WASP as an apparently dominant mediator of early inclusion formation. Correspondingly, the macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA induced a dose-dependent decrease in inclusion formation (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, macropinocytosis</bold>), with ~50% of the remaining inclusions containing RBs which were morphologically abnormal (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s007">S7 Fig</xref>, EIPA</bold>). By contrast, treatment with filipin and cholesterol oxidase, which target lipid raft and caveolae-mediated endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref052">52</xref>], did not significantly affect the number of inclusions formed in comparison to the mock-treated controls (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, filipin &amp; cholesterol oxidase</bold>), or the morphology of the inclusions or RBs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s007">S7 Fig</xref>, cholesterol oxidase</bold>). Tip, which targets myosin VI and consequently clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref053">53</xref>], reduced inclusion formation by 15 ± 6% at the mid concentration, although the inhibitor itself was significantly cytotoxic when applied at higher concentrations (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, Tip</bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s008">S8 Fig</xref>, Tip</bold>). These initial inhibition experiments using inclusion formation 24 hpi as a phenotypic read-out in RPE1 cells, both confirmed recognised mediators of bacterial entry and early inclusion biogenesis (Rac1, dynamin, Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerisation) and implicated previously unrecognised factors (Cdc42, N-WASP, macropinocytosis).</p>
<p>However, these data alone are insufficient to distinguish a role for these factors in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry rather than in the subsequent development and trafficking of early bacteria-containing vacuoles. Based on the initial results (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s006">S6 Fig</xref></bold>), a more restricted inhibitor screen was performed using EHop (Rac1), Casin (Cdc42), MiTMAB (dynamin), wiskostatin (N-WASP), CK636 (Arp2/3), cytochalasin D and latrunculin B (actin polymerisation), EIPA (macropinocytosis) and Rhosin (RhoA), to assess the effect of these inhibitors directly on bacterial entry using differential ‘inside-outside’ immunofluorescence staining (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s001">S1 Fig</xref></bold>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and Methods</xref>). In agreement with their effects on inclusion formation (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s006">S6 Fig</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s007">S7 Fig</xref></bold>), inhibition of Rac1, N-WASP, macropinocytosis and the Arp2/3 complex each reduced bacterial entry in a dose-dependent manner (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g002">Fig 2</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s009">S9 Fig</xref></bold>). Indeed, the N-WASP inhibitor wiskostatin could block <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry, without inducing substantial cell cytotoxicity (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g002">Fig 2</xref>, N-WASP</bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s008">S8 Fig</xref>, Wiskostatin</bold>).

Unexpectedly, neither cytochalasin D nor latrunculin B decreased bacterial entry as anticipated (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g002">Fig 2</xref>, cytochalasin D</bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s009">S9 Fig</xref>, latrunculin B</bold>), although cytochalasin D treatment significantly inhibited the entry of <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> into RPE1 cells, reducing internalisation to 18 ± 9% of mock-treated controls under equivalent conditions at IC<sub>50</sub> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s010">S10A Fig</xref></bold>), when F-actin organisation is clearly disrupted (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s010">S10B Fig</xref></bold>).

At this timepoint, only 7–10% of bacteria are intracellular (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s005">S5 Fig</xref></bold>), thus the recruitment of Rac1 and Cdc42 (8.6 ±0.9% and 6.7 ±1.3% respectively) reflects the transient association of these with nearly every invasion-competent EB at 10 minutes post-infection. Arf6-GFP was observed with lower frequency in membrane ruffles adjacent to some EBs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g003">Fig 3</xref>, Arf6-GFP</bold>), consistent with its role in membrane ruffling and Rac1 trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref055">55</xref>].

<p>Given that N-WASP is transiently recruited to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry foci and N-WASP inhibition has dose-dependent effects on bacterial entry, we validated the role of N-WASP in entry using knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (N-WASP<sup>-/-</sup>). In these cells, chlamydial adhesion was reduced by &gt;70% compared to isogenic wild-type control cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s012">S12A Fig</xref></bold>), while <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry was significantly reduced by 54 ± 17% (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s012">S12B and S12C Fig</xref></bold>). These data confirm the importance of N-WASP during entry processes, yet imply the role of N-WASP is more complex than simply the requirement in entry alone. The fact that upstream adhesion of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> is also affected may be indicative of a role for N-WASP and consequently the actin cytoskeleton in stablising chlamydial adhesion, which may subsequently impact bacterial entry efficiency. Alternatively, the absence of N-WASP in the knockout cells may disturb F-actin organization and influence normal <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> adhesion processes indirectly. Nevertheless, these data clearly support the view that N-WASP plays a significant yet previously uncharacterised role in the early interactions between <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> and the host cell.</p>

<title>A macropinocytosis-like pathway underlying <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry</title>
<p>The requirement for Rac1, Cdc42, N-WASP, the Arp2/3 complex and macropinocytosis-associated sodium-proton exchangers inhibited by EIPA, and the dynamic recruitment of Rac1, Cdc42, WAVE and N-WASP to entry foci, together with the association of EBs with phagocytic cups, suggested that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry shared many similarities to growth factor and virus-induced macropinocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref056">56</xref>]. An additional hallmark of macropinocytosis is the associated activity of phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), and the sequential generation of the phosphoinositide signalling intermediates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3] and phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) at the plasma membrane. Consequently, we next investigated PI3K activity and used reporters to determine the localisation of 3-phosphoinositide species during chlamydial internalisation. RPE1 cells were infected with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> LGV2 in the presence of the pan-PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref057">57</xref>], and the effect on bacterial entry assessed using the fluorescence ‘inside-out’ assay. Neither wortmannin nor LY294002 significantly inhibited <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g005">Fig 5A</xref></bold>), in agreement with previous data in HeLa cells showing wortmannin-insensitive chlamydial internalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref002">2</xref>]. However, Akt-PH-GFP, which reports PI(3,4,5)P3 when expressed in cultured cells, was recruited to EBs 10 and 30 minutes post infection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, Akt-PH-GFP</bold>). Strikingly, the PI3P reporter PX-p40-GFP not only accumulated at entry sites, but also persisted around motile early vacuoles encapsulating EBs (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, PX-p40-GFP</bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s015">S1 Movie</xref></bold>). These data suggest that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> enters via a macropinocytosis-like route, with features subtly distinct from the canonical pathway. This would not be without precedent, as a wortmannin- and LY294002-insensitive pathway generates PI(3,4,5)P3 during <italic>Salmonella</italic> entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref058">58</xref>].</p>

<title>Sorting nexin 9 mediates filopodial capture during <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-induced macropinocytosis</title>
<p>Macropinosomes are derived from membrane ruffles and protrusions folding back and fusing with the plasma membrane to form large vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref059">59</xref>]. Although the signalling underlying cellular macropinocytosis is incompletely understood Rac1, WAVE, Cdc42 and N-WASP, along with other downstream effectors such as PAK1, are implicated in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref056">56</xref>]. Phosphoinositide signalling is also central, with PI(3,4,5)P3 present in phagocytic cups being rapidly dephosphorylated to PI3P on the nascent macropinosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref061">61</xref>]. The sorting nexin (SNX) protein family is implicated in membrane trafficking, cargo sorting and endocytosis, and is characterised by a phosphoinositide-binding phox (PX) domain. The PX domain confers phosphoinositide binding specificity, with some PX domains binding PI(3)P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref062">62</xref>]. The SNX-PX-BAR subfamily contain a BAR domain, and of these SNX1, SNX5, SNX9, SNX18 and SNX33 are implicated in macropinosome formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref063">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref065">65</xref>].</p>
<p>To further characterise the macropinocytic-like entry pathway of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic>, we explored whether SNX-PX-BAR proteins were involved early during bacterial entry. Cultured RPE1 cells expressing individual SNX-PX-BAR family proteins epitope-tagged at their C-terminus (SNX1-Myc, SNX2-Myc, SNX4-Myc, SNX5-Myc, SNX6-Myc, SNX7-Myc, SNX8-Myc, SNX9-Myc, SNX18-Myc, SNX30-Myc, SNX32-Myc and SNX33-Myc) were infected with C. trachomatis LGV2. Infection was allowed to proceed for 10 minutes prior to fixation and analysis of SNX-PX-BAR-Myc recruitment to entry foci.</p>
<p>Of the twelve SNX-PX-BAR-Myc proteins analysed, SNX9-Myc was observed most frequently at entry sites (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, SNX9</bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, SNX9-Myc</bold>). However, since all twelve ectopically-expressed SNX-PX-BAR-Myc derivatives were also present at entry sites at low frequency using our applied scoring criteria (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g006">Fig 6A</xref></bold>), we next verified the localisation of endogenous SNX9 with an anti-SNX9 polyclonal antibody by indirect immunofluorescence. This antibody recognised endogenous SNX9 in accordance with literature (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s014">S14A Fig</xref> anti-SNX9</bold>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref067">67</xref>]), and within F-actin pedestals generated following infection of RPE1 cells with enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EPEC) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s014">S14B Fig</xref></bold>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref068">68</xref>]).

In addition to these studies using fixed cells, RPE1 cells expressing GFP-SNX9 were also observed by live imaging. <italic>In trans</italic> expression of GFP-SNX9 expression generated two distinct phenotypes, dependent on the level of expression. High expression induced extensive membrane tubulation, whereas lower expression generated a punctate distribution reminiscent of the endogenous protein (compare left and right GFP-SNX9 panels in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s014">S14A Fig</xref> GFP-SNX9</bold>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref069">69</xref>]). Consequently, cells exhibiting membrane tubulation were excluded from further analysis. Functionality of GFP-SNX9 in low-expressing cells was additionally confirmed by verifying localisation within F-actin pedestals generated following infection with EPEC (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s014">S14C Fig</xref></bold>). Cultured RPE1 cells expressing low levels of GFP-SNX9 were infected with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> LGV2.

<p>To establish whether the effect of SNX9 knockdown is limited to invasion, cells were treated with siRNA for 48 hours, prior to infection with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> LGV2. Infection was allowed to proceed for 24 hours prior to fixation and quantification of the number of inclusion containing cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g007">Fig 7C</xref></bold>). No significant difference was observed in the overall number of infected cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g007">Fig 7C</xref></bold>). However, RPE1 cells treated with SNX9 siRNA had a significant number of smaller-sized inclusions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g007">Fig 7D</xref></bold>). While the spread of inclusion diameters in control non-targeting siRNA (10.4 ± 3.4 μm) and SNX9 siRNA (8.1 ± 3.8 μm) treated cells were similar, the minimum and maximum inclusion diameters in the SNX9 siRNA treated cells were smaller than those in control non-targeting siRNA treated cells. This suggests that SNX9 influences inclusion growth, or the phenotype could be a secondary effect arising from the reduction in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g007">Fig 7A</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>However, as these knockdown experiments inevitably represent a mixed population, we exploited human adherent HAP1 cells that recapitulate the chlamydial infection cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref070">70</xref>] to generate a SNX9 knockout cell line (SNX9<sup>-/-</sup>).

As the membrane-scission protein dynamin interacts with SNX9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref071">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref072">72</xref>], we examined the structure of early <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic>-containing vacuoles at 3 hours post infection of HAP1 wild type and SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> by cryo-EM tomography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref017">17</xref>].

<p>SNX9 has an established role in the reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton, as it interacts directly with multiple proteins that regulate filament dynamics, including the Arp2/3 complex, N-WASP, Cdc42 and RhoA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref073">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref074">74</xref>], and is recruited to F-actin-rich structures during fluid-phase endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref073">73</xref>]. To examine whether SNX9 might contribute to cytoskeletal reorganisation during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry, F-actin morphology during bacterial entry into wild type and SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> HAP1 cells was compared using the assays developed previously to assess RPE1 and HeLa cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s003">S3 Fig</xref></bold>). Adherent wild type and SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> cells appear phenotypically similar prior to infection, and both populations exhibited protrusions, filopodia and lamellipodia; however, SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> cells exhibited a small yet significant reduction in the numbers of filopodia per cell in non-infected cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g009">Fig 9A</xref></bold>, compare WT and SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> in ‘NI’ cells). During infection, there was a modest increase in overall filopodia numbers per cell in the WT background, while this was not observed in the SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> cells, and the reduction in filopodia numbers per cell compared to the WT was greatly reduced (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g009">Fig 9A</xref></bold>, compare WT and SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> cells during infection ‘I’). This is likely to be an oversimplification however, due to the limitations of confocal microscopy to analyse filopodia on the cell surface, and additional information about the cell surface structures during infection would likely be visible using higher resolution microscopy techniques. When both populations were infected with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> LGV2 and the resulting actin structures compared 30 minutes post infection, the number of bacteria in contact with filopodia decreased by &gt; 50% in the SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> background, whereas the number of EBs in association with cup, tail, or ring-like structures were not significantly different (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, sedimentation</bold>). As filopodial capture is an early event, we investigated whether this effect occurred only when EBs were artificially sedimented onto the HAP1 cells, by comparing the phenotypes when cells were infected by co-incubation with a population of cells from which bacteria are actively egressing, previously developed for electron tomography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref017">17</xref>]. This natural infection captures all the progressive processes that occur during cell entry, rather than experimentally imposing synchronous contact between EBs and the host cell plasma membrane by sedimentation. When wild type and SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> HAP1 cells were infected in this more natural way, fewer EBs were again observed in contact with filopodia in the SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> relative to the WT cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, egress</bold>). Moreover, entry was strikingly reduced by 59 ± 8% in the SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g009">Fig 9C</xref></bold>), compared to the 25 ± 9% reduction following sedimentation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g008">Fig 8B</xref></bold>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that SNX9 is required for early filopodia formation during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry, an effect that can be partially compensated by artificial sedimentation of the bacteria into contact with the host cells.</p>

<title>Filopodial capture is significantly attenuated in SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> cells.</title>
<p>(A) Non-infected HAP1 WT and SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> cells have similar F-actin organisation and filopodia number. Cultured HAP1 WT and SNX9 <sup>-/-</sup> cells were fixed and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin to visualise F-actin. Scale bars, 10 μm. The number of filopodia per cell was quantified in maximum projections of confocal xy sections with the criteria that the cells quantified has at least three ‘edges’ not adherent to a neighbouring cell, and that filopodial projections were ≥1 μm in length. 15 cells were assessed for WT and SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> cells and the results are expressed as the average ±SD (n = 3). P-values obtained from Student's unpaired two-tailed t-test, * P&lt;0.05. (B) The numbers of EBs in association with filopodia during entry is decreased in the HAP1 SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> cells after infection by sedimentation or egress. Cultured HAP1 WT and SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> cells were infected with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomati</italic>s LGV2 for 2h. At 2 h post-infection cells fixed with 1% PFA and stained with an anti-<italic>Chlamydia</italic> primary antibody and an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells were permeablised and stained again using anti-<italic>Chlamydia</italic> primary antibody and an Alexa Fluor 633-conjugated secondary antibody. Intracellular bacteria were labelled with only one fluorophore (Alexa Fluor 633). Extracellular EBs in association with filopodia, ring, cup/tail, or other F-actin structures were scored, and expressed as the relative percentage of EBs in association with each structure ±SD for ≥150 cell-associated bacteria (n = 3). P-values obtained from Student's unpaired two-tailed t-test,* P&lt;0.05, ‘ns’ not significant. Data from one representative experiment is shown for egress as infection is asynchronous therefore it is inappropriate to cross-compare data from individual experiment for statistical analysis. Scale bars, 10 μm. (C) Entry efficiency is decreased in the SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> cells. Cultured HAP1 WT and SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> cells were infected by egress with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomati</italic>s LGV2. At 2 h post-infection the cells fixed with 1% PFA and stained as in ‘(B)’. Representative images are maximum projections of confocal xy sections. Scale bars, 10 μm.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we aimed to further understand the pathways exploited by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> to enter eukaryotic host cells. We demonstrated that during internalisation, distinct F-actin structures interact with cell-associated EBs, including an initial contact between EBs and filopodia, and bacterial association with more complex F-actin cup, tail and ruffle structures. In addition to the recognised roles of the Rac1 GTPase and its associated NPF WAVE, we have revealed an additional unrecognised pathway sharing key hallmarks of macropinocytosis: i) amiloride sensitivity, ii) fluid-phase uptake, iii) recruitment and activity of the NPF N-WASP, iv) the localised generation of phosphoinositide-3-phosphate (PI3P) species and v) involvement of the SNX-PX-BAR protein SNX9 in early filopodial capture.</p>
<p>Macropinocytosis-like pathways underlie cell entry by diverse viruses, including HIV, Vaccinia, Adenovirus, Ebola, Influenza A and the Herpes Simplex Virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref075">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref079">79</xref>]. Indeed, <italic>Chlamydiae</italic> were originally described as a virus due to the absolute requirement of the host cell for survival, yet in many ways <italic>Chlamydiae</italic> remain atypical bacteria, particularly as EBs do not exclusively utilise either zipper or trigger mechanisms of entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref001">1</xref>], and for bacteria they are relatively small. In this study we extend viral parallels to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry. We have shown that filopodia associations with EBs occur at a high frequency during invasion in a process reminiscent of the filopodia-mediated capture of viruses, including Vesicular Stomatitis Virus, Murine Leukaemia Virus and HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref080">80</xref>]. In this process, viral particles associate with and either ‘surf’ along or induce filopodial retraction towards the cell body where they are internalised at endocytic ‘hot spots’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref024">24</xref>]. In the context of our data which show a decrease in EB association with filopodia over time, filopodial capture is likely the initial point of contact for EBs and may explain the distinct orientation of the T3SS towards the cell during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref017">17</xref>], likely facilitating interaction of EBs with the surface of microvilli-dense cells of mucosal membranes they preferentially infect. Indeed, many viruses follow this filopodia-mediated capture with membrane ruffling and uptake via macropinocytosis, furthering similarities between EB and viral uptake. The involvement of a macropinocytosis-like pathway in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry is supported by several observations: requirement for Rho GTPases, sensitivity to EIPA, coincidence of EBs and a fluid phase marker during entry, dynamin independence and the association of EBs with PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI3P during early entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref056">56</xref>]. We have also shown a requirement for N-WASP activity during chlamydial entry, suggestive of N-WASP involvement in F-actin rearrangements during internalisation, including filopodia formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref035">35</xref>]. Furthermore, while Cdc42 does not have a major role in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref038">38</xref>]; this study), there is a limited, although significant reduction in entry upon Cdc42 inhibition. Co-activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 is central to membrane ruffling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref081">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref082">82</xref>] and macropinocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref083">83</xref>], so the coordinated inter-dependent action of Rac1 and Cdc42 would not be unexpected in membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis-like uptake of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic>, especially as a similar pathway underlies <italic>C</italic>. <italic>caviae</italic> entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref084">84</xref>]. Indeed, our data suggest that there was no specific preference of Rac1-, Cdc42, N-WASP or PIR121 (WAVE) GFP reporter fusions for particular EB-associated F-actin superstructures. Further careful investigation of endogenous regulators is now required, as this either reflects a limitation induced by the expression of the reporters or implies functional redundancy.</p>
<p>Further similarities remain to be assessed, such as whether PAK1/2, myosin II, and CtBP1 are involved in entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref085">85</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref088">88</xref>], yet <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-specific adaptations would not be unexpected. Typical macropinocytic ruffles are much larger and differences in signalling requirements during macropinocytic uptake of smaller-sized cargoes have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref087">87</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref089">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref090">90</xref>]. Indeed, despite the clear association of EBs with 3-phosphoinositide species, paradoxically <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry is largely PI3K-independent. However, this is not without precedent, as for example the association of <italic>Salmonella</italic> with PI(3,4,5)P3-rich membrane ruffles is PI3K-independent, and mediated by as yet unknown mechanisms involving the inositol phosphatase mimic SopB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref058">58</xref>].</p>
<p>As expected, cytochalasin D and latrunculin B significantly inhibited inclusion formation and <italic>Salmonella</italic> entry in our hands. However, phalloidin staining revealed F-actin patches accumulated beneath cell-associated EBs, which were reported as internalised by the ‘inside-outside’ assay despite the presence of the inhibitors. Both the F-actin accumulation and this apparent internalisation were unexpected. The latter may merely reflect a difference in antibody accessibility under these conditions, but the accumulation of F-actin may indicate that effector-mediated actin polymerisation might locally limit the effect of actin depolymerising agents. This is not without precedent, as a similar phenomenon was observed after cells infected by <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> were treated with cytochalasin D, where stabilised F-actin patches were similarly evident beneath adherent bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref091">91</xref>], and even during bead uptake by phagocytes treated with cytochalasin B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref092">92</xref>]. Cytochalasin D may therefore not prevent F-actin accumulation, despite inhibiting actin-dependent processes. As with PI3K- and myosin X-dependent processes, the efficiency of drug-mediated inhibition of actin polymerisation may be dependent on particle size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref089">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref090">90</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref093">93</xref>], and consequently the short dense F-actin present beneath ~400 nm diameter EBs represent relatively poor targets. Despite the ‘dogma’ of cytochalasin D-mediated inhibition of pathogen entry, conflicting effects have been reported for <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. Ward and Murray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref094">94</xref>] reported only a 50% reduction in chlamydial entry into cytochalasin D-treated cells, whereas Carabeo and colleagues later reported a 41-fold reduction in entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref002">2</xref>]. However, entry of related <italic>C</italic>. <italic>psitacci</italic> was only decreased by 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref095">95</xref>]. As TARP-mediated actin polymerisation can occur both directly and via Rac1-dependent pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref011">11</xref>], these redundant mechanisms may be differentially susceptible to inhibitors in different strains and target cells. It is clear that the mechanisms by which a small bacterium like <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> triggers host actin polymerisation now demands further investigation.</p>
<p>We reveal a functional relationship between EB internalisation and PX-BAR-domain containing protein SNX9, which mediates F-actin rearrangements during the early entry process. Indeed, global increases in filopodia formation during infection (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g009">Fig 9A</xref></bold>), similar to those observed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref002">2</xref>], as well as specific association between <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> EBs and filopodia (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g009">Fig 9B</xref></bold>), are decreased in the SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> cells. How SNX9 is facilitating this process remains an open question, yet one attractive hypothesis is that SNX9 acts as a scaffold for the recruitment and activation of N-WASP to bring about filopodia formation, membrane ruffling and macropinocytic uptake of the EB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref096">96</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref097">97</xref>]. SNX9 interaction with factors important for filopodia formation have been previously identified, and include N-WASP and Arp2/3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref073">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref096">96</xref>]. A more recent study also described a direct interaction between Cdc42 and SNX9 and intriguingly linked SNX9 expression to increased filopodia formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref074">74</xref>], suggesting our observation that initial filopodial capture of EBs is impaired in SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> cells is a direct consequence of impaired F-actin rearrangements (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007051.g010">Fig 10</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>SNX9 knockout decreases <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> entry and influences filopodial association early during host F-actin reorganisation.</title>
<p>Schematic depicting the entry defects associated with entry into SNX9<sup>-/-</sup> cells. When bacteria are sedimented onto cells there is a 25 ±9% decrease in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> internalisation, whereas when cells are infected via egress 59 ±8% fewer EBs are internalised. Both methods of infection involve fewer EBs in contact with filopodia. We propose it is this filopodia defect which results in a discrepancy in entry efficiency by the two different methods of infection. This seems likely as filopodial capture would result in more efficient infection when cells are exposed to EBs from infected cells by egress, yet would have less impact on efficiency when cells are infected by sedimentation, consequently partially compensating for SNX9 loss.</p>

<p>Similar to the effect of SNX9 depletion on <italic>Salmonella</italic> invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref058">58</xref>], in our study SNX9 knockdown or knockout did not abrogate entry completely. As some SNX-PX-BAR proteins are reported to have redundant roles, for instance SNX18 can compensate for SNX9 deficiency in CME, which may in part arise from the ability of SNX-PX-BAR family proteins to form heterodimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref098">98</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref099">99</xref>], there may be compensatory effects during entry into these SNX9 depleted cells that might also allow chlamydial entry to proceed.</p>
<p>SNX9 is recognised not only for coordination of membrane remodelling, but also as a scaffold to integrate F-actin reorganisation, endocytic traffic and Rho GTPase activity to fulfill roles in both cellular homeostasis and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref074">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref100">100</xref>]. Consequently, SNX9 is an attractive candidate for hijack by opportunistic bacterial pathogens. SNX9 has been implicated in both the entry and infection of <italic>Salmonella</italic> and pedestal formation by EPEC and related EHEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref068">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref069">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref101">101</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref102">102</xref>]. These pathogens utilise T3SS effectors to subvert SNX9 activity, for example during <italic>Salmonella</italic> invasion localised SopB-mediated increases in PI(3,4)P2 recruit SNX9 to membranes to facilitate ruffling and N-WASP signalling. In this process, comparable decreases in <italic>Salmonella</italic> entry are observed when SNX9 is depleted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref101">101</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that a chlamydial effector interacts with SNX9 during cell entry, triggering oligomerisation of SNX9 to amplify SH3-domain mediated interactions akin to the signal amplification induced by EPEC/EHEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref068">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref069">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref102">102</xref>]. Whether or not SNX9 is recruited to membranes through an association with a chlamydial T3SS effector remains to be established, but an additional possibility is that manipulation of phosphoinositides during entry temporally and spatially control SNX9 recruitment, similar to the indirect recruitment of SNX9 mediated by <italic>Salmonella</italic> SopB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref101">101</xref>]. To date no chlamydial entry effectors that directly interfere with phosphoinositide signalling have been have been identified, unlike in most other bacterial pathogens studied, for example phosphoinositide phosphatase mimics such as <italic>Salmonella</italic> SopB or <italic>Shigella</italic> IpgD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref103">103</xref>]. However, the T3SS effector TARP binds to the p85 subunit of PI3K, whereas the T3SS effector TepP can interact with both p85 and p110 PI3K subunits and contributes to PI3K activation on early inclusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref104">104</xref>]. These effects are intriguing given the apparent PI3K-independent PI3P and PI(3,4,5)P3 interaction with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> we observe during early entry and now warrant further investigation.</p>
<p>Chlamydial entry and early T3SS effectors are not well defined, a fact reinforced by the observation that only <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> TARP harbors the N-terminal repeat regions required for Rac1 activation, suggesting additional factors are required by other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref016">16</xref>]. In this study we identified roles for N-WASP and macropinocytosis during the internalisation of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> using a panel of small molecule inhibitors, in addition to the established roles of Rac1 and Arp2/3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref039">39</xref>]. This is in contrast to other studies which have implicated clathrin mediated endocytosis in EB uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref105">105</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref107">107</xref>]. However, consistent with the data presented here, including a lack of clathrin recruitment to chlamydial entry sites (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007051.s011">S11 Fig</xref></bold>), our detailed dissection of entry structures by cryo-EM never revealed an electron-dense clathrin coat present at chlamydial entry foci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Our data reveal new insights into the diversity of signalling underlying the entry of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>trachomatis</italic> into host cells. We revealed a key initial interaction between EBs and host cell filopodia mediated by the SNX-PX-BAR protein SNX9. This shares similarities with virus-like entry routes, and precedes a macropinocytosis-like pathway. Further studies of the underlying molecular mechanisms will reveal insights into the hijack of host cell function by this important obligate intracellular pathogen.</p>

<p>Cells were seeded at an appropriate density in 24-well plates containing 12 mm coverslips. 24 h later cells were infected as described above in infection media containing 1% serum and either TRITC-dextran at a concentration of 1 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> for 30 min or transferrin Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate at a concentration of 200 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> for 30 min. Following ligand uptake, the plates were incubated on ice and the medium was removed. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS and for 2 min in ice-cold stripping buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 100 mM glycine, 5 mM KCl and 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> at pH 4.5. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS prior to fixation in PFA. The total fluorescence of transferrin Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate within cell boundaries was corrected by background fluorescence in ImageJ. Mean transferrin fluorescence in arbitrary units was quantified in infected and non-infected cells. Dextran uptake was measured according to a modified version of the protocol reported by Wang and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007051.ref112">112</xref>]. Briefly, the 3D objects counter tool in ImageJ was used to quantify dextran uptake as 3D objects or puncta (macropinosomes) within z-stacks, using a minimum size filter of 0.2 μm2–20 μm<sup>2</sup> for specificity of macropinosome identification and to minimise background fluorescence.</p>

<title>The influence of cytochalasin D on <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> entry and F-actin distribution.</title>
<p>(A) RPE1 cells were pre-treated for 5 minutes with 2 μM cytochalasin D and infected with <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar typhimurium SL1344 in infection medium containing cytochalasin D. Infection was allowed to proceed for 1 h before cells were washed and further incubated for 1 h in gentamicin-containing cell culture medium. Cells were then lysed and serial dilutions of the resulting lysate were plated onto solid agar. The number of colonies recovered from cytochalasin D and mock-treated control cells was quantified. Results are expressed as a percentage relative to mock treated control ±SD (n = 3). (B) Non-infected RPE1 cells treated with cytochalasin D for 1 h at the indicated concentration. Cells were then fixed and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin to visualize F-actin.</p>
