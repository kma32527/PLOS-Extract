<abstract>
<p>Late gene transcription in herpesviruses is dependent on viral DNA replication <italic>in cis</italic> but the mechanistic basis for this linkage remains unknown. DNA replication results in demethylated DNA, topological changes, removal of proteins and recruitment of proteins to promoters. One or more of these effects of DNA replication may facilitate late gene transcription. Using 5-azacytidine to promote demethylation of DNA, we demonstrate that late gene transcription cannot be rescued by DNA demethylation. Late gene transcription precedes significant increases in DNA copy number, indicating that increased template numbers also do not contribute to the linkage between replication and late gene transcription. By using serial, timed blockade of DNA replication and measurement of late gene mRNA accumulation, we demonstrate that late gene transcription requires ongoing DNA replication. Consistent with these findings, blocking DNA replication led to dissolution of DNA replication complexes which also contain RNA polymerase II and BGLF4, an EBV protein required for transcription of several late genes. These data indicate that ongoing DNA replication maintains integrity of a replication-transcription complex which is required for recruitment and retention of factors necessary for late gene transcription.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Herpesviruses exhibit both latent and lytic replication cycles. Gammaherpesviruses such as Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and Epstein Barr virus undergo lytic replication when they reactivate from latency. During this process, when infectious virions are produced, an orderly cascade of gene expression occurs. Late lytic genes, which primarily encode structural components of the virion, are only transcribed after replication of the DNA genome has occurred. Unlike early lytic genes, late gene transcription is tightly linked to viral DNA replication; if viral DNA replication is blocked, late gene mRNA accumulation is severely inhibited. The mechanism by which late gene transcription is linked to DNA replication has remained elusive. In this paper we show that a process of continuous DNA replication is required. If one blocks DNA replication, further transcription also ceases, indicating that concurrent DNA replication is required to maintain late transcription. We also show that when DNA replication is blocked, the nuclear complexes in which herpesviruses are replicating dissociate. These replication complexes also serve as factories of viral transcription. When the complexes disperse, proteins required for transcription dissociate from the DNA replication machinery. These data indicate that ongoing DNA replication is necessary to maintain the physical and functional integrity of these structures. Our study provides new insight into this linkage that ensures coordination between viral replication and late gene expression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The human gammaherpesviruses Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) establish lifelong persistent infection in B lymphocytes and intermittently reactivate, producing infectious virions transmitted by the oral route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref002">2</xref>]. KSHV is associated with Kaposi’s sarcoma, Multicentric Castleman’s disease and primary effusion lymphoma, whereas EBV is linked to nasopharyngeal carcinoma and a variety of lymphoproliferative syndromes and lymphomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref002">2</xref>]. In common with all herpesviruses, both KSHV and EBV sequentially express immediate-early (IE), early (E) and late (L) genes during the lytic phase of replication. Immediate-early genes in the γ-herpesviruses encode transcriptional activators that initiate the lytic cycle and are necessary for virus reactivation from latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref003">3</xref>]. Many early gene products are required for lytic viral DNA replication, which is carried out by virus-encoded homologs of the cellular DNA replication machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref003">3</xref>]. Late genes encode the structural virion components that comprise capsid, tegument and glycoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref001">1</xref>]. In addition to these essential aspects of virion production, lytic gene products are increasingly recognized as contributing to tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref004">4</xref>]. Intermittent lytic replication and virion production may also contribute to maintenance of the latently infected reservoir in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref004">4</xref>]. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which sequential gene expression is controlled during the lytic phase of replication is therefore important for identifying molecules and pathways that can be therapeutically targeted.</p>
<p>Whereas expression of IE and E genes is unaffected by inhibition of DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref005">5</xref>], most EBV and KSHV late genes are strictly dependent on DNA replication from the lytic origin of replication, and inhibitors of viral DNA polymerase drastically inhibit late gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref007">7</xref>]. The basis for lytic DNA replication-dependent late gene expression has been a subject of investigation for many years but remains incompletely characterized. Whether DNA replication from an origin <italic>in cis</italic> to the late gene promoter is required for late gene transcription has been controversial. Two studies in EBV indicated that late promoter driven gene expression from plasmids could occur in the absence of plasmid DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref009">9</xref>]. However, several studies using plasmid reporters and late promoters have concluded that the presence of DNA replication <italic>in cis</italic> is necessary to allow efficient late gene expression in KSHV, MHV-68 and EBV although virally produced proteins acting <italic>in trans</italic> are also necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref013">13</xref>]. Similar conclusions were also drawn regarding HSV late gene expression from plasmids and from the viral genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Recent findings have revealed fundamental differences between late promoters and IE, E and cellular promoters in β and γ herpesviruses that provide a starting point for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of late genes in β and γ herpesviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref021">21</xref>]. KSHV, EBV, murine gammaherpesvirus 68 and human cytomegalovirus all express a complex of six proteins which form a viral pre-initiation complex (vPIC) specific for late gene promoters and which are essential for late promoter function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref021">21</xref>]. Homologous genes have also been identified in human HHV6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref022">22</xref>]. One of the proteins in the EBV vPIC, the BcRF1 gene product, functionally substitutes for TBP and binds to atypical TATT boxes in late promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref018">18</xref>]. The vPIC has been demonstrated to bind RNAP at late promoters at which the vPIC forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref018">18</xref>]. A recent elegant study used recombinant EBV bacmids to demonstrate that each of the six components is individually required for late gene expression but do not affect DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref023">23</xref>]. Further, this study confirmed that late gene expression from the EBV genome requires DNA replication <italic>in cis</italic>. Thus, it appears that the unique virus-specified late gene transcriptional machinery is dependent on DNA replication of the template on which the late gene promoter resides.</p>
<p>Despite the discovery of the specific vPIC involved in β and γ herpesvirus late gene expression, the basis of its unique dependence on DNA replication <italic>in cis</italic> remains to be explained. Several possible mechanisms, which are not mutually exclusive, may be considered. First, late gene transcription may require chromatin modifications that occur concurrent with lytic genome replication, such as removal of methylation marks and histone occupancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref025">25</xref>]. The “naked” chromatin of newly replicated genomes may thereby allow more efficient access of the vPIC to late gene promoters. Alternatively, the translocating DNA replication complex may bring or recruit factors or components of the vPIC required for late gene transcription to the relevant promoters. Third, the physical localization of replicating genomes may facilitate or be required for co-localization of transcription factors needed for late gene transcription. For example, EBV lytic DNA replication occurs at discrete sites, called replication compartments, in which viral transcription also takes place. These include domains designated BMRF1 cores, in which newly synthesized viral DNA genomes are organized around and then stored inside cores composed of BMRF1, the DNA polymerase processivity factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref026">26</xref>]. It has also recently been shown that KSHV assembles an "all-in one" factory for both gene transcription and DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref027">27</xref>]. Finally, DNA replication increases template copy number and may contribute to late transcript abundance. In this study, we have investigated the involvement of several of these possible mechanisms, including demethylation, template abundance and the role of ongoing DNA replication and replication compartment formation. Our findings suggest that demethylation and template abundance are not significant factors in the linkage between late gene expression and DNA replication in KSHV and EBV. However, continuous, ongoing DNA replication appears to be necessary for late gene expression and maintenance of replication compartments.</p>

<title>DNA demethylation enhances early and late gene expression but cannot rescue late gene expression when DNA replication is inhibited</title>
<p>Early experiments demonstrated that promoter hypomethylation correlated with transcriptional activity of EBV lytic genes but that demethylation alone was insufficient to induce lytic gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref029">29</xref>]. It is also known that DNA hypomethylation occurs during lytic replication and that both EBV and KSHV virion DNA are essentially devoid of DNA methylation and histones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref029">29</xref>]. It was therefore possible that DNA hypomethylation that occurs coincident with lytic replication and production of linear DNA templates might be required for efficient transcription of late genes. In order to determine whether demethylation of KSHV latent DNA could rescue late gene transcription when DNA replication was blocked, we used the demethylase inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-Aza) in combination with phosphonoacetate (PAA) a selective inhibitor of herpesvirus DNA polymerases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref030">30</xref>]. BAC16/iSLK cells are epithelial cells that inducibly express RTA (ORF50) upon treatment with doxycycline and stably carry the eGFP-expressing JSC-1 KSHV bacmid BAC16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref032">32</xref>]. RTA expression is necessary and sufficient to induce lytic KSHV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref033">33</xref>], and treatment of BAC16/iSLK with doxycycline leads to highly efficient induction of the KSHV lytic cycle and production of infectious KSHV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref019">19</xref>]. BAC 16/iSLK cells were cultivated in media supplemented with 2μM 5-Aza for two days to demethylate DNA before induction of lytic replication. Lytic viral replication was induced with doxycycline and DNA replication was simultaneously inhibited with PAA. Two days post induction, RNA and DNA were harvested and qPCR was performed to quantitate individual gene expression and viral genome copy number. As expected, RNA transcription of early genes (ORF6 and ORF57) was highly induced by doxycycline but was unaffected by PAA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). There was a further increase when iSLK cells were treated with 5-Aza, indicating that methylation inhibits early gene promoter activity. Demethylation also upregulated expression of late genes, (ORF25, ORF26 and K8.1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). However, consistent with the dependence of late gene transcription on DNA replication, PAA completely inhibited transcription of K8.1, ORF25 and ORF26. Importantly, even when viral genomes were demethylated by 5-Aza, transcription was strongly inhibited by PAA, demonstrating that removal of methylation is not the reason that DNA replication is required for late lytic gene transcription.</p>

<p>In order to determine whether the dependence of late gene transcription on DNA replication was similarly independent of the methylation status of template DNA during EBV replication, we repeated the same experiment in AGSiZ cells. AGSiZ is an EBV bacmid infected gastric carcinoma-derived cell line in which a doxycycline-inducible EBV transactivator Zta has been stably introduced by lentivirus transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref034">34</xref>]. As expected, EBV early genes (BMRF1 and SM) were highly expressed without being inhibited by PAA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) and a further increase in BMRF1 and SM mRNA levels was observed upon treatment with 5-Aza. Expression of late genes (BDLF1, BcLF1 and BCRF1) was highly inhibited by PAA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). However, demethylation did not affect the dependence of late gene transcription on DNA replication as PAA was equally effective in inhibiting late gene expression despite the presence of 5-Aza. These data therefore indicate that DNA demethylation occurring during DNA replication is not the basis of the linkage between late transcription and genome replication in either KSHV or EBV.</p>
<p>We confirmed that PAA had effectively inhibited KSHV and EBV lytic replication by measuring the KSHV and EBV copy number in cells used for the above experiment. Increases in intracellular EBV and KSHV DNA are maximal by 4–5 days post induction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>, PAA completely blocked the increase in KSHV and EBV genome copy number seen 5 days after induction of lytic replication.</p>

<title>Late gene transcription is not due to amplification of viral DNA genomes and increased template number</title>
<p>Another possible basis for replication dependent late gene transcription is the increase in template number that occurs with lytic DNA replication. To ask whether there was a significant increase in KSHV template number at 48 hours when 500–1,000-fold increases in late transcript abundance were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g001">Fig 1</xref>), we measured KSHV DNA copy number at 48 hours after induction. KSHV genome copy number was measured by qPCR of DNA extracted from the same cells that were used for measurement of mRNA transcript levels. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, DNA copy number had only increased by 20% at 48 hours, in the absence of PAA, demonstrating that the large increases in late gene transcript levels precede those in DNA copy number. Increased KSHV template numbers are therefore unlikely to play a role in replication dependent increases in KSHV late gene transcription. When similar measurements were performed to measure EBV copy numbers in AGSiZ cells, the kinetics were different, EBV replication occurring somewhat earlier, with increases in copy number at 48 hr (approximately 7-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). We therefore repeated the experiment in AGSiZ cells and harvested cells for RNA and DNA 24 hr post induction to determine whether late gene transcription could be demonstrated to precede increases in genome copy number. Although as expected, late gene transcription was not as pronounced as at 48 hr, all patterns at 24 hr were similar to those observed at 48 hr: Early gene transcription was insensitive to PAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) and 5-Aza treatment did not rescue late gene transcription when DNA replication was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). At this time point, DNA copy number however, had not increased more than 10% from levels prior to induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Therefore, increases in template numbers did not play a role in replication dependent stimulation of EBV or KSHV late gene transcription.</p>

<title>5-Aza demethylates both cell and viral genome DNA</title>
<p>Although the increases in both early and late gene transcription seen with 5-Aza were consistent with promoter demethylation, we performed direct analyses to confirm CpG demethylation by 5-Aza. We analyzed a known methylated region in the cellular genome (LINE-1, L1-PKP4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref035">35</xref>]) by COBRA (combined bisulfite restriction analysis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g003">Fig 3</xref>). DNA was amplified with primers specific for bisulfite converted DNA (in which unmethylated, but not methylated C, is converted to T) and then digested with TaqI. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>, specific amplification in bisulfite treated samples yielded a 392 bp PCR product, but not in bisulfite untreated samples from iSLK and AGSiZ cells. Bisulfite treatment is predicted to create 3 TaqI cut sites (TCGA) in the PKP4 PCR product, but only from methylated CCGAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, left panel). Bisulfite-treated PCR products demonstrated almost complete TaqI cleavage, confirming the methylated status of the amplified region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>, lanes 9 and 10). In 5-Aza-treated samples, analysis of the PCR products revealed a mixture of partially cleaved and un-cleaved bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>, lanes 11 and 12). These data therefore demonstrate that 5-Aza led to CpG demethylation and prevented production of TaqI sites from methylated CCGA sites.</p>

Bisulfite-converted PCR products from doxycycline-induced (+D) or mock induced (-D) iSLK samples with or without 5-Aza treatment are shown in lanes 5–8, respectively. The amplicon size is 392bp. After digestion of samples with TaqI, 5-Aza untreated samples are almost fully digested to a 211 bp fragment with a minor partial cleavage product at 291 bp (lanes 9, 10). After 5-Aza treatment, TaqI digestion is inhibited due to conversion of unmethylated CCGA to TTGA, and multiple partially cleaved 211 bp, 291 bp, 321 bp and uncleaved (392bp) products are produced (lanes 11, 12).

<p>In addition to demethylation of cellular DNA, we wished to confirm that viral genomes were also demethylated by 5-Aza. The methylation status of the ORF33 promoter in KSHV genome, which has been previously demonstrated to be methylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref025">25</xref>], was therefore assessed by pyrosequencing. Five CpG sites in the ORF33 promoter showed changes in the level of methylation upon 5-Aza treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007070.t001">Table 1</xref>). At 2 days post induction of lytic replication (4 days after 5-Aza treatment), the average percentage change of methylation had decreased in all 5-Aza treated samples. Lytic replication led to demethylation (15.7% change) and when lytic replication was blocked by PAA there was no change in methylation. However, 5-Aza treatment in the presence of PAA led to a degree of demethylation similar to that of lytic replication (15.7% change). This experiment demonstrated that the KSHV viral genome DNA was demethylated by 5-Aza treatment, consistent with its observed effects on gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

<title>KSHV and EBV late gene transcription depend on ongoing DNA replication</title>
<p>Since neither removal of DNA methylation nor increasing template number appeared to be the reason for the linkage of late gene expression to DNA replication, we considered the possibility that DNA replication removed other protein factors from latent episomes that are chromatinized during latency. If such a mechanism were involved, initiation of DNA replication could be sufficient to enable late gene transcription. Alternatively, if DNA replication were required to bring proteins required for late gene transcription to the late gene promoters, or were necessary to maintain a replication factory with the requisite transcription factors, continuing (ongoing) DNA replication would be necessary to maintain late gene transcription. To distinguish between these alternatives, we performed the following experiment to assess the effect of blocking DNA replication at various times after induction of lytic replication. We induced lytic KSHV replication in iSLK cells and added PAA at 0 hr, 12 hr, 24hr, 36hr post-induction, and then harvested RNA at 48 hr post induction. At each time point when we add PAA, we also harvested untreated cells in parallel to compare the temporal pattern of RNA accumulation. The results showed that KSHV late gene (ORF25 and ORF26) accumulation at 48 hr was inhibited compared to no PAA treatment when we added PAA at any time after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>]. On the other hand, early gene (ORF59 and ORF57) accumulation did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). These data suggest that KSHV late gene expression requires ongoing DNA replication to maintain transcription. If initiation of DNA replication merely established a permissive condition for late gene transcription, accumulation should continue to increase even after PAA was added. We then further extended the time course to 96 hr post-induction and added PAA up to 72 hours post-induction to maximize the opportunity for genomes potentially licensed by DNA replication to transcribe late genes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>, late gene RNA accumulation at 96 hr was still inhibited when we added PAA at any time point compared to no PAA treatment. Addition of PAA at any time point essentially led to cessation of further RNA accumulation. These results demonstrated that continued KSHV late gene mRNA accumulation requires maintaining ongoing viral DNA replication.</p>

<title>Inhibition of DNA replication causes dissolution of the EBV replication/transcription compartment</title>
<p>A potential explanation for the dependence of late gene transcription on continued DNA replication is that the process of lytic replication, which involves formation of nuclear replication factories, that include recruited transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref026">26</xref>], is essential for maintenance of the transcriptional milieu required for late gene transcription. We therefore wished to ask whether inhibiting DNA replication could affect the maintenance of EBV replication factories. The EBV DNA polymerase processivity factor BMRF1 (EA) concentrates in EBV replication factories and serves as a marker of these compartments in immunofluorescence studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref036">36</xref>]. Identification and visualization of these nuclear replication compartments is easily performed in EBV infected 293 cells by staining for BMRF1. We first performed preliminary experiments in which we followed the formation of the replication compartments after induction of lytic replication. We induced EBV replication in EBV-infected 293 cells by transfection of lytic activator Zta expression plasmid. We then fixed and stained the cells with anti-BMRF1 antibody at various times post-induction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g006">Fig 6</xref>, formation of replication factories is clearly evident by 24 hr post-induction, and continues through 96 hr. Consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref026">26</xref>], concentration and co-localization of RNA pol II in these nuclear replication foci is also evident (but not in cells in which EBV replication was not induced). We then asked what would happen to these replication compartments if DNA replication were blocked after they had been allowed to form. We added PAA after the formation of replication complexes, at 24 hr and 48 hr post replication induction, and stained the cells at 96 hr. Addition of PAA at either time point led to loss of the large, discrete foci typical of cells in which DNA replication was not blocked. Rather, BMRF1 became dispersed throughout the nucleus in fine speckles. RNA pol II remained associated with these residual speckles, also assuming a diffuse nuclear distribution. These data suggest that continuing DNA replication is required to maintain a nuclear replication/transcription factory.</p>

Fixed cells were stained for RNA Pol II (Red) and BMRF1 (Green) to visualize the formation of replication compartments.

<p>In order to confirm the observations shown above, we measured the changes in replication complex structure by counting the percentage of cells that contained the large clusters and smaller clusters (spots) versus the fine speckles more commonly seen after PAA treatment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, the number of cells with clearly formed larger replication foci (spots/clusters) increased over time with over 65% of BMRF1-positive cells containing such complexes. However, when PAA was added at 24 or 48 hr, by 96 hr, the number of cells with large foci had decreased to 29% and 38% respectively.

AGSiZ/EBV cells were induced to permit EBV replication and the replication inhibitor was added either 24 or 48 hr later and cells were fixed at 96 hr post-induction. Cells untreated with either drug were induced and fixed at 96 hr post induction exactly as performed previously with PAA. Fixed cells were then stained with anti-BMRF1 and anti-RNAP antibodies and examined by fluorescence microscopy. The results, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g008">Fig 8</xref>, confirm that inhibiting EBV DNA replication with either ganciclovir or acyclovir leads to loss of replication complex integrity. As with PAA, RNA pol II appears to maintain association with BMRF1 in the finer speckles resulting from blocking DNA replication.</p>

<title>Inhibition of DNA replication leads to dissociation of an EBV protein required for late gene transcription from replication factories</title>
<p>Disintegration of replication complexes upon blockade of DNA replication suggested that complex integrity might be necessary for recruitment of transcription factors. Since RNA pol II appeared to remain associated with BMRF1 even after complex dispersal, we wished to ask whether inhibition of DNA replication might lead to loss of other factors needed for late gene transcription. BGLF4, an EBV encoded kinase with multiple functions in viral packaging and egress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref038">38</xref>], has also recently been shown to be essential for transcription of several late genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref039">39</xref>] and to be present in replication complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref040">40</xref>]. We therefore examined the location of BGLF4 after inducing EBV replication and after inhibiting DNA replication. In cells undergoing replication, BMRF1 was localized in mostly large structures. BGLF4 was found in these structures as well, although the co-localization with BMRF1 was not 100%. Whereas the majority of BMRF1 complexes contained BGLF4, nuclear foci of BGLF4 without BMRF1 were also present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g009">Fig 9</xref>, 48h + Z). After treatment with PAA, the BMRF1 foci exhibited dispersal as expected. In addition, BGLF4 was no longer highly co-localized with BMRF1. In order to quantify and confirm this effect, we counted nuclei that were BMRF1 positive and categorized the nuclei as either co-localized or not co-localized. Cells where greater than 75% of the BMRF1 foci also contained BGLF4 were counted as co-localized and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g010">Fig 10</xref>). The number of cells exhibiting co-localization decreased significantly after PAA treatment. These data indicate that when the replication factories undergo dispersal, there is a concomitant loss of BGLF4 recruitment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have investigated the factors that link late gene transcription to lytic DNA replication in the γ herpesviruses EBV and KSHV. We have shown the DNA demethylation that occurs consequent to lytic replication of KSHV and EBV genome by viral DNA polymerases is unlikely to be the mechanism by which late gene transcription is linked to DNA replication <italic>in cis</italic>. Increases in late gene expression also preceded increases in DNA template copy number, confirming that template amplification does not contribute significantly to late transcript accumulation. Temporal analysis of the relationship between DNA replication blockade and late mRNA accumulation indicated that KSHV and EBV late gene expression require ongoing DNA replication. Further, RNA pol II and the EBV kinase BGLF4 colocalized with DNA polymerase processivity factor in EBV replication factories and blockade of DNA replication led to loss of replication compartment integrity.</p>
<p>DNA methylation has an important regulatory role in gene expression during the KSHV and EBV life cycle. The EBV and KSHV genomes are highly methylated during latency, and become hypomethylated or unmethylated during lytic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref041">41</xref>]. Unlike cellular DNA or latent herpesvirus genomes, newly produced herpesviral genomes are not remethylated after lytic replication, and virion DNA is unmethylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref044">44</xref>]. DNA demethylation has been shown to upregulate viral gene expression and induce EBV and KSHV lytic replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref045">45</xref>]. Thus, it was plausible that replication-dependent demethylation was required for late gene promoter activity. We found that viral DNA demethylation by 5-Aza treatment potentiated both EBV and KSHV early and late lytic gene expression (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g004">4D</xref>). Although demethylation increased both early and late lytic promoter activity, it could not rescue late gene transcription from DNA replication blockade. These data therefore indicate that removal of CpG promoter methylation is not the mechanism of late gene expression dependence on DNA replication.</p>
<p>Previous studies using plasmids with lytic herpesviral origins and late gene promoters have suggested that increases in DNA template number are not required to support late gene expression <italic>in cis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref011">11</xref>]. In order to confirm these findings in the context of entire viral genomes, we measured the viral DNA content of lytically induced KSHV and EBV infected cells over time and compared it to the temporal accumulation of late gene transcripts. The increase in transcript levels occurred prior to increases in DNA copy number, confirming that replication induced template abundance does not play a significant role in enhancing late gene transcription. Thus, DNA replication has an effect on late gene transcription very early after it begins and before template number is significantly increased.</p>
<p>It therefore appeared that late gene transcription occurs from newly replicated genomes, and some property of the newly replicated DNA makes it supportive of late gene transcription. Two alternative models for the permissiveness of nascent herpesvirus genomes can be envisioned with slightly different implications. First, a topological or steric property of newly replicated DNA allows access of the late gene vPIC and the RNA polymerase to the relevant promoters. Such a mechanism would suggest that once a linear or partly linear, non-supercoiled genome were produced, it would be permissive for continued late gene transcription, and subsequent blockade of DNA replication would not shut off persistent late gene expression from the “licensed” genomes. Alternatively, a mechanism that requires continuing operation of the DNA polymerase might be required. The DNA polymerase or associated factors might bring or recruit essential transcription cofactors to the late gene promoters as has been demonstrated to occur during replication of bacteriophage T4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref046">46</xref>]. A recent report of interaction between ORF59, the KSHV DNA polymerase processivity factor and RNA pol II make this an attractive hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref047">47</xref>]. In this alternative scenario, blocking DNA replication at any point would strongly inhibit, if not curtail, further late gene expression as continued delivery of proteins essential for transcription would cease. A related model is one in which the replication factory: a complex of the vPIC, late gene transcription factors, RNAP, the replicating genome and DNA polymerase, requires ongoing DNA replication to be maintained. Finally, if linear genomes enter a non-permissive state for late gene transcription shortly after replication, either by temporary chromatinization or encapsidation, continued production of new templates would be required.</p>
<p>We first asked whether DNA replication licensed templates for continued late gene transcription, that is, whether stopping DNA replication would still allow late gene transcription from linear genomes that had previously been synthesized. We inhibited DNA replication at various times after induction of lytic transcription, and either harvested RNA or allowed potential transcription to proceed and measured RNA accumulation at the end of a fixed period allowed for transcription. A similar analysis of HSV late gene transcription concluded that continued DNA replication was not required for additional synthesis of late gene mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref048">48</xref>]. However, in the case of both KSHV and EBV, we found that inhibiting DNA replication essentially led to a cessation of further RNA accumulation beyond that point.</p>
<p>Thus, it appears that in the absence of continuing DNA replication, the newly replicated genomes do not remain competent for transcription. Possible explanations for this phenomenon stem from the basic concept that changes occur to the nascent genomes shortly after their production that render them no longer accessible for transcription. One mechanism by which this could occur is the deposition of proteins on linear genomes that prevent further transcription unless removed by additional rounds of replication as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g011">Fig 11A</xref>. While it is generally accepted that herpes virus genomes prior to packaging are devoid of histones or other chromatin marks, it is possible that linear genomes undergo a period of rechromatinization prior to the removal of histones upon encapsidation. However, histones have been reported to be excluded from EBV replication factories during late stages of lytic replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref049">49</xref>]. Similarly, a recent report shows that newly replicated KSHV genomes do not associate with histones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref050">50</xref>]. Thus, we consider this model less likely as an explanation of DNA replication and late transcription linkage. Nevertheless, it remains possible that other proteins may bind to the newly replicated genomes after synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref050">50</xref>], and such proteins may prevent continued access of the late gene transcription complex to the DNA.</p>

<title>Models for the dependence of late gene transcription on continuing DNA replication.</title>
<p>A. Newly replicated linear herpesvirus genomes are shown being bound by DNA binding proteins shortly after production, rendering them inaccessible for the late gene transcription complex. Histones bound to latent genomes prior to lytic transcription are depicted in light blue. Only newly replicated genomes devoid of protein are shown being transcribed. B. Replicated genomes are shown being encapsidated, preventing further transcription which only occurs from newly produced genomes. C. The translocating DNA polymerase complex is shown bringing a component of the vPIC to a late gene promoter. BMRF1 is shown as the protein performing this function by analogy to T4 replication, but the process may be performed by any component of the DNA polymerase machinery, and one or more proteins required for late gene transcription may be involved. D. The replication/transcription factory is shown undergoing dissolution when the process of DNA replication is blocked, with a loss of physical integrity and dispersion of the locally concentrated replication proteins, DNA template and RNA transcription factors. Some of the interacting proteins are shown as maintaining association in the dispersed particles.</p>

</fig>
<p>An alternative model is that topological changes in the newly replicated genomes allow access to late gene transcription complexes. There may be a limited period of time shortly after synthesis when the linear genomes sterically allow access of the RNA polymerase complex but then assume conformations, perhaps due to encapsidation, that render them no longer accessible to the RNA polymerase machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g011">Fig 11B</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, replication may also be necessary to continually bring or recruit factors necessary for late gene transcription to the late gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g011">Fig 11C</xref>). A distinct, although not mutually exclusive, mechanism is suggested by our finding that there is a physical dissolution of the replication complexes upon cessation of EBV DNA replication. The process of ongoing DNA replication thus seems to be required to maintain the integrity of the replication factory. Consistent with previous findings, we have shown that RNA pol II co-localizes with BMRF1 during EBV lytic replication in large nuclear structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref026">26</xref>]. The late gene vPIC complex is recruited to noncanonical TATT boxes of true late gene promoters; components of the vPIC have been shown to interact with RNA polymerase II; and late gene mRNAs localize to the inner cores of replication factories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref051">51</xref>]. BGLF4, which is required for transcription of late genes encoding structural proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref039">39</xref>], also is found in the replication complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007070.ref052">52</xref>]. The fact that these replication/transcription factories, in which late lytic gene transcription and DNA replication occur, undergo breakdown when DNA replication stops, suggests that a functioning complex of DNA polymerase and viral genome is required to maintain the physical and functional integrity of the structure. When DNA replication stops, the replication/transcription factory begins to disintegrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007070.g011">Fig 11D</xref>). It appears that while some association of DNA replication proteins with transcription machinery, such as with RNAP, may persist, others such as with BGLF4, may not. Ultimately it appears that late gene transcription is dependent on a on a very tight physical and temporal association with ongoing lytic DNA replication. Such a mechanism would help to ensure that late gene products are synthesized concurrently and at the appropriate time to be available for packaging of newly replicated genomes.</p>
