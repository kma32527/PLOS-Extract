<abstract>
<p><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is a facultative intracellular pathogen and its interaction with macrophages is a key event determining the outcome of infection. Urease is a major virulence factor in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> but its role during macrophage interaction has not been characterized. Consequently, we analyzed the effect of urease on fungal-macrophage interaction using wild-type, urease-deficient and urease-complemented strains of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>. The frequency of non-lytic exocytosis events was reduced in the absence of urease. Urease-positive <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> manifested reduced and delayed intracellular replication with fewer macrophages displaying phagolysosomal membrane permeabilization. The production of urease was associated with increased phagolysosomal pH, which in turn reduced growth of urease-positive <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> inside macrophages. Interestingly, the <italic>ure1</italic> mutant strain grew slower in fungal growth medium which was buffered to neutral pH (pH 7.4). Mice inoculated with macrophages carrying urease-deficient <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> had lower fungal burden in the brain than mice infected with macrophages carrying wild-type strain. In contrast, the absence of urease did not affect survival of yeast when interacting with amoebae. Because of the inability of the urease deletion mutant to grow on urea as a sole nitrogen source, we hypothesize urease plays a nutritional role involved in nitrogen acquisition in the environment. Taken together, our data demonstrate that urease affects fitness within the mammalian phagosome, promoting non-lytic exocytosis while delaying intracellular replication and thus reducing phagolysosomal membrane damage, events that could facilitate cryptococcal dissemination when transported inside macrophages. This system provides an example where an enzyme involved in nutrient acquisition modulates virulence during mammalian infection.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is a relatively frequent cause of life-threatening infection in severely immunocompromised patients, especially those with AIDS. Persistence of infection involves residence within macrophages, where <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> can survive and replicate while residing in the phagolysosome. New treatments may be developed from a better understanding of how this pathogen resists clearance from and adapts for persistence in host phagocytic cells. In this study, we demonstrate a novel role for urease, a major virulence factor of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>, in its interaction with macrophages. This enzyme is able to break down urea into ammonia, which is a base, thus raising the surrounding pH. In the context of a mammalian infection, we show that cryptococcal urease increases the phagolysosomal pH which delays yeast replication, therefore causing less damage to macrophages and prolongs intracellular residence. Moreover, urease promotes <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> exit from macrophages without killing the host cells. Overall, our data implies that urease also contributes to virulence by allowing the pathogen to persist and disseminate in macrophages.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>, a major life-threatening fungal pathogen predominantly infects severely immunocompromised patients and causes over 180,000 deaths per year worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref001">1</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> is ubiquitous, although is most frequently found in soils contaminated with bird excreta or from trees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref011">11</xref>]. Current treatments for Cryptococcosis often fail, are inadequate and/or unavailable for these infections, especially in developing countries. Therefore, it is important to study the fundamental pathogenic processes of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> to discover new treatments against this pathogen.</p>
<p>Human infection with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> follows inhalation of spore or yeast cells. In healthy individuals, pulmonary infections with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> are normally controlled and macrophages play a central role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref013">13</xref>]. Soon after phagocytosis, the <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>-containing phagosome undergoes maturation, acidification and lysosome fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref017">17</xref>]. However, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> is a facultative intracellular pathogen that it is able to survive and persist in mature phagolysosome, and can become latent and localized within the giant cells or macrophages in granulomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref022">22</xref>]. Depletion of macrophages is associated with improved survival of infected mice, supporting the notion that yeast cell cells are maintained within macrophages and as such, this host cell can constitute a niche for dissemination and persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref023">23</xref>]. In the rat, latent infection resides in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref018">18</xref>]. Infection can reactivate in conditions of weakened immunity, with intracellular replication and dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref024">24</xref>]. Consequently, the ability of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> to survive and replicate intracellularly contributes to different stages of cryptococcal pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref027">27</xref>]. It has been proposed that this intracellular pathogenic strategy emerged from interactions with amoebae in the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref030">30</xref>]. A recent study reports that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> spends a relatively short time (~80 min) inside <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> and is expulsed before yeast replication occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> expresses virulence factors that promote its pathogenicity, including formation and enlargement of a polysaccharide capsule, melanin production, extracellular secretion of various enzymes including phospholipase, urease, etc. The role of capsule and melanin in macrophage-pathogen interaction are well understood. The capsule interferes with phagocytosis, by potentially masking macrophage receptor binding sites and polysaccharide shed by the yeast is immunosuppressive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref034">34</xref>]. Moreover, both capsule and melanin protect <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> from intracellular killing by providing protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as antimicrobial peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref036">36</xref>]. However, mechanism by which urease contributes to intracellular pathogenesis is unknown.</p>
<p>Urease functions as a general virulence factor for many bacterial pathogens, such as <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref037">37</xref>], and fungal pathogens <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> spp. and <italic>Coccidioides posadasii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref040">40</xref>]. Urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref042">42</xref>]. Ammonia generated from ureolytic activity can serve as a nitrogen source. Since urea is evenly distributed throughout the human body it is conceivable it is used as a nutrient by mammalian pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref043">43</xref>]. Beyond its nutritional role, ureolytic activity enhances the invasion of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> to the central nervous system by promoting the yeast sequestration within the microcapillary beds of blood-brain barrier. The underlying mechanism is not known, but was hypothesized that ammonia generated by urease activity was toxic to microvascular endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref046">46</xref>]. Urease-mediated ammonia can also neutralize any acidic microenvironment and thus help pathogens to survive harsh pH of the phagolysosome. The neutralizing effect of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic>’s urease is well established, enabling that bacterium to colonize gastric mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref048">48</xref>]. In addition to its role in gastric colonization, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> urease regulates the host-macrophage interaction by retarding the opsonization of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref049">49</xref>]. The enzyme can also modulate phagosomal pH and disrupt phagosome maturation to enhance the intracellular survival of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref050">50</xref>]. Furthermore, it induces the expression of inducible NO-synthesizing enzyme (iNOS), a M1 macrophage polarization marker, in mouse macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref051">51</xref>]. In contrast, in both <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>posadasii</italic>, urease-producing strains promote the polarization of immune responses to a nonprotective Type 2 (T2) rather than a fungicidal Type 1 (T1) immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref052">52</xref>]. Hence, bacterial and fungal urease may have different effects on macrophage activation, and the role of cryptococcal urease during macrophage-pathogen interaction, which may affect the appropriate immune response, is unexplored.</p>
<p>In this paper, we evaluated the role of urease on intracellular pathogenesis of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> in both amoebae and macrophages.

<title>Urease did not affect phagocytosis, phagosomal maturation and nitric oxide production</title>
<p>Macrophages play a central role in host response to cryptococcal infection and harbor the organism as an intracellular pathogen during latent infection. To investigate the effect of urease in intracellular pathogenesis we studied the response of macrophage when they were infected with either <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans ure1</italic> deletion strain, its parental H99 or the <italic>URE1</italic> complemented strains. Studies have shown that <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> urease can affect phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref049">49</xref>], modulate the recruitment of lysosomal marker LAMP-1 to phagosome and thus prevent phagosomal maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref050">50</xref>], and stimulates the expression of iNOS to induce nitric oxide generation production in mouse macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref051">51</xref>]. Therefore, we first measured the efficiency of phagocytosis of antibody-opsonized cells for the three strains by calculating the phagocytic index after incubation for 2 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007144.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). We then tested if cryptococcal urease can affect the recruitment of LAMP-1 to phagosomes by examining percentage of LAMP-1 positive phagosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007144.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). To study if cryptococcal urease affects host iNOS expression, we infected macrophages with urease-positive and negative strains and measured the concentration of nitrite, a stable oxidation product of nitric oxide, in the culture supernatant using Griess assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007144.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). Our data shows that cryptococcal urease does not affect the efficiency of antibody-mediated phagocytosis, phagosomal maturation, and nitric oxide production of macrophages during the infection. We also determined the ability of wild-type, urease deletion and complemented strains to survive intracellularly by enumerating the colony forming units (CFU).

<p>We hypothesized that if ureolytic activity of urease influenced non-lytic exocytosis, that the addition of urea to the media would also affect the frequency of these events. Consequently, we adjusted the concentration of urea in cell media to 9 mM, which is the level found in plasma from mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref057">57</xref>], and studied the interaction of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> and macrophages.

However, the increase in exocytosis was also noted when macrophages were infected with urease deleted strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007144.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).

<p>To investigate whether urease enzymatic activity affected non-lytic exocytosis, we infected BMDM with H99 in the presence of 5 mM of the urease inhibitor acetohydroxamic acid (AHA), a concentration that inhibits 50% of yeast urease activity while presenting minimal toxicity to murine macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007144.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), and measured the frequency of non-lytic exocytosis. Addition of AHA decreased non-lytic exocytosis to a level comparable to that observed with the urease deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007144.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). This result is consistent with and supports the notion that urease mediated urea hydrolysis modulates the frequency of non-lytic exocytosis.</p>
<p>We observed no significant difference in the frequency of host cell lysis in the presence versus absence of urease when there is no urea supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007144.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). However, after the concentration of urea in the culture medium was adjusted to 9 mM cell lysis events of macrophages infected with urease-positive strain decreased by 38%, whereas the event of cell lysis with urease-negative strain increased by 35% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007144.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).

<title>Urease and intracellular growth and survival</title>
<p>We compared the intracellular replication of cryptococcal strains with or without urease. For each strain, we analyzed more than 800 internalized cryptococcal cells in five 24-hour time-lapse movies for their ability to replicate intracellularly. In wildtype <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>, 39.6% of cells underwent replication inside macrophages while 63.5% occurred for <italic>ure1</italic>Δ cells, i.e., <italic>ure1</italic>Δ cells replicated nearly twice as more than wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007144.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Adding 9 mM urea to the medium resulted in larger difference in intracellular replication between wild-type and urease deletion mutant, with decreased number of replication on H99 and increased number of replication on <italic>ure1</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007144.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). We also investigated whether the presence of urease affected the onset of intracellular replication, and we measured the time of first budding after the cells were phagocytized by macrophages. Urease-positive strains had more cells that started replication later than urease-negative cells although both of the peaks are at 4–6 h after phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007144.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Therefore, even among those cells that replicated inside macrophages, urease-positive strains manifested slightly delayed replication compared to <italic>ure1</italic>Δ strain. The delay became more pronounced when urea (9 mM) was supplemented to the medium, resulting in a peak shift of urease-positive cells from 4–6 h to 8–10 h, implying that cells took longer to begin to replicate in this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007144.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that urease ureolytic activity is strongly linked to the delayed onset of cell replication.

The phagolysosomes containing the cells from the urease complement strain had a similar pH (4.7–5.1) as those containing wild-type cells and constantly had higher pH than cells deficient in urease at the first two hours of phagocytosis, but the results were inconsistent with those containing wild-type for longer time intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007144.g006">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007144.s004">S4C Fig</xref>). This finding could result from differences in urease level expression in the complemented strain relative to wild-type expression and/or other uncharacterized factors affecting the reconstituted strain. We also observed considerable pH variation among individual phagolysosomes, which could reflect many factors including differences in the timing of phagocytosis, heterogeneous microenvironments or the cellular position of the phagolysosomes (peripheral vs juxtanuclear) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref065">65</xref>] or plain stochastic variation. Overall, phagolysosomes containing both wild-type and urease complemented strains had higher pH than the bead- and <italic>ure1</italic>Δ strain-containing phagosomes in the first two hours after phagocytosis, consistent with a mechanism whereby urease increases phagolysosomal pH through hydrolysis of urea, which is present in the system from the metabolism of macrophages and from fetal calf serum in the macrophage media.</p>

<p>We also determined the pH of phagolysosome containing heat-inactivated H99 (50 °C for 30 min). Although we expected that it would behave comparably pH of phagolysosomes containing polystyrene beads, the pH was significantly higher (pH 5.1) from 2–4 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007144.g006">Fig 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007144.s004">S4E Fig</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that urease activity was not abolished by heat-inactivating to 50 °C for 30 min, since the plating of heat-inactivated cells on Christensen urea agar turned pink (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007144.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Of note, the color effect in urea agar was faster with heat-inactivated cells than with alive cells, suggesting that the heating may have liberated the enzyme. Given this result we repeated the experiment with H99 cells killed by heating to 50 °C for a longer period of time (4 h) which was effective in inactivating the urease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007144.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). The phagolysosomal pH indeed became lower (pH 4.7) after macrophages ingested H99 heat killed at 50 °C for 4 h when compared to 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007144.g006">Fig 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007144.s004">S4E Fig</xref>). We note that phagolysosomal pH of heat-killed H99 at 50 °C for 4 h was not as low as the pH of phagolysosome containing beads or the urease deletion mutant. A similar phagosomal pH value was observed after ingestion heat-killed urease deficient cells (50 °C for 4 h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007144.g006">Fig 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007144.s004">S4E Fig</xref>), suggesting that part of the increase in pH is independent of the presence of urease. We hypothesize these components could derive from leakage of intracellular contents including proteins with functional groups such as amino acids and carboxylic groups that can absorb hydronium ions, and buffer the acid flux such that it does not reach the low pH observed with polystyrene beads. However, the data with urease deficient mutant and urease inactivation by heat killing demonstrates that cryptococcal urease contributes to neutralize and therefore increase the phagosomal pH after ingestion by murine macrophages.</p>
<p>To confirm whether the increase of pH was a result of urease activity, we supplemented the media with urea at different concentrations (9 mM or 50 mM). To establish that urea can freely pass across cell membrane, we measured urea in macrophages using a colorimetric assay. Incubation of macrophages with urea raised their urea content to physiological urea concentration of 9 mM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007144.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). Urea supplementation was associated with a more alkaline phagolysosomal pH in macrophages containing wild-type and urease complemented strains as well as heat-inactivated H99 (50 °C for 30 min), but not urease deletion strain, bead or heat killed H99 (50 °C for 4 h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007144.g005">Fig 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007144.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). These results suggest that the increased phagolysosomal pH is associated with urease degradation of available urea.</p>

One possible explanation is that there is a metabolic cost of producing the enzyme, especially when adjusting to the nutrient-limited medium we used in this particular experiment. However, once the urease-positive strains adapt to the environment, the rate of growth can return to maximum.

<p>Urease is not only able to elevate the pH of microenvironment, but it also serves as a nitrogen source for pathogenic microbes such as <italic>Actinomyces naeslundii</italic> and <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> during infection by hydrolyzing urea to ammonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref067">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref069">69</xref>].

However, the role of cryptococcal urease in nutrition and metabolism has not been fully explored. Consequently, we tested whether <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> could use urea as both a nitrogen and carbon source and whether this was urease-dependent.

When urea was the sole nitrogen source, there was no growth of urease deletion mutant up to 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007144.g008">Fig 8D</xref>), consistent to prior results. The addition of ammonium salt partially complemented the growth defect of urease deletion mutation, suggesting that the growth defect was the result of an inability to produce ammonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007144.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). On the other hand, although urea could serve as a nitrogen source, cryptococcal strains were not able to grow when urea was the sole carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007144.g008">Fig 8F</xref>).

<title>Increased brain invasion by macrophages laden with urease-positive strain</title>
<p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> brain invasion can occur by carriage in macrophages in a Trojan Horse-like mechanism or through transcytosis of endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref070">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref077">77</xref>].

It is still not clear if this defect was due to ineffective dissemination from the lung or whether this reflected the fact that urease-negative strains are less effective in crossing the BBB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref046">46</xref>]. Furthermore, it was not clear if Trojan-horse transport inside macrophages was affected by the presence and absence of urease. Since urease retards the intracellular replication, it could promote the coexistence and persistence of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> within macrophages and thus increase the chance for dissemination by a Trojan Horse-like mechanism. Alternatively, since <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> urease also induces non-lytic exocytosis, this could facilitate escape of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> from macrophages in the lung or the bloodstream and enhance brain invasion of free yeasts by transcytosis, which is facilitated by urease.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Urease is an important virulence factors of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref040">40</xref>]. However, most studies have focused on urease role in brain invasion and its effects on the host immune response. Cryptococcal urease facilitates transmission of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> across the blood-brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref046">46</xref>] and polarizes the immune system to a Th2 response, which translates into greater fungal burden in lung in mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref052">52</xref>]. Yet the effect of urease in macrophage interaction has not been explored despite the fact that the outcome of the interaction <italic>of C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> with macrophages is a key determinant of the outcome of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref078">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref079">79</xref>]. In this study, we analyzed the role of urease in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>-macrophage interactions. Our results provide new insights on how this enzyme can affect the pathogenesis of <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> spp since we show that urease influences the intracellular growth of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>, affects non-lytic exocytosis from macrophages, is critical for growth at mammalian physiological pH and confers upon the yeast the potential for using urea as a nitrogen source in nutrition.</p>
<p>Urease can break down urea to produce ammonia, which in turn raises pH. In our study, the measurements of phagolysosomal pH show that cryptococcal urease contributes to buffering acidic pH in the phagolysosome, which is almost certainly a consequence of the hydrolysis of urea. Urea is present in the fetal bovine serum in the culture medium and easily crosses cell membranes. Urea is also a product of macrophages arginase catalysis, which provides <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> an additional intracellular source of substrate for urease. Moreover, human body fluids normally contain between 2.5 to 7.1 mM urea that is evenly distributed in all body compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref080">80</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref082">82</xref>]. These concentrations make it feasible for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> to utilize urea in the host and alter its microenvironmental pH such as phagolysosome. Phagolysosomal alkalization has also been observed with other urease-positive microbes. Mycobacterial urease contributes to the alkalization of the phagolysosomal pH in resting macrophages, but its effect is not sufficient to neutralize the pH in the more acidic phagolysosome of activated macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref083">83</xref>]. In contrast, the presence of cryptococcal urease was sufficient to raise pH by an average of 0.4 pH units. <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> urease is also known to significantly elevate phagolysosomal pH as well as retard recruitment of Lamp-1, a marker for late endosome and lysosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref050">50</xref>]. However, unlike <italic>H</italic>. <italic>pylori</italic> cryptococcal urease did not affect the LAMP-1 acquisition.</p>
<p>Phagosome acidification is usually considered an important component of the antimicrobial machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref084">84</xref>], but <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> grows best in acidic environments while other pathogens’ growth is inhibited by phagolysosome acidification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref085">85</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref087">87</xref>]. Our analysis shows that even inside the mammalian macrophage <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> grows at a higher rate in pH 5–6. Our results, together with studies of other groups, showed that neutralizing phagolysosomes by treating the macrophages with ammonium chloride inhibited intracellular growth of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref063">63</xref>]. Therefore, phagolysosomal acidification does not appear to be an important element of in the control of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> by macrophages. However, we show that urease is required for the optimal growth of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> at physiological pH. Therefore, we describe a previously unknown role of urease in neutral/alkaline pH tolerance.</p>
<p>The majority of intracellular cryptococcal cells in the urease-positive population did not undergo replication immediately upon entry into macrophages and <italic>ure1</italic> deletion strain initiated replication earlier than wild-type counterparts. This effect was pronounced when the culture medium was supplemented with urea. We attribute this effect to an increase in the phagolysosomal pH from 4.4 to 4.8, a pH that reduced the maximum growth rate of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>. Together, urease retards growth in macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic>, and at first glance this is the opposite of what would be expected from a virulence factor. However, this effect has to be considered in the context of the larger picture of cryptococcal pathogenesis. Urease-positive strains still possessed the ability of resisting killing by macrophages and delayed replication could promote a quiescent state intracellularly, which may be associated with persistence of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref088">88</xref>]. A previous study reported a strong correlation between intracellular replication of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> and lysosomal damage due to the increased number of yeasts in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref059">59</xref>]. Indeed, macrophages containing urease-positive cells manifested less phagolysosomal permeabilization than those containing urease-negative cells. Loss of phagolysosomal membrane integrity could be expected to benefit to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> by allowing the fungus access to host cytosolic nutrients. However, many bacterial pathogens thrive in vacuoles or phagosome rather than nutrient rich cytoplasm and have developed strategies to maintain phagosomal membrane integrity to avoid immune surveillance pathway and eventually prevent inflammasome-mediated lytic cell death called pyroptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref089">89</xref>]. A temporary maintenance of membrane integrity could contribute to persistent infections by prolonging the interaction of macrophages and cryptococci. Consistent with this, our results show that when the medium is supplemented with urea, urease-positive cryptococcal cells manifest pronounced growth retardation and cause fewer events of host cell lysis. This correlation suggests that the growth retardation associated with urease mediated alkalization results in fewer yeasts in macrophages, which in turn protects <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> from humoral immune responses and facilitates persistent infection and dissemination by reducing the likelihood of lytic exocytosis.</p>
<p>The cellular and molecular mechanism of the non-lytic exocytosis is poorly understood. It is a highly choreographed process where both host and pathogen factors are involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref024">24</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that cryptococcal capsule and phospholipase B1 contribute to non-lytic exocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref090">90</xref>]. Host cell membrane protein annexin A2 and signaling kinase ERK5 have also been identified to regulate non-lytic exocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref091">91</xref>]. Repeated cycles of actin polymerization that form around cryptococci-containing phagosome could potentially inhibit non-lytic exocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref092">92</xref>]. Moreover, phagolysosome neutralization by the addition of weak base ammonium chloride and chloroquine increased the frequency of non-lytic exocytosis events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref062">62</xref>]. Here we identify urease as new fungal factor that modulates non-lytic exocytosis. Moreover, chemical inhibition of urease enzymatic activity decreased the frequency of non-lytic exocytosis, suggesting that the effect was related to urea hydrolysis. The most likely mechanism is that the pH alteration caused by ureolytic reaction contributes to increasing the frequency of non-lytic exocytosis, which is consistent with our observation that urease activity raised phagolysosomal pH. However, the mechanism on how phagolysosomal pH influences the non-lytic exocytosis remains to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Given that phagolysosomal alkalization can increase non-lytic exocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref062">62</xref>], we evaluated whether higher concentrations of urea would increase the frequency of this phenomenon. While increase in exogenous urea increased phagolysosomal pH in those containing urease-positive cells, we also observed increased non-lytic exocytosis in macrophages containing urease-negative cryptococcal cells. Therefore, the effect was not entirely dependent on urease-mediated alkalization, but could also be affected by urea, which can promote the fusion of vesicles with bilayer lipid membrane and thus induce exocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref093">93</xref>]. Hence, one possible mechanism for the increased non-lytic exocytosis observed for urease-negative cells is that urea encourages phagolysosome-cell membrane fusion to disgorge yeast cells.</p>
<p>The phagolysosomal pH was measured by conjugating a pH sensitive probe to 18B7 antibody, which binds to cryptococcal capsule, a method that can adapted to any system using antibody-mediated phagocytosis. It is noteworthy that we observed considerable pH variation among individual phagolysosomes. This heterogeneity has been observed in many other studies, and could be caused by many factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref094">94</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref096">96</xref>], such as differences in the timing of phagocytosis. Despite using centrifugation to enhance the yeast cells contact with macrophages, yeast cells might attach to macrophages but not be engulfed synchronously. A recent study also report that the position of lysosomes determines their pH, such that peripheral lysosomes are less acidic than juxtanuclear ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref065">65</xref>]. Phagolysosomal pH variation could also be attributed to the heterogeneity in protein composition of V-ATPases and NADPH oxidase among individual phagolysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref095">95</xref>]. Differences in the metabolic state or age of the infecting cells could also contribute to phagolysosomal pH heterogeneity. In this regard, variability in the infecting <italic>Salmonella</italic> population resulted in heterogeneous macrophage response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref097">97</xref>]. Finally, it is possible that the heterogeneity in phagolysosomal pH reflects the outcome of the individual battles between <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> and macrophages that are fought phagolysosome-to-phagolysosome, such that in some phagolysosomes the microbe gains ascendancy while in others it is suppressed.</p>
<p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> was able to utilize urea as nitrogen source for growth. This metabolic process was entirely urease dependent since the urease deficient strain was unable to grow in medium where urea was the sole nitrogen source. Supplementation with ammonium salt partially rescued the growth of urease-negative strain, suggesting that ammonia generated from ureolytic activity, not urea itself, is the actual nitrogen source for the growth of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>. We also showed that urea could not serve as the sole source of carbon for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>. Therefore, we propose that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> urease activity may also provide an important nutritional function for <italic>in vivo</italic> under nitrogen-limited conditions since urea diffuses easily in tissues and macrophages can generate urea. Of note, two conundrums arise from our studies. Firstly, the partial rescue suggests that cryptococcal urease is further involved in the metabolism of ammonia. Secondly, it remains to be investigated why urease is required for growth at physiological pH. In contrast to other virulence factors such as the capsule, melanin, and phospholipase, a deficiency in urease did not increase the vulnerability of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> for amoebae. Hence, the main role of urease in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> in its natural environment appears to be nutritional in nature and this enzyme provides an example on how a protein involved in nutrition acquisition can serve a fortuitous role during pathogenesis as a modulator of virulence.</p>
<p>Taken together, we propose the following model for the role of urease in intracellular pathogenesis. Urease secreted by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> into phagolysosome hydrolyses urea, releases ammonia and increases the pH of this compartment by approximately half of a pH unit, which is sufficiently to retard the replication of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> inside macrophages. The growth retardation in turn leads to fewer macrophages with phagolysosomal membrane permeabilization and fewer host cell lysis. In parallel, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> urease induces non-lytic exocytosis events of macrophages. Crossing of the blood brain barrier can be done by yeast cells in a transcytosis event or inside macrophages in a Trojan horse-like mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref070">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref077">77</xref>]. For yeast cells crossing the blood brain barrier alone urease has been shown to promote brain invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref046">46</xref>]. In addition, urease contributes to optimal <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> growth at physiological pH, which may facilitate the its extracellular growth and dissemination to tissues. Urease can also play a role in cryptococcal nitrogen metabolism by providing a source of nitrogen, and that could support the long-term survival of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> in nitrogen-limited conditions such as macrophages. Our observation shows that the presence of urease promotes non-lytic exocytosis, delays intracellular replication, allows for use of an abundant nitrogen source and facilitates growth at mammalian physiological pH. Therefore, urease can affect all of the types of blood-brain barrier crossing mechanisms by providing more extracellular yeasts and increased pH fitness for transcytosis, as well as increasing residence time in macrophages, with the latter promoting macrophage-associated crossings. This supposition was supported by the observation of higher fungal dissemination to the brain in mice injected with macrophage containing urease producing <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>. Furthermore, it is consistent with the model proposed by others that elevating the frequency of non-lytic exocytosis by altering host cell signaling reduces dissemination, presumably by limiting the opportunity for Trojan horse transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref027">27</xref>]. Overall, we propose that urease helps <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> to both persist in and exit from macrophages, events that could facilitate the dissemination of the pathogen to brain through macrophage-dependent transport mechanisms. We anticipate that the findings here for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> may also be relevant to other urease-positive fungal pathogens such as <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> and <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic>, two pathogens that modulate phagolysosomal pH and for which acidification is critical for control of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref087">87</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref098">98</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007144.ref099">99</xref>]. Analysis of urease effects on macrophages is likely to be a fertile area of investigation for the many fungal pathogens that express this enzyme.</p>

Infected BMDM were lysed with sterilized water and cell lysis were plated in YPD plates to confirm inoculum CFU. After 72 h post-injection, mice were euthanized, lung and brain were isolated and homogenized by passing through a 100 μm filter. Homogenates were plated onto YPD agar for CFU enumeration. Three mice per strain per experiment were studied and two independent biological experiments were performed.</p>

<p>(A) Urease has no effect on phagocytosis by murine macrophages. BMDM was incubated with cryptococcal urease-positive strain (H99 or <italic>ure1</italic>Δ::<italic>URE1</italic>) and urease-negative strain (<italic>ure1</italic>Δ) for 2 h to allow phagocytosis. The <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>/macrophage ratio was 3:1. The phagocytic index was determined by the number of internalized cryptococcal cells per 100 macrophages. Each strain was tested at least five times independently for over 600 macrophages. Error bars represent 95% confidence interval of the mean. <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05 by Fisher’s exact test. (B) Urease has no effect on the recruitment of lamp-1 to phagosome. BMDM were infected with H99, <italic>ure1</italic>Δ or <italic>ure1</italic>Δ::<italic>URE1</italic> strain for indicated times. Cells were fixed and stained with lamp-1 antibody, and processed for imaging. Percentage of phagosomes which acquire lamp-1 were shown. Two independent biological experiments were performed. <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05 by Student’s <italic>t</italic> test. (C) Urease does not affect the level of NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> generation by BMDM. BMDM were infected with H99, <italic>ure1</italic>Δ or <italic>ure1</italic>Δ::<italic>URE1</italic> strain for 24 h. The level of NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> in the culture supernatant were determined by Griess reaction colorimetric nitrite assay. The data are presented as mean ± SD from triplicate observations. Comparable result was obtained from additional independent experiment. <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05 by Student’s <italic>t</italic> test. (D) Urease does not affect the survival of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> inside macrophage. The survival of cryptococcal strains was determined by colony form unit (CFU) after 0 and 2 h phagocytosis. The percentage of survival was calculated by normalizing the CFU value of 2 h infection to that of time zero. Data represent the mean of three technical replicates per biological sample and error bars are SD. Comparable result was obtained from additional independent experiment. <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05 by Student’s <italic>t</italic> test.</p>
