<abstract>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> causes chronic infection of mononuclear phagocytes, especially resident (alveolar) macrophages, recruited macrophages, and dendritic cells. Despite the importance of these cells in tuberculosis (TB) pathogenesis and immunity, little is known about the population dynamics of these cells at the sites of infection. We used a combination of congenic monocyte adoptive transfer, and pulse-chase labeling of DNA, to determine the kinetics and characteristics of trafficking, differentiation, and infection of mononuclear phagocytes during the chronic, adaptive immune phase of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection in mice. We found that Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes traffic rapidly to the lungs, where a subpopulation become Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> and remain in the lung vascular space, while the remainder migrate into the lung parenchyma and differentiate into Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> dendritic cells, CD11b<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells, and recruited macrophages. As in humans with TB, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice have increased numbers of blood monocytes; this is due to increased egress from the bone marrow, and not delayed egress from the blood. Pulse-chase labeling of dividing cells and flow cytometry analysis revealed a T<sub>1/2</sub> of ~15 hrs for Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, indicating that they differentiate rapidly upon entry to the parenchyma of infected lungs; in contrast, cells that differentiate from Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes turn over more slowly, but diminish in frequency in less than one week. New cells (identified by pulse-chase labeling) acquire bacteria within 1–3 days of appearance in the lungs, indicating that bacteria regularly encounter new cellular niches, even during the chronic stage of infection. Our findings that mononuclear phagocyte populations at the site of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection are highly dynamic provide support for specific approaches for host-directed therapies directed at monocytes, including trained immunity, as potential interventions in TB, by replacing cells with limited antimycobacterial capabilities with newly-recruited cells better able to restrict and kill <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>During certain chronic infections such as tuberculosis, inflammatory cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, are recruited to infected tissues where they aggregate to form tissue lesions known as granulomas. Although granulomas can persist long term, the dynamics of the cell populations that comprise granulomas are not well understood. We used a combination of methods to discover that, during chronic infection of mice with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, the monocyte, macrophage, and dendritic cell populations are highly dynamic: recently-proliferated cells traffic rapidly to infected lung tissues, yet they persist with a half-life of less than one week. We also found that recently-proliferated cells become infected with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> as soon as one day after their arrival in the lungs, indicating that the bacteria are regularly moving to new cellular niches, even during the chronic stage of infection. The dynamic nature of the cell populations that encounter <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> suggests that interventions such as trained immunity have potential therapeutic roles, by replacing cells that have poor antimycobacterial activity with cells with enhanced antimycobacterial activity. These interventions could improve the outcomes of treatment of drug resistant tuberculosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mononuclear phagocytes (MNP) harbor <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> in tissues of humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref001">1</xref>] and experimental animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref004">4</xref>]; and MNP are essential elements of granulomas, the characteristic tissue lesions in tuberculosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref006">6</xref>]. Although macrophages have been characterized as prominent cellular hosts for <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis in vivo</italic>, recent studies have revealed the roles of distinct populations of MNP, including tissue-resident (i.e., lung alveolar) macrophages, monocyte-derived recruited macrophages, and dendritic cells, as host cells for the bacteria in experimental animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref004">4</xref>] and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref007">7</xref>]. Although cells in these subsets exhibit functional differences during <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection, including the ability to transport bacteria from the lungs to the local lymph nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref010">10</xref>] and their ability to present antigens for activation of CD4 T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref011">11</xref>], there is little known regarding the population dynamics of MNP in tuberculosis or any other chronic infection.</p>
<p>Recent studies of blood monocytes that emigrate from the bone marrow during homeostasis have revealed the potential for these cells to differentiate from Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes to several distinct subsets of intravascular and tissue parenchymal cells. A proportion of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes differentiate into Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes, which remain in the blood and vascular space of peripheral tissues, where they are considered to 'patrol' the vascular space and respond to inflammatory stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref012">12</xref>]. In addition, Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes emigrate from the vascular space during homeostasis and differentiate into lung macrophages and dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref013">13</xref>]. <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection markedly increases accumulation of recruited macrophages and dendritic cells in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref015">15</xref>], but it is unclear whether the recruited cells are long-lived, or whether they require continuous replenishment by recruitment, local proliferation, or both. Since <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection is accompanied by apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref016">16</xref>], necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref017">17</xref>], and egress from the lungs to the local lymph node [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref010">10</xref>], we hypothesized that mononuclear cell populations in the lungs are dynamic, and their abundance and differentiation may contribute to the outcomes of infection.</p>
<p>Initial evidence that MNP populations can be dynamic at a tissue site was obtained in studies by Dannenberg, who used intravenous injection of tritiated thymidine to track the recruitment and decay of MNP at sites of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> BCG injection in the skin of rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref018">18</xref>]. Although these experiments revealed evidence for MNP turnover, they could not reveal the differentiation of the labeled cells, and the decay of labeled cells at the site of BCG injection may have been at least partly due to clearing of the attenuated bacteria used as the stimulus.</p>
<p>Here, we studied monocyte trafficking, differentiation, and turnover in multiple compartments: blood, the lung vasculature, lung parenchyma, lung-draining lymph nodes, and distant lymph nodes, in uninfected and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice, using adoptive transfer and <italic>in vivo</italic> pulse-chase labeling, coupled with flow cytometry and immunostaining of tissue sections. We selected time points that followed the rapid accumulation of cells that occurs during the early response to infection and that followed the development of adaptive immune responses. Our results extend previously-published results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref015">15</xref>] by revealing distinct characteristics of endovascular and tissue parenchymal cells, by revealing that the MNP population is actively turning over during the chronic phase of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection, and by finding that new MNP rapidly acquire bacteria at the site of infection. The findings that MNP populations are dynamic during the chronic stage of infection suggests that mechanisms that disrupt MNP trafficking or differentiation may underlie reactivation and progression of TB, and also indicate the potential to employ trained immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref019">19</xref>] as a therapeutic intervention in tuberculosis, by replacing cells that support intracellular bacterial growth with new cells that are more capable of restricting bacterial growth.</p>

<title>Adoptively transferred monocytes differentiate into diverse mononuclear cells in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice</title>
<p>To characterize the patterns and kinetics of trafficking and differentiation of monocyte-derived cells during the chronic phase of infection in a non-lymphoid tissue (the lungs), we purified Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> and Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes from the blood and bone marrow (BM) of CD45.1<sup>+</sup> mice and transferred them intravenously (i.v.) to CD45.2<sup>+</sup> recipients either 4 or 8 weeks after aerosol infection with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv. Mononuclear cells were ~92–99% Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes; the remainder were Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes, dendritic cells (DC) and cells expressing markers of stem cell progenitors. Utilizing multi-color flow cytometry panels, live/dead discrimination and Boolean gating we were able to identify multiple subsets of live mononuclear cells and granulocytes from lungs of infected and uninfected mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s002">S2</xref> Figs), we then characterized the adoptively-transferred CD45.1<sup>+</sup> cells as they trafficked and differentiated in five compartments: peripheral blood, the lung vasculature, the lung parenchyma, the lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) and pooled peripheral lymph nodes that do not drain the lungs (pLN) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s003">S3A</xref> Figs). Cells within the lung parenchyma were distinguished from intravascular cells by the i.v. administration of anti-CD45 antibody immediately prior to euthanasia. All alveolar macrophages (Siglec F<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>lo</sup> CD11c<sup>hi</sup> SSC<sup>hi</sup> CD103<sup>−</sup>) (AvM) were CD45 IV<sup>−</sup> and contained no CD45.1<sup>+</sup> adoptively transferred monocytes at any of the time points we observed.</p>
<p>At the time of the earliest sampling (~40 h following transfer), the transferred cells in the blood and lung vasculature resembled the population of transferred cells: most were Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes (Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>−</sup> MHCII<sup>−</sup>); the remainder were Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes (Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>lo</sup> MHCII<sup>−</sup>), while no other monocyte-derived cell subset was detectable in the blood or the lung vascular space (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g001">1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g001">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s003">S3A</xref>).</p>

<p>The composition of transferred mononuclear cell populations in the lung parenchyma and MLN were similar, but notably different between weeks 4 and 8 of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection. At the first time point after transfer into mice infected for 4 weeks, &gt;50% of the transferred cells in these tissues had differentiated into Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> DCs (Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> MHCII<sup>hi</sup>); the remainder of the transferred cells in these tissues were predominantly Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, while a small fraction had differentiated into CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC (Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> MHCII<sup>hi</sup>) in both tissues or into Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>lo</sup> MHCII<sup>lo</sup> recruited parenchymal macrophages (RPM) in the lungs. Transferred cells differentiated almost identically in the MLN when transferred at 4 and 8 weeks post infection. However, at 8 weeks post <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection, both Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> DC and CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC fractions were diminished in the lung parenchyma while the portion of transferred monocytes that became RPM was substantially increased.</p>
<p>While both Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes and RPM express the phenotypic markers previously used to define lung recruited macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref004">4</xref>], they differ in their location within the lung vasculature or parenchyma. In the steady state, ~10% of the Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes/RPM are within the lung parenchyma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). However, as disease progresses, an increasing proportion of these cells are in the parenchyma, which is further evidenced by the increased number and proportion of donor-derived RPM during the later phase of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent publications have characterized heterogeneity within both the Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> and Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocyte populations in the bone marrow and circulation. Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes are believed to be derived from Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, and in the steady state, the majority of the Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes differentiate into I-Ab<sup>−</sup>vascular-patrolling monocytes in an NR4A1-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref021">21</xref>]. Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, on the other hand, have been shown to differentiate into monocyte-derived DCs and tissues macrophages in an NR4A1- and Flt3L-independent manner, with high expression of the transcription factor PU.1 predisposing these cells to differentiate into DC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref022">22</xref>]. Intranuclear staining for the PU.1 revealed that DC populations in the lung parenchyma expressed the highest levels of PU.1 amongst mononuclear cells, while RPM expressed the lowest levels of PU.1 amongst mononuclear phagocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). These data support the assertion that Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes contribute to bona fide DC and RPM cell subsets in the lungs of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice.</p>
<p>In contrast to the MLN, Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes were the dominant transferred cell subset in the pLN week 4 after infection, and only a small fraction of the cells were Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> DC or CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC. However, by week 8 of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection, transferred cells in the pLN differentiated into Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> DC, suggesting that the inflammatory environment within pLN is distinct from MLN 4 weeks post infection, but the inflammatory milieu is more similar by week 8 of infection. The presence of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> in the pLN has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref010">10</xref>] and the inflammation from infection and the effector cytokines produced by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-reactive T cells may contribute to the differentiation of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> DC in the LN. These results indicate that circulating bone marrow-derived monocytes enter an infected peripheral tissue and differentiate rapidly, and that differentiation into DC or RPM happens during or after egress from the vascular space in the lungs of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice.</p>
<p>At later time points after transfer during both phases of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection, donor cells underwent further differentiation in tissue-dependent patterns, followed by gradual declines in their abundance in each compartment. In the peripheral blood and lung vascular space, Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes progressively became less frequent as a fraction of the recovered cells, with nearly all of the remaining transferred cells present as Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes 6–8 days after transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In both of these compartments, the number of Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes exhibited an inverse pattern relative to that of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, with Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> cells reaching a peak by days 3–4 followed by a gradual decline to approximately 30% of the peak level by day 8. This pattern is consistent with differentiation of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> to Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes in the blood, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Over time, Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> and CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC exhibited an inverse relationship in the lung parenchyma and MLN. The total number of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> DC and their proportion of transferred cells continuously ebbed over time while CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC numbers increased until day 4 before diminishing in number, while also constituting the majority of transferred cells. Surprisingly, although the kinetics of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes and CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC turnover were similar in the pLN and MLN, only a small fraction of transferred cells differentiated into Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> DC in the pLN.</p>
<p>The pattern and kinetics of adoptively transferred monocyte trafficking and differentiation in the MLN were similar at later phases of infection (8 weeks post infection), though, in the lung parenchyma and in pLN there was a delay in the peak number of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> DC to nearly 3 days after transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Transferred monocytes also differentiated into CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC more rapidly during this later phase of infection, peaking at day 3 instead of 4 days after transfer. The most striking difference between the two infectious phases, however, was the greater increase in RPM in the lung parenchyma at the later phase of infection. This suggests the inflammatory environment within the lung is changing throughout infection, leading to an evolving population of mononuclear cells with different phenotypes.</p>
<p>We determined the half-life of the Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes as well as the total transferred CD45.1<sup>+</sup> mononuclear cell population in each of the 5 compartments examined by fitting a first order exponential decay function to the data on the cell numbers identified by flow cytometry. There was substantial variation in the R<sup>2</sup> coefficients of determination and in the half-lives of the CD45.1<sup>+</sup> cells in each compartment and we utilized a comparison of fits analysis to determine the quality of each equation for each tissue. This analysis operates with a null hypothesis that the data are best represented by an equation with the same slope for all the cell numbers across all tissues combined. This analysis determined that the null hypothesis was correct for the total CD45.1<sup>+</sup> cells and the best-fit line for all the compartments combined yielded a consensus half-life of 112.18 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s003">S3D and S3E Fig</xref>). In contrast, the decay of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes (by differentiation, egress, death, or other mechanisms) was more rapid than total transferred cells and appeared most rapid in the pLN and was similar to that in the lung vasculature and parenchyma. However, when the qualities of the non-linear equations for each tissue were analyzed by comparison of fits analysis, it was determined that a single best-fit equation for all the Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in all tissues was a better fit than equations for each tissue and this best-fit equation yielded a half-life of 15.31 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s003">S3D and S3E Fig</xref>). Together, these results indicate that Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes have a half-life of less than one day, while cells that differentiate from Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes have a half-life of approximately 5 days during the chronic stage of infection with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>.</p>
<p>The results of these monocyte adoptive transfer studies are consistent with studies of the homeostatic state in mice indicating that Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes that egress the bone marrow can differentiate into Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes that remain in the blood and vascular space for prolonged periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref012">12</xref>]. In addition, they reveal that during the chronic phase of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection, monocytes that enter the lung parenchyma and lung-draining MLN preferentially differentiate into Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> DC, followed by CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC. In contrast, monocytes that traffic to a lymph node distant from the lungs undergo more diverse pathways of differentiation, suggesting that the local tissue environment contributes to monocyte differentiation into distinct cell subsets.</p>

<title>Recently-proliferated monocytes have similar turnover in lymphoid and peripheral tissues during <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection</title>
<p>Our adoptive transfer experiments established the kinetics and potential for monocytes to traffic and differentiate in distinct compartments in the context of chronic infection with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> but could not provide insight into the quantitative contributions of monocytes compared with resident cells in the lungs or lymph nodes during infection. To further understand the dynamics of mononuclear cell trafficking, proliferation, and differentiation, we briefly pulsed uninfected and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice at multiple stages of chronic infection with the nucleoside EdU (5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine) and characterized monocytic cells with EdU-labeled DNA at multiple time points in the bone marrow, blood, lung vascular space, lung parenchyma, and MLN. EdU incorporation was compared to the staining of cells from infected or uninfected mice that did not receive EdU injections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s005">S5</xref> Figs).</p>
<p>Quantitation of total Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> cells in the bone marrow revealed no differences between uninfected mice and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice, at any stage of chronic infection (up to 16 weeks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s011">S1A Table</xref>). In contrast to the bone marrow, in the blood we found that chronic <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection was associated with increases in Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, with the most marked increase observed at the latest time point of infection examined (16 weeks post infection) (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g002">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s016">S6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s011">S1A Table</xref>).

<p>The finding of increased numbers of blood monocytes during infection without an increase in the number of mature monocytes at their site of production in the bone marrow is consistent with a shorter dwell time of mature monocytes in the bone marrow, and/or a longer dwell time in the blood. Analysis of the frequency of labeled monocytes after a brief pulse of EdU revealed a significant increase in the rate of decay or egress of monocytes from the bone marrow associated with infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). The statistical differences in %EdU<sup>+</sup> and total numbers of EdU<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes between uninfected or <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s011">S1B and S1C Table</xref>. The half-life of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in the BM decreased from 47.59 h in uninfected mice to 26.06 h at the most acute phase of infection examined, though, the half-life had increased to 34.27 h by the 16<sup>th</sup> week of infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s016">S6C Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s012">S2A Table</xref>). We also determined the half-lives of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes by fitting the equation to the total numbers of EdU<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes; this revealed a similar trend of increased monocyte turnover during <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s016">S6D Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s012">S2B Table</xref>). These results suggest that acute and chronic <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection are associated with increased production of monocytes in the bone marrow, which is balanced by increased egress from the bone marrow to the blood and to peripheral tissues. This interpretation was supported by analysis of the frequency of EdU-labeled monocytes in the blood. First, comparison of the frequency of EdU pulse-labeled monocytes in the blood of uninfected and infected mice revealed a lag before EdU-labeled monocytes peaked in the blood of uninfected mice; this lag was not evident in the blood of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice, consistent with more rapid entry of monocytes into the blood from the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g002">Fig 2B and 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s011">S1B Table</xref>). Second, the rate of decay of the frequency of EdU-labeled monocytes from the blood was greater in infected mice (ranging from 17.6–23.6 h) compared with that in uninfected mice (34.1 h) (Figs <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s006">S6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g002">2C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s012">S2A Table</xref>). Together, these results show that increased numbers of monocytes in the blood of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice result from increased production of monocytes in the bone marrow, balanced by increased release of mature monocytes from the bone marrow into the blood, and not by prolonged retention of monocytes in the blood.</p>
<p>Because the total numbers of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes are substantially different between phases and a logarithmic scale makes it difficult to observe the change in EdU<sup>+</sup> monocytes over time, we sought to normalize the number of new monocytes and display them on a linear scale. We determined the frequency of EdU<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes amongst total live cells in the lungs, determined the peak frequency of EdU<sup>+</sup> monocytes of live cells and then calculated the % of maximum EdU<sup>+</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). This allowed all phases to be shown on a linear scale and helped normalize for variations in total lung cell yields between time points, as well as more clearly demonstrating the turnover of monocytes.</p>
<p>Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes accumulated in the peripheral tissues during <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection, with ~30-fold increase in the lung vasculature over that in uninfected mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s013">S3 Table</xref>). The kinetics of EdU pulse-labeled monocytes in the lung vascular space closely mimicked those in the blood, including the delay to the peak in the frequency of labeled Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in uninfected mice that was absent in infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g002">Fig 2B and 2D</xref>), and the shorter half-life of monocytes in blood of infected mice.</p>
<p>In the lung parenchyma, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection was accompanied by a striking increase in the total number of monocytes, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref015">15</xref>] the number of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in the lung parenchyma progressively increased between 4 and 16 weeks of infection where they were more than 550 times more numerous than in uninfected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s013">S3 Table</xref>). The peak in the frequency of EdU pulse-labeled monocytes was lower in the lung parenchyma of infected mice compared with that of uninfected mice; this is most likely due to the larger population of monocytes in the lungs of infected mice into which the EdU<sup>+</sup> cells are diluted. After peaking on day 2 post EdU pulse, the rate of decay of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> EdU<sup>+</sup> cells was increased in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g002">2B, 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s006">S6C and S6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s012">S2 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>The behavior of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> EdU<sup>+</sup> monocytes in the lung-draining MLN closely mimicked those in the lung parenchyma: the number of cells in both tissues increased markedly and progressively with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection, and the kinetics of appearance and decay of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> EdU<sup>+</sup> cells were similar. In both tissues, infection accelerated the rate of decay of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> cells, and by 7 days after the EdU pulse, the number of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> cells decreased 10 to 100-fold compared to the peak value reached at 2 days post-pulse. During both acute and chronic phases of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection, Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes rapidly proliferate in the BM, and enter the periphery to differentiate into various cell subsets at an increased rate relative to uninfected mice.</p>

At this time point, the total number of RPM and the number of EdU<sup>+</sup> RPM was higher than observed 4 or 8 weeks post infection. Together, these results indicate that the dynamics of mononuclear cells at the site of infection change during the chronic phase of infection, resulting in a larger population of RPM that turns over more slowly and comprises a larger proportion of the parenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s007">S7E and S7F Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with the data from adoptive transfer of bone marrow monocytes, the EdU pulse labeled up to 10–15% of the Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> DC in the lung parenchyma with peak labeling observed 3 days after the EdU pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). The statistical differences in total cell number, %EdU<sup>+</sup> and total numbers of EdU<sup>+</sup> in the multiple DC and MP populations in the lung parenchyma of uninfected or <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s015">S5 Table</xref>. Also consistent with the results of adoptive transfer, Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> DC are transient, with the proportion of EdU<sup>+</sup> cells decaying to ~30% of the peak level one week after EdU pulse. Furthermore, these cells did not accumulate with disease progression as observed with other mononuclear cell populations (RPM, CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC, CD103<sup>+</sup>/XCR1<sup>+</sup> DC), displayed similar kinetics of EdU incorporation and decay between infection phases, and were undetectable in the lungs of uninfected mice. These cells likely represent a transient transition state from Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes to CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC or RPM and are only detectable during infection.</p>
<p>CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC progressively increased in number within the lung parenchyma of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice and EdU<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC reached a peak frequency ~3 days after the EdU pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). A substantial fraction of CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC were EdU<sup>+</sup> within 24 h of EdU administration, suggesting that a large fraction of these cells can proliferate locally in the lungs, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref026">26</xref>], while the rest of the EdU<sup>+</sup> DCs are derived from the differentiation of monocytes or other subsets of recruited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The frequency of CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC that were EdU<sup>+</sup> was continuously diminished as disease progressed, conversely, the total numbers of EdU<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC increased with infection progression. This is largely due to the accumulation and retention of increasing numbers of CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC over time during infection, and while recently proliferated cells comprising a smaller portion of the total number, they still represent a sizable population of cells that is turning over (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>We examined two additional subsets of mononuclear phagocytes in the lung parenchyma: CD103<sup>+</sup>/XCR1<sup>+</sup> DC and alveolar macrophages (AvM). For some of the experiments we utilized antibodies specific for XCR1 instead of CD103 as XCR1<sup>+</sup> DC have been shown to largely consist of CD103<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>–</sup> DC in the LN and peripheral organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref028">28</xref>]. Up to 12–15% of the CD103<sup>+</sup>/XCR1<sup>+</sup> DC in the lung parenchyma were labeled with an EdU pulse; unlike the other cell subsets studied, the frequency of EdU<sup>+</sup> CD103<sup>+</sup>/XCR1<sup>+</sup> DC did not differ in uninfected compared with infected mice, although the total number of CD103<sup>+</sup> DC and the number of EdU<sup>+</sup> CD103<sup>+</sup>/XCR1<sup>+</sup> DC increased in a time-dependent manner with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection. Notably, the peak of EdU-labeled CD103<sup>+</sup>/XCR1<sup>+</sup> DC did not exhibit the lag observed with RPM, Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> DC, or CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g003">Fig 3</xref>), suggesting that this subset of cells in the lung parenchyma does not depend on differentiation from a cell with another phenotype, and that CD103<sup>+</sup>/XCR1<sup>+</sup> DC proliferate locally in the lungs, even in the absence of infection, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref026">26</xref>]. Compared with the other cell subsets examined, a smaller fraction (&lt;10%) of AvM incorporated EdU, and the frequency and number of EdU<sup>+</sup> AvM was unaffected by <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection at any time point examined. Also, unlike the other cell subsets examined, there was no detectable increase in the total number of AvM in lungs of infected mice compared with uninfected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The majority of mononuclear cell subsets in the lung parenchyma of infected mice had low (1–2%) expression of Ki67, while ~10% of CD103<sup>+</sup>/XCR1<sup>+</sup> DC were Ki67<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s007">S7G Fig</xref>). Thus, the majority of professional phagocyte subsets we identified were derived by differentiation from Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, while CD103<sup>+</sup>/XCR1<sup>+</sup> DC and AvM proliferated in situ with minimal contribution from monocytes.</p>
<p>Finally, we calculated the total number of potential monocyte precursors within the lung vasculature and compared it to the total number of putative monocyte-derived populations in the parenchyma. We determined the area-under-the-curve for lung vasculature Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> and Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes as well as DCs throughout 7 days post EdU pulse for each phase and compared it to the area-under-the-curve for parenchymal monocytes, RPM, Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> DC, CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC and CD103<sup>+</sup>/XCR1<sup>+</sup> DC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s007">S7H Fig</xref>). The turnover of circulating EdU<sup>+</sup> precursors of vascular monocytes, MP and DC populations was greater than the combined number of these parenchymal populations in uninfected mice and at all phases of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection. Thus, the turnover of recently-proliferated vascular monocytes is sufficient to account for the turnover in monocyte-derived cells in the lung parenchyma.</p>

<title>Maturation and activation of monocytes as they differentiate into DC and MP subsets</title>
<p>We further characterized the differentiation of recently-proliferated monocytes and their descendants into cells with antigen-presenting potential by comparing the expression of MHCII in new (EdU<sup>+</sup>) cells relative to all cells of each subset. Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes within in the lungs increased their expression of MHCII as they moved from the vasculature into the parenchyma and differentiated into Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> and CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g004">Fig 4</xref>). At 12h after an EdU pulse, in the lung parenchyma and vasculature EdU<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes expressed significantly less surface MHCII than the total population of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes. New Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> DC, CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC and CD103<sup>+</sup> DC also had significantly lower expression of MHCII when compared to total MHCII expression of these subsets. However, by 24h all populations of new EdU<sup>+</sup> had upregulated MHCII to the same level as their respective total population. These data support previous work demonstrating the upregulation of MHCII by Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes as they transition from the vasculature into peripheral tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref029">29</xref>].</p>

<p>Amongst all myeloid cells in the MLN that contain bacteria, Ly6C<sup>−</sup> CD11b<sup>hi</sup> CD11c<sup>hi</sup> MHCII<sup>+</sup> cells constitute the largest population infected with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> at all time points examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s008">S8B Fig</xref>), in agreement with previous studies that were limited to early time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref009">9</xref>]. There were also minor populations of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> DC (CD11b<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> MHCII<sup>+</sup>) infected with <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>, while few of the CD11b<sup>−</sup> DC (Ly6C<sup>−</sup> CD11b<sup>lo</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> MHCII<sup>hi</sup> and Ly6C<sup>−</sup> CD11b<sup>lo</sup> CD11c<sup>hi</sup> MHCII<sup>+</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref009">9</xref>] contained bacteria as detected by flow cytometry.</p>
<p>Ly6C<sup>−</sup> CD11b<sup>lo</sup> CD11c<sup>hi</sup> MHCII<sup>+</sup> DC rapidly incorporated EdU following the pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g005">Fig 5</xref>), suggesting they proliferated within the MLN and supporting their classification as resident DC. The other mononuclear cell subsets examined all showed increasing EdU incorporation over time, albeit with different kinetics between populations and infection phases. Furthermore, each of these populations had different levels of EdU incorporation 24 h post pulse, potentially reflecting varied contributions of proliferation within the MLN. Of the mononuclear cell populations subsets examined, Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> DC decayed most rapidly, consistent with their differentiation into other DC subsets. Other mononuclear subsets also decayed in the MLN during the 7 days following the EdU pulse, indicating that their populations remain dynamic as late as 16 weeks post-infection.</p>
<p>Mononuclear cells present in the MLN during <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection might arrive from the blood via high endothelial venules (HEV) or from the lungs through afferent lymphatics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref034">34</xref>]. Monocytes expressing CD62L bind to heavily glycosylated molecules expressed on HEV and enter into lymph nodes from the blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref035">35</xref>]. To determine the contribution of blood-derived, HEV-recruited monocytes to the mononuclear cell subsets present during <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection we blocked CD62L in conjunction with an EdU pulse to identify recently-proliferated and/or recruited cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s008">S8C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>As expected, there were profound reductions in total cell numbers in the MLN and peripheral LNs following anti-CD62L treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s008">S8D Fig</xref>). However, there were no significant differences in the total numbers of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in any of the compartments we evaluated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s008">S8E Fig</xref>). To compare the relative contribution of HEV-migration on monocytes and mononuclear cell subsets within the LN that had drastically different total cell numbers we evaluated the relative fraction of EdU incorporation between anti-CD62L-treated and control mice. There was a small but significant reduction in the frequency of EdU<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in the MLN following CD62L blockade while there were no differences in the BM, blood, pLN or lungs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s008">S8F Fig</xref>). In contrast to the small reduction in proportion of new Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in the MLN, there were no differences in EdU incorporation in Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> DC, total CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC in the lungs or in the multiple mononuclear cell subsets in the lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s008">S8G–S8I Fig</xref>). Thus, a small fraction of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes are directly entering into the MLN, while the majority of these cells arrive from the lungs through the afferent lymphatics. The vast majority of potential <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-harboring mononuclear subsets within the MLN are derived from cells that have passed through the lung lymphatics or proliferated within the MLN.</p>

<title>Recently proliferated myeloid cells enter granulomas and become infected shortly after arrival</title>
<p>Since only a small minority of the cells that accumulate at the site of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection in the lungs harbor bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref004">4</xref>], we investigated whether the bacteria remain in the same cells for long periods, or whether they are acquired by new cells. We took advantage of EdU labeling to identify new cells and to localize and quantitate the presence of fluorescent protein-expressing bacteria in the recently-proliferated cells.</p>
<p>Immunofluorescence microscopy of lung sections revealed that by day three following the EdU pulse recently-proliferated (EdU<sup>+</sup>) CD11b<sup>+</sup> professional phagocytes are evident within granulomas containing GFP-expressing <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>, 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) or 8 weeks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s009">S9 Fig</xref>) after infection. Consistent with the evidence from flow cytometry studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), EdU<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells were most apparent at day 3 post pulse and became subsequently less abundant in lung lesions over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). This timing corresponds to the peak numbers of EdU<sup>+</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells in the lung parenchyma, which were comprised of both mononuclear cell subsets and neutrophils by flow cytometry (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s007">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s010">S10A</xref>).

<p>To quantitate new (EdU pulse-labeled) cells that become infected soon after they appear in the lungs, we used flow cytometry to detect the coincidence of EdU labeling and <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv-mCherry in the cell subsets of interest. Because the numbers of EdU<sup>+</sup> Rv<sup>+</sup> cells in the MLN were so infrequent, we were only able to quantify newly infected cells within the lung. Examination at either 4 weeks or 16 weeks post infection revealed that a fraction of the EdU<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> DC, CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC, RPM, neutrophils and AvM contained bacteria as early as one day after the EdU pulse (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g005">5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g005">5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s010">S10C and S10D</xref>). At both time points post infection, the frequency of infected EdU<sup>+</sup> cells increased progressively in each of these cell subsets, up to 7 days post EdU (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g005">5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s005">S5C</xref>).</p>
<p>We also characterized the dynamics of infection with an alternative approach, by determining the fraction of bacteria-containing cell subsets that were comprised of EdU<sup>+</sup> new cells. Most infected cell subsets contained increasing amounts of EdU<sup>+</sup> cells over the week post EdU pulse, with up to 10–20% recently proliferated cells at both 4 and 16 weeks after infection (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007154.g005">5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007154.s010">S10E</xref>). In contrast, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes week 16 post infection and neutrophils at both infection phases had a substantially higher proportion of new cells, up to 50% and 40% EdU<sup>+</sup> respectively. Instead of continuously increasing, the proportion of these infected cells peaked in EdU staining before rapidly diminishing to 20–25% of the peak the following day. The large fraction of these particular subsets that is composed of new cells and the drastic loss of EdU staining is indicative of their relative short half-lives within granulomas before differentiating, migrating or dying.</p>
<p>These data demonstrate that newly-proliferated and -differentiated mononuclear cells are constantly trafficking to the infected lung where they are able to enter granulomas during the early and the later phase of infection. Importantly, these results also reveal that new mononuclear cells become infected shortly after their appearance at the site of infection, indicating that while the overall bacterial population remains at a steady state, the bacteria themselves are regularly entering new cellular environments. Since these data are only able to reveal the acquisition of bacteria by the new/EdU<sup>+</sup> cells which are a small fraction of the total population at a given time, our results likely underestimate the frequency of bacterial transfer from cell to cell that is ongoing at the site of infection, even after development of adaptive immune responses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we advanced the understanding of host cell and bacterial dynamics during the chronic stage of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection, after the development of adaptive immunity. Consistent with reports in sterile inflammation models, we found that Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> blood monocytes differentiate into multiple subsets of dendritic cells and macrophages in the lungs and lymph nodes of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice. Using a recently-described method of distinguishing cells that reside in the vascular space from those in the tissue parenchyma, we determined that Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes differentiate into Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocytes that remain in the lung vascular space in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice. Using the same method, we determined that differentiation of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> cells into other subsets happens after egress from the vascular compartment, without transitioning through a Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> state. In particular, we determined that Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes rapidly differentiate into Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> MHCII<sup>+</sup> population of DC, which is a transient intermediate state followed by differentiation into CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC in the lungs. Although our evidence is indirect, we found kinetic evidence that both Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> and CD11b<sup>+</sup> DC migrate and transport bacteria from the lungs to the lung-draining mediastinal lymph node, consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>We also determined that the response to <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection in mice includes peripheral blood monocytosis, as observed in children and adult humans with TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref025">25</xref>], and using pulse-chase DNA labeling, we determined that peripheral blood monocytosis is due to enhanced production and egress from the bone marrow and not due to delayed egress from the blood. Pulse-chase DNA labeling further confirmed the capacity and kinetics of differentiation of monocyte-derived cells and established that the monocyte-derived professional phagocyte populations in the lungs and lymph nodes of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice are dynamic and turn over with a half-life of less than one week. The finding that the monocyte-derived cell subsets that harbor <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> turn over frequently suggested that the bacteria must exchange their cellular niches frequently, and we confirmed this prediction by detecting <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> in newly-arrived cells in the lungs, indicating that the bacteria must respond regularly and rapidly to distinct cellular environments.</p>
<p>Although the dynamics of mononuclear cells in localized mycobacterial infections has gotten little recent attention, there are precedents in other animal models, and evidence to suggest similar events in humans. Nearly 50 years ago, administration of radiolabeled thymidine was used to characterize mononuclear cell recruitment and death at skin sites of injection of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>bovis</italic> BCG in rabbits, and revealed that in contrast to prior assumptions, granuloma mononuclear cell populations are dynamic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref036">36</xref>]. However, at the time those experiments were performed, it was not possible to distinguish distinct subsets of mononuclear cells or their differentiation other than by their morphology. More recent studies used adoptive transfer of bone marrow monocytes during <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection of mice, and revealed tissue-dependent differentiation into multiple subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells, with distinct patterns of differentiation in the lungs and the lung-draining lymph nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref015">15</xref>]. Our findings extend those results by revealing that Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells appear after Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes enter the lung parenchyma and are transient intermediates that subsequently differentiate into CD11c<sup>hi</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells. This observation helps reconcile apparently different results of analysis of the cells that transport <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> from the lungs to the lung-draining mediastinal lymph node: one study attributed this property to inflammatory monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref008">8</xref>], while another reported that CD11b<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells are responsible for bacterial transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref009">9</xref>]. Our present results indicate that the inflammatory monocytes credited with bacterial transport likely differentiate into Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells after entering the lung parenchyma, where they acquire bacteria and differentiate further into CD11b<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells, which contain bacteria and appear in the draining lymph node [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Other recent studies have emphasized the importance of tissue-dependent differentiation of monocytes in tuberculosis, and certain of these have revealed important functional differences of monocyte-derived cell subsets. In particular, administration of poly-ICLC, a potent inducer of type I interferon expression, impaired control of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> in the lungs of mice, due to CCR2-dependent recruitment of monocyte-derived cells that are especially permissive for intracellular bacterial survival and/or growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref014">14</xref>]. In contrast, a recent study reported that interstitial macrophages that depended on CCL2 for their recruitment, are more able to constrain <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> fitness as reflected by use of fluorescent reporter plasmids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref002">2</xref>]. These seemingly contradictory results emphasize the potential plasticity of cells that differentiate from monocytes, which is likely the product of early programming of monocytes as well as of signals for differentiation and activation at the site of infection. Notably, studies in zebrafish embryos infected with virulent <italic>M</italic>. <italic>marinum</italic> have revealed that recruited macrophages are less able to control intracellular mycobacterial growth compared with tissue-resident macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref037">37</xref>]. As bacterial spread to recruited macrophages was a function of bacterial phenolic glycolipid, these results indicate that pathogen virulent factors can also act by directing bacteria to cells that are poorly equipped to kill them.</p>
<p>Although studies similar to ours have not been performed in humans or with human samples, it is noteworthy that cell subsets comparable to the ones studied here can be detected in human lung tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref038">38</xref>]. Likewise, recent studies of human monocytes have revealed a comparable pattern of cell turnover and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref039">39</xref>], indicating that in humans with tuberculosis, cell populations localized to the site of infection in granulomas may exhibit dynamic states of turnover and differentiation similar to those that we have found in <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice.</p>
<p>The finding that mononuclear cell populations are in a dynamic state during the chronic stage of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection may have clinical value. First, our findings that MNP populations are dynamic, even during the chronic phase of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection suggests that mechanisms that perturb the dynamics of MNP trafficking and differentiation may underlie or contribute to the transition from latent TB infection to active TB disease and/or the severity of TB disease. Evidence consistent with this hypothesis is that pulmonary TB in patients with diabetes mellitus, which has poorer outcomes compared with those of pulmonary TB in those without diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref042">42</xref>] is characterized by decreased frequencies of blood monocyte and dendritic cell populations compared with those in patients without diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref043">43</xref>]. Second, a recent study revealed that 'trained hematopoietic stem cells' that produce epigenetically-modified monocytes and macrophages are capable of contributing to control of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> infection in mice, in a manner that is independent of T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007154.ref019">19</xref>]. Our finding that recruited macrophage populations are dynamic and that newly-arrived cells have access to bacteria even during the chronic stage of infection, implies that modification of cell populations to better restrict and/or kill <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> may have therapeutic value in humans with drug-resistant tuberculosis, and may shorten the length of effective treatment, even in those with drug-susceptible tuberculosis.</p>

<title>Half-lives of Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes during multiple phases of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection.</title>
<p><italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-infected mice were injected with EdU and its incorporation by dividing monocytes was evaluated by flow cytometry at multiple time points. Exponential one-phase decay calculations were performed for Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes during each infection phase and in each tissue. A) Tabulated results of half-lives calculated from exponential best-fit lines of %EdU<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes and the R<sup>2</sup> coefficient of determination. Comparison of fits for the slopes of the best-fit lines of %EdU<sup>+</sup> Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes for each organ from infected or naïve mice.
