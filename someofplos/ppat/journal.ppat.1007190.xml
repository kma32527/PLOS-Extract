<abstract>
<p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71) causes hand, foot and mouth disease, a mild and self-limited illness that is sometimes associated with severe neurological complications. EV71 neurotropic determinants remain ill-defined to date. We previously identified a mutation in the VP1 capsid protein (L97R) that was acquired over the course of a disseminated infection in an immunocompromised host. The mutation was absent in the respiratory tract but was present in the gut (as a mixed population) and in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (as a dominant species). In this study, we demonstrated that this mutation does not alter the dependence of EV71 on the human scavenger receptor class B2 (SCARB2), while it enables the virus to bind to the heparan sulfate (HS) attachment receptor and modifies viral tropism in cell lines and in respiratory, intestinal and neural tissues. Variants with VP1<sub>97L</sub> or VP1<sub>97R</sub> were able to replicate to high levels in intestinal and neural tissues and, to a lesser extent, in respiratory tissues, but their preferred entry site (from the luminal or basal tissue side) differed in respiratory and intestinal tissues and correlated with HS expression levels. These data account for the viral populations sequenced from the patient’s respiratory and intestinal samples and suggest that improved dissemination, resulting from an acquired ability to bind HS, rather than specific neurotropism determinants, enabled the virus to reach and infect the central nervous system. Finally, we showed that iota-carrageenan, a highly sulfated polysaccharide, efficiently blocks the replication of HS-dependent variants in cells and 2D neural cultures. Overall, the results of this study emphasize the importance of HS binding in EV71 pathogenesis and open new avenues for the development of antiviral molecules that may prevent this virus’s dissemination.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has been the cause of major hand-foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. However, the recent emergence of severe neurological cases associated with EV71 infection in Europe and the lack of an efficient vaccine or antiviral agent to fight EV71 infections highlight two critical needs: (A) the identification of ill-defined viral factors that contribute to viral dissemination and pathogenesis in humans and (B) the development of effective antiviral strategies. Herein, based on clinical observation in an immunocompromised host, we have demonstrated that heparan sulfate attachment receptor played a critical role in EV71 virulence and that “in host” EV71 adaptation to a heparan sulfate-dependent virus was likely responsible for its dissemination. To our knowledge, this is the first study highlighting the key determinants of EV71 dissemination based on a clinical case and proposing a new therapeutic approach against EV71 neurological diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of a limited number of enterovirus genotypes that have the ability to infect the central nervous system (CNS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref003">3</xref>] and has emerged as a major health-care threat across the Asia-Pacific region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref007">7</xref>]. Although this virus is typically associated with mild hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) epidemics, EV71 has been increasingly associated with neurological disorders that range from aseptic meningitis with or without pulmonary edema to brain stem encephalitis and poliomyelitis-like acute flaccid paralysis, particularly among children less than 6 years old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref010">10</xref>]. EV71 transmission depends on hygiene, water quality, and the extent of crowding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref011">11</xref>]. EV71 is typically transmitted through fecal-oral routes, although transmission via respiratory secretions also frequently occurs, particularly in countries with high standard sanitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Following infection, EV71 predominantly replicates in the intestinal mucosa and, to a lesser extent, in the respiratory mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref014">14</xref>]. Subsequently, the virus can enter the bloodstream and disseminate to a variety of organs, including the central nervous system (CNS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref015">15</xref>]. EV71 dissemination to the CNS remains a rare event and the viral neurotropic determinants remain ill-defined, despite extensive epidemiological studies and experimentation in animal models.</p>
<p>EV71 tissue tropism may be modulated by its ability to bind to a variety of receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref016">16</xref>]. The human scavenger receptor class B2 (SCARB2), a major transmembrane lysosomal protein, is ubiquitously expressed and is the best studied receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref017">17</xref>]. In the human CNS, SCARB2 is expressed on neurons and glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref018">18</xref>], and a transgenic mouse model expressing human SCARB2 has exhibited susceptibility to EV71 infection and the development of ataxia, paralysis and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref019">19</xref>]. The second EV71 entry receptor, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), is expressed exclusively on leukocytes and is only bound by certain EV71 strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref021">21</xref>]. Finally, attachment molecules, such as heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (HS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref022">22</xref>], sialic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref023">23</xref>], nucleolin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref024">24</xref>], vimentin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref025">25</xref>] and annexin II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref026">26</xref>] also enhance EV71 infectivity and may contribute to viral dissemination and neurotropism. Residues that are crucial for the binding of EV71 to certain of these receptors have been mapped on the VP1 viral capsid protein. For instance, 172Q and adjacent amino acids in the EF loop are required for binding to human SCARB2 and for efficient infection of cells expressing this receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref027">27</xref>] while K98E, E145A and L169F substitutions confer binding ability to murine SCARB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref028">28</xref>]. Similarly, EV71 strains with a glycine or a glutamine at position 145 of VP1 are able to bind PSGL-1, while strains with a glutamate at this position are not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref021">21</xref>]. Binding of EV71 to annexin II has been mapped to the BC loop region of VP1 (residues 40–100) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref026">26</xref>]. Finally, positively charged residues at the 5-fold axis of EV71 capsids (VP1 162K, 242K, and 244K) appear to be essential for attachment to HS. When these residues are mutated, compensatory mutations (E98A, T100K and Q145R-T237N) can restore binding. Similarly, strains with 98E and 145E are poor HS binders, while E98K restores binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref029">29</xref>]. These observations are based on <italic>in vitro</italic> adapted EV71 isolates and do not address the <italic>in vivo</italic> significance of dissemination and neurotropism. In addition, the implication of immune escape mutations may add a level of complexity. VP1 residues 98 and 145 have been shown to be under positive selection and may be targeted by neutralizing antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref031">31</xref>]. Finally, EV71 virulence determinants that have been identified in animal models contradict epidemiological studies in humans. VP1 residue 145E was shown to be a virulence factor for both cynomolgus monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref032">32</xref>] and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref034">34</xref>], while isolates with 145G/Q are also frequently associated with severe neurological disease in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref038">38</xref>]. Mutations in other genomic regions may explain these apparent contradictions.</p>
<p>We previously isolated EV71 from an immunocompromised patient with disseminated disease. Genomic analysis revealed that this clinical strain clusters with EV71 in the human EV-A species and is related to the subgenogroup C1. Comparison of five full-length genomes sequenced directly from respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous system and blood specimens highlighted a critical non-synonymous single amino acid change within the EV71 VP1 BC loop (L97R) that could potentially lead to dissemination in natural infections. EV71-VP1<sub>97R</sub>, which was absent in the respiratory sample, was present as a dominant population in blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples and as a mixed population (EV71-VP1<sub>97R/L</sub>) in the stool sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref039">39</xref>]. However, the mechanisms by which the mutant virus could disseminate are not clear. In this study, we investigated the capacity of EV71-VP1<sub>97L</sub> and EV71-VP1<sub>97R</sub> to bind and mediate infection in different cell lines and in 3D reconstituted respiratory, intestinal and neural tissues. We demonstrated that both derivatives are dependent on SCARB2 for effective infection, while their specific tropism is linked to a different ability to bind HS and further correlates with the expression level of this attachment receptor in the tested tissues. This study provides new insight regarding HS binding as a critical determinant of EV71 dissemination in humans and opens the door to antiviral strategies aimed at preventing EV71 in-host adaptation and dissemination.</p>

<p>We previously showed that the VP1 L97R mutation conferred a binding advantage in RD and Vero cells. In addition, we showed <italic>in vitro</italic> that this mutation was associated with a second non-conservative mutation (E167G/A) in the VP1 EF loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref039">39</xref>].

<p>Viral stocks were prepared in monkey kidney cells (Vero) and titrated in Vero, colorectal carcinoma (Caco-2), rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) and neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). After 4 days of infection, viruses were sequenced from each cell line. EV71-VP1<sub>97L167G</sub> and EV71-VP1<sub>97R167E</sub> viral stocks were unstable independent on the cell line (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007190.t001">Table 1</xref>) and thus could not be amplified and purified in sufficient quantities to be used in functional assays. EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> (originally isolated from the lower respiratory tract sample of the patient with a disseminated infection) and EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> (<italic>in vitro</italic> adapted from EV71-VP1<sub>97R167E</sub>, which was originally isolated from the stool, cerebrospinal fluid and blood of the patient) were thus used for all further investigations. Titration showed that EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> and EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> exhibited differential cell tropism, with significantly enhanced replication being observed for EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> in RD and SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Notably, the RNA load measured in the stocks prepared in Vero cells was comparable for the two viruses (12.38 log RNA copies/ml for EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> and 12.30 log RNA copies/ml for EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub>).</p>

<title>EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> and EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> infections are dependent on SCARB2</title>
<p>As SCARB2 plays a critical role for EV71 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref017">17</xref>], we investigated whether the differential cell tropism of the two variants is linked to a different dependence on this receptor. We used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to knockout SCARB2 in Caco-2 and RD cells, two cell lines presenting different susceptibilities to the two variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g001">Fig 1</xref>). A striking reduction in viral titers was observed in SCARB2 knockout RD and Caco-2 cells for EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> and EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g002">Fig 2</xref>) suggesting that both variants depend on this receptor for effective infection regardless of the cell line. This was also shown by transfection of human SCARB2 in mouse L929 cells that are non-permissive for infection by EV71 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref017">17</xref>].

<p>To confirm this observation, competition experiments were performed with a viral stock (EV71-VP1<sub>97R/L-167G/E</sub>) containing equivalent amounts of each derivative. The competition was run under 3 conditions: using untreated cells, using cells having surface HS digested with heparinase, or using a viral population that was pretreated with heparin, a soluble HS analogue. Both binding (1 hour post-infection [hpi]) and replication (24 hpi) efficiencies were monitored by real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and the dominant species was characterized by Sanger sequencing for each binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) and replication condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The overall binding was lower for the mixed population than for the EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> stock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g003">Fig 3B</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g003">3A</xref>). Accordingly, the pretreatment of cells with heparinase reduced viral binding less significantly, while viral replication was affected in SH-SY5Y, Vero and Caco-2 cells. Sanger sequencing of the entire VP1 region after binding showed that in Vero, SH-SY5Y and RD cells, EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> (with R at position 97 encoded by CGC and G at position 167 encoded by GGG) was the dominant variant in non-treated conditions, which was not the case in Caco-2 cells, where EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> (with L at position 97 encoded by CTC and E at position 167 encoded by GAG) and EV71-VP1<sub>97L167G</sub> were dominant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Upon heparinase treatment, the dominant consensus sequence shifted towards EV71-VP1<sub>97R/L167G/E</sub>, EV71-VP1<sub>97L167G/E</sub> or EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> in binding and replication assays. Notably, viral species with a positive charge at VP1 position 98 (K encoded by GAA instead of E encoded by AAA) emerged after treatment of SH-SY5Y, RD and Caco-2 cells with heparinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). Pre-incubation of viruses with heparin also resulted, although in a less stringent manner, in a shift of the dominant population from EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> to a mixed EV71-VP1<sub>97R/L167G/E</sub> population, except after replication in SH-SY5Y and RD cells.</p>
<p>To determine if the improved binding and replication of EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> in cells correlated with HS expression levels, quantification of HS expression was assessed by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). SH-SY5Y, RD and Vero cell lines strongly express HS, while Caco-2 showed low HS expression.</p>
<p>A recent publication showed that variants with VP1 E167G do not bind heparin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref029">29</xref>], and the differential binding and replication of EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> confirmed our previous observations with EV71-VP1<sub>97R167E</sub> in SH-SY5Y and Vero cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref039">39</xref>], indicating that the acquired HS binding ability is due only to the L97R substitution.</p>
<p>Finally, we confirmed the different affinity of EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> and EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> for HS using a heparin sepharose binding assay. After incubation of a mixed viral stock (EV71-VP1<sub>97R/L-167G/E</sub>) composed of 50% of each derivative with sepharose beads, we sequenced the viral populations present in the non-heparin-binding population (flow-through) or in the heparin-binding population (eluate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). As expected, EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> was highlighted in the non-heparin-binding population, while EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> was detected in the heparin-binding population.</p>

These tissues faithfully reproduce the pseudostratified architecture of the upper and lower airway epithelia composed of ciliated cells, mucus secreting cells (as well as club cells in the lower airway) and basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>, upper panels) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref041">41</xref>]. Viral suspensions were applied apically (air exposed side) or basally (liquid exposed side) for 4 hours before removal of unbound viruses by extensive washing. Each day afterwards, apically released viruses were collected and basal medium was changed. Viruses released apically at day 5 pi were quantified by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). Overall replication was low in both tissue types compared to typical respiratory EVs, such as EV-D68 or rhinoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref042">42</xref>], however the infectivity of viruses collected at day 5 pi was confirmed by productive infection in RD cells. No significant difference was observed in the level of replication of EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> and EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> after apical inoculation of MucilAir (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) or SmallAir (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).

<title>Intestinal tissues</title>
<p>As a mixed population of viruses with VP1 97L and VP1 97R was highlighted in the patient’s stool, the experimental approach used for respiratory tissues was applied to assess the replication abilities of EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> and EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> in 3D reconstituted human small intestine tissues (EpiIntestinal, Mattek) cultured at the air-liquid interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In this tissue culture model, that reproduces the cellular composition of the small intestine with enterocytes, paneth cells, M cells, tuft cells and intestinal stem cells, viral loads were more than 2 log higher than those measured in respiratory tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g005">Fig 5A</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). For small intestine tissues as for respiratory tissues, there was no significant difference between the replication of EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> and EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> 5 dpi for the apical inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), while for the basal inoculation, EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> replicated significantly better than EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> and systematically outcompeted the latter variant in competition. However, in contrast to observations made in respiratory tissues, EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> did not outcompete EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> after the apical infection, and both populations were present 5 dpi in a mixed viral population. These data are in agreement with the expression of HS in the tissue, with the attachment receptor being expressed both at the apical and basal side of the tissue, although with higher concentration at the basal tissue side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>).

<title>Iota-carrageenan specifically inhibits infection by EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub></title>
<p>Because of the acquired ability of EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> to bind HS, its sensitivity to iota-carrageenan (ı-carrageenan), a highly sulfated polysaccharide, was investigated and compared to the sensitivity of EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> in Vero and 2D neural cultures. As expected, EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> infection was strongly inhibited by ı-carrageenan in Vero cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 17.8 μg/ml), whereas EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> infection was only slightly affected by the treatment (IC<sub>50</sub>&gt;200 μg/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Similar results were obtained in neural cultures, where the infection of EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> and EV71-VP1<sub>97R/L167G/E</sub> was inhibited up to 90% in a dose-dependent manner. EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> infectivity was also inhibited but to a lesser extent (up to 50%). Treatment of the mixed viral population altered the dominant sequence from EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> at 1 dpi towards EV71-VP1<sub>97R/L167G/E</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007190.g007">Fig 7B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In 2012, we reported an EV71 genogroup C1 disseminated infection in an immunocompromised patient treated with rituximab who was hospitalized with respiratory and neurological symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref039">39</xref>]. Although EV71 genogroup C1 infections have not been associated with severe diseases in the past, several complicated cases have been recently reported in Europe, underscoring the importance of defining EV71 virulence determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref044">44</xref>]. By sequencing the full genome of the virus from different samples, we identified the acquisition of a non-conservative mutation in VP1 (L97R), which was absent at the beginning of the infection in the respiratory tract but was present in a mixed population in the gastrointestinal tract and became dominant in the blood and CSF at later time points. We showed that this mutation conferred a binding advantage to the virus in certain cell lines. In this study, we extended these findings and showed that the VP1 L97R substitution, as well as an associated mutation (VP1 E167G) observed after <italic>in vitro</italic> culturing, confers an ability of the virus to use HS as an attachment receptor while it does not alter the dependence of the virus on the ubiquitously expressed SCARB2 entry receptor. Tan and colleagues recently showed that variants with VP1 E167G do not bind heparin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref029">29</xref>]. In addition, in our previous publication, we observed the same binding advantage of the VP1<sub>97R</sub> mutant in neuroblastoma and Vero cells that was observed in this study with the VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref039">39</xref>]. This strongly suggests that the VP1 L97R mutation confers an HS binding ability, while the VP1 E167G mutation has a stabilizing function as proposed previously based on VP1 3D structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref039">39</xref>]. Interestingly, after competition between EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> and EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> for binding and replication in cells pretreated with heparinase, EV71-VP1<sub>97R</sub> was excluded from the viral population, while a new variant (EV71-VP1<sub>98K</sub>) which is also known to promote HS binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref029">29</xref>], emerged. Thus, it is very likely that after cleavage with heparinase at the 1→4 linkages between hexosamine and glucuronic acid residues, HS is still bound by EV71-VP1<sub>98K</sub> but not by EV71-VP1<sub>97R</sub>, suggesting that these two variants present different HS binding specificities.</p>
<p>To assess EV71 replication <italic>in vivo</italic> in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and in the CNS, we analyzed the replication of HS-dependent (EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub>) and independent (EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub>) variants in relevant tissue culture models that mimicked the upper and lower respiratory airway epithelia, intestinal and neural tissues. To reproduce natural infection routes, we inoculated intestinal and respiratory tissue cultures that grow at an air-liquid interface from the apical (corresponding to the lumen) or basal (corresponding to the blood-borne) tissue sides. A comparison of viral growth of HS-dependent and HS-independent variants and competition experiments highlighted that HS-dependent variants had improved access to respiratory and intestinal tissues from the basal tissue side, where HS is highly expressed, while HS-independent variants show improved replication after infection from the air-exposed side of respiratory tissues, where HS is only slightly present, in line with previous publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref046">46</xref>]. Infection from the luminal side of intestinal tissues sustained efficient replication of both variants and correlated with intermediate expression of HS at this side. We also highlighted high expression of SCARB2 at the apical side of respiratory and intestinal tissues and low expression at the basal side. HS may thus be necessary in tissues with low SCARB2 expression to concentrate the virus at the cell surface and promote subsequent interaction with SCARB2. This would explain why HS-dependent variants infect the basal side of respiratory and intestinal tissues better than HS-independent variants.</p>
<p>Our findings in respiratory and intestinal tissues correlate with the viral populations isolated from the different specimens of the patient. We only observed an HS-independent variant in the bronchoalveolar lavage of the patient, a sample collected from the luminal side of the respiratory tissue. Importantly, sequencing of EV71 that was detected in bronchoalveolar lavages from two other immunosuppressed patients who presented neurological complications in Switzerland also identified viruses from the same genogroup and with the same VP1 sequence (GenBank accession numbers MH256663 and MH256664). Of note in these 2 cases as in our case, the infecting virus had a glutamate at position 145, a residue known to confer poor HS binding ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref029">29</xref>]. This suggests that HS-independent variants may be preferentially transmitted via the respiratory route.</p>
<p>We observed a mixed viral population in the stool of the patient, a sample that reflects viral population isolated from the luminal side of the gastrointestinal tract. A mixed viral population was also obtained after apical inoculation of intestinal tissue cultures with a viral population composed of EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> and EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub>. Since both <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> intestinal tissues are the favored site of EV71 replication, and since these tissues express HS at the basal and apical surface, it is very likely that the emergence of an HS-dependent virus arose at this site. Whether this site was reached after replication in the respiratory tract and propagation via shedding in oral secretions and swallowing or whether infection occurred simultaneously in the two sites remains an open question.</p>
<p>Concerning neurotropism, the viral population sequenced from the CSF of the patient was HS-dependent while results obtained in 2D and 3D neural cultures were more intricate. In single infections, HS-dependent and HS-independent variants revealed similar neurotropic potential as both showed high replication levels in primary neural cells without significant difference 5 dpi. However, in competition experiments, HS-independent variants outcompeted HS-dependent variants 5 dpi while the opposite occurred at earlier time points (1 hpi and 1 dpi in 2D and 4 hpi in 3D cultures). The higher amount of cell-associated HS-dependent viruses shortly after inoculation is easily explicable by the high expression of HS in neural tissues. However, the fact that the improved binding is not reflected by an improved replicative fitness 5 dpi is less obvious. A similar situation was observed in Vero cells where the binding advantage of EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> did not result in improved replication relative to EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub>. Whether another step of the viral life is affected by the VP1 L97R mutation in Vero, 2D and 3D neural cultures is currently under investigation. Of note in this study and in our previous publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref039">39</xref>], the HS-dependent variant was fitter in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells at any time post infection. This difference between primary neural cultures and immortalized cells may rely on the nature of these culture models (cancer neuron precursors for neuroblastoma cells versus mature neurons and glial cells for both 2D and 3D neural cultures) and emphasizes the need to use relevant primary tissue culture models to study viral pathogenesis.</p>
<p>Two explanations may account for the detection of HS-dependent virus only in the patient’s CSF and our experimental observations that the HS-independent virus outcompetes the HS-dependent virus in neural tissues 5 dpi (thought both variants replicate to high level in independent infections). First, the patient’s CSF may have been sampled shortly after neural invasion, at a time where the HS-dependent variant was also fitter in neural cultures. However, this would imply that both variants were present together in the CNS where the HS-dependent variants outcompeted the HS-independent variants. The fact that only HS-dependent variants were found in the patient’s blood does not support this hypothesis. More probably, the ability to bind HS promoted EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> replication in HS-enriched tissues (such as the basal layers of the gastrointestinal mucosa, muscle or endothelial cells), resulting in sustained viremia and subsequent dissemination to neural tissues. In this context, EV71 neurotropism may not rely on an improved growth in neural tissues but rather on an improved dissemination ability selected upstream of CNS contamination over the course of an infection.</p>
<p>The implication of HS binding in dissemination and neurotropism has been investigated for several viruses and remains controversial. Studies on aphtoviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref047">47</xref>], flaviviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref048">48</xref>], togaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref049">49</xref>], alphaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref050">50</xref>] and even enteroviruses such as coxsackievirus B3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref051">51</xref>] suggest that binding to HS may lower viremia due to virus trapping in tissues expressing high HS levels, while it may improve neurotropism and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref052">52</xref>]. Of note, two recent papers reported that infection by EV71 with VP1 E145Q substitution was associated with an attenuated phenotype in mice and cynomolgus monkeys and that this attenuation was linked to the ability of VP1 145Q to bind HS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref034">34</xref>]. The authors conclude that HS binding and <italic>in vivo</italic> virulence are negatively correlated due to trapping and abortive infection of HS-dependent viruses in tissues expressing high levels of HS but low levels of SCARB2. In the clinical case investigated here, the HS binding variant was the only variant sequenced from the blood of the patient suggesting that HS binding did not prevent viremia and dissemination but rather promoted it. Several hypotheses could explain these different observations: first, mice and monkeys may not faithfully reproduce EV71 infection in human as suggested by studies showing that isolates with VP1 145G/Q are frequently associated with severe neurological disease in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref038">38</xref>]; second, the inoculation site may modulate the infection outcome. Huang and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref053">53</xref>] showed that broad mutant spectra with divergent mutations are observed at the initial infection sites (the respiratory and digestive systems) and that a selection bottleneck occurs afterwards with subsequent enrichment of advantageous mutations in the viral population. Intraperitoneal or intravenous injections may thus prevent the natural evolution of the viral population observed after fecal-oral or respiratory transmission; third, the binding affinity for HS may differ according to the number and/or location of positive charges on the viral capsid, and different mutations (VP1 E145Q versus VP1 L97R) may result in different binding intensities and different trapping strengths; finally, the host immunity certainly plays a key role. In the clinical case presented here, the patient underwent immunosuppressive therapy with rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody that depletes the peripheral B‐cell pool. Seroneutralisation experiments performed with the patients’ serum at a time when the VP1 97R mutation was already present in the plasma failed to highlight the presence of an antibody-mediated selective immune pressure against HS-dependent and HS-independent variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref039">39</xref>]. This absence of neutralizing antibodies was correlated with a negative complement fixation assay confirming a poor antibody response against enterovirus linked to the immunosuppressed state of the patient. Fujii et al showed that viruses with VP1 145E are more resistant to neutralizing antibodies than viruses with VP1 145G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref031">31</xref>]. The absence of immune pressure may thus be a prerequisite for the emergence of HS-dependent variants <italic>in vivo</italic>, since critical residues, such as VP1 98 and 145, seem to play an important role both in immune escape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref031">31</xref>] and HS binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref055">55</xref>]. The emergence of HS-dependent mutants and their dissemination could thus be favored in the presence of a poor antibody response. Additional clinical investigations are needed to further assess the implication of HS binding in dissemination and disease severity in humans.</p>
<p>The recent emergence of severe cases associated with EV71 genogroup C1 infections and the lack of an efficient vaccine or antiviral to fight EV71 infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref057">57</xref>] highlights an important need for the development of effective antiviral strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007190.ref058">58</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrated the key role of HS attachment receptor binding in EV71 dissemination in an immunocompromised host, and our preliminary results in cells and neural cultures highlighted the inhibition of HS-dependent variants by soluble HS mimetic compounds. Soluble heparan sulfate analogs may thus be a useful tool to limit enterovirus replication and dissemination. In conclusion, our data may help to unravel the key determinants of EV71 dissemination and neurotropism and bridge the gap between EV71 neurological diseases and the lack of a therapeutic approach.</p>

<title>I-carrageenan inhibition assay</title>
<p>I-carrageenan (C1138, Sigma-Aldrich, Merck, Switzerland) was serially diluted and added for 1h at 37°C to EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub>, EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> or EV71-VP1<sub>97R/L167E/G</sub> (multiplicity of infection [MOI], 0.01 PFU/cell). The mixture was then added to confluent 2D neural cells or Vero cells grown in a 96-well plate at a density of 13 × 10<sup>4</sup>/well. After 1 h at 37°C, monolayers were washed and overlaid with fresh medium. One dpi, viral replication was monitored by immunocytochemistry (ICC) in Vero cells and by RT-qPCR in neural cells.</p>
<p>For ICC, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with cold methanol:acetone (1:1) for 1 min and permeabilised with PBS-Triton 0.1% for 5 min on ice. Cells were then incubated 1h at 37°C with mouse anti-EV71 VP2 monoclonal antibody (MAB979, Millipore, Merck, Switzerland; diluted 1:500 in PBS-BSA 1%). After 3 washes with PBS-Triton 0.1%, cells were incubated 1 h at 37°C with the anti-mouse HRP-labelled secondary antibody (7076, Cell Signaling Technology; diluted 1:1000 in PBS-BSA 1%). After extensive washing, DAB substrate solution (D4293-50SET, Sigma-Aldrich, Merck, Switzerland) was added for 15 min before final washing with PBS. More than 400 cells per well were scored under a light microscope. The percent of inhibition of virus infectivity was determined by comparing the percentage of infected cells in presence of increasing concentrations of ı-carrageenan relative to the percent of infected cells in absence of ı-carrageenan (set as reference at 100%). All data were generated from duplicate wells in three independent experiments.</p>
<p>For quantification by RT-qPCR, neural cultures were lysed in 200 μl of easyMAG lysis buffer. RNA was extracted, viral replication was quantified by RT-qPCR and VP1 was PCR amplified and sequenced.

An LR recombination reaction was performed between the entry clone containing the SCARB2 coding sequence (pENTR-L1-SCARB2-L2, Clone ID IOH9776, Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland), the entry clone containing the ubiquitin promoter (pENTR-L4-UBI-L1R, gift from Patrick Salmon, Addgene plasmid # 45959) and the destination vector containing attR sites (pCWX-R4-DEST-R2-PGK-GFP, kindly provided by Prof. Karl-Heinz Krause, University of Geneva). Sub confluent mouse L929 cells, were transfected with pCWX-UBI-SCARB2-PGK-GFP or pCLX-UBI-GFP (gift from Patrick Salmon, Addgene # 27245). After 24 h, the cells were infected with EV71-VP1<sub>97R167G</sub> and EV71-VP1<sub>97L167E</sub> at an MOI of 0.2. 24 h post infection cells were lysed with RIPA (Tris 50 mM- pH 7, NaCl 150 mM, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100) and analysed by Western Blot both for quantification of SCARB2 expression and to highlight expression of viral protein. To this end, protein were loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred on a PVDF membrane (162–0177, BIO-RAD, Switzerland) that was hybridized with the primary rabbit anti- LIMPII/Igp85 (SCARB2) Ab (PA3-1682, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Switzerland, diluted 1:1000 in 5% milk/TTBS 0.05%), mouse anti-EV71 VP2 mAb (MAB979, Millipore, Merck, Switzerland, diluted 1:1000 in 5% milk/TTBS 0.05%) and mouse anti-GAPDH mAb (6C5, sc-32233, Santa Cruz, Switzerland) overnight at 4°C.
