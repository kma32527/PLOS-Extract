<abstract>
<p>Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent of three human malignancies, the endothelial cell cancer Kaposi’s sarcoma, and two B cell cancers, Primary Effusion Lymphoma and multicentric Castleman’s disease. KSHV has latent and lytic phases of the viral life cycle, and while both contribute to viral pathogenesis, lytic proteins contribute to KSHV-mediated oncogenesis. Reactivation from latency is driven by the KSHV lytic gene transactivator RTA, and RTA transcription is controlled by epigenetic modifications. To identify host chromatin-modifying proteins that are involved in the latent to lytic transition, we screened a panel of inhibitors that target epigenetic regulatory proteins for their ability to stimulate KSHV reactivation. We found several novel regulators of viral reactivation: an inhibitor of Bmi1, PTC-209, two additional histone deacetylase inhibitors, Romidepsin and Panobinostat, and the bromodomain inhibitor (+)-JQ1. All of these compounds stimulate lytic gene expression, viral genome replication, and release of infectious virions. Treatment with Romidepsin, Panobinostat, and PTC-209 induces histone modifications at the RTA promoter, and results in nucleosome depletion at this locus. Finally, silencing Bmi1 induces KSHV reactivation, indicating that Bmi1, a member of the Polycomb repressive complex 1, is critical for maintaining KSHV latency.</p>

<p>Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causative agent of three human malignancies. KSHV establishes latent infection but can be reactivated from latency to the lytic phase of the viral life cycle to propagate. KSHV reactivation from latency is controlled by epigenetic changes at the promoter of the lytic gene transactivator, RTA. Here a novel inhibitor of a member of Polycomb repressive complex 1, Bmi1, stimulates KSHV reactivation from latency by altering histone modifications and nucleosome density at the RTA promoter. We also identify three additional inhibitors of histone deacetylases and bromodomain-containing proteins that induce KSHV reactivation from latency.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also known as human herpesvirus 8, is the causative agent of three human malignancies, the endothelial cell cancer Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), as well as two B cell cancers, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman’s disease (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref001">1</xref>]). KSHV establishes latent infections, where only a few viral genes and microRNAs are expressed, but can be reactivated from latency to the lytic phase of the viral life cycle, where all viral genes are expressed, the viral genome is replicated, and progeny virions are released. Although the majority of KSHV positive cells in PEL and KS are latently infected, the virus undergoes spontaneous reactivation in a fraction of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref002">2</xref>]. It is thought that spontaneous reactivation contributes to KSHV maintenance, and that certain lytic proteins shape the clinical pathology of KS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Upon initial infection, the KSHV genome is rapidly chromatinized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref006">6</xref>]. Epigenetic modifications play a role in KSHV reactivation from latency as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors such as sodium butyrate (NaB) and DNA demethylating agents such as 5-azacytidine stimulate reactivation <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref009">9</xref>] and in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref010">10</xref>]. Expression of the KSHV lytic gene transactivator RTA is necessary and sufficient to drive the lytic program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref014">14</xref>]. During latency, the RTA promoter is associated with HDACs and with Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref017">17</xref>]. EZH2 is the catalytic subunit of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which trimethylates histone 3 on lysine residue 27 (H3K27me3). Thus, histones at the RTA promoter are hypoacetylated and bear H3K27me3, both of which are associated with repressed transcription. The KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA/ORF73) also antagonizes the RTA promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref018">18</xref>] and interacts with bromodomain-containing proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref021">21</xref>], which bind acetylated histones. Analysis of nucleosome density by formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) did not reveal regions of open chromatin in the RTA promoter in latent KSHV genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref022">22</xref>]. On the other hand, markers of active transcription, like histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), are also present at this locus, indicating that this region is transcriptionally repressed but is poised for rapid induction of RTA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref016">16</xref>]. During reactivation induced by treatment with NaB, there is increased histone acetylation, decreased association with EZH2, and decreased levels of H3K27me3 at the RTA promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref016">16</xref>]. Furthermore, the Ini1/SNF5 chromatin remodeling complex is recruited to this locus, and nucleosomes are rapidly depleted as demonstrated by restriction endonuclease accessibility and micrococcal nuclease assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref015">15</xref>]. Thus, RTA transcription and KSHV reactivation are particularly sensitive to epigenetic changes occurring within the KSHV genome.</p>
<p>We previously conducted screens for cellular kinases and natural product extracts that repress or activate KSHV reactivation, respectively, which provided proof of principle that KSHV reactivation screens are possible and represent a means to identify novel regulators of RTA transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref024">24</xref>]. To gain further insight into epigenetic control of the latent to lytic switch, we screened a library of known small molecule inhibitors that target epigenetic regulatory proteins such as histone writers, readers, and erasers for their ability to stimulate KSHV reactivation. Histone writers add post-translational modifications to histones, and include histone methyltransferases like EZH2, as well as histone acetyltransferases, among many others. Histone erasers, such as HDACs and histone demethylases, remove modifications from histones. Histone readers bind to histone modifications and impact a variety of processes like chromatin remodeling and transcription. These proteins include methyl-lysine readers, such as chromodomain-containing proteins, and acetyl-lysine readers, the most common of which are the bromodomain-containing proteins. Thus, by screening inhibitors that target a range of chromatin regulatory proteins, we aimed to identify host proteins that are critical for the maintenance of KSHV latency.</p>

<title>Screen for inhibitors that induce KSHV reactivation from latency</title>
<p>To identify host chromatin-modifying proteins that are essential for maintaining KSHV latency, we screened 62 known small molecule inhibitors that target epigenetic regulatory proteins for their ability to stimulate KSHV reactivation. These compounds fell within several categories, including inhibitors of bromodomains, HDACs, histone methyltransferases, methyl-lysine readers, histone demethylases, and others. Each compound, or DMSO as a negative control, was incubated at a concentration of 1 μM for 48 hours with BJAB cells latently infected with rKSHV.219, a recombinant virus that expresses GFP from the constitutively active EF-1α promoter, expresses RFP from the KSHV PAN lytic promoter, and expresses a puromycin resistance gene as a selectable marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref025">25</xref>]. BJAB-KSHV.219 cells were selected for this study as regions of open chromatin in the KSHV genome are conserved in these cells and PEL cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref022">22</xref>]. Following inhibitor treatment, GFP and RFP expression were assayed by flow cytometry. The compounds that induced appreciable KSHV reactivation after 48 hours were the HDAC inhibitors LAQ824 (Dacinostat), Trichostatin A (TSA), SAHA (Vorinostat), CAY10603, Romidepsin, and Panobinostat, where 5–25% of treated cells were RFP positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007267.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The same compounds induced reactivation in latently infected 293 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007267.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). The TSA and SAHA results are consistent with previously published reports where these compounds induced KSHV reactivation in a subset of latently infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref027">27</xref>], thus validating the screen. Although it is well established that HDAC inhibitors can induce KSHV reactivation from latency, two of the most potent stimulators of reactivation, the pan-HDAC inhibitors Romidepsin and Panobinostat, have not previously been shown to stimulate KSHV reactivation.</p>

<p>To identify additional inhibitors that reactivate KSHV from latency, several modifications were made to the experimental design. First, we increased the working concentration of each compound to 10 μM. Second, as it can take several days for an appreciable decrease in histone methylation to occur following inhibition of methyltransferase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref028">28</xref>], we increased the time of incubation with each compound to five days. Under these conditions, one of the most effective stimulators of KSHV reactivation from latency was PTC-209 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref029">29</xref>], where reactivation occurred in approximately 10% of treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007267.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). PTC-209 is reported to reduce transcription of B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi1), although the molecular details of its mechanism of action and selectivity versus other potential targets has not been well defined. Bmi1 is a member of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), which monoubiquitinates histone 2A on lysine residue 119 (H2AK119ub) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref030">30</xref>]. Bmi1 functions to enhance the enzymatic activity of the PRC1 catalytic subunit, a RING1 ubiquitin ligase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref031">31</xref>]. Additionally, all of the HDAC inhibitors except PCI-34051 induced reactivation in 5–12% of treated cells. Several bromodomain inhibitors also stimulated reactivation, all of which target the BET family of bromodomains which includes BRD2, -3, and -4. The most potent of these inhibitors was (+)-JQ1, where reactivation occurred in 5% of treated cells. Other bromodomain inhibitors that induced reactivation, including PFI-1, Bromosporine, I-BET762 (GSK525762A), I-BET151, and OTX015, were less effective, and stimulated reactivation in 2–3% of treated cells. KSHV reactivation was also induced by the JMJD3 histone demethylase inhibitor GSK-J4 and the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor Decitabine in 2% and 4% of treated cells, respectively. The same set of compounds also induced KSHV reactivation in 293-KSHV.219 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007267.s001">S1B Fig</xref>), although PTC-209 was somewhat less effective in these cells, where reactivation was induced in 3.3% of treated cells. As PTC-209 and (+)-JQ1 were the most potent of the non-HDAC inhibitors, these were also selected for further analysis.</p>
<p>Under the culture conditions tested thus far, the EZH2 inhibitors included in the screen, UNC1999, EPZ-6438, GSK343, GSK126, EI1, and EPZ011989, did not induce appreciable KSHV reactivation. This was surprising given that H3K27me3 is associated with latent KSHV genomes and suppressed RTA expression, and the EZH2 inhibitor 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) has previously been demonstrated to induce KSHV reactivation from latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref016">16</xref>]. To determine the effectiveness of these EZH2 inhibitors at higher concentrations, we tested 3-fold serial dilutions of each compound starting from 50 μM. UNC1999 and GSK126 were the most potent inducers of KSHV reactivation, which was stimulated in approximately 35 percent of cells treated with the highest concentration of these inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007267.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). This was comparable to the level of reactivation induced by the positive control, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA). EPZ-6438 and GSK343 induced reactivation in 16 and 11 percent of cells, respectively. DZNep, EI1, and EPZ011989 stimulated KSHV reactivation in 6, 5, and 7 percent of cells, respectively. Thus, our data is consistent with previously published reports describing a role for EZH2 in the maintenance of KSHV latency.</p>

<title>Romidepsin, Panobinostat, (+)-JQ1, and PTC-209 induce KSHV lytic gene expression in PEL cells</title>
<p>To confirm that our compounds of interest, Romidepsin, Panobinostat, (+)-JQ1, and PTC-209, induce KSHV reactivation in PEL cells, various PEL lines were incubated with each compound, NaB+TPA as a positive control, or DMSO, and KSHV lytic transcript levels were analyzed by RT-qPCR. Romidepsin and Panobinostat induced expression of vIL-6, ORF57, and K8.1 in all PEL lines tested at levels similar to or exceeding those induced by NaB+TPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007267.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). For example, NaB+TPA treatment induced lytic gene expression by approximately 100- to 1,000-fold in BCBL-1 cells compared to the DMSO control, while Romidepsin and Panobinostat induced lytic gene expression by approximately 200- to 5,000-fold in these cells. Furthermore, we observed increased vIL-6 and ORF45 protein levels in NaB+TPA, Romidepsin, and Panobinostat treated cells compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007267.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Treatment with (+)-JQ1 and PTC-209 also induced KSHV lytic gene expression in all the PEL lines tested, albeit at more modest levels than those induced by NaB+TPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007267.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Expression of vIL-6, ORF57, and K8.1 was induced in NaB+TPA treated cells by levels ranging from 30- to 8000-fold compared to DMSO treated cells. In BCBL-1, JSC-1, and BC-3 cells, (+)-JQ1 induced expression of these genes to levels 2- to 30-fold higher than in DMSO treated cells. BC-1 cells were particularly responsive to (+)-JQ1 treatment, where ORF57 and K8.1 expression were induced to levels approximately 1000- to 2000-fold greater than in DMSO treated cells. Following treatment with PTC-209, vIL-6 expression increased in BCBL-1 and JSC-1 cells by approximately 16- and 2-fold, respectively, and ORF57 and K8.1 expression increased in all the PEL lines tested by 3- to 30-fold. We observed increased vIL-6 protein levels in (+)-JQ1 treated BCBL-1 cells compared to the control, and increased vIL-6 and ORF45 protein levels in PTC-209 treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007267.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Thus, Romidepsin, Panobinostat, (+)-JQ1, or PTC-209 treatment induces KSHV lytic gene expression in PEL cells.</p>

<p>As a thorough analysis of the mechanism by which (+)-JQ1 stimulates KSHV reactivation from latency has recently been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref032">32</xref>], we continued our studies with Romidepsin, Panobinostat, and PTC-209. To determine if these compounds induce KSHV genome replication, KSHV copy number in DMSO and inhibitor treated BCBL-1 cells was determined by qPCR. KSHV copy number was increased by at least 100-fold in Romidepsin and Panobinostat treated cells compared to DMSO treated cells, confirming that Romidepsin and Panobinostat induce KSHV genome replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007267.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). To test the ability of inhibitor treated cells to produce infectious virions, supernatants from DMSO, Romidepsin, and Panobinstat treated cells were collected and used to infect naïve Vero cells, where KSHV copy number in the infected Vero cells was determined by qPCR. We found a 5- and 25-fold difference in KSHV copy number in Vero cells infected with supernatants collected from Romidepsin and Panobinostat treated versus DMSO treated BCBL-1 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007267.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). To probe viral gene expression in infected Vero cells, KSHV transcript levels were assayed by RT-qPCR. We found an approximately 200- to 5000-fold increase in levels of vIL-6, ORF57, and K8.1 transcripts in Vero cells infected with supernatants collected from Romidepsin or Panobinostat versus DMSO treated BCBL-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007267.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Similarly, KSHV copy number was increased in PTC-209 treated BCBL-1 cells by 3-fold compared to DMSO treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007267.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), and there was a 15-fold difference in KSHV copy number in Vero cells infected with supernatants collected from PTC-209 versus DMSO treated BCBL-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007267.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). vIL-6, ORF57, and K8.1 were expressed at levels 9- to 30-fold higher in Vero cells infected with supernatants collected from PTC-209 versus DMSO treated BCBL-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007267.g004">Fig 4F</xref>).

<title>Romidepsin, Panobinostat, and PTC-209 treatment induces histone modifications at the RTA promoter</title>
<p>To probe the mechanism by which Romidepsin, Panobinostat, and PTC-209 stimulate KSHV reactivation, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on compound treated BCBL-1 cells. We hypothesized that Romidepsin and Panobinostat treatment would increase levels of acetylated histone 3 (H3Ac) at the RTA promoter, while PTC-209 treatment would reduce levels of H2AK119ub, which is associated with heterochromatin and repressed gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref030">30</xref>]. To test this hypothesis, we performed ChIP on DMSO, Romidepsin, or Panobinostat treated BCBL-1 cells using total H3, H3Ac, or control IgG antibodies. Following treatment with Romidepsin and Panobinostat, the amount of H3Ac increased at the promoter of the cellular gene NFKBIA, and at four regions of the RTA promoter by 1.3- to 3.8-fold compared to cells treated with DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007267.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Furthermore, ChIP-qPCR analysis following PTC-209 treatment using total H2A, H2AK119ub, or control IgG antibodies revealed a greater than 2-fold reduction in H2AK119ub at the NFKBIA promoter and across the RTA promoter in PTC-209 treated compared to DMSO treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007267.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). These data confirm that treatment with Romidepsin, Panobinostat, and PTC-209 results in histone modifications at the RTA promoter that are favorable to RTA transcription.</p>

<title>Romidepsin, Panobinostat, and PTC-209 treatment results in open chromatin at the RTA promoter</title>
<p>To determine if increased levels of H3Ac and decreased levels of H2AK119ub result in changes in chromatin accessibility at the RTA promoter, we probed nucleosome density in this region by FAIRE analysis. FAIRE relies on differential crosslinking efficiency between DNA bound by nucleosomes versus DNA in nucleosome-depleted regions, where an increase in FAIRE signal indicates a reduction in nucleosome density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref035">35</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we aimed to identify host chromatin-modifying proteins that are critical for the maintenance of KSHV latency. To this end, we screened a collection of inhibitors that target chromatin associated proteins, including histone writers, readers, and erasers, for their ability to stimulate KSHV reactivation. Romidepsin and Panobinostat, two HDAC inhibitors not previously shown to induce KSHV reactivation, as well as (+)-JQ1, a bromodomain inhibitor, and PTC-209, a Bmi1 inhibitor, induced KSHV lytic gene transcription. While Romidepsin and Panobinostat stimulated expression of all viral genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007267.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), only a subset of viral genes were induced by (+)-JQ1 and PTC-209 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007267.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), suggesting that modulation of different epigenetic signals may activate viral gene transcription through different pathways. This possibility will be explored in future investigation. Romidepsin, Panobinostat, and PTC-209 induced viral DNA replication and the production of infectious virions. Histone modifications at the RTA promoter were altered by treatment with these compounds, where Romidepsin and Panobinostat increased H3 acetylation, and PTC-209 decreased H2AK119ub. Furthermore, each of these compounds induced nucleosome depletion at the RTA promoter. These data indicate that histone deacetylation and monoubiquitination at the RTA promoter aid KSHV latency, and conversely, that these marks need to be reversed to allow RTA transcription.</p>
<p>Silencing of PRC1 member Bmi1 by siRNA resulted in KSHV reactivation, demonstrating that PRC1 is critical for the maintenance of KSHV latency. Thus, it appears that PRC1 activity must be suppressed during reactivation. The upstream signals that govern activity of this complex, and how Bmi1 contributes to it in the context of KSHV infection, are not completely understood. The function of PRC1 components, including Bmi1, is modulated by post-translational modifications like SUMOylation and phosphorylation. For example, Bmi1 phosphorylation by MAPKAP kinase 3 results in dissociation of PRC1 complexes from chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref038">38</xref>]. MAPKAP kinase 3 is downstream of activated ERK and p38, and ERK and p38 signaling have previously been implicated in KSHV reactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref041">41</xref>]. Thus, the function of ERK or p38 signaling in KSHV reactivation may be to modulate PRC1 activity. Furthermore, LANA plays a role in PRC1 regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref042">42</xref>], which now can be further defined. The activity of the PRC1 complex may also be impacted by other histone modifications, as canonical PRC1 complexes contain chromobox proteins that bind H3K27me3. Therefore, a decrease in H3K27me3 at the RTA promoter may precede reduced PRC1 activity, resulting in KSHV reactivation. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that non-canonical PRC1 complexes lacking chromobox proteins can catalyze H2AK119ub in the absence of H3K27me3 recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref044">44</xref>]. Clearly, a number of counteracting factors converge to establish the histone code on the RTA promoter. This study added Bmi1 as a new contributor, confirmed the preeminent role of bromodomain-containing proteins, and identified two novel, high-potency HDAC inhibitors to aid our understanding of this crucial point in the viral life cycle.</p>
<p>A thorough understanding of the factors controlling KSHV reactivation from latency is important for the development of therapies to combat KSHV-associated cancers or eradicate KSHV in HIV-positive patients. One approach that has been explored for KSHV as well as EBV, another gammaherpesvirus that causes lymphoproliferative disorders, is “lytic induction therapy,” which involves stimulation of reactivation in the presence of antiviral drugs. This approach has been shown to be effective in reducing lymphoproliferative disease and PEL growth in mouse xenograft models of pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref047">47</xref>]. In the clinic, it relies as much on direct pan-cancer effects of HDAC inhibitors like SAHA (Vorinostat), as on KSHV-directed reactivation and virus-induced killing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref049">49</xref>]. Romidepsin is promising in this regard as it has previously been shown to be more effective than other HDAC inhibitors in stimulating reactivation of HIV in <italic>ex vivo</italic> patient samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref050">50</xref>] and has anti-lymphoma activity (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007267.ref051">51</xref>]). Furthermore, Bmi1 inhibition represents a new target for induction of KSHV reactivation from latency.</p>
