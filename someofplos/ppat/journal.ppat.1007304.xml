<abstract>
<p>Poliovirus (PV) 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> is the most studied 2C protein in the <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family. It is involved in RNA replication, encapsidation and uncoating and many inhibitors have been found that target PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>. Despite numerous investigations to characterize its functions, a high-resolution structure of PV 2C has not yet been determined. We report here the crystal structure of a soluble fragment of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> to 2.55Ã, containing an ATPase domain, a zinc finger and a C-terminal helical domain but missing the N-terminal domain. The ATPase domain shares the common structural features with EV71 2C and other Superfamily 3 helicases. The C-terminal cysteine-rich motif folds into a CCCC type zinc finger in which four cysteine ligands and several auxiliary residues assist in zinc binding. By comparing with the known zinc finger fold groups, we found the zinc finger of 2C proteins belong to a new fold group, which we denote the âEnterovirus 2C-likeâ group. The C-terminus of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> forms an amphipathic helix that occupies a hydrophobic pocket located on an adjacent PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> in the crystal lattice. The C-terminus mediated PV 2C-2C interaction promotes self-oligomerization, most likely hexamerization, which is fundamental to the ATPase activity of 2C. The zinc finger is the most structurally diverse feature in 2C proteins. Available structural and virological data suggest that the zinc finger of 2C might confer the specificity of interaction with other proteins. We built a hexameric ring model of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and visualized the previously identified functional motifs and drug-resistant sites, thus providing a structure framework for antiviral drug development.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Since the launch of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, the number of poliomyelitis cases has significantly reduced but obstacles to disease eradication remain. In the endgame phase, anti-poliovirus drugs will be critical in controlling transmission of vaccine-derived polioviruses and in treating patients with chronic infection. However, no effective anti-poliovirus drugs are yet available. The 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> encoded by poliovirus is one of the most important drug targets, and many inhibitors of 2C have been found. We report here the crystal structure of a soluble portion of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>, containing an ATPase domain, a zinc finger and a C-terminal helical domain. Our findings not only revealed common and individual structural features in the picornaviral 2C protein family, but also allowed us to visualize a large collection of functional motifs and drug-resistant sites identified from the decades-long investigations of poliovirus 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>. Our findings are invaluable for understanding the function of picornavirus 2C proteins and the development of antiviral drugs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Poliovirus (PV) is the pathogen of poliomyelitis. PV infection can directly result in damage of motor neurons and cause neural lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref001">1</xref>]. Since the launch of Global Polio Eradication Initiative (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://polioeradication.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://polioeradication.org/</ext-link>) by the World Health Assembly, the number of poliomyelitis cases have been significantly reduced. The incidence of paralytic polio in 1988 was 1,000 children per day, and this number decreased to 400 per day in 2013[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref002">2</xref>]. Only three endemic countries remain today. Nevertheless, obstacles to global polio eradication remain. To overcome the last hurdles in the endgame phase, effective anti-PV drugs are critical in controlling transmission of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) and in treating patients with chronic infection or personnel casually exposed to PV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref003">3</xref>]. Further, to minimize poliomyelitis risk in the âpost-polioâ era, the National Research Council of the Unite States concluded that the development of antiviral drugs would be important, and possibly essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>PV belongs to Enterovirus C species in the <italic>Enterovirus</italic> genus, <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref005">5</xref>]. It has an icosahedral non-enveloped capsid containing a single-stranded +RNA genome of ~ 7,500 nucleotides. PV has three serotypes, PV1 PV2 and PV3, whose capsids exhibit distinct antigenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref006">6</xref>], but the replicative enzymes of PV are highly conserved not only among different serotypes, but also in other virus species. Therefore, the virally encoded replicative enzymes are considered as good targets for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Among EVs replicative enzymes, 2C protein is arguably the most attractive target for direct-acting antivirals (DAA) development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref008">8</xref>]. At least ten inhibitors have been found targeting 2C, including guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref010">10</xref>], HBB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref011">11</xref>], TBZE-029 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref012">12</xref>], MRL-1237 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref014">14</xref>], pirlindole, dibucaine, zuclopenthixol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref015">15</xref>], hydantoin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref016">16</xref>], fluoxetine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref018">18</xref>] and brefeldin A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref019">19</xref>]. Genotype analyses of drug-resistant virus clones had revealed a large set of residues of 2C that are likely to be involved in binding. Structural characterization of 2C proteins is therefore essential to visualize these potential drug binding sites and to assist antiviral drug development.</p>
<p>2C protein of enteroviruses has typically ~330 residues. It is composed of a N-terminal membrane binding domain, a central ATPase domain, a cysteine-rich domain and a C-terminal helical domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref020">20</xref>]. We recently determined the crystal structure of a soluble portion of 2C helicase from human enterovirus 71 (EV71) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref021">21</xref>], the first high-resolution 2C structure in <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>. The ATPase domain of EV71 2C exhibits the structural characteristics of superfamily 3 (SF3) helicases. EV71 2C has an unusual zinc finger with three cysteine ligands. The C-terminus of EV71 2C forms an amphipathic helix that mediates self-oligomerization through a specific interaction between 2C-2C. The hexameric ring model of EV71 2C revealed that the central pore is negatively charged and a putative RNA binding motif is located on the rim of the ring, which suggests the mode of RNA binding might be the winding around the hexameric ring.</p>
<p>Poliovirus (PV) 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> has been intensively studied for decades. Numerous genetic and biochemical studies have shown that PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> is implicated in series of events in virus life-cycle, from uncoating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref022">22</xref>], cellular membrane rearrangement and assembly of membranous replication complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref023">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref027">27</xref>], viral RNA synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref028">28</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref030">30</xref>] to morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref031">31</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref034">34</xref>]. PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> has only 329 residues but is very rich in features. It can be divided into an N-terminal domain, a central ATPase domain and a C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain harbors a membrane binding motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref035">35</xref>], an amphipathic helix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref030">30</xref>], an oligomerization motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref036">36</xref>] and an RNA binding motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref037">37</xref>]. The extreme N-terminal sequence of 2C is able to interact both with virally encoded proteins, 2B, 2BC, 3A, 3AB, 3C, VP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref039">39</xref>] and cellular protein RTN3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref040">40</xref>]. Structural investigation of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> has been challenging because the N-terminal domain confers protein insolubility. Our structural characterization of EV71 2C was possible only when the N-terminal domain was removed. We characterized the roles of Walker A + B motifs, Motif C and arginine finger (R-finger) of EV71 2C in ATP hydrolysis and virus production. All of these conserved ATPase motifs are present in PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>, and should exert similar functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref042">42</xref>]. It was predicted that the C-terminal cysteine rich motif of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> forms a CCCC type zinc finger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref043">43</xref>], but the second potential zinc coordination sites (PCS) of the putative zinc finger is not present in many other enterovirus 2C proteins including EV71 2C. The crystallographic data showed that EV71 2C indeed lacks the PCS2 and it possesses a rare zinc finger with only three cysteine ligands, but it does not seem to affect its zinc coordinating capability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref021">21</xref>]. Whether PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> has a distinct zinc finger requires structural investigation. PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> shares 63.7% amino acid sequence identity with EV71 2C helicase, however, no conclusive evidence has shown that PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> has helicase activity to date. To support RNA synthesis, Cho et al found that the 3D polymerase of poliovirus has the activity of unwinding long stretch of RNA duplex, and the nascent RNA strand can be displaced from the template during chain elongation reaction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref044">44</xref>]. Thus, the unwindase activity of PV 3D satisfies the necessity of using a helicase during PV replication.</p>
<p>Although many inhibitors have been found targeting PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> over decades, the high-resolution structure of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> was still missing to date, which hindered the understanding of the mechanisms of inhibitorâs efficacy and drug-resistance and the development of anti-PV drugs. GuHCl for example inhibits ATPase activity of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref042">42</xref>]. Mutations that confer resistance to GuHCl were mostly mapped in segments outside the catalytically important ATPase motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref010">10</xref>], whose precise functions were unknown.</p>
<p>We report here the crystal structure of a soluble fragment of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> containing the complete ATPase and the C-terminal domains to a resolution limit of 2.55Ã. We found that the C-terminal helix mediates self-oligomerization of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> via a specific interaction between 2C-2C, which is essential to ATPase activity. Comparing the structures of PV 2C and EV71 2C revealed both common and distinct structural characteristics. We built a hexameric ring model of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> to visualize regions important to PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> function and drug resistance.</p>

<p>To gain atomic insight into poliovirus 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>, we carried out a crystallographic study. We first expressed a N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) tagged full-length 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> from human poliovirus 1 (strain Mahoney, GenBank: KU866422.1); however, the MBP tagged protein did not yield crystals. Removal of MBP tag by proteinase cleavage only led to precipitation of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>. Therefore, we employed a similar strategy as used in expressing the soluble fragment of EV71 2C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref021">21</xref>]. Firstly, we removed the N-terminal 115 residues of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>, (PV-2C-ÎN). This fragment lacks the N-terminal membrane binding domain but retains a complete ATPase domain, a zinc binding site and a C-terminal helical domain. PV-2C-ÎN was soluble, but still failed to crystallize. Considering that surface-entropy reduction may favor crystallization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref045">45</xref>], we predicted a set of surface residues charges based on EV71 2C structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref021">21</xref>]. We then introduced alanine substitutions systematically to these residues with an aim of minimizing surface charging. We finally obtained crystals of PV-2C-ÎN bearing mutations E207A, K209A and R149A (PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut). None of these mutations is located within conserved ATPase motifs, zinc binding site or the C-terminal helical domain.</p>
<p>We grew PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut crystals in a hanging drop vapor diffusion system at 20Â°C. The crystals diffracted the X ray to a 2.55Ã. It belonged to the space group of P2<sub>1</sub> and contained 6 copies of 2C per asymmetric unit (ASU). We solved the crystal structure of PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut by molecular replacement using EV71 2C structure (PDB code: 5GQ1, B chain) as the search model. Several regions of the initial atomic model were built manually, especially at the zinc binding site that accounted for the largest structural discrepancy. In the finally refined model, we were able to located most of residues in chains A, B, C, D and E. But chain H was largely disordered, only a fraction of residues was visible in the electron density. Chain A and B were the most intact 2C copies and they were associated with relatively low temperature factors, 67.82 Ã<sup>2</sup> and 72.44 Ã<sup>2</sup>, respectively. By contrast, the temperature factors of the other chains C, D, E and H are much higher; the values are 108.38 Ã<sup>2</sup>, 76.55 Ã<sup>2</sup>, 105.38 Ã<sup>2</sup> and 170.56 Ã<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Therefore, only chain A and B were used for further structural analysis. Because the average temperature factor of this structure is high, we generated a simulated-annealing 2Fo-Fc composite omit map to validate its quality. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g001">Fig 1</xref>, the simulated-annealing composite omit map has a good fit with the final model PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut, which supported that the model was correctly built. We performed a structural comparison of the chains within ASU (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007304.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The r.m.s.d. values among different chains ranges from 0.4Ã to 1.3Ã. The largest structural deviation is contributed by a small loop region 180-184aa of B chain between Î²3 and Î±2, which is apparently resulted from the crystal packing artifacts. The C-terminal helical domain of PV 2C exhibits only slightly different orientation, but this is not comparable with the dramatical conformational changes observed at the C-terminal helix in EV71 2C structure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref021">21</xref>] (PDB entries: 5GQ1 and 5GRB).

<p>The overall fold of PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut is similar to EV71 2C. Structural comparison between PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut and EV71 2C (PDB code: 5GRB, chain C) gave a Dali Z-score of 30.9 with 197 aligned CÎ± atoms and the r.m.s.d. value was 1.3Ã. PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut is comprised of an ATPase domain with canonical Î±/Î² Rossmann fold, a CCCC type zinc finger followed and a long helical C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The ATPase domain contains a five-stranded parallel Î²-sheet (Î²1-Î²5) surrounded by three Î±-helices (Î±1-Î±3). We located three conserved ATPase motifs. Walker A motif is located on the loop connecting Î²1 and Î±1, forming the phosphate binding loop (P-loop). A phosphate group was found occupying the P-loop. The Walker B motif is located on the loop between Î²3 and Î±2. The SF3 helicase specific motif C is located on the loop between Î²4 and Î±3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g002">Fig 2A and 2E</xref>).</p>

<p>The cysteine-rich motif of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> (residue 267â289), located between Î±4 and Î²6, connects the ATPase domain and the C-terminal helical domain. The cysteine-rich motif folds into a CCCC type zinc finger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The zinc ion is coordinated by four cysteine ligands, C269, C272, C281 and C286. Three of these cysteine residues are from the long loop between Î±4 and Î±5, and one is from the C-terminus of Î±5. The distances from each SÎ³ atom to the zinc varies from 2.2Ã to 2.4Ã, which are typical distances between sulfur and zinc as the median distance of Zn-S is 2.28Ã [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref046">46</xref>]. In addition, two conserved residues C282 and K288 assist the zinc coordination. The carbonyl oxygen of C282 buttress the zinc ion from the bottom (distance, 3.3 Ã), whereas the side chain NÎ¶ atom of K288 covers the zinc on top (distance 4.2Ã) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). There is an unusually long loop region between the second and third zinc ligands C272 and C281, on which N277 and F278 dock their side chains into a hydrophobic groove formed between Î±1 and Î±6 helices. This hydrophobic interaction between the zinc finger and the ATPase domain may serve to further stabilize the folding of the zinc finger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Pfister and colleagues predicted four potential zinc coordination sites (PCS1-4) in the cysteine-rich motif of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref043">43</xref>]. We therefore adopted this nomenclature in our structural analysis of zinc finger structure for the convenience of comparing with the results reported previously. We found that while the conformation of C269 (PCS1), C281 (PCS3) and C286 (PCS4) are well conserved in both structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), residue C272 acts as PCS2 for zinc binding in PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>, but its structural counterpart E272 in EV71 2C is not a zinc ligand. Instead, E272 forms a salt bridge with K288 stabilizing the overall folding of the zinc finger of EV71 2C. The loop harboring PCS2 (residues 270â276) is among the least conserved regions in picornavirus 2C proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), which coincides with the pronounced structural difference of this region between PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and EV71 2C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>We performed crystal packing analysis of PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut structure and found that all 2C copies in the crystal polymerize via a C-terminus helix mediated 2C-2C interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The mode of PV 2C-2C interaction resembles EV71 2C-2C interaction we characterized previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref021">21</xref>]. Residues C323, M324, L327 and F328 of the C-terminus Î±6 helix of a PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut monomer formed a pocket-binding domain (denoted: PBD) that docks inside a hydrophobic pocket (denoted: pocket) between the zinc finger and the ATPase helicase domain of an adjacent PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The pocket is formed by 13 residues, most of which are hydrophobic. A salt bridge between E325 from the PBD and R144 from the pocket further stabilizes 2C-2C interaction. To validate PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut oligomerization observed in crystalline state, we investigated self-oligomerization of PV-2C-ÎN using size-exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The molecular mass of PV-2C-ÎN was observed to be 94kDa, close to the theoretical molecular mass of tetramers 95.2kDa, suggesting PV-2C-ÎN exists as tetrameric in solution. Removing PBD of PV-2C-ÎN (PV 2C 116â319) reduced its molecular mass to 23kDa, nearly matching the theoretical molecular mass for monomers 23.8kDa. Therefore, the tetramerization of PV-2C-ÎN was dependent on the PBD mediated 2C-2C interaction. Our previous results demonstrated that mutation of either L327 or F238 could abolish self-oligomerization of EV71 2C and these two residues are highly conserved among 2C helicases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref021">21</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). We then measured the molecular mass of PV-2C-ÎN bearing mutation L327A and F238A respectively. The molecular mass of these mutants reduced to monomeric size, 26kDa, indicating that both residues play the crucial role in PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> self-oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Our previous crystallographic study of EV71 2C identified a hinge region on C-terminus Î±6 helix, which could mediate rotation between 2C-2C, therefore resulting multiple 2C-2C conformations in crystal structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref021">21</xref>]. By contrast, we did not find the similar 2C-2C rotations in the crystal structure of PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut, the C-terminus Î±6 helix of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> was kept essentially straight in all 2C copies. We compared the PV 2C-2C conformation with multiple EV71 2C-2C conformations, which demonstrated that PV 2C-2C conformation resembles EV71 2C-2C conformation-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref021">21</xref>], a catalytically nonproductive conformation. We measured the distance from the phosphate group occupying the P-loop of a PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut monomer to the side chain of R241 (arginine-finger) on an adjacent PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut. The distance was 21Ã, suggesting this cannot be a catalytically active conformation. In order to explore the biologically relevant conformation of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>, we built a hexameric ring model. We first searched structural homologues of PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut using Dali server, and found that beside EV71 2C, the best hit was the structure of a SV40 Large T Antigen (PDB code: 2H1L). We generated a hexameric model of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> by superimposing six copies of PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut to each subunit within SV40 Large T Antigen hexamer. In the hexameric model of PV-2C-ÎN, the C-terminal PBD of a protomer is located very close to the hydrophobic pocket on the adjacent protomer. We therefore slightly bent the Î±6 helix so that the PBD could readily occupy the hydrophobic pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).</p>

<p>The hexameric model of PV-2C-ÎN has a ring-like shape with the diameter of 117Ã and the height of 40Ã (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Its size is similar to EV71 2C hexameric model[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref021">21</xref>]. Adams and colleagues have reported that particles of the MBP tagged PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> were composed of 5â8 protomers, and they exhibited increasing size ranging from 150 to 200Ã [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref036">36</xref>]. The larger size of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> homo-oligomers visualized in the electron microcopy was possibly contributed by the N-terminal domain of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and the presence of the MBP tag. While the unliganded foot-and-mouth disease virus 2C protein lacking the N-terminal domain self-oligomerizes in a concentration-dependent manner, this truncation containing a Motif C mutation (N207A) specifically forms hexamers in the presence of ATP and RNA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref047">47</xref>]. The negative stain electron microscopy study further revealed FMDV 2C-ATP-RNA is a hexameric ring with 6-fold symmetry. The hexameric ring model of PV-2C-ÎN shows that all conserved ATPase motifs line up at the gaps between protomers, constituting the active sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). While Walker A, Walker B motifs and Motif C are located on one side of the active site, the R finger (R241) is located on the other side. The distance from the phosphate group at the P-loop to R241 side chain has now reduced to 5.1Ã, suggesting the improved active site conformation. The central pore of the hexameric ring has a funnel-like shape. While the opening on cytoplasm side is wider (diameter = 27Ã), the opening on membrane proximal side is narrower (diameter = 14Ã). It was previously reported that PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> harbors two discrete segments, residues 21â45 and 312â319, both involved in RNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref010">10</xref>]. Although the N-terminal RNA binding segment is missing in our structure, the C-terminal RNA binding segment is located on the rim of the hexameric ring, suggesting that the RNA might bind the rim of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> hexameric ring.</p>
<p>To validate our structural findings, we characterized the ATPase activity of the MBP tagged full-length PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and a selection of mutants. We first characterized the ATPase activity of the wild-type enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Our analysis showed that the ATPase activity of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> obeys the Hill equation. The nonlinear curve fitting using the Hill equation gave an R<sup>2</sup> = 0.999. The Hill coefficient n is approximal 1.9, suggesting a positive cooperativity in ATP binding and hydrolysis. We calculated the enzyme kinetic parameters V<sub>max</sub> = 137.7Â±2.1 Î¼M/min and K<sub>m</sub> = 641.7Â±25.1 Î¼M. The turnover rate k<sub>cat</sub> of the enzyme is 27.5 min<sup>-1</sup>. This value was calculated by dividing V<sub>max</sub> with the concentration of the monomeric MBP-PV 2C. The turnover rate of the MBP-tagged PV 2C is lower than that measured for the bilayer nanodiscs bound PV 2C[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref048">48</xref>]. The difference in the ATPase activity is likely due to the different strategy and affinity tag used in protein preparation.</p>

<p>Next, we measured and compared the ATPase activity of the PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). When we kept the substrate ATP concentration constant at 500Î¼M, the wild-type PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> exhibited an ATPase activity of 8.9Â±0.8 Î¼mol/Î¼mol/min<sup>-1</sup>, whereas the catalytic inactive mutants K135A (Walker A), D177A (Walker B), N223A (Motif C) and R241A (R finger) all exhibited the background activities at least 20 folds less than the wild-type activity, similar to MOCK and MBP controls. In most of cases, mutations on either the PBD or the pocket led to severe losses or abrogation of ATPase activity. The loss of ATPase activity was possibly caused by the disruption of PBD-pocket interaction and in turn 2C self-oligomerization, therefore the active site between PV 2C-2C could not form. These results are consistent with size-exclusion chromatography experiment that the disruption of PBD-pocket interaction by mutation F328A or deletion of PBD abolished 2C tetramerization in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The ATPase activity of mutant C323A was measured as 12.1Â±1.2 Î¼mol/Î¼mol/min, similar to WT enzyme. This suggests that substituting of C323 by an alanine could not undermine the interaction between PBD-pocket. This hypothesis is supported by our size-exclusion chromatography results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g004">Fig 4</xref>). PV-2C-ÎN bearing mutation C323A at the C-terminal PBD also eluted as tetramers, suggesting the homo-oligomerization remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Among alanine substitutions of four zinc coordinating cysteine, C272A retained more than 70% of WT ATPase activities, 6.5Â±0.4 Î¼mol/Î¼mol/min, whereas C269A, C281A and C286A lost the majority of their activities; the percentage of the activities remained were 22%, 13% and 10%, respectively. Pfister et al. showed that while eliminating PCS1 (C269) of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> caused the failure in recovering virus from plasmid, but eliminating PCS2 (substitute C272 with serine or glutamine) did not affected PV translation activity in vivo. Nevertheless, substitution of PCS2 could induce temperature sensitive phenotype, encapsidation defects and impairment of RNA replication at high temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref043">43</xref>]. PCS2 is naturally missing in EV71 2C and many other enterovirus 2C proteins. To further investigate the significance of PCS2, we introduced a set of mutations to an infectious clone of EV71. Structural alignments of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and EV71 2C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g002">Fig 2D</xref>) revealed that residue E272 of EV71 2C is the structural counterpart of C272 of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>. We therefore substituted E272 with cysteine and histidine respectively, with an aim of adding PCS2 to the EV71 2C zinc finger. To cover all possibilities, we also substituted three other nearby residues S271, N273 and N274 with cysteine respectively, so that at least one of these mutants may have a PCS2 for the zinc finger. To our surprises, the infectious clone bearing E272C or E272H did not showed the improved EV71 infectivity, instead they caused &gt;75% losses of activities. Mutations N273C and N274C were also detrimental to virus production. Only S271C retained &gt;75% of WT activity, but there was no improvement in EV71 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Comparing the available high-resolution structures of enterovirus 2C proteins (PV 2C, EV-C species and EV71 2C, EV-A species), we identified both common and individual structural features. (i) The zinc finger is the most structurally distinct site in PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and EV71 2C. While PC 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> has a CCCC type zinc finger, EV71 2C has only three cysteine (lacking the PCS2) for zinc coordination. Eliminating the PCS2 of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> resulted in temperature-sensitive phenotypes and encapsidation defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref049">49</xref>]. We added the PCS2 to the zinc finger of EV71 2C in order to convert it to a CCCC type zinc finger similar to PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> zinc finger, but it failed to improve EV71 infectivity. Zinc fingers are ubiquitous small motifs that function as binding module for nucleic acids or proteins, etc.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref050">50</xref>]. It was demonstrated that the C-terminal cysteine-rich site of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>, the zinc finger in our structure, is required for morphogenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref049">49</xref>]. Therefore, the significant difference in sequence and structure of the zinc finger we observed here may underlie the specificity of 2C protein and determine what process it may involve. The cysteine-rich motif is one of the least conserved regions in Picornaviridae 2C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). In fact, the 2C of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) does not even have a cysteine-rich motif between ATPase and C-terminal helical domains. So, this region of FMDV 2C might fold into a structure completely different from the zinc finger but it may still function as protein binding module with the distinct specificity. (ii) The hexameric ring models of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and EV71 2C show that the ATPase active site formed between 2C subunits has nearly identical geometry and the catalytic residues (Walker A &amp; B, Motif C and R finger) identified by structural and biochemical characterizations are invariant. (iii) The C-terminus amphipathic helix mediated self-oligomerization is common in enterovirus 2C. Analogous to EV71 2C, PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> undergoes self-oligomerization both in crystalline state and in solution via PBD-pocket interaction. Although residues constituting the PBD and the pocket are not strictly conserved in PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and EV71 2C, the âknob-into-holeâ interaction between PBD-pocket is identical. The PBD residues of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> include C323, M324, L327 and F328, whereas the PBD of EV71 2C contains residues T323, I324, L327 and F328. All PBD residues are hydrophobic, in which L327 and F328 are invariant. The strict conservation of L327 and F328 highlights their essential role in 2C activity. We showed that mutations L327 and F328 abrogated the ATPase activity and homo-oligomerization of both PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and EV71 2C helicases (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g005">5</xref>), and these mutations could halt EV71 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref021">21</xref>]. The dimension of the hydrophobic pocket of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> is 17Ã long, 12 Ã wide and 7Ã deep, which is similar to the pocket size of EV71 2C. We calculated the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of the pocket of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> as 918 Ã<sup>2</sup> containing 13 residues, the SASA of the pocket of EV71 2C is 846 Ã<sup>2</sup> containing 14 residues.</p>
<p>Eight zinc finger fold groups have been classified previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref050">50</xref>]. Comparison of the geometry of the zinc fingers of EV71 2C and PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> with eight known groups of zinc finger demonstrates that it belongs to none of them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007304.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Therefore, the 2C zinc finger represents a new fold group, which we denote the âEnterovirus 2C-likeâ fold group. This group is composed of a N-terminal long loop followed by a short helix and a short loop. Three zinc ligands are contributed from the long loop, one ligand is contributed from the short helix. The short helix has a âPhhCâ consensus sequence (h represents hydrophobic residues) in enteroviruses. The PhhC sequence is followed by a âGKAâ motif that is invariant among enteroviruses. The conserved lysine of GKA motif plays an auxiliary role in stabilizing the zinc binding. The second zinc ligand is nonessential in zinc coordination. It can be substituted by a solvent water molecule, such in case of EV71 2C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous studies have identified a large set of residues important to 2C functions. Genotype analyses of drug resistant virus clones have suggested many residues that were targeted by drugs. We summarized these findings and analyzed the compatibility of the published phenotypes with our structural characterization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007304.s004">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007304.s005">S2</xref> Tables and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Based on their locations on 2C structure, we divided these residues into four categories. (i) Residues from Walker A motif, Walker B motif, Motif C and R finger are essential for ATPase/helicase activities. They are gathered in the gaps between subunits in the hexameric ring model of 2C protein. These residues are in general not involved in drug resistance, probably due to high genetic barrier. Only one GuHCl-resistant mutation was mapped to Walker A (A133T) of echovirus-9 2C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref011">11</xref>]. (ii) Residues buried deeply into the hydrophobic core of 2C are important to overall folding. These include L125, V218, I142 A143, M246 and I248, most of which are buried between the parallel Î²-strand plane and the surrounding helices in ATPase domain. These residues were found important to encapsidation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref031">31</xref>], morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref049">49</xref>] or temperature-sensitive virus phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref051">51</xref>]. Mutations of these residues account for resistant to GuHCl, MRL-1237 and Hydantoin. (iii) Residues exposed to the molecular surface of 2C hexamer model may directly interact with protein binding partners, RNA or drugs. Most of these residues are mapped on the cytoplasmic side and the rim of the ring, however a few are on the membrane proximal side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Therefore, in vivo the membrane proximal side of the hexameric ring model is unlikely to be the accessible molecular surface of 2C. During infection, this side should be attached to N-terminal portion of 2C, whose structure is yet to be determined. We further divided the surface exposed residues into different regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). The majority of published drug resistant mutations were mapped into regions around the pore of the hexameric ring. These regions are potentially targeted by GuHCl, MRL-1237, HBB, TBZE-029, Fluoxetine, Dibucaine, Zuclopenthixol and Pirlindole. (iv) Residues located on N-terminal membrane binding domain are still missing in the available 2C structures.</p>

We mapped all published GuHCl-resistant or dependent mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref010">10</xref>] on the structure of PV-2C-ÎN, revealing two distinct sites, site-1 and site-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>). Mutations I142V and A143G cluster on site-1, where they are deeply buried inside the hydrophobic core of ATPase domain. Substitute at here may affect the interaction with GuHCl or other ligands via an indirect way; the mechanism require further investigation. The other mutations, N179G on the loop between Î²3 and Î±2, M187L on the Î±2 helix and S225T, I227M and A233T/S on the loop between Î²4 and Î±3 (Î²4-Î±3-loop), cluster on site-2. The Î²4-Î±3-loop is highly flexible in PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>, and a segment of this loop residues 227â235 were missing in the electron density map. When displayed these residues on the hexameric ring model of PV-2C-ÎN, we found that six copies of site-2 from each subunit form a belt region surrounding the central pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>), which may act as the direct binding site of GuHCl. Site-2 might act an essential interface for the binding with other viral or cellular proteins during replication. Hence, a plausible explanation of the inhibitory mechanism of GuHCl is blocking other proteins from binding to 2C by occupying site-2. Mutations responsible for resistance to other drugs were also mapped on the Î²4-Î±3-loop. Echovirus 9 bearing 2C mutations I227L and A229V is resistant to HBB. Coxsackievirus B3 containing 2C mutation A224V, I227V and A229V is resistant to TBZE-029, Fluoxetine and Dibucaine. Therefore, the Î²4-Î±3-loop of 2C is likely a âhot spotâ for drug resistance.</p>
<p>The investigation of PV morphogenesis suggested that the cysteine-rich motif on the C-terminal domain of 2C helicase is involved in encapsidation, possibly via an interaction with a region between Walker A and B motifs of the ATPase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref049">49</xref>]. Our crystal structure of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> revealed that the Î±1 helix (residues 135â150) located between the Walker A and B motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g002">Fig 2E and 2C</xref>) directly interacts with residues N277 and F278 from the loop between PCS2 and PCS3 of the zinc finger. Wang et al showed that PV with K279A/R280A mutations showed defects in replication and encapsidation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref049">49</xref>]. The same group later demonstrated that the PCSs of the cysteine-rich motif are also involved in encapsidation. According to the crystal structure of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and the hexameric ring model, the cysteine rich motif folds into a zinc finger and it is located on six vertices of the ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007304.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). K279 and R280 are located immediately downstream of N277 and F278, where they are fully accessible on the surface of the hexameric ring. Therefore, it is suggestive that the interaction between the zinc finger and the ATPase domains are important to stabilizing the folding of the zinc finger, whereas K279 and R280 may be involved in an interaction with other protein partners during encapsidation. Among four PCSs of the zinc finger, C269 (PCS1) and C281 (PCS3) are almost completely buried in the hydrophobic core; by contrast, C272 (PCS2) and C286 (PCS4) are relatively more exposed to the molecular surface. This supports the results reported by Wang and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref049">49</xref>], that while alanine substitution of PCS1 or PCS3 was lethal, substitutions of PCS4 and PCS2 exhibited temperature-sensitive and quasi infectious phenotypes respectively. It suggests that PCS1 and PCS3 are absolutely required in maintaining the folding of the zinc finger and probably the entire hexamer, whereas PCS2 and PCS4 might have an additional role of interacting with other proteins during encapsidation.</p>

<title>Protein preparation</title>
<p>Because full-length PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>is unstable for structural and biochemical studies, we prepared the maltose-binding protein (MBP) tagged 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref036">36</xref>]. In brief, the cDNA encoding 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> of human poliovirus 1 strain Mahoney (GenBank ID: KU866422.1) was synthesized (GENEWIZ), amplified using PCR and inserted into pMAL-c5X vector (New England BioLabs) between EcoRV and SalI sites. The resulting plasmid expressed a N-terminal tagged full-length PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> (MBP-PV 2C). The plasmid was transformed to competent E. coli cells BL21 (DE3). The bacteria were inoculated in a medium containing 100 mg/L ampicillin and grown to a density OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.8 at 37Â°C. The cultures were cooled and induced with 0.3mM IPTG. The bacteria were then cultured at 18Â°C overnight before harvesting. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation (5,000g, 10min) and resuspended in a cold lysis buffer (50mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1mM DTT and 1mM EDTA) on ice. The suspended cells were disrupted by ultrasonication on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 25,000g for 30min. The supernatant was loaded onto the amylose resin (New England BioLabs) and the resin was washed thoroughly by using a buffer containing 50mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and 1mM DTT. The MBP-PV 2C protein was eluted with 5 column volume of elution buffer (50mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100mM NaCl, 1mM DTT and 20mM maltose). The final step of the purification was size exclusion chromatography using Superdex 200 HR10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 20mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 100mM NaCl and 5mM DTT.</p>
<p>The MBP tagged full-length PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> were used for biochemical characterization, however, this protein did not yield crystals. To crystallized PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>, we expressed a fragment of 2C lacking the N-terminal membrane binding domain. The cDNA encoding residues 116â329 of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> was amplified PCR and inserted into pET28-SUMO expression plasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref021">21</xref>](modified from pET28a) between BglII and XhoI sites. The resulting plasmid expressed a truncation of PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup>, denoted PV-2C-ÎN. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli competent cells BL21 (DE3) (Novagen). A single colony was picked and grew in 1L of LB media containing 50 mg/L kanamycin at 37Â°C to a density OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.8. The culture was then cooled to 18Â°C and induced by 0.5mM IPTG (final concentration). The bacteria culture continued at 18Â°C overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000g, 10min) and resuspended in cold lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 100mM NaCl) and disrupted by ultrasonication. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 25,000g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded to Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). The column was washed thoroughly with 20 column volumes of wash buffer containing 50mM Tris pH 7.5, 100mM NaCl, 20mM imidazole to eliminate nonspecifically bound proteins. Subsequently, Ulp1 peptidase was added to cleave SUMO tag at 4Â°C overnight. The flow through containing the non-tagged PV-2C-ÎN was collected and subjected to Superdex 200 HR10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 20mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 100mM NaCl and 5mM DTT.</p>
<p>Mutations of the full-length MBP-PV 2C<sup>ATPase</sup> and PV-2C-ÎN were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutants were expressed and purified using the same protocols described above.</p>

<title>Crystallization and structure determination</title>
<p>PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut was concentrated to ~5 mg/ml before crystallization trials. The protein was crystallized by mixing 1Î¼l of protein sample (5mg/ml) with 1.3Î¼l of buffer containing 0.2M MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1M MES pH 6.5, 3% (v/v) PEG4000, 9.2% (v/v) polypropylene glycol P 400, and 5mM TECP were freshly added to the buffer before use. The crystals were grown in a hanging-drop vapor diffusion system at 20Â°C. The crystals were flash frozen in Liquid nitrogen. Glycerol (v/v 25%) was used as the cryoprotectant. Complete datasets were collected at BL18U1 beamline of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). The crystal diffracted the X ray to 2.55Ã. It belonged to a space group of P2<sub>1</sub>, contained six copies of PV 2C-ÎN in the asymmetric unit (ASU). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using EV71 2C structure (PDB code: 5GQ1, B chain) as the searching model. The atomic model of PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut was completed by manual building using the software Coot v0.8.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref052">52</xref>]. The structure was refined using the software PHENIX v1.10.1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref053">53</xref>]. Most residues of PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut were located in chain A, B, C, D and E, however only a fraction of residues was visible in chain H. The loop between Î²4 and Î±3 was highly flexible in all chains. The composite omit map of PV-2C-ÎN-3Mut was calculated using the software <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://phenix.composite_omit_map" xlink:type="simple">phenix.composite_omit_map</ext-link> from PHENIX v1.10.1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007304.ref053">53</xref>].

<p>The ribbon models of chain A (red), chain B (orange), chain C (yellow), chain D (green), chain E (cyan) and chain H (blue) were aligned using Dali pairwise structure comparison server. The structural comparison between chains A and B gave Z-score = 33.1, rmsd = 1.3Ã with 204 residues aligned. The largest structural deviation between A and B chains is contributed by a small loop region 180-184aa of B chain between Î²3 and Î±2, which is resulted from the crystal packing. The structural comparison between chains A and C gave Z-score = 31.5, rmsd = 0.5Ã with 188 residues aligned. The structural comparison between chains A and D gave Z-score = 34.6, rmsd = 0.4 Ã with 202 residues aligned.

The structural comparison between chains A and H gave Z-score = 10, rmsd = 1.2Ã with 89 residues aligned. The C-terminal helix of different chains exhibits only slightly different conformation, but this is not comparable with the large conformational changes observed at the C-terminal helix in EV71 2C structure (PDB entries: 5GQ1 and 5GRB).</p>
