<abstract>
<p>Adult plant resistance (APR) is an enigmatic phenomenon in which resistance genes are ineffective in protecting seedlings from disease but confer robust resistance at maturity. Maize has multiple cases in which genes confer APR to northern leaf spot, a lethal disease caused by <italic>Cochliobolus carbonum</italic> race 1 (CCR1). The first identified case of APR in maize is encoded by a hypomorphic allele, <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup>, at the <italic>hm1</italic> locus. In contrast, wild-type alleles of <italic>hm1</italic> provide complete protection at all developmental stages and in every part of the maize plant. <italic>Hm1</italic> encodes an NADPH-dependent reductase, which inactivates HC-toxin, a key virulence effector of CCR1. Cloning and characterization of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> ruled out differential transcription or translation for its APR phenotype and identified an amino acid substitution that reduced HC-toxin reductase (HCTR) activity. The possibility of a causal relationship between the weak nature of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> and its APR phenotype was confirmed by the generation of two new APR alleles of <italic>Hm1</italic> by mutagenesis. The HCTRs encoded by these new APR alleles had undergone relatively conservative missense changes that partially reduced their enzymatic activity similar to HM1<sup>A</sup>. No difference in accumulation of HCTR was observed between adult and juvenile plants, suggesting that the susceptibility of seedlings derives from a greater need for HCTR activity, not reduced accumulation of the gene product. Conditions and treatments that altered the photosynthetic output of the host had a dramatic effect on resistance imparted by the APR alleles, demonstrating a link between the energetic or metabolic status of the host and disease resistance affected by HC-toxin catabolism by the APR alleles of HCTR.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Adult plant resistance (APR) is a phenomenon in which disease resistance genes are able to confer resistance at the adult stages of the plant but somehow fail to do so at the seedling stages. Despite the widespread occurrence of APR in various plant diseases, the mechanism underlying this trait remains obscure. It is not due to the differential transcription of these genes, and here we show that it is also not due to the differential translation or activity of the APR alleles of the maize <italic>hm1</italic> gene at different stages of development. Using a combination of molecular genetics, biochemistry and physiology, we present multiple lines of evidence that demonstrate that APR is a feature or symptom of weak forms of resistance. While the mature parts of the plant are metabolically robust enough to manifest resistance, seedling tissues are not, leaving them vulnerable to disease. Growth conditions that compromise the photosynthetic output of the plant further deteriorate the ability of the seedlings to protect themselves from pathogens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plant responses to pathogens are dynamic, and they involve a number of inducible mechanisms that are tightly regulated both in space and time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref001">1</xref>]. They are called into action only at the time and site of infection. The tight regulation of innate immunity is due to disease resistance genes that plants inherit from their parents and which often segregate with the trait of resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref003">3</xref>]. A vast majority of these disease resistance genes function in every part of the plant and at every stage of development. However, many exceptions exist where resistance is manifested in a tissue- or developmental stage-specific manner. In most instances of developmentally regulated resistance, plants are susceptible at the seedling stage but become increasingly resistant toward maturity. The term commonly used to define such developmentally regulated resistance is adult plant resistance (APR), although other terms such as age-associated resistance, ontogenic resistance, mature plant resistance, or flowering-induced resistance have also been used in the literature to describe the same phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Adult plant resistance (APR) often manifests gradually with the advancement of plant age, but a few cases have been reported where the onset is abrupt, happening sharply at a certain stage of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref012">12</xref>]. An example of the latter kind is the wheat <italic>Lr34</italic> gene-mediated resistance, in which the onset against the leaf rust pathogen, <italic>Puccinia triticina</italic>, is largely confined to the uppermost leaf (flag leaf) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref013">13</xref>]. In contrast, in the rice-<italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzae</italic> pathosystem, resistance conferred by the <italic>Xa21</italic> gene is almost negligible during the first three weeks of age but then increases steadily each week, reaching full efficacy at maturity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref015">15</xref>]. Similarly, the <italic>Yr36</italic>-conferred resistance in wheat to <italic>Puccinia striiformis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref016">16</xref>] and the <italic>Hm2</italic>-conferred resistance in maize to <italic>Cochliobolus carbonum</italic> race 1 (CCR1) increase gradually with plant age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>In efforts to understand the mechanistic basis of APR, several genes conferring this form of resistance were isolated in different pathosystems. Some of these genes include <italic>Cf-9B</italic> from tomato conferring resistance to leaf mold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref017">17</xref>], <italic>Mi-1</italic> from tomato conferring resistance to aphids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref018">18</xref>], <italic>Xa21</italic> from rice conferring resistance to leaf blight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref014">14</xref>], <italic>Lr67</italic> and <italic>Lr34</italic> from wheat conferring resistance to leaf rust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref019">19</xref>], <italic>Yr36</italic> from wheat conferring resistance to stripe rust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref016">16</xref>], and <italic>Hm2</italic> from maize conferring resistance to leaf blight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref012">12</xref>]. Two of these genes, <italic>Cf-9</italic> and <italic>Mi-1</italic>, clearly follow the gene-for-gene (GFG) paradigm in conferring resistance, while four others, <italic>Lr67</italic>, <italic>Lr34</italic>, <italic>Yr36</italic> and <italic>Hm2</italic>, do not, suggesting that any disease resistance gene has the potential to confer an APR phenotype.</p>
<p>What makes a gene behave in an APR manner? This question still eludes us, even though a number of APR genes, including those described in the preceding paragraph, have been cloned and characterized. One logical expectation was that the phenotype of APR genes may derive from their differential expression at different stages of plant development and that the level of gene expression would match their phenotypic efficacy closely. However, this has been ruled out with the majority of the APR genes, as their transcript levels do not reflect changes in their resistance phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref020">20</xref>]. Other possibilities that may affect the APR behavior of these genes are differential translation, differential post-translational modifications, and developmental changes in plant physiology and metabolism.</p>
<p>To gain insight into the mechanistic basis of APR in maize, we have been studying the northern leaf spot (NLS) disease of maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) caused by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>carbonum</italic>. This system is ideally suited because pathogen virulence on maize is determined by a single metabolite, a toxin produced by the pathogen and inactivated by the host. This toxin, HC-toxin, is the disease-causing effector of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>carbonum</italic> race 1, the race of this pathogen that causes NLS. Defeat of this effector is accomplished by the host via two loci encoding NADPH-dependent HC-toxin reductases (HCTR), which utilize NADPH as a cofactor to reduce an essential ketone function in HC-toxin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref023">23</xref>]. A classic APR syndrome is described in this pathosystem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref009">9</xref>]. The duplicate HCTR encoding genes, differ in structure and strength of conferred resistance. The HCTR encoded by wild-type (WT) <italic>Hm1</italic> contains 356 amino acids and dominantly confers resistance at every stage of plant development. The HCTR encoded by the only functional <italic>Hm2</italic> allele, by contrast, is truncated and lacks the last 52 amino acids compared to HM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref012">12</xref>] and it confers APR against CCR1 when <italic>hm1</italic> is homozygous null. <italic>Hm2</italic> is expressed throughout the age of the plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref012">12</xref>], ruling out developmentally regulated transcript accumulation as the mechanism of APR. Like <italic>Hm2</italic>, an allele of <italic>hm1</italic> conferring APR has also been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref009">9</xref>]. Designated <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup>, this APR allele is recessive to the WT <italic>Hm1</italic> allele and dominant to the <italic>hm1</italic> null allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>To explore why and how the <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> allele leads to an APR phenotype, we have cloned and characterized this allele in detail. HCTR activity in <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> plants was intermediate between WT (<italic>Hm1Hm1</italic>) and null mutant (<italic>hm1hm1hm2hm2</italic>) plants. This, along with the truncated nature of the APR allele at <italic>hm2</italic>, prompted us to consider if the hypomorphic <italic>Hm1</italic> alleles resulted in APR. This hypothesis was addressed by mutagenizing <italic>in planta</italic> the wild-type allele of <italic>hm1</italic>. Two new APR alleles also had reduced HCTR activity. Thus, APR was a symptom of partial loss-of-function mutations in <italic>Hm1</italic> that result in seedling susceptibility.</p>

<title>Detailed genetics of APR-conferring <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> as an allele of <italic>hm1</italic></title>
<p>The APR trait attributed to <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> was first noticed in the inbred P8, developed at Purdue University in the early 1960s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref009">9</xref>]. The genetic evidence linking the APR of P8 with an allele of <italic>hm1</italic> (<italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup>) made use of two segregating populations, a testcross and an F<sub>2</sub> population, generated by crossing P8 (<italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup><italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup><italic>hm2hm2</italic>) with the resistant inbred WF9 (<italic>Hm1Hm1Hm2Hm2</italic>). The susceptible inbred for the testcross was Pr, which is homozygous for null mutations at both the <italic>hm1</italic> and <italic>hm2</italic> loci. There were at least two concerns with this study. First, it used a relatively small number of progenies, comprising about 90 plants each for both the F<sub>2</sub> and testcross populations. Second, the resistant inbred WF9 also contained an APR allele at the <italic>hm2</italic> locus, leaving room for error in extrapolation from these data.</p>
<p>These concerns necessitated that we revisit these findings, to clone and characterize <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup>. We acquired P8 from the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN). To confirm that this source of P8 harbored the <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> allele reported by Nelson and Ullstrup in 1964 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref009">9</xref>], we conducted a thorough analysis of the genetics of P8 resistance to CCR1. We first crossed P8 twice with Pr (<italic>hm1hm1hm2hm2</italic>) to produce a BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>1</sub> testcross population. Of 384 BC<sub>1</sub>F<sub>1</sub> plants inoculated with CCR1, 186 plants were susceptible at both the seedling and adult stage while 198 plants were susceptible as seedlings, but later emerging leaves were fully resistant, consistent with the APR phenotype of P8. The recessive null <italic>hm1</italic> allele of Pr (designated as <italic>hm1</italic><sup><italic>Pr</italic></sup>) contains a 256-bp <italic>Drone</italic> transposon insertion in exon 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref024">24</xref>]. All 186 plants susceptible at maturity were homozygous for <italic>hm1</italic><sup><italic>Pr</italic></sup>, whereas all 198 plants that were initially susceptible and then displayed APR were heterozygous for <italic>hm1</italic><sup><italic>Pr</italic></sup>. This 1:1 ratio of susceptible <italic>vs</italic>. APR plants (<italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup>–0.375, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05, 1 d.f.) indicated that a single gene at or near the <italic>hm1</italic> locus controlled the APR behavior of P8.</p>
<p>Next we crossed P8 to Pr1, a near isogenic line (NIL) of Pr in which the mutant <italic>hm1</italic> allele was replaced by a WT <italic>Hm1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref025">25</xref>]. The resulting <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup><italic>Hm1</italic> F<sub>1</sub> hybrid was testcrossed to Pr, the <italic>hm1hm2</italic> null stock. The inheritance of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>Pr1</italic></sup> vs. <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> in this population was tracked with a PCR-based marker that differentiated between those two alleles. Of the 540 F<sub>1</sub> test cross progeny, 276 were susceptible as seedlings and later exhibited APR, while the remaining 264 were completely resistant to CCR1 regardless of age. All 264 completely resistant plants had inherited the WT <italic>Hm1</italic> allele from Pr1, while the 274 plants that exhibited APR had inherited the <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> allele from P8. Chi-squared tests supported the 1:1 expected inheritance of monogenic inheritance (X2–0.266667, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05, 1 d.f.). No recombinants between the genotypes at the <italic>hm1</italic> locus and the expression of CCR1 susceptibility were found in either population (924 opportunities for crossover). This confirmed that the source of P8 we obtained recapitulated the phenomenon described in 1964 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref009">9</xref>] and that the APR of P8 is likely conferred by the <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> allele.</p>
<p>To incorporate <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> into a uniform background for detailed phenotypic comparisons, we introgressed this APR allele into the B73 inbred by crossing P8 (<italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup><italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> <italic>hm2hm2</italic>) to B73 (<italic>Hm1Hm1hm2hm2</italic>). As <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> is recessive to WT <italic>Hm1</italic>, we utilized sequence polymorphism between <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> and <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>B73</italic></sup> to construct a PCR-based marker. After seven crosses to B73 with selection for the <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> genotype, BC<sub>7</sub>F<sub>2</sub> progeny were generated by self-pollinating a heterozygous plant. This BC<sub>7</sub>F<sub>2</sub> population segregated in a 3:1 ratio for complete resistance and APR, again consistent with <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> being responsible for APR of P8. Homozygous <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> plants from this population were selected and maintained as an <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> near-isogenic line in B73.</p>

<title>Phenotypic manifestation of adult plant resistance in maize to CCR1</title>
<p>To develop a comprehensive account of the onset of APR by <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup>, we also introgressed the null <italic>hm1</italic><sup><italic>Pr</italic></sup> allele into the B73 background over seven generations, and crossed with <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> B73 NIL to generate plants heterozygous for <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup>. Both homozygous (<italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup><italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup>) and heterozygous (<italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup><italic>hm1</italic><sup><italic>Pr</italic></sup>) <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> plants were inoculated with CCR1 at weekly intervals, starting at 1 week-after-planting (wap) and culminating at 10 wap. Their infection phenotypes were measured using a 1–10 disease rating scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref012">12</xref>] and compared with those of B73 and a B73 NIL containing the null <italic>hm1</italic> allele (<italic>hm1</italic><sup><italic>Pr</italic></sup> B73 NIL). A rating of 10 on this scale indicated highly susceptible plants, while a rating of 1 indicated complete resistance.</p>
<p>The susceptible <italic>hm1</italic><sup><italic>Pr</italic></sup> B73 NILs scored 10 on the disease rating scale regardless of age, and the resistant controls (B73 inbred), which produced small chlorotic flecks in response to CCR1 infection, scored 1 throughout development. Plants containing <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> exhibited very little resistance at the seedling stage, but severity scores decreased with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g001">Fig 1A and 1C</xref>). At the age of week-1, <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> seedlings were consistently rated 8 or higher. This disease rating dropped to 5 or less by week-5. At week-10, <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> plants resembled the resistant controls, receiving a rating of 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). The level of resistance conferred by <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> correlated with the age of the whole plant at the time of inoculation and not the age of the inoculated leaf. Inoculating each leaf of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup><italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> and <italic>hm1hm1</italic> plants at week-5 of plant growth confirmed this observation. All the leaves of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> plants were equally resistant regardless of their age, and all the leaves of <italic>hm1hm1</italic> plants were equally susceptible.</p>

<p>Similar to the APR conferred by the <italic>Hm2</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref012">12</xref>], the resistance conferred by <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> was dosage dependent.

<title>Molecular characterization of the <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> allele</title>
<p>Atypical behavior of a disease resistance gene can sometimes result from complex structural changes at the locus, such as an increase in the copy number of the gene or a part of the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref027">27</xref>]. To address if such a genetic mechanism also led to the <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> APR, we conducted a Southern blot analysis with P8 DNA digested with a variety of restriction enzymes. Consistent with the genetic data, a single <italic>BamHI</italic> restriction fragment hybridized to <italic>Hm1</italic>-specific probes on these blots, indicating that <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> was a single copy gene in the P8 inbred and that the entire gene was present on a 13 kb restriction fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). To clone the <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> gene, a lambda library was constructed from the <italic>Bam</italic>H1-digested P8 DNA restriction fragments migrating on a gel as 12 to 15 kb fragments.

<p>To determine the structural changes in <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup>, its sequence was compared with that of the B73 reference sequence. Significant changes were encountered in the promoter regions of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> and <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>B73</italic></sup>. Except for a few indels and SNPs, the first -200 bp from the translation start site of the promoter region are similar in <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> and B73 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007356.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The next -1.5 kb region upstream, however, is completely different between the two alleles, though this does not seem to be due to the insertion of a transposable element. Interestingly, the promoter region of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> is identical to that of <italic>hm1</italic><sup><italic>Pr</italic></sup>, the null <italic>hm1</italic> allele from the susceptible inbred Pr. To examine if any other resistant lines containing a wild-type <italic>Hm1</italic> allele also had a promoter region identical to that of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup>, we used a primer pair designed from the <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> promoter region to PCR amplify DNA from a number of resistant inbreds. Two inbreds, Pr1 and Va35, were found whose <italic>Hm1</italic> WT alleles have the promoter regions identical to that of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007356.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the promoter polymorphism between <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> and <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>B73</italic></sup> predicted neither resistance nor susceptibility and thus may be inconsequential to the APR phenotype of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup>.</p>
<p>The coding region of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> also differed from that of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>B73</italic></sup>, containing nine SNPs. Although four of these SNPs were silent or synonymous, five led to amino acid substitutions in the predicted HM1<sup>A</sup> peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Relative to the B73 HM1 reference, these substitutions were: a Serine to Tyrosine change at residue 99 (S99Y), an Aspartic acid to Tyrosine change at residue 110 (D110Y), a Leucine to Histidine change at residue 116 (L116H), a Serine to Asparagine change at residue 191 (S191N), and a Leucine to Proline change at residue 240 (L240P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>

<title>The L116H substitution is the likely causative polymorphism in the <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> allele</title>
<p>As <italic>Hm1</italic> is one of the most polymorphic genes in maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref028">28</xref>], we decided to examine the peptide sequence of various resistance alleles to potentially pinpoint the amino acid change(s) responsible for the APR behavior of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup>. We first amplified and evaluated the HM1 sequences of Pr1 and Va35, the two resistant inbreds that share their promoters with <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup>, and compared them with the sequences of both HM1<sup>A</sup> and HM1<sup>B73</sup>. HM1<sup>Pr1</sup> was found to differ by five amino acids from HM1<sup>B73</sup>, with two of these polymorphisms, S99Y and L240P, also being present in HM1<sup>A</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007356.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). These same two changes were also found in HM1<sup>Va35</sup>, which differed from HM1<sup>B73</sup> by six amino acids. Another resistant <italic>Hm1</italic> allele that differed from B73 by six amino acids was in the inbred W22, but none of those changes matched those of HM1<sup>A</sup>. However, the predicted HM1 of the landrace Enano from Bolivia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref028">28</xref>] shared with HM1<sup>A</sup> the two polymorphisms D110Y and S191N. And most importantly, the HM1 of the landrace Pira from Colombia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref028">28</xref>] shared four of the five amino acid changes between HM1<sup>A</sup> and HM1<sup>B73</sup>. These are S99Y, D110Y, S191N, and L240P, thereby leaving only the L116H polymorphism unique to HM1<sup>A</sup>.</p>
<p>To examine the functional status of the <italic>Hm1</italic> allele of Pira, we acquired this landrace from GRIN and inoculated it with CCR1. It was found to be completely resistant to CCR1, even at the seedling stage. This demonstrated that despite having four of the five amino acid changes of HM1<sup>A</sup>, the <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>Pira</italic></sup> allele is fully functional and not APR. These results highlight the importance of the L116H substitution in defining the phenotype of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup>. Consistent with this hypothesis, the Leucine at 116 is highly conserved not only in all the homoeologs and orthologs of the <italic>Hm1</italic> gene across the grass lineage, but also in the maize dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), an NADPH-dependent enzyme of the anthocyanin pathway predicted to be a progenitor of HM1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007356.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). All these findings suggest that the HM1<sup>A</sup> L116H substitution is unique to <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> and may underlie its APR behavior to CCR1 in maize by somehow negatively impacting HCTR activity.</p>

<p>To address if the differential translational activity of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> had any impact on its APR behavior, we first conducted western analysis to examine the level and stability of the HM1<sup>A</sup> protein. While an antibody raised against the entire HM1<sup>A</sup> peptide lacked specificity, a multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref029">29</xref>] antibody generated against a 13 aa peptide corresponding to residues 312 to 324 of the HM1 peptide worked well and reacted to a single product on Western blots generated from <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> homozygous or heterozygous plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). No change in the level of the HM1<sup>A</sup> protein could be detected over time in the <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> homozygotes, indicating that the APR phenotype of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> is not due to differential translation either. In the heterozygous <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup><italic>hm1</italic><sup><italic>Pr</italic></sup> plants, with one APR allele and one null allele, the levels of HM1<sup>A</sup> were lower than in the <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> homozygotes, consistent with a dosage effect of the <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> allele. In addition, we do detect some variation in HM1<sup>A</sup> accumulation over time, peaking at week-5 but exhibiting similar levels of accumulation at weeks-2 and -7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). That young and old plants accumulate similar levels of HM1<sup>A</sup> demonstrates, again, that preferential accumulation of HM1<sup>A</sup> protein in older plants cannot explain their resistance.</p>
<p>We next addressed if the activity of HCTR encoded by <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> had any role in its APR behavior. To do this, an LC-MS/MS-based <italic>in vitro</italic> HCTR activity assay that quantified the reduction of HC-toxin by crude protein extracts was developed. The <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements were normalized to total protein content, allowing us to estimate the level of the functional HCTR in plant tissues. To examine the level of HCTR over time, proteins were extracted from CCR1-inoculated leaves of 3- and 7-week-old plants of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> and control stocks, and their HCTR activity was measured in replicated samples. Two trends were noted as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g003">Fig 3D</xref>. First, the HCTR activity encoded by HM1<sup>A</sup> was lower than that of the WT allele but not null as that of <italic>hm1</italic><sup><italic>Pr</italic></sup>. At both stages of development, the HCTR activity of HM1<sup>A</sup> was about 3-fold lower than that of HM1. Second, the level of active HCTR differed little if any in 3- or 7-week <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Likewise, the HCTR activity of the WT allele also did not differ between week-3 and week-7-old plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Two conclusions can be drawn from these results. First, <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> encodes an HCTR that is relatively weaker than the enzyme encoded by the WT allele. Second, the level of the active HCTR stays constant over development and does not account for the APR phenotype of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup>.</p>

<title>Partial loss-of-function mutations confer adult plant resistance in the maize-CCR1 pathosystem</title>
<p>What aspect of the <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> gene structure or function restricts it to be an APR gene, i.e., conferring resistance only at the mature-plant stage but not the seedling stage? Having ruled out differential transcription or translation as possible mechanisms, we paid attention to an attribute of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> that differentiates it from both the WT and null mutant alleles of <italic>hm1</italic>—the relatively weak nature of the HCTR activity encoded by <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup>. This partial enzymatic activity of HM1<sup>A</sup> mirrored exactly the phenotypic strength of resistance conferred by this APR allele, which is recessive to that of WT <italic>Hm1</italic> but dominant to that of null <italic>hm1</italic>. Given that the APR allele at the <italic>hm2</italic> locus also confers partial resistance to CCR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref012">12</xref>], we pondered if this could be a requirement for a resistance gene to have an APR phenotype.</p>
<p>If this hypothesis that a <italic>Hm1</italic> APR allele owes its phenotype to being a weak or partial loss-of-function allele is correct, we should be able to confirm it by generating new APR alleles from the WT <italic>Hm1</italic> allele by mutagenesis. To address this possibility, we first tried a random mutagenesis screen to generate new alleles of <italic>Hm1</italic>, in large part because of the lethal nature of CCR1 infection on field-grown plants lacking functional <italic>Hm1</italic>. About 1,000 M<sub>2</sub> families of B73 were generated by treating pollen with the mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). Twenty-four plants per M<sub>2</sub> family were planted in a field and inoculated with CCR1 at the seedling stage. One M<sub>2</sub> family was identified in which CCR1-susceptible plants segregated in a recessive fashion. These plants remained susceptible throughout their growth, suggesting they were the result of a null mutation. Sequence analysis of the <italic>hm1</italic> allele from this mutant (named <italic>hm1-2</italic>) confirmed its null status and revealed a single G to A transition at the junction of exon3/intron3 as the cause of mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007356.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Since this change is expected to abolish the splicing of intron 3, it would result in a truncated protein lacking all the amino acids encoded by exons 4 and 5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007356.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). It is unlikely that such a grossly truncated protein would have any HCTR activity.</p>
<p>We next conducted a targeted mutagenesis screen to generate a series of mutant alleles of <italic>Hm1</italic>. To accomplish this, EMS-mutagenized <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>B73</italic></sup> pollen was applied to ears of completely susceptible Pr plants in a greenhouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Approximately 4,500 M<sub>1</sub> seeds obtained from this cross were planted in the field and inoculated with CCR1 at week-2. Seven plants were identified as CCR1 susceptible at this seedling stage. When inoculated again at week-5, five of them were still fully susceptible, suggesting they were null mutants. The other two plants however exhibited APR as they developed different levels of resistance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007356.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Sequencing the <italic>Hm1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007356.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) from all seven mutants revealed that they all carried GC to AT transitions in the coding region of <italic>Hm1</italic>. The two APR-exhibiting alleles (designated <italic>Hm1-3</italic> and <italic>Hm1-4</italic>) had missense mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions, T90M in <italic>Hm1-3</italic> and V210M in <italic>Hm1-4</italic>, in the HM1 peptide (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007356.t001">Table 1</xref>). Of the five null mutants, three (named <italic>hm1-6</italic> to <italic>hm1-8</italic>) had nonsense mutations, one a C82Y substitution (<italic>hm1-5</italic>), and one a splice-site mutation (<italic>hm1-9</italic>) at the junction of intron 4/exon 5 that also produced a pre-mature stop codon (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007356.t001">Table 1</xref>). The new APR alleles were introgressed back into B73 for seven generations using CAPs markers. Comparison of the resistance phenotype of the two new APR alleles with <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> revealed that all three APR alleles differ markedly from each other in this trait. <italic>Hm1</italic>-3 confers the highest level of resistance at all stages of development, followed by <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> and <italic>Hm1-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This screen thus provided us with a series of APR alleles at the <italic>hm1</italic> locus.</p>

<title>Like <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup>, the new APR alleles encode HCTRs with intermediate activity</title>
<p>To evaluate if the HCTR activity encoded by <italic>Hm1-3</italic> and <italic>Hm1-4</italic> was also partially compromised like that of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup>, we used the aforementioned LC-MS/MS based activity assay on samples derived from these two mutants as well as their positive and negative controls. During weeks-3 and -7 (when APR plants are susceptible and resistant, respectively), crude protein was extracted from the leaf tissue following inoculation with CCR1. The HCTR activity of extracts from APR plants was found to be significantly reduced when compared with B73 at both week-3 and week-7, indicating that HM1-3 and HM1-4 proteins exhibit partially compromised HCTR activity during both susceptible and resistant plant ages, like HM1<sup>A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Furthermore, and consistent with HM1<sup>A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), the levels of their HCTR did not change significantly with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g006">Fig 6</xref>) despite the age-dependent manifestation of disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007356.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

<p>Differences in the disease/resistance ratings of the new APR alleles predicted corresponding differences in their HCTR activities. This indeed was found to be true. The disease severity of APR plants at three weeks of age was found to be linearly correlated with HCTR activity (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g006">6</xref>). The APR allele with the highest degree of HCTR activity was HM1-3, followed by HM1<sup>A</sup>, and HM1-4 being the weakest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g006">Fig 6</xref>). This variation in enzymatic activity is consistent with the gradient of CCR1 resistance displayed by <italic>Hm1-3</italic>, <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup>, and <italic>Hm1-4</italic> plants from strongest to weakest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g005">Fig 5</xref>). At maturity, however, plants carrying any of these weak alleles of <italic>Hm1</italic> were all indistinguishable from WT B73. This was not the case with plants carrying only the null allele; they remained uniformly susceptible to CCR1 infection even at maturity.</p>

<title>Modulation of photosynthesis output alters susceptibility to CCR1 in <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> seedlings</title>
<p>If the HCTR levels of the APR alleles remain largely uniform throughout plant development, why then are weak alleles unable to confer protection at the seedling stage? Some anecdotal observations that we have made about plants with APR alleles suggested that the availability of fixed carbon for energy production played a role in determining the ability of these weak alleles to suppress disease. The APR mutants always exhibited greater disease susceptibility and prolonged sensitivity in winter greenhouses as compared to the field. In the winter greenhouse, those plants closest to supplemental lights were more resistant than plants growing distant from light fixtures. Third, the resistance phenotype of APR alleles was compromised in double-mutant combination with the dominant <italic>oil-yellow1-N1989</italic> allele that has a chlorophyll deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>We grew the <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> plants at extended and reduced photoperiods to test the hypothesis that energy availability from fixed carbon could determine disease susceptibility in APR mutants. Fully-resistant WT B73 and fully-susceptible homozygotes for the null <italic>hm1-2</italic> allele were grown side-by-side with <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> B73 NIL homozygotes in a growth chamber with a light regimen of 12h light (L) and 12h dark (D) for 2 weeks. Following inoculation with CCR1 and overnight incubation, half of the seedlings were shifted to a growth chamber adjusted at 18h L and 6h D. <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> mutant seedlings were strongly influenced by light regime. <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> seedlings grown in 12:12 L:D photoperiod were susceptible to CCR1 when examined at 72 hours post-inoculation (hpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) and showed no ability to suppress expanding lesions at 96 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). However, the <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> plants that were shifted to 18:6 L:D developed a resistant reaction instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>). Daylight duration of 12h was not sufficient to disrupt the resistance provided by the WT B73 genotype. Similarly, increased daylength was insufficient to overcome the susceptibility of the <italic>hm1-2</italic> null homozygotes. Thus, the seedling susceptibility of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> conferred by low HCTR activity could be overcome by providing a longer period of photosynthetically active radiation.</p>

<p>We reasoned that if photosynthate availability enhanced resistance and permitted the weak <italic>Hm1</italic> alleles to confer seedling resistance, disruption of energy balance should negate their ability to confer any resistance. To test this, seedlings were either incubated in extended darkness or treated with the herbicide (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea) (DCMU), which disrupts electron transfer during the light reactions of photosynthesis. For this experiment we used <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> and <italic>Hm1-3</italic> APR homozygotes as well as WT B73 and the null <italic>hm1-2</italic> homozygotes as controls to determine the impact of these treatments on resistance.

If the lack of photosynthesis is responsible for susceptibility following extended darkness, then CCR1 susceptibility should also result from disruption of photosynthesis by herbicide treatment. To test this, the same genotypes were grown at 14:10 L:D and inoculated with CCR1. At 24 hpi, plants were divided into two groups with one receiving a solution of DCMU applied to the leaf whorl. At 7 dpi (6 days after DCMU treatment), the DCMU treated <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> and <italic>Hm1-3</italic> homozygotes were completely susceptible to CCR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study reveals one fundamental aspect of adult plant resistance (APR) in maize to CCR1. APR alleles at the <italic>hm1</italic> locus are weak determinants of resistance that fail to protect plants at the seedling stage but are sufficient to confer complete protection to CCR1 at maturity. This conclusion is supported by multiple lines of evidence derived from a combination of genetic, molecular, and biochemical experimentation. Genetic analysis demonstrated that all APR alleles of <italic>hm1</italic> confer partial resistance that exhibits haploinsufficiency (gene-dosage sensitivity) during most stages of plant development. This contrasts with resistance conferred by the wild-type (WT) alleles of <italic>hm1</italic> that are completely dominant and protect every part of the plant regardless of age or maturity. Plants with null alleles of <italic>hm1</italic>, on the other hand, are susceptible to CCR1 at all stages of development. CCR1 infection typically results in plant lethality for these alleles, and the ubiquitous nature of this pathogen makes them difficult to propagate in the field. The APR alleles of <italic>hm1</italic> are recessive to the WT alleles (e.g., <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>B73</italic></sup>) but dominant to null alleles of <italic>hm1</italic> (e.g., <italic>hm1</italic><sup><italic>Pr</italic></sup>).</p>
<p>Consistent with the idea that APR is a symptom of weak or partial loss-of-function alleles, we were able to generate two new APR alleles from the WT <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>B73</italic></sup> allele by mutagenesis with EMS. Five completely susceptible mutants were also recovered in this mutant screen, which presumably encoded null mutations. In keeping with these predictions, molecular analysis of these null alleles showed that four of the five null mutants were the result of nonsense mutations that truncated their predicted peptides by introducing premature stop codons. The fifth null mutant, which was caused by a missense mutation, changed a highly conserved cysteine residue (C82Y) that is perhaps critical for protein function. In sharp contrast, both novel APR alleles underwent relatively conservative mutational changes: T90M in <italic>Hm1-3</italic> and V210M in <italic>Hm1-4</italic>. Even <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup>, which differs from the WT <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>B73</italic></sup> allele by five amino acids, seems to owe its APR phenotype to a single L116H change. HCTR activity was encoded by all of the APR alleles, indicating that none of these mutations completely eliminates the function of the enzyme. Their HCTR activities were compromised, however, being intermediate to that of the fully functional WT allele (which confers completely dominant protection) and the recessive null <italic>hm1</italic> alleles, which impart no resistance to CCR1. These results indicate that at some level HCTR activity is unable to deter the pathogen from colonizing maize plants at the seedling stage but that level of activity is sufficient to prevent CCR1 from colonizing at maturity.</p>
<p>A cause-and-effect relationship between APR and partial-loss-of-function alleles of <italic>hm1</italic> is further substantiated by the correlation between the strength of the resistance reaction conferred by an APR allele and its HCTR activity. The level of HCTR activity matched perfectly with the strength of CCR1 resistance conditioned by the three APR alleles. These results demonstrate that alleles of <italic>hm1</italic> with partial loss-of-function mutations encode HCTR with a compromised activity and that the weaker activity results in later onset of disease resistance. The resistance of seedlings encoding WT <italic>Hm1</italic> demonstrates that efficient toxin deactivation is sufficient for maize seedlings to resist CCR1 infection and, therefore, they express all of the required machinery for defense. Likewise, mature plants lacking <italic>hm1</italic> function are completely susceptible, demonstrating that HCTR is absolutely required for CCR1 infection, and mature maize plants are not protected from toxin-mediated disease spread. These interpretations depend on the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay correctly reflecting <italic>in vivo</italic> activity. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> HCTR activity assay did not detect the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of the enzyme but instead the level of the functional protein present at a given time point. It is possible that <italic>in vivo</italic> activity did not correspond to the <italic>in vitro</italic> activity identified by this method.</p>
<p>A seemingly mechanistic relationship between partial resistance and APR is also evident in many other pathosystems where such genes have been cloned and studied in detail. One example is that of <italic>Cf-9B</italic>, which mediates incomplete resistance to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>fulvum</italic> in a developmentally specified fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref017">17</xref>]. Its paralog <italic>Cf9</italic>, which encodes a receptor like protein, confers complete protection in all plant tissues at every stage of development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref031">31</xref>]. Another example is that of <italic>Xa21</italic>, a receptor-like kinase that confers weak resistance to Xanthomonas leaf blight in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref015">15</xref>]. The maize <italic>Hm2</italic> APR allele provides another example. The weak CCR1 resistance provided by this allele is conferred by a truncated HCTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>In wheat, APR genes are rather common and have been used widely to protect this crop from all forms of the disease caused by three different species of rust pathogens (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref032">32</xref>]). Even though APR genes confer little or no protection in wheat seedlings, the broad-spectrum and durable nature of resistance provided by such genes in adult plants have many breeders proclaim that breeding for rust resistance should deploy only APR genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref032">32</xref>]. Three of these wheat APR genes have been cloned recently and, interestingly, they all appear to confer resistance by different mechanisms. One of them, <italic>Yr36</italic>, a mediator of resistance to yellow rust, encodes a kinase with an unusual domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref016">16</xref>], while <italic>Lr34</italic> and <italic>Lr67</italic>, both of which mediate APR to both rust and powdery mildew pathogens, encode an ABC transporter and a hexose transporter, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref019">19</xref>]. Exactly how these genes confer APR remains unresolved, but one thread that unifies them is their ability to confer only weak or partial resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref032">32</xref>]. Overexpression of <italic>Lr34</italic>, one of the best studied APR genes, however, did enable it to confer seedling resistance in durum wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref033">33</xref>]. Furthermore, the efficacy of this transgene in conferring seedling resistance improved even further under extended daylight conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref034">34</xref>]. These results echo what we have discovered with the APR alleles in maize and suggest that the connection between weak resistance and APR is not unique to the maize-CCR1 pathosystem but perhaps is a general feature of most disease resistance genes that are weak and provide only partial protection.</p>
<p>A second major finding is that APR is not the result of the enhanced level or activity of proteins encoded by APR alleles at the mature-plant stage. Rather, it must be the result of a change in seedlings vs. mature plants that affects differential resistance. It was previously shown in a number of cases that the differential transcriptional activity of an APR gene did not account for its APR phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref020">20</xref>]. Here we extend this to the level and HCTR activity of the accumulated HM1 proteins, which remained stable across development. At the onset of APR, resistance manifests uniformly in all parts of the plant, including the youngest leaves that are still unfurled, indicating that the APR-inducing factor is not accumulated over a long period of time in aging tissues, but rather is available in every part of the plant regardless of the age of the organ and determined solely by the plant maturity.</p>
<p>Considering that the HCTR activity is present at equivalent levels in APR mutant extracts regardless of plant stage, why then are seedlings susceptible? Though the studies presented here do not resolve this question, the biochemical mechanism by which <italic>hm1</italic> confers resistance to CCR1 suggests a plausible scenario. Although this resistance is conferred by <italic>hm1</italic>-encoded HCTR, the HC-toxin (HCT) inactivation reaction requires the reducing power of NADPH as a co-substrate. The direct involvement of NADPH in HC-toxin reduction suggests this molecule could be very critical in regulating resistance in the maize-CCR1 pathosystem. Supporting this hypothesis are our results showing that light and photosynthetic activity have a great impact on resistance mediated by APR alleles, either boosting them to confer seedling resistance or limiting them to prevent APR.</p>
<p>Based on these results, it could well be the availability of NADPH that determines the difference in resistance between seedling and mature stages in the <italic>hm1</italic> APR mutants. NADPH is produced during the light reactions of photosynthesis, the C4 malate shuttle, and sugar oxidation, along with other energy carriers such as ATP. Maize seedlings not only have a limited photosynthetic capacity to assimilate carbon (C), but also strong sinks to consume these assimilates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref035">35</xref>]. As a result, seedling leaves become C-deficient at night and that may negatively impact the availability of NADPH and ATP. Since NADPH is required for HCTR activity, its depletion at night may negatively impact the activity of hypomorphic mutants of HCTR, thereby leaving HC-toxin active to induce susceptibility to CCR1. Bolstering this hypothesis is the observation that the <italic>Hm1-3</italic> and <italic>Hm1-4</italic> mutations occur at residues predicted to be critical for the binding of NADPH to HCTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref036">36</xref>]. The mutant HCTR may require higher NADPH levels for sufficient activity for CCR1 suppression, while WT HCTR affinity for NADPH retains sufficient activity during the expected dip in NADPH cofactor concentration during the night. Surprisingly, we were unable to find a study of diurnal NADPH concentrations in maize, and such measurements would permit a test of this hypothesis. Such a scenario may also explain why plants with the APR alleles become more resistant as they mature; increased output of photosynthates may outstrip the sink requirements, allowing excess photosynthates to be stored as starch during the day and then used at night to fuel NADPH production.</p>
<p>Several aspects of plant bioenergetics are expected to support the resistance of plants to pathogens. In the case of our APR alleles, NADPH may play an additional critical role in energizing APR in the maize-CCR1 pathosystem. This, of course, is due to the direct involvement of this molecule as a cofactor in the enzyme reaction that is the resistance mechanism mediated by HCTR. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that maize plants carrying the WT <italic>Hm1</italic> gene are completely resistant to CCR1 at all stages of development, including as seedlings and in the shorter day-lengths that resulted in loss of resistance in plants carrying APR alleles (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g008">8</xref>). A number of further tests of this hypothesis are available including measurements of HC toxin reduction <italic>in vivo</italic> in the same conditions employed for our CCR1 inoculations. We have demonstrated that HCTR accumulation is not different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007356.g003">Fig 3</xref>) and diurnal modulation in HC toxin reduction could be studied using purified toxin. This hypothesis, if validated, would provide a direct link between primary metabolism in the host and disease resistance.</p>
<p>An intriguing implication of this study concerns the metabolic basis of resistance in plants. This topic is not only of fundamental interest to plant pathologists and entomologists but also has huge agricultural relevance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref039">39</xref>]. Our study demonstrates that, compared to strong resistance, the weak form of resistance has a much higher metabolic demand from the host. As shown in the case of APR, this can be so high that the seedlings are not able to express such resistance effectively. This argument may also extend to quantitative forms of resistance that are often weak and easily affected by the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref041">41</xref>]. We have shown for the CCR1-maize pathosystem that the vulnerability of seedlings to diseases can increase in conditions that compromise photosynthesis. This phenomenon is analogous to what has been well established in the animal world that malnutrition compromises the immunity of infants much more than that of adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007356.ref043">43</xref>].</p>

Amplified PCR fragments were processed as described above for <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> amplification and submitted to the Purdue Genomics Facility for low-throughput sequencing.</p>

<title>Differential photoperiod treatments of <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> plants</title>
<p><italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> B73 NIL plants were grown in Conviron growth chambers providing a 12:12 L:D photoperiod. The WT B73 and <italic>hm1-2</italic> were used as resistant and susceptible controls, respectively. Two-week-old plants were inoculated with 100 μl of 10<sup>5</sup> spores/mL of CCR1 spore suspension into the leaf whorl. CCR1-inoculated plants were incubated overnight in a humidity chamber at 80% relative humidity. These plants were then subjected to 12:12 L:D or 18:6 L:D photoperiods. The response reaction to CCR1 infection was evaluated every 24 h for a 96 h period. Digital photographs of lesion progression were taken using a Canon EOS Digital Rebel XSi camera.</p>
<p>Additional extended darkness and DCMU treatment experiments were performed in growth chambers on plants homozygous <italic>Hm1</italic><sup><italic>A</italic></sup> and <italic>Hm1-3</italic> in the B73 genetic background. Again, WT B73 and <italic>hm1-2</italic> served as resistant and susceptible controls. Plants were grown in a growth chamber under 14:10 L:D for two weeks. We inoculated these plants with CCR1 and subjected them to two different light regimes, 14:10 L:D or 4:20 L:D. On a subset of CCR1 inoculated plants transferred to 14:10 L:D, the herbicide (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea) (DCMU) at a concentration of 100 μM was applied to the leaf whorl 24 hpi. Disease severity of these plants was determined at 7 dpi.</p>
