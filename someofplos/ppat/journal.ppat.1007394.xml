<abstract>
<p>Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is the major transforming protein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and is critical for EBV-induced B-cell transformation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) regulates accessibility of chromatin, alters functions of transcriptional activators and repressors, and has been directly implicated in transcriptional activation. Previously we showed that LMP1 activates PARP1 and increases Poly(ADP-ribos)ylation (PARylation) through PARP1. Therefore, to identify targets of LMP1 that are regulated through PARP1, LMP1 was ectopically expressed in an EBV-negative Burkitt’s lymphoma cell line. These LMP1-expressing cells were then treated with the PARP inhibitor olaparib and prepared for RNA sequencing. The LMP1/PARP targets identified through this RNA-seq experiment are largely involved in metabolism and signaling. Interestingly, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of RNA-seq data suggests that hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) is an LMP1 target mediated through PARP1. PARP1 is acting as a coactivator of HIF-1α-dependent gene expression in B cells, and this co-activation is enhanced by LMP1-mediated activation of PARP1. HIF-1α forms a PARylated complex with PARP1 and both HIF-1α and PARP1 are present at promoter regions of HIF-1α downstream targets, leading to accumulation of positive histone marks at these regions. Complex formation, PARylation and binding of PARP1 and HIF-1α at promoter regions of HIF-1α downstream targets can all be attenuated by PARP1 inhibition, subsequently leading to a buildup of repressive histone marks and loss of positive histone marks. In addition, LMP1 switches cells to a glycolytic ‘Warburg’ metabolism, preferentially using aerobic glycolysis over mitochondrial respiration. Finally, LMP1+ cells are more sensitive to PARP1 inhibition and, therefore, targeting PARP1 activity may be an effective treatment for LMP1+ EBV-associated malignancies.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is one of the most ubiquitous human viruses, with over 90% of adults worldwide harboring lifelong latent EBV infection in a small fraction of their B-lymphocytes. EBV is known to cause lymphoproliferative disorders and is associated with several other types of cancer, including Hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma and Nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, in most cases, the approach to EBV-positive lymphomas does not differ from EBV-negative lymphomas of the same histology. Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is the major transforming protein of EBV and is critical for EBV-induced B-cell transformation in vitro. LMP1 activates several epigenetic regulators to modify host gene expression, including the chromatin-modifying enzyme Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, or PARP1. In the current study we have determined that LMP1 can activate PARP1 to increase hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α)-dependent gene expression, leading to a change in host cell metabolism indicative of a ‘Warburg effect’ (aerobic glycolysis). This subsequently provides a proliferative advantage to LMP1-expressing cells. The LMP1-induced increase in HIF-1α-dependent gene expression, alteration of cellular metabolism, and accelerated cellular proliferation, can be offset with the PARP inhibitor olaparib. Therefore, targeting PARP1 activity may be an effective treatment for LMP1+ EBV-associated malignancies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human gammaherpesvirus that latently infects approximately 95% of the population worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref001">1</xref>]. Latent EBV infection causes lymphoproliferative disease in immunosuppressed patients and is associated with Burkitt’s lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref003">3</xref>]. Following infection in epithelial cells, EBV often initially establishes a latent type III infection in naive B cells, where it expresses its full repertoire of latency genes. Expression of these genes within infected B cells drives proliferation and differentiation by triggering intracellular signals which mimic antigenic stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref004">4</xref>]. Type III latency genes include the six Epstein–Barr nuclear antigens (EBNAs 1, 2, 3A, 3B and 3C and EBNA leader protein (EBNA-LP)), latent membrane proteins LMP1 and LMP2 (which encodes two isoforms, LMP2A and LMP2B) and the non-coding EBV-encoded RNAs (EBER1 and EBER2) and viral microRNA (miRNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>During various stages of B cell differentiation in vivo, EBV will express either the latency III program, or one of two alternative forms of virus latency (known as latency I and latency II). Expression of the large set of EBV genes in latency III is highly immunogenic and eventually leads to the implementation of a limited gene expression profile (type I latent gene expression program) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref006">6</xref>], with only Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) expressed. EBNA1 is essential for viral episomal maintenance and replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref007">7</xref>] and allows the EBV-infected host cell to evade detection by the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Specific EBV-associated malignancies are associated with different latency types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref006">6</xref>]. Therefore, understanding EBV gene regulation during latency and latency switching will provide fundamental new insights into the development of novel, targeted treatments against EBV-associated malignancies. In particular, there is an unmet need for the specific targeting of EBV-positive lymphomas, as in most instances the approach to EBV-positive lymphomas does not differ from EBV-negative lymphomas of the same histology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification where single units (mono-ADP-ribosylation) or polymeric chains (poly-ADP-ribosylation) of ADP-ribose are conjugated to proteins by ADP-ribosyltransferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref010">10</xref>]. This post-translational modification by the ADP-ribosyltransferases (also known as PARPs) plays a key role in a variety of nuclear processes including transcriptional regulation via epigenetic mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref014">14</xref>], and direct histone modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref016">16</xref>]. PARylation of histones reduces their affinity for DNA due to electrostatic repulsion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref013">13</xref>], allowing greater accessibility to DNA repair or transcriptional machineries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref018">18</xref>]. The host also uses PARylation, specifically through the PARP1 protein, to regulate both the lytic and latent infection of EBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Our group has previously shown that viral gene products can also influence PARylation, and that disruption of PARP regulation is sufficient to alter host gene expression. In that study, the relationship between EBV latency type and PARylation was explored, and type III cells latently infected with EBV were determined to have significantly higher PAR levels than type I latently infected EBV cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref022">22</xref>]. Expression of the type III latency-associated EBV protein Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) alone was sufficient to promote PARP1-mediated PARylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref022">22</xref>]. LMP1 is the major transforming protein of EBV and is critical for EBV-induced B-cell transformation <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>As LMP1 alone was sufficient to promote PARP1-mediated PARylation, we are reporting here an unbiased approach to identify global targets of LMP1 that are regulated through PARP1. In this approach, LMP1 was ectopically expressed in an EBV-negative Burkitt’s lymphoma cell line DG75. These LMP1-expressing cells were then treated with the PARP inhibitor olaparib and prepared for RNA sequencing. The LMP1/PARP targets identified through this RNA-seq experiment are largely involved in metabolism and signaling. Interestingly, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, IPA, of RNA-seq data suggests that the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) is an LMP1 target mediated through PARP1. Dysregulation and overexpression of HIF-1α due to hypoxia or genetic alternations are heavily implicated in oncogenesis, as well as several other pathophysiologies, involving vascularization and angiogenesis, energy metabolism, cell survival, and tumor invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Transcriptionally active HIF-1 is a heterodimer composed of α- and β-subunits. The dimer is a member of the basic helix loop helix-PER-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) family of transcription factors which play a role in cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref026">26</xref>]. In normal, non-hypoxic cells, HIF-1α is continually synthesized and degraded, while HIF-1β is constitutively expressed to relatively constant levels within the nucleus. HIF-1α degradation is initiated by hydroxylation of a proline residue (Pro-402 and/or Pro-564) by prolyl hydroxylases (PHD-1, PHD-2, and PHD- 3) using molecular oxygen as a co-substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref028">28</xref>]. Upon hydroxylation, HIF-1α- OH becomes ubiquitinated by the von Hippel Lindau E3 ubiquitin ligase protein (VHL), and subsequent proteasomal breakdown occurs. In low oxygen, PHDs cannot function, resulting in stabilization of HIF-1α in the cytoplasm and its translocation to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, several human oncogenic viruses increase levels of the transcription factor HIF-1, including EBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref030">30</xref>]. Specifically, LMP1 was shown to enhance the synthesis of HIF-1α and the expression of HIF-1α-responsive genes in a nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)-derived cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref031">31</xref>], which could be attributed to enhanced degradation of prolylhydroxylases (PHD) 1 and 3 mediated by SIAH1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref032">32</xref>]. More recent work illustrates that infection of full length EBV increases HIF-1α protein levels and its translocation to the nucleus in comparison to normal cytokine-induced proliferating B cells. EBNA-3 and EBNA-LP were shown to bind directly to PHD-2 and PHD-1, respectively, preventing HIF-1α hydroxylation and consequently allowing it to escape degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref033">33</xref>]. In addition, PARP1-deficient chronic myelogenous leukemia cells showed reduced HIF-1 transcriptional activation dependent on PARP1 enzymatic activity. PARP1 was found to complex with HIF-1α through direct protein interaction and increased HIF-1α–dependent gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>We report here that PARP inhibition offsets LMP1-mediated gene activation. Specifically, we determined that LMP1 can modulate host gene expression by using PARP1 as a coactivator of HIF-1α-dependent gene expression in B cells. PARP1 directly co-activates HIF-1α–dependent gene expression by binding to the promoter regions of HIF-1α targets. Many of these HIF-1α–dependent gene targets are involved in metabolism, and consequently LMP1+ cells are much less dependent on mitochondrial respiration and instead use aerobic glycolysis, conferring a ‘Warburg effect’/aerobic glycolysis (high rate of glycolysis followed by lactic acid fermentation even in the presence of abundant oxygen) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref035">35</xref>]. Finally, LMP1+ cells are more sensitive to PARP1 inhibition and therefore targeting PARP1 activity may be an effective treatment for LMP1+ EBV-associated malignancies.</p>

<title>PARP inhibition offsets LMP1-mediated gene activation</title>
<p>To identify global targets of LMP1 regulated by PARP1, LMP1 was ectopically expressed in the EBV-negative Burkitt’s lymphoma cell line DG75 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007394.s001">S1A Fig</xref>)</bold>. Cells were transduced with retroviral particles containing either pBABE (empty vector) or pBABE-HA-LMP1 vectors. Transduced cells were placed under long-term selection in medium containing 1 μg/ml puromycin and LMP1 expression was confirmed by western blotting, which showed physiological protein levels as observed in latency type III cell lines (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007394.s001">S1B Fig</xref>)</bold>. Previously we have demonstrated that expression of the type III latency-associated EBV protein LMP1 alone was sufficient to promote PARP1-mediated PARylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref022">22</xref>], and this was also observed following ectopic expression of LMP1 in DG75 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007394.s001">S1D Fig</xref></bold>). LMP1 positive (+) and LMP1 negative (-) cells were incubated for 72 hrs with 1 μM of the PARP inhibitor olaparib or the DMSO vehicle as a control. RNA was then isolated and prepared for RNA sequencing. We observed that the expression of 2504 genes were significantly changed (FDR&lt;0.01) when comparing LMP1- vs LMP1+ cells, with 1578 and 926 genes upregulated and downregulated by LMP1, respectively (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007394.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref></bold>). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) predicted HIF-1α as one of the top upstream regulators activated by LMP1 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007394.s002">S2D Fig</xref></bold>). Furthermore, gene function analysis identified pathways such as glycolysis I, gluconeogenesis I, Notch signaling and B cell development to be upregulated by LMP1 (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007394.s002">S2C Fig</xref>).</bold> Inspection of regulated genes and IPA analysis showed well-known targets of LMP1 that have been reported in prior literature, confirming that ectopic expression in DG75 could recapitulate the changes in gene expression induced by LMP1.</p>
<p>We then compared untreated LMP1+ cells with LMP1+ cells treated with the PARP inhibitor olaparib. In total, we observed expression of 2435 genes to be significantly changed (FDR&lt;0.01), with balanced up and downregulation following PARP inhibition (1163 and 1272 genes, respectively) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007394.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>)</bold>.

<p>We then overlaid the aforementioned two datasets and introduced log2 I1I Fold Change to identify our ‘LMP1/PARP1’ targets, of which there were 292 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007394.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</bold> Of these 292 genes, the majority (225) were upregulated by LMP1 and offset by PARP1 inhibition <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007394.g001">Fig 1B</xref>)</bold>. We performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering and observed that the LMP1+ samples treated with olaparib and the LMP1- samples clustered together and separately from the LMP1+ untreated samples. We observed that two clusters emerged among the LMP1/PARP1 targets, which were analyzed by IPA gene function analysis. Cluster 1 genes were upregulated by LMP1 and downregulated following PARP1 inhibition, while cluster 2 genes were downregulated by LMP1 and upregulated following PARP1 inhibition (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007394.g001">Fig 1C</xref></bold>).

<p>As there is an increase in PARP1 activity and HIF-1 transcriptional activation in LMP1+ cells, and inhibition of PARP1 catalytic activity reduces HIF-1 transcriptional activation, we wanted to determine if the PARP1/HIF-1α complex was PARylated in LMP1+ cells. As shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007394.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>,</bold> following incubation with Poly-ADP-ribose binding macrodomain resin, western blot for HIF-1α and PARP1 confirms that the PARP1/HIF-1α complex is PARylated. Specifically, LMP1+ cells exhibited a two-fold increase in HIF-1α and PARP1 levels, respectively, compared to LMP1- cells following pull down with the Poly-ADP-ribose binding macrodomain resin (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007394.g003">Fig 3D</xref>)</bold>. Biological replicates of the IP and PAR resin assays are shown in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007394.s006">S6 Fig</xref></bold>.

<title>PARP1 co-activates HIF-1α–dependent gene expression by binding to the promoter regions of HIF-1α targets</title>
<p>To determine if increased PARP activation in LMP1+ cells was augmenting HIF-1 transcriptional activation by influencing HIF-1 binding to its downstream promoters, we performed ChIP-PCR experiments on promoter regions of validated HIF-1α targets. These targets have been validated by RT-qPCR and had demonstrated increased transcription in LMP1+ cells vs LMP1- cells and decreased transcription in LMP1+ cells, following both PARP1 inhibition and PARP1 knockdown. Promoter regions of three such HIF-1α targets were bound by PARP1 and HIF-1α considerably more in LMP1+ cells vs LMP1- cells. Furthermore, binding of HIF-1α and PARP1 was reduced at promoter regions of HIF-1α targets by PARP1 inhibition in LMP1+ cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007394.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref></bold>). One exception was at the BNIP3 promoter, where no loss of HIF-1α binding following PARP1 inhibition was observed. Therefore, in the case of BNIP3, it may be that despite HIF-1α binding, the HIF-1α/PARP complex is less active and less stable following PARP inhibition (as shown by IP data and loss of PARP1 binding to BNIP3 promoter), which results in the decreased gene expression observed. This leads to the speculation that the presence of PARP1 at the promoter may be the determining factor for activation of HIF-1-responsive gene expression in a subset of HIF-1-responsive genes. However, after ChIP-PCR experiments with EBV infected cells with latency III and I setting (Mutu III/I) (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007394.s005">S5B Fig</xref></bold>), we did observe loss of HIF-1α binding at the BNIP promoter following PARP1 inhibition.

<title>LMP1 confers a ‘Warburg’ effect</title>
<p>Many of the HIF-1α downstream transcriptional targets activated by LMP1 through PARP1 are involved in metabolism, therefore we aimed to determine if LMP1/PARP1interaction lead to any functional metabolic effect at the cellular level. To examine this, we performed mito stress test and glycolytic rate assays using a XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) to measure oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). For the mito stress test, OCR and ECAR were detected under basal conditions followed by the sequential addition of oligomycin, fluoro-carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone (FCCP) and rotenone + antimycin A. As shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007394.g006">Fig 6B</xref></bold>, mitochondrial respiration is significantly decreased in LMP1+ cells. PARP1 inhibition in these cells subsequently leads to an increase in mitochondrial respiration (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007394.g006">Fig 6C</xref>)</bold>. This suggests that LMP-mediated activation of PARP1 leads to decreased reliance on mitochondrial respiration in the cell. PARP1 activation has been shown to damage mitochondrial activity characterized by secondary mitochondrial superoxide production, distorted mitochondrial structure and reduced mitochondrial oxidation and ATP production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref036">36</xref>].

<p>Apart from Mitochondrial respiration, the other major cellular energy pathway is glycolysis. Due to the decreased reliance on mitochondrial respiration by LMP1, and knowing that HIFs activate transcription programs which induce glycolysis and inhibit mitochondrial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref037">37</xref>], we wanted to determine if LMP1 promotes a switch to glycolytic metabolism. To accomplish this, we used the glycolytic rate test procedure to measure the OCR and ECAR. Both were detected under basal conditions followed by the sequential addition of 2μM rotenone + 2 μM antimycin A and 50 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose. As shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007394.g007">Fig 7B, 7D and 7E</xref>,</bold> LMP1 confers a ‘Warburg’ effect, significantly increasing basal and compensatory glycolysis in the cell under aerobic conditions.

<title>LMP1 provides a proliferative advantage that can be eradicated following PARP inhibition</title>
<p>Warburg metabolism is thought to enable rapid cell division through the creation of excess carbon obtained from increased glucose consumption, which can subsequently be used to fuel anabolic processes. This excess carbon can then be diverted into the various branching pathways that stem from glycolysis and subsequently used for the production of nucleotides, lipids, and proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref038">38</xref>]. Activated T cells extensively and rapidly proliferate upon activation and have been shown to engage Warburg metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref039">39</xref>].

<p>As LMP1 appears to be engaging ‘Warburg metabolism’, and our IPA analysis suggested increased proliferation of cells with LMP1 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007394.g008">Fig 8A</xref></bold>), we wanted to determine if this conferred a proliferative advantage. To ascertain this, we measured cellular proliferation by staining cells with CFSE (5(6)-Carboxyfluorescein N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester) staining. CFSE Uptake at time zero was the same for both LMP1+ and LMP1- cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007394.s008">S8B Fig</xref></bold>). We then allowed cells to proliferate for 96 hrs before proceeding with FACS analysis. LMP1 presence led to increased proliferation vs LMP1- cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007394.g008">Fig 8B</xref></bold>), which was markedly curtailed following PARP1 inhibition (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007394.g008">Fig 8C</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report here that LMP1 can modulate host gene expression by using PARP1 as a coactivator of HIF-1α-dependent gene expression in B cells. In recent decades, research into PARP biology, outside of its classical role in DNA damage detection and repair responses, has led to greater appreciation and understanding to the pivotal role PARP-1 plays in gene regulation. PARP-1 can function as a key regulator of gene expression through a variety of mechanisms, including roles as a chromatin modulator, a coregulator for DNA-binding transcription factors, and a regulator of DNA methylation. The gene regulatory effects of PARP-1 have been linked to the control of inflammation, metabolism, circadian rhythms, and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref042">42</xref>]. Previous work by our group has established that expression of the type III latency-associated EBV protein LMP1 alone was able to promote PARP1-mediated PARylation, and disruption of inhibition of PARP activity was sufficient to alter host gene expression. Moreover, the induction of PARylation mediated by LMP1 was also essential for EBV-driven oncogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref022">22</xref>]. Building on our previous work, here we are reporting a global approach to identify host gene targets of LMP1 that are regulated through PARP1. Greater understanding of how LMP1 is able to manipulate the host gene regulatory machinery through chromatin-modifying enzymes, such as PARP1, may be exploited by therapeutic intervention to better treat EBV-positive cancers.</p>
<p>Our initial analysis of RNA-seq data suggested that the transcription factor Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) is an LMP1 target mediated through PARP1. There is strong evidence that activation of HIF-1 is a common pathway affected by human oncogenic viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref030">30</xref>] and HIF-1's role in the transcriptional upregulation of metabolic, angiogenic and microenvironmental factors is integral for oncogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref030">30</xref>]. HIF-1α transcription is continual and several growth factors and their accompanying pathways have been shown to play a role in enhancing HIF-1α signaling in an oxygen-independent manner. However, the majority of work surrounding HIF-1 regulation has been focused on its constitutive normoxic protein breakdown and how this can be subverted in the context of oncogenesis. LMP1 has been shown to increase the synthesis of HIF-1α through the ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref031">31</xref>] and decrease its breakdown through the degradation of PHD 1 and 3, mediated by SIAH1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Our work does not find any significant evidence of LMP1 increasing HIF-1α protein or mRNA levels. It should be noted however, that our work has taken place in B cells, with the above-mentioned work mainly taking place in epithelial cells and the latter study involved full length EBV infection. Another key difference is our use of a Burkitt’s lymphoma cell line (DG75) which carries a MYC translocation. Overexpression of Myc has been reported to stabilize the α subunit of HIF1 (HIF-1α) under normoxic conditions and enhance HIF-1α accumulation under hypoxic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref043">43</xref>]. Therefore, a potentially higher basal level of HIF-1α in our cell lines could have dampened the effects of ectopic LMP1 expression.</p>
<p>Instead, our evidence indicates that PARP1 is acting as a coactivator of HIF-1α-dependent gene expression in B cells, and this co-activation is enhanced by LMP1-mediated activation of PARP1. Outside of EBV, a similar mechanism was reported in PARP1-deficient chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, which showed reduced HIF-1 transcriptional activation dependent on PARP1 enzymatic activity. This agrees with our observations, as inhibition of PARP1 catalytic activity reduced transcriptional activation of HIF-1 targets. The authors of this study also demonstrated PARP1 forming a complex with HIF-1α through direct protein interaction <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as endogenously in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref034">34</xref>]. Our study adds to the scope of this mechanism by demonstrating that this complex is also PARylated, and that PARP1 inhibition not only leads to loss of PARylation but also destabilization of the complex. Whether only PARP1 is PARyated, or also other factors, such as HIF-1α or histones, has to be further elucidated, which we are planning to achieve in the coming months. What is clear is the requirement of PARP1 enzymatic activity for HIF-1–dependent transcription and the stability of the PARP1/HIF complex, presumably due to the proper scaffolding of PAR polymers by PARP1.</p>
<p>We then demonstrated, through ChIP assays, that PARP1 co-activates HIF-1α–dependent gene expression by binding to the promoter regions of HIF-1α targets, which adds to the PARP1/HIF-dependent gene expression studies assessed by transient transfection of a reporter gene under the control of hypoxia response element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref034">34</xref>]. Here we show that promoter regions of HIF-1α targets are bound by HIF-1α and PARP1 considerably more in LMP1+ cells vs LMP1- cells, and the binding of both proteins is significantly reduced following PARP1 inhibition.</p>
<p>Our ChIP experiments also revealed that LMP1 induction led to significant accumulation of the positive histone mark H3K27ac at HIF-1α–dependent genes. This is interesting as one of the key coactivators of HIF-1 is the histone acetyltransferases p300, which can directly associate with the COOH-terminal transactivation domain of HIF-1α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref044">44</xref>] and facilitate acetylation of histone H3 at 'lysine 27' (H3K27ac) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref045">45</xref>]. Furthermore, this mark was lost following PARP1 inhibition, which conversely led to the accumulation of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3. Previous work by our group has demonstrated that in the absence of DNA damage, both pharmacological inhibition of PARP and knockdown of PARP1 induced the expression of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) member EZH2, which mediates the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3). This resulted in increased global H3K27me3, with ChIP assays confirming PARP1 inhibition led to H3K27me3 deposition at EZH2 target genes, resulting in gene silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref012">12</xref>]. Ensuing work found that EZH2 is a direct target of PARP1 upon induction of alkylating and UV-induced DNA damage in cells and <italic>in vitro</italic>. PARylation of EZH2 inhibits EZH2 histone methyltransferase (H3K27me) enzymatic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref047">47</xref>]. This lends to the possibility that one of the roles of PARP1, as a coactivator of HIF-1α–dependent gene expression, could be down to its ability to modify histone tails to augment HIF-1α–dependent gene expression. Specifically, the role of PARP1 could be to PARylate EZH2 and inhibit EZH2 histone methyltransferase (H3K27me) enzymatic activity. This may then allow the histone acetyltransferases p300, a key coactivator of HIF-1, to facilitate acetylation of histone H3 at 'lysine 27' (H3K27ac), creating a more permissible environment for gene transcription at HIF-1 transcriptional targets.</p>
<p>PARP1 and HIF-1α occupy prominent positions in mitochondrial homeostasis and metabolism and EBV–transformed B cells have been shown to induce a ‘Warburg effect’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref049">49</xref>]. In addition, LMP1 has been shown to be the key regulator in reprogramming of EBV-mediated glycolysis in NPC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref051">51</xref>]. Many of the LMP1-induced PARP1/HIF-1α transcriptional targets we identified in our data set are involved in metabolism, and therefore we wanted to determine if PARP1 was required for the LMP1-induced aerobic glycolysis that we observed. We determined that LMP1 significantly increased glycolysis and decreased mitochondrial respiration, and this switch in metabolism appeared to be mediated through PARP1. This isn’t too surprising, as the majority of research points to PARP activation damaging mitochondrial function, while PARP inhibition has the opposite effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref054">54</xref>]. For example, we observed significant ATP loss in LMP1+ cells followed by recovery with PARP1 inhibition, as estimated by the mito stress test assay. AMP concentrations can be increased by PAR degradation, and AMP perturbs mitochondrial ADP/ATP exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref055">55</xref>]. In addition, HIFs are well-known to activate transcription programs that induce glycolysis and inhibit mitochondrial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref037">37</xref>]. For instance, enzymes catalyzing glucose metabolism—including phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) and phosphofructokinase (PFK), are well-established targets of HIF-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref056">56</xref>] and were identified from our RNA-seq data as being induced by LMP1/PARP1. PDK1 was also identified from our dataset, another recognized HIF-1 target and a key enzyme that contributes to the ‘Warburg effect’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous studies point to the NF-kB signaling pathway and glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) as being key mediators in the activation of aerobic glycolysis in LMP1+ NPC cell lines and both EBV and spontaneous B-cell lymphomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref051">51</xref>]. While we didn’t find any evidence of increased transcription of GLUT1, it is possible that LMP1 may be inducing glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) membrane trafficking, as was observed in EBV and spontaneous B-cell lymphomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref049">49</xref>]. Regarding the NF-kB signaling pathway driven aerobic glycolysis, this may be happening upstream of PARP1/HIF-1α -dependent gene expression. Firstly, there is evidence that PARP1 can act as a coactivator of NF-kB in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref057">57</xref>], which is supported by our IPA analysis which identified NF-kB as the highest scoring upstream regulator predicted to be activated by LMP1 and inactivated by PARP1, as was seen with HIF-1α (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007394.s007">S7 Fig</xref></bold>). Secondly, there is evidence of significant crosstalk between the NF-kB and HIF-1α pathways. NF-κB has been shown to be a direct modulator of HIF-1α expression. Specifically, the HIF-1α promoter has been demonstrated to be responsive to selective NF- κB subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref058">58</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary, our work adds an important branch to the existing model of how LMP1 affects cellular functions through modulation of chromatin modifying enzymes to regulate host gene expression, specifically through PARP1 and PARylation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007394.g009">Fig 9</xref>)</bold>. One remaining question is how LMP1 communicates with PARP1, which we will address in the coming months by determining whether LMP1 regulates PARP1 through direct interaction or via of the signaling pathways that LMP1 activates. Gaining a better insight into the LMP1/PARP1 interaction will reveal new important functions of LMP1 in the context of cellular transformation and EBV infection.</p>

<title>RNA extraction and RNA-seq</title>
<p>RNA was extracted using a PureLink RNA Mini Kit (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The polyadenylated transcript library used for transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was generated using an Epicentre (Illumina) mRNA-seq kit. Total RNA was depleted of the rRNA component using a RiboZero rRNA removal kit (Epicentre) and then processed with a ScriptSeq (version 2) kit along with ScriptSeq index PCR primers (Epi- centre) to generate a strand-specific library of mRNA. Single reads of 50 bp were obtained using an Illumina genome analyzer II. Sequencing reads were aligned to the human genome rn4 using the TopHat program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref060">60</xref>], considering reads encoded across splice junctions (parameters were set to the default). The expression level of all RefSeq transcripts was evaluated using the Cufflinks program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007394.ref061">61</xref>], and the number of fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped (FPKM) was calculated for each transcript (the parameters were set to the default, and the hg19 RefSeq GTF table was used to define the transcripts). Differences in gene expression levels between samples were assessed by use of the Cuffdiff program and calculated as the log2 fold change. RNA-seq data were analyzed using Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA; Qiagen, Redwood City, CA).</p>
<p>The RNA-seq data are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE121476.

<title>Metabolic assays</title>
<p>Cell-Tak solution (Corning) at a concentration is 22.4 μg/mL (diluted in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate pH 8.0) was used to coat the XF96 plates (Seahorse Bioscience) to allow for suspension cell adhesion to the plate. 3x105 cells per well were then seeded in the XF96 plates, followed by centrifugation of the cells at room temperature at 200 <italic>×</italic> g for 5 minutes. The plated cells were then incubated in a 37°C incubator not supplemented with CO2 for 25–30 minutes to ensure that the cells had completely attached. Cells were incubated for a total of 1 hr in a 37°C incubator without CO2 to allow for pre-equilibration with the assay medium. Cells were then analyzed by either the cell mito stress test assay or the glycolytic rate assay (see below).</p>
<p>The XF mito stress test report and glycolytic rate report generator automatically calculates the XF cell mito stress test parameters and glycolytic rate test parameters from Wave (Agilent) data that have been exported to Excel. Respiration and acidification rates are presented as the mean ± SEM of 3 independent experiments in all experiments performed with 4 to 10 replicate wells in the Seahorse XF96 analyzer.</p>

<title>Cell mito stress test assay</title>
<p>The XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) was used to measure the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) using the mitochondrial stress test procedure in XF media (non-buffered DMEM containing 10 mM glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate). OCR and ECAR were detected under basal conditions followed by the sequential addition of 2 μM oligomycin (Sigma), 1 μM fluoro-carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone (FCCP) (Sigma) and 2μM rotenone + 2 μM antimycin A (Sigma). This allowed for an estimation of the contribution of individual parameters for basal respiration, proton leak, maximal respiration, spare respiratory capacity, non-mitochondrial respiration and ATP production.</p>
