<abstract>
<p>Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is critical for cytosolic DNA-triggered innate immunity. STING is modified by several types of polyubiquitin chains. Here, we report that the deubiquitinase CYLD sustains STING signaling by stabilizing the STING protein. CYLD deficiency promoted the K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of STING, attenuating the induction of IRF3-responsive genes after HSV-1 infection or the transfection of DNA ligands. Additionally, CYLD knockout mice were more susceptible to HSV-1 infection than their wild-type (WT) littermates. Mechanistically, STING translocated from the ER to the Golgi upon HSV-1 stimulation; CYLD partially accumulated with STING and interacted selectively with K48-linked polyubiquitin chains on STING, specifically removing the K48-linked polyubiquitin chains from STING and ultimately boosting the innate antiviral response. Our study reveals that CYLD is a novel checkpoint in the cGAS-STING signaling pathway and sheds new light on the dynamic regulation of STING activity by ubiquitination.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>STING is critical for mediating the production of type I interferons and other proinflammatory cytokines. The appropriate activation of STING signaling is precisely modulated to maintain immune homeostasis. It is well established that covalent modification of STING by different types of polyubiquitin chains serves to fine-tune STING activity in response to extracellular and intracellular stresses. However, it remains poorly understood how these polyubiquitin chains on STING are dynamically removed in response to different stimuli. In this study, we characterized the deubiquitinase CYLD, which partially accumulates with STING upon HSV-1 infection and interacts selectively with the K48-linked polyubiquitin chains on STING. CYLD specifically removes K48-linked polyubiquitin chains from STING and thus promotes antiviral responses. Our study reveals a novel function of CYLD in the STING signaling pathway and indicates that CYLD is an important target for modulating the host response to infections caused by DNA pathogens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The innate immune system represents the first line of host defense against invading pathogens and employs germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect conserved microbial molecules known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Upon sensing their corresponding PAMPs, PRRs activate signaling cascades that trigger the expression of downstream genes, which collaboratively restrain microbes and activate adaptive immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>RIG-I and MDA5 detect cytosolic RNAs and recruit mitochondrial MAVS, which activate TBK1 and IKK kinases to phosphorylate the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB, ultimately inducing the expression of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref003">3</xref>]. Cytosolic aberrant DNAs are potentially sensed by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors (DAI), DEAD-box helicase 41 (DDX41) or interferon gamma inducible protein 16 (IFI16) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref011">11</xref>]. Interestingly, the signaling pathways triggered by these sensors all converge at stimulator of interferon genes (STING, also known as MITA, ERIS or MPYS), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref015">15</xref>] that recruits and activates TBK1 and IKK to ultimately induce the expression of antiviral and proinflammatory genes.</p>
<p>The action of STING is extensively regulated by various types of ubiquitin modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref016">16</xref>]. For example, the E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF5 and TRIM29 catalyze K48-linked polyubiquitination of STING, facilitating its proteasome-mediated degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref018">18</xref>]. TRIM56 and TRIM32 target STING for K63-linked polyubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref020">20</xref>] and enhance the downstream signaling. AMFR/INSIG1 catalyze the K27-linked polyubiquitination of STING, which is crucial for recruiting and activating TBK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref021">21</xref>]. RNF26 promotes K11-linked polyubiquitination of STING at lysine 150, a residue that is also targeted by RNF5 for K48-linked polyubiquitination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref022">22</xref>]. Notably, it remains largely unknown how polyubiquitin chains on STING are dynamically removed in response to different stimuli.</p>
<p>CYLD was identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial cylindromatosis, and it plays important roles in development and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref026">26</xref>]. Biochemically, CYLD is a deubiquitinase that can remove K63- or K48-linked polyubiquitin chains in a reaction catalyzed by its C-terminal USP domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref031">31</xref>]. A recent study reported that SDC4 could recruit CYLD to remove polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I, thus inhibiting RIG-I signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref032">32</xref>]. The potential role of CYLD in the STING signaling pathway remains to be explored.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that silencing CYLD markedly attenuated the STING-mediated induction of antimicrobial genes. Consistent with this finding, CYLD knockout mice were more susceptible to HSV-1 infection than their WT littermates. Mechanistically, CYLD partially accumulated with STING upon HSV-1 stimulation and interacted selectively with K48-linked polyubiquitin chains on STING. CYLD specifically removed K48-linked polyubiquitin chains from STING and ultimately boosted host innate antiviral responses. This study uncovers an essential function of CYLD in the STING signaling pathway and provides a new perspective for restricting infections caused by DNA pathogens.</p>

<title>CYLD is a new regulator of DNA-triggered antiviral signaling pathway</title>
<p>To explore the potential function of CYLD in STING signaling, we screened two different siRNAs against murine CYLD (siCYLD#1 and siCYLD#2 for mouse).

<p>To rule out potential off-target effects of CYLD siRNAs, we generated two RNA interference (RNAi)-resistant CYLD constructs, namely, rCYLD WT and rCYLD C597S, in which silent mutations were introduced into the sequence targeted by the siRNA without changing the amino acid sequence of the corresponding protein. As shown in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007435.g002">2C, 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007435.s002">S2C and S2D</xref>, the diminished IFN production in <italic>Cyld</italic><bold><italic>-</italic></bold>silenced cells was restored by introducing rCYLD WT but not rCYLD C597S after stimulation with poly(dA:dT) or ISD.

<title>CYLD associates with STING in a ubiquitination-dependent manner</title>
<p>To identify the potential target of CYLD, we expressed the indicated plasmids in HEK293 cells as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007435.s004">S4A Fig</xref>, which triggered the expression of the IFN-β-luciferase reporter. We observed that the activation of the IFN-β-luciferase reporter by cGAS and STING was markedly reduced when <italic>Cyld</italic> was silenced. In contrast, knockdown of <italic>Cyld</italic> did not affect the activation of the IFN-β-luciferase reporter when TBK1 or IRF3-5D was ectopically expressed. CYLD had a remarkable effect on cGAMP-induced activation of IRF3-responsive genes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007435.g001">1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007435.g003">3G and 3H</xref>). Therefore, we wondered whether CYLD could interact directly with STING. Exogenous STING and CYLD were transfected individually or together into HEK293T cells, followed by coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007435.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). HA-tagged STING did not interact with Myc-tagged CYLD. It was demonstrated in our previous work that K27-linked polyubiquitin chains on STING can recruit TBK1 and facilitate its translocation to the perinuclear microsomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref021">21</xref>]. We speculated that the polyubiquitin chains of STING may recruit CYLD to STING. To test this possibility, we coexpressed STING and CYLD together with different E3 ligases, namely, RNF5, TRIM32, or TRIM56, in HEK293T cells. RNF5 is known to catalyze K48-linked polyubiquitination of STING [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref017">17</xref>], while TRIM32 and TRIM56 catalyze the formation of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on STING [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref020">20</xref>]. Interestingly, the association between CYLD and STING was detected only when the E3 ligase RNF5 was coexpressed. In contrast, the E3 ligase Trim32 or Trim 56 failed to promote the association between STING and CYLD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007435.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). Moreover, a catalytically dead mutant of RNF5 (C42S) did not promote the interaction between STING and CYLD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007435.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). Furthermore, as it was reported that RNF5 ubiquitinated STING at K150 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref017">17</xref>], we examined whether lysine 150 of STING could influence the association of STING with CYLD. We coexpressed CYLD and RNF5 with STING or STING K150R and found that the STING K150R mutant failed to associate with CYLD even when RNF5 was present (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007435.s004">S4D Fig</xref>). Additionally, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007435.s004">S4B Fig</xref>, we observed that RNF5 could interact with STING but not CYLD. Recently, TRIM29 was reported to catalyze K48-linked polyubiquitination of STING at lysine 370. TRIM29 is also known to be specifically expressed in airway epithelial cells (AECs) and intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref018">18</xref>]. Therefore, we examined if TRIM29 has any effect on the association of STING with CYLD. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007435.s004">S4C Fig</xref>, unlike RNF5, TRIM29 could not promote CYLD-STING association. To further investigate if STING and CYLD interact directly, we performed the indicated experiments in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007435.s004">S4E Fig</xref>. We found that ubiquitinated STING, but not unmodified STING, interacted with CYLD <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that CYLD associates with STING in a ubiquitination-dependent manner. To test whether the catalytically dead CYLD mutant influenced binding with STING, we coexpressed a catalytically dead mutant of human CYLD C601S in the presence of RNF5, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007435.g004">Fig 4E</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref034">34</xref>]. As expected, we observed that the human CYLD C601S mutant bound more tightly to STING than the WT human CYLD. A similar result was observed for the catalytically dead murine mutant CYLD C597S (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007435.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). Then, the endogenous association between STING and CYLD was further investigated. Notably, the endogenous interaction between STING and CYLD was substantially enhanced upon HSV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007435.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). Consistent with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref017">17</xref>], we also found that RNF5 expression was not changed during HSV-1 infection, while the association of RNF5 with STING was gradually increased. Consistent with this finding, confocal microscopy imaging revealed that the colocalization of STING and CYLD was enhanced in the presence of RNF5 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007435.g004">4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007435.s004">S4F</xref>). We knew that STING could translocate from the ER to the Golgi upon stimulation with HSV-1, which was also confirmed by our results, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007435.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>. Interestingly, we observed that CYLD partially accumulated with STING, which was instrumental for deubiquitinating STING. Taken together, these data establish that CYLD associates with STING in a ubiquitination-dependent manner and colocalizes with STING in the Golgi upon HSV-1 infection.</p>

<title>CYLD specifically removes K48-linked polyubiquitin chains from STING</title>
<p>Previous reports demonstrated that CYLD could potentially remove either K63-linked or K48-linked polyubiquitin chains from substrate proteins via its USP domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref032">32</xref>]. Notably, the CYLD USP domain appears to preferentially remove K63-linked polyubiquitin chains over other types of polyubiquitin chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref030">30</xref>]. However, it is not known whether CYLD directly binds these chains via its USP domain. Chemically synthesized K63-linked di-ubiquitin chains (K63-diUb) or K48-linked di-ubiquitin chains (K48-diUb) were subjected to pull-down analysis with His-CYLD-USP (residues 583–956 aa). As shown in Fig<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007435.g005">5A</xref>, the His-CYLD-USP domain could directly pull-down both K48-linked and K63-linked di-ubiquitins, supporting previous observations.</p>

<p>We explored whether CYLD could catalyze the deubiquitination of STING. Flag-tagged STING was cotransfected with CYLD or the catalytically dead mutant CYLD C601S. The cell lysates were denatured and subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-Flag antibody, followed by immunoblotting, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007435.g005">Fig 5B</xref>. Notably, STING was markedly deubiquitinated in the presence of CYLD, whereas CYLD C601S had no such effect. Consistent with the previous study, RNF5 catalyzed the formation of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains on STING. CYLD efficiently removed the polyubiquitin chains from STING, whereas CYLD C601S failed to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007435.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Murine CYLD had the same function as human CYLD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007435.s006">S6B and S6C Fig</xref>). We also confirmed that human CYLD and murine CYLD deubiquitinated STING <italic>in vitro</italic>, but the catalytically dead mutants (human CYLD C601S and murine CYLD C597S) could not perform the same function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007435.s006">S6D and S6E Fig</xref>). Notably, the CYLD USP domain also deubiquitinated STING <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007435.s006">S6D Fig</xref>), which is consistent with our observation in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007435.s004">S4E Fig</xref>. To substantiate this finding, we transfected Flag-STING along with HA-tagged WT ubiquitin or ubiquitin mutants in the presence or absence of CYLD, followed by immunoblotting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007435.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, CYLD selectively removed WT- and K48-linked polyubiquitin chains from STING. Consistent with this result, CYLD failed to remove non-K48-linked polyubiquitin chains (in which lysine 48 of ubiquitin was mutated to arginine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007435.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). These results indicated that CYLD selectively deconjugates the K48-linked ubiquitination of STING. In addition, compared with that in WT BMDMs, endogenous STING polyubiquitination was markedly enhanced in <italic>Cyld</italic> <sup>-/-</sup> BMDMs upon HSV-1 stimulation in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007435.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Consistent with this finding, <italic>Cyld</italic> <sup>-/-</sup> BMDMs exhibited a marked reduction in the STING protein level upon HSV-1 infection, but this reduction was reversed by MG132 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007435.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that CYLD prevents STING from undergoing proteasome-mediated degradation by specifically removing K48-linked ubiquitination, thus sustaining STING and promoting the host antiviral response after HSV-1 infection.</p>

<p>It is well established that STING is required to initiate effective IFN production when the host is infected by HSV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref036">36</xref>]. According to several seminal studies, STING KO mice had a higher mortality rate than WT mice upon HSV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref037">37</xref>]. Significant amounts of HSV-1 could be detected in the brains of infected STING KO mice but not in the brains of controls. Mice defective in STING abolished microglia-dependent type I IFN expression upon HSV-1 infection and exhibited increased susceptibility to acute Herpes simplex encephalitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref037">37</xref>]. Additionally, analysis of serum from STING KO mice indicated a profound defect in the production of type I IFNs after HSV-1 infection compared to that of infected control animals. Here, we revealed that CYLD KO mice had similar characteristics after injection of HSV-1. Taken together, our data indicate that CYLD is also required <italic>in vivo</italic> for the effective production of type I IFNs and is essential for sustaining protection against HSV-1 infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As the convergence point for monitoring cytosolic aberrant DNAs, STING integrates upstream danger signals to activate TBK1/IRF3, which ultimately induces the production of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref038">38</xref>]. However, misregulation of STING signaling has been implicated in cancers and autoimmune diseases. Thus, the strength and duration of STING signaling are dynamically modulated in a multilayered and highly ordered manner to maintain immune homeostasis. It is well established that modification of STING by different types of polyubiquitin chains serves to fine-tune STING activity in response to extracellular and intracellular stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref016">16</xref>]. Similarly, removing polyubiquitin chains from STING acted as an effective feedback mechanism to counterbalance the relevant immune responses. A recent report demonstrated that USP13 could remove K27-linked polyubiquitin chains from STING, thus downregulating STING signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref039">39</xref>]. It remains unknown how other types of STING polyubiquitination are terminated and how STING activity is sustained during viral infection.</p>
<p>In this study, we characterized the ability of CYLD to specifically deconjugate K48-linked polyubiquitin chains from STING, thus sustaining STING activity and promoting host antiviral responses against DNA viruses. Several lines of evidence substantiate these claims. First, silencing CYLD resulted in a marked decrease in the STING-mediated induction of IRF3-responsive genes, which could be rescued by ectopic expression of WT CYLD but not a catalytically dead CYLD mutant. Second, CYLD enhanced STING signaling via its deubiquitination activity. Third, CYLD knockdown impaired the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and facilitated HSV-1 infection. Fourth, knocking out <italic>Cyld</italic> in BMDMs drastically attenuated STING signaling stimulated by DNA mimics, cGAMP or HSV-1. Fifth, CYLD associated with STING via the K48-linked polyubiquitin chains on STING, and this association appeared to be enhanced upon HSV-1 infection. Sixth, <italic>Cyld</italic> <sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed a significant decrease in the production of interferons and cytokines became vulnerable to HSV-1 infection <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>CYLD was originally reported as a tumor suppressor and later characterized as a deubiquitinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref026">26</xref>]. CYLD can suppress the activation of NF-κB or JNK signaling by removing K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from the signaling complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref040">40</xref>]. A recent study reported that SDC4 enhances the interaction between CYLD and RIG-I, thus promoting the removal of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on RIG-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref032">32</xref>]. Importantly, CYLD can also deconjugate K48-linked polyubiquitin chains from some target proteins. For example, CYLD specifically removes K48-linked polyubiquitin chains from TRAF2, thereby preventing the proteasome-mediated degradation of TRAF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref029">29</xref>]. CYLD can also deconjugate K48-linked polyubiquitin chains on LCK, blocking T cell receptor (TCR) downstream signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007435.ref027">27</xref>]. Our study revealed that CYLD preferentially deconjugates K48-linked polyubiquitin chains on STING, leaving other types of polyubiquitin chains intact. Interestingly, we observed that STING and CYLD colocalized in the Golgi but not in the ER upon HSV-1 stimulation. Therefore, STING translocated from the ER to the Golgi upon HSV-1 stimulation, and CYLD partially accumulated with STING to promote STING deubiquitination. Consequently, CYLD actively prevented the proteasome-mediated degradation of STING and sustained antiviral responses in innate immunity.</p>
<p>Notably, the STING signaling pathway plays a crucial role in dampening cancer development. It is intriguing to consider whether CYLD acts as a tumor suppressor by potentiating STING signaling in cancer. It is also unknown whether human CYLD mutations correlate with the activity of the STING signaling pathway. Insights from these investigations will be instrumental in developing CYLD as a potential target for cancer therapy.</p>
