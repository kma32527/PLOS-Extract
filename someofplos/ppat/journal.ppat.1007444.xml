<abstract>
<p>Copper toxicity and copper limitation can both be effective host defense mechanisms against pathogens. Tolerance of high copper by fungi makes toxicity as a defense mechanism largely ineffective against fungal pathogens. A forward genetic screen for <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic> mutant yeasts unable to replicate within macrophages showed the Ctr3 copper transporter is required for intramacrophage proliferation. Ctr3 mediates copper uptake and is required for growth in low copper. Transcription of the <italic>CTR3</italic> gene is induced by differentiation of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> into pathogenic yeasts and by low available copper, but not decreased iron. Low expression of a <italic>CTR3</italic> transcriptional reporter by intracellular yeasts implies that phagosomes of non-activated macrophages have moderate copper levels. This is further supported by the replication of Ctr3-deficient yeasts within the phagosome of non-activated macrophages. However, IFN-γ activation of phagocytes causes restriction of phagosomal copper as shown by upregulation of the <italic>CTR3</italic> transcriptional reporter and by the failure of Ctr3-deficient yeasts, but not Ctr3 expressing yeasts, to proliferate within these macrophages. Accordingly, in a respiratory model of histoplasmosis, Ctr3-deficient yeasts are fully virulent during phases of the innate immune response but are attenuated after the onset of adaptive immunity. Thus, while technical limitations prevent direct measurement of phagosomal copper concentrations and copper-independent factors can influence gene expression, both the <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter induction and the attenuation of Ctr3-deficient yeasts indicate activation of macrophages switches the phagosome from a copper-replete to a copper-depleted environment, forcing <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> reliance on Ctr3 for copper acquisition.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Control of primary pathogens that infect phagocytes often requires adaptive immunity, but the mechanisms that convert host cells from permissive to antimicrobial states are only partially understood. The intracellular fungal pathogen <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic> resides and proliferates within the macrophage phagosome. During innate immunity, macrophages which normally control fungi prove ineffective against <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> yeasts. At this stage, the phagosome of unactivated macrophages has ample copper that facilitates intracellular growth of <italic>Histoplasma</italic> but does not cause copper toxicity. However, the onset of adaptive immunity and the subsequent activation of macrophages decreases phagosomal copper and macrophages become less permissive to <italic>Histoplasma</italic> proliferation. IFN-γ acts as a key cytokine for switching the macrophage strategy by changing phagosomes from a copper-sufficient to a copper-depleted state in order to control intracellular pathogens. In such activated macrophages, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> yeasts upregulate expression of the Ctr3 copper transporter to enable continued acquisition of essential copper.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>To successfully infect and colonize a host, pathogens must acquire sufficient nutrients from the host to enable microbe growth and proliferation. These metabolic resources include, but are not limited to, essential metals. The nutrient-limited phagosome represents a particularly challenging environment for intracellular pathogens as mammalian hosts can sequester essential elements such as iron and zinc from pathogens. This has been termed “nutritional immunity” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref002">2</xref>]. For example, host molecules such as heme, ferritin, transferrin, and lactoferrin make iron largely inaccessible to microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref001">1</xref>]. However, successful pathogens have developed sophisticated strategies to combat iron limitation. For example, <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and the fungal pathogen <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic> secrete iron-chelating siderophores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref005">5</xref>]. Accordingly, inability to synthesize siderophores severely impairs intracellular growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref006">6</xref>]. In addition, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> maintains a slightly acidic intra-phagosomal pH which is sufficient to release iron from host transferrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref007">7</xref>]. Mammalian hosts also restrict available zinc by production of zinc chelating proteins such as S100 family proteins and calprotectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref009">9</xref>]. In addition, host zinc transporters (ZIPs) are employed to tightly control zinc levels in different cellular compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref010">10</xref>]. Host zinc limitation mechanisms are an important aspect of activation of cellular immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref011">11</xref>]. However, as with iron limitation, some pathogens have evolved efficient mechanisms to counteract zinc sequestration. High affinity transporters expressed by <italic>Salmonella</italic> species and <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> (ZnuABC and Zrt2, respectively) enable these pathogens to import zinc in environments with low zinc concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref015">15</xref>]. Without these zinc transporters <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> intracellular proliferation is significantly attenuated. Employing an alternative strategy, the fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic> expresses zincophore (Pra1), a zinc-chelating molecule, to scavenge zinc during endothelial invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Like iron and zinc, pathogen acquisition of copper during infection is essential, but high levels of copper are toxic. Copper killing mechanisms involve reactive oxygen-generating fenton-type reactions, nitrosative stress, or iron-sulfur cluster attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref001">1</xref>]. Recent evidence has shown that immune cells can utilize excessive copper as a powerful weapon to kill pathogens during innate immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref019">19</xref>]. For pathogens, an inability to decrease cellular copper can impair pathogen virulence. For example, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> survival in host cells depends on copper exporter proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref019">19</xref>] and <italic>Salmonella</italic> systemic infection requires detoxification of excess copper by a multi-copper-ion oxidase (CueO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref020">20</xref>]. The fungus <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans (grubii)</italic> utilizes copper-sequestering metallothionein (Cmt) proteins for full virulence during pulmonary infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref017">17</xref>]. On the other hand, there is evidence that host defenses also use copper limitation in some tissue environments. During kidney infection, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> switches from copper-dependent superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1) to expression of the copper-independent Sod3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref021">21</xref>]. Proliferation of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> in murine brains requires two copper transporters (Ctr1 and Ctr4) indicating that copper is limited in the mouse CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref023">23</xref>]. Thus, maintenance of copper homeostasis in host environments with high or low copper environments is essential for pathogens to establish successful infections.</p>
<p><italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> is a primary fungal pathogen that is not efficiently controlled by innate immunity alone since clearance requires activation of cell-mediated immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref025">25</xref>]. <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> resides within the phagosome of host phagocytes, an environment that is initially permissive for fungal proliferation. Through a forward genetic screen, we identified a homolog of copper transporters (Ctr3) which was required for growth of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> in low copper and within the phagosome of host macrophages. We determined that Ctr3 enhances <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> survival in vivo specifically during the peak of the adaptive immune response to pulmonary infection. Consistent with this, expression of <italic>CTR3</italic> increases in low copper concentrations in vitro and in activated, but not in unactivated macrophages. These findings show that copper is sufficiently available to intramacrophage <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> during innate immunity, but that activation of macrophages induces copper limitation to enact fungal control.</p>

<title>Intramacrophage growth of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> requires Ctr3</title>
<p>To identify genes required for intramacrophage growth, a genetic screen was designed to identify mutants unable to proliferate within macrophages. Insertion mutants were created using <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>-mediated transformation of a T-DNA element previously shown to provide relatively random and trackable mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref026">26</xref>]. To facilitate efficient identification of mutants with reduced intramacrophage proliferation, two indirect assays of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> yeast replication within macrophages were used. First, increasing fluorescence of red-fluorescence protein (RFP) expressing yeasts was used to indicate intramacrophage yeast replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref027">27</xref>]. Second, a lacZ-expressing macrophage cell line was used to rapidly quantify the ability of mutant yeast to lyse infected macrophages as a result of yeast replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref028">28</xref>]. Individual <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> mutants were added to macrophage populations to initiate infections. RFP-fluorescence was monitored daily over 7–8 days after which remaining macrophages were quantified by the remaining β-galactosidase activity. Mutants were selected that showed less than 30% increase in RFP fluorescence and/or at least 30% reduction in macrophage lysis. Of 40,000 insertion mutants, 178 had reduced intramacrophage growth and/or attenuated virulence in macrophages.</p>
<p>The insertion mutations were mapped to the genome by sequencing the regions flanking the T-DNA insertion, and two mutants (27H11 and 84D11) were identified which had T-DNA insertions in the promoter region of a gene encoding a putative copper transporter (193 bp and 215 bp upstream of the CDS initiation codon for 27H11 and 84D11, respectively). We designated the gene <italic>CTR3</italic> based on phylogenetic analysis that showed the gene product was similar to copper transporters, including the high affinity Ctr3 copper transporter of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007444.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Each mutant had approximately 50% reduced RFP-fluorescence (intramacrophage fungal growth) and 60% reduced macrophage lysis compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007444.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Consistent with the RFP-based measurement of intracellular growth, CFU-based measurement of viable yeasts within macrophages in culture confirmed that the Ctr3-deficient mutant proliferated only 30% to 50% as well as wild type at 48 hours and 72 hours post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007444.g001">Fig 1C</xref>).

<p>To directly show Ctr3-dependent copper acquisition, we measured intracellular copper levels in yeasts by inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Ctr3-deficient yeasts have lower overall copper levels compared to Ctr3-expressing yeasts during exponential growth in medium containing 10 nM copper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007444.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), and starvation of yeasts for copper reduces intracellular copper to baseline levels. Upon replenishment of copper, Ctr3-expressing but not Ctr3-deficient yeasts accumulate intracellular copper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007444.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Both Ctr3-expressing and Ctr3-deficient yeasts have equivalent iron levels in exponential growth and after iron starvation and accumulate iron upon supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007444.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), showing the specificity of Ctr3 for copper, but not iron acquisition.

<p>Since copper regulates <italic>CTR3</italic> expression, we created a green-fluorescent protein (<italic>gfp</italic>) transcriptional fusion to the <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum CTR3</italic> promoter as a fluorescent indicator of copper availability. <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter activity, as indicated by GFP fluorescence of yeast cells, was measured by microscopy after growth in liquid culture and normalized to the fluorescence of an isogenic strain in which <italic>gfp</italic> expression was controlled by the constitutive <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum TEF1</italic> promoter. Consistent with the transcriptional analysis, decreasing copper concentrations increased the <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter activity, and addition of BCS further increased the reporter GFP-fluorescence to levels at least 5-fold greater than expression in high copper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007444.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Conversely, addition of copper greatly decreases but does not eliminate <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter activity. The <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter responds to changes in copper concentrations but is not affected by changes in iron or zinc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007444.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). In addition, the <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter activity is not affected by reactive oxygen stress (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007444.s005">S5A Fig</xref>) or changes in pH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007444.s005">S5B Fig</xref>), two physiologically-relevant environmental changes encountered by Histoplasma in the phagosome.

<p>To provide quantitative estimates of phagosomal copper levels, the fluorescence of the <italic>gfp</italic> reporter strains was measured in a gradient of copper concentrations. Analysis of media by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) showed that media without any metal addition had 60 nM trace copper. To reduce copper concentrations below 60 nM necessitated culture of cells in increasing concentrations of BCS. The dose response-data for increasing copper was used to generate a curve of the <italic>CTR3</italic>-promoter (P<sub><italic>CTR3</italic></sub>)-controlled GFP fluorescence in 60 nM to 10 μM copper, which showed that <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter activity decreased to baseline levels at concentrations above 240 nM copper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007444.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).

<p>IFN-γ-induced phagosomal copper restriction also occurs in vivo. At day 6 post-infection, the <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter activity is normally low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007444.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). However, administration of IFN-γ to mice increased the <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter activity of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> yeasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007444.g006">Fig 6C</xref>); the average fluorescence was at least two-fold higher with just two IFN-γ treatments indicating that IFN-γ is sufficient to induce copper restriction in vivo. Copper concentration estimation using the dose-response curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007444.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) indicates that this IFN-γ treatment causes copper concentration to decrease from 100 nM to well below 60 nM.</p>
<p>We used the growth of Ctr3-deficient yeasts as an alternate indicator of cytokine-induced changes to phagosomal copper availability. Intramacrophage growth of Ctr3-deficient yeasts, which are sensitive to low copper, was compared to that of wild-type <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> yeasts. Without cytokine treatment, Ctr3-deficient yeasts proliferate equally as well in BMDMs as Ctr3-expressing yeasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007444.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). This indicates copper is not limited in the phagosomes of these macrophages and is consistent with the <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter activity measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007444.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Treatment of BMDMs with IFN-γ, but not TNF-α, restricted the growth of Ctr3-deficient <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> yeasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007444.g006">Fig 6D</xref>), demonstrating that IFN-γ triggers restriction of available copper in the phagosome to levels which impair the growth of Ctr3-deficient yeasts. These results are consistent with the <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter activity data in IFN-γ-treated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007444.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>) indicating that IFN-γ activation of macrophages changes the available phagosomal copper from high to low concentrations (significantly less than 60 nM).</p>
<p>For quantifying <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter activity, GFP fluorescence driven by the <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter was normalized to fluorescence of intracellular yeasts with a GFP-promoter fusion to the <italic>TEF1</italic> promoter to control for any changes in global gene expression due to the state of intracellular yeast cells. The activity of the <italic>TEF1</italic> promoter is not affected by copper levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007444.s007">S7A Fig</xref>) or by residence within unactivated or activated macrophages in culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007444.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). Furthermore, normalization of the GFP fluorescence driven by the <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter to a different housekeeping gene (<italic>H2B</italic>) promoter fusion showed a similar increase of the <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter in intramacrophage yeasts before and after activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007444.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). Finally, GFP-fluorescence driven by the <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter was normalized to RFP-fluorescence driven by the <italic>TEF1</italic> promoter within the same yeast cells. This also showed the same induction of the <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter in activated BMDMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007444.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). These data indicate that <italic>TEF1</italic> promoter activity serves as an accurate normalization factor to account for global transcription variation due to intracellular residence of yeasts.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In order to establish infections and proliferate in macrophages, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> yeasts must acquire essential metals within the phagosomal environment. <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> secretes siderophores and expresses zinc transporters to combat host limitation of iron and zinc, respectively. In this study, we demonstrate that growth in macrophages also imposes challenges on yeasts to maintain copper homeostasis. Specifically, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> yeasts rely on the Ctr3 copper transporter to acquire sufficient copper when copper becomes limiting, both in liquid culture and within macrophages. Besides Ctr3, the <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> genome encodes two additional putative copper transporters (Ctr1 and Ctr2). However, Ctr1 and Ctr2 are not simply redundant with Ctr3; Ctr1 and Ctr2 are not as highly expressed as Ctr3, and they are not sufficient for copper acquisition when phagosomal copper levels become severely limited. Thus, Ctr3 is the primary transporter involved in copper acquisition as part of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic>’s pathogenesis program.</p>
<p>Two aspects related to <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> pathogenesis contribute to Ctr3 expression. First, differentiation of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> into pathogenic yeasts induces Ctr3 expression independent of copper levels, consistent with a virulence role facilitating <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> infection of macrophages and persisting within a copper-limited environment. Second, restriction of available copper further increases Ctr3 expression above the level set by yeast-phase differentiation. In support of this dual regulation of Ctr3 transcript levels, the Ctr3 promoter contains putative binding sites for two transcription factors, Ryp1 and Mac1, which have been implicated in yeast-phase gene regulation and fungal transcriptional responses to copper concentration, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref030">30</xref>]. Furthermore, ChIP-chip analysis showed that two yeast-phase transcriptional regulators, Ryp1 and Ryp4, preferentially interact with the <italic>CTR3</italic> locus in the yeast phase compared to mycelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref029">29</xref>]. While we can not rule out the possibility that other copper-independent features of macrophage infection do not impact the <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter activity, the data suggest that yeast-phase expression of <italic>CTR3</italic> is regulated primarily by available copper. Other physiologically-relevant conditions encountered by yeasts within the phagosome (i.e., iron and zinc concentrations, reactive oxygen, and pH changes) do not influence the <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter. Consistent with our results, <italic>CTR3</italic> is part of a copper-responsive regulon in a microarray-based study of copper-regulated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref031">31</xref>], although in this study only yeast responses were examined. <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> strain differences in <italic>CTR3</italic> expression are due to trans-acting factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref032">32</xref>], likely from variations in either Ryp or Mac1 production or activity among strains. Together, these data are consistent with the model that yeast phase differentiation primes <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> cells for pathogenesis by inducing basal Ctr3 expression and the level of Ctr3 production is further tuned to the precise level of copper availability in the phagosome.</p>
<p>Technical challenges in direct measurement of phagosomal copper required the use of surrogate indicators of copper availability for intracellular <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic>. Using a transcriptional <italic>gfp</italic> fusion as a semi-quantitative reporter of available copper, we determined that during innate immune stages, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> resides within a phagosomal environment with copper concentrations above 100 nM. Consistent with this, <italic>CTR3</italic> transcription is lowest for yeast within alveolar macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007444.g007">Fig 7</xref>). At 10 days post-infection, which coincides with the onset of adaptive immune responses, copper becomes restricted. Both in vitro and in vivo, IFN-γ is sufficient to trigger copper restriction. Comparison of in vivo <italic>CTR3</italic> transcription to a standard curve generated in vitro estimates phagosomal copper concentrations become significantly lower than 60 nM. As <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> yeasts are found almost exclusively within phagocytes during mammalian infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref033">33</xref>], these levels reflect copper concentration within the phagosomal environment at these two points of infection. We note that these copper concentrations are inferred using regulation of the <italic>CTR3</italic> promoter, which assumes differential expression is not influenced by copper-independent changes during infection. However, our conclusions about <italic>CTR3</italic> transcription reflecting copper dynamics are completely supported by the differential growth of Ctr3-deficient and Ctr3-expressing <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> strains as a second indicator of copper availability within the phagosome; Ctr3-mediated copper transport is required for <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> yeast proliferation in vivo at 9 days post-infection but not before. While higher intraphagosomal copper concentration can be microbicidal to some intracellular pathogens, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> can tolerate high copper (up to mM levels) and thus copper toxicity mechanisms of immune defense are ineffective.</p>
<p>As a nearly exclusive intracellular pathogen, <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> responses to copper levels provide unique insights into the dynamics of the phagosomal environment. Like <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> (<italic>grubii</italic>) yeasts up-regulate transcription of copper transporters (Ctr4 and Ctr1 which are homologs of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> Ctr3 and Ctr1, respectively) in response to copper restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref035">35</xref>]. For <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>, these transcriptional responses vary by tissue with <italic>CTR4</italic> promoter activity increasing in the CNS environment but not in the lung environment, suggesting limited copper in the CNS, but not the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref035">35</xref>]. These results are corroborated by the reciprocal expression profile of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> copper-binding metallothioneins (Cmt1 and Cmt2) which are induced by high copper concentrations; <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> yeasts in the lung have elevated Cmt1 and Cmt2 expression but not in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref022">22</xref>]. Multiple functional studies with mutants of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> support the transcriptional profiles since Ctr4- and Ctr1-deficient <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> yeasts, which are unable to grow in limited copper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref030">30</xref>], are impaired in CNS but not lung infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref036">36</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> mutants lacking the Cmt1 and Cmt2 metallothioneins are attenuated in lung infection. Together these studies indicate copper concentrations in the lungs during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> infection are sufficiently high to not require the Ctr1 and Ctr4 transporters. Initially, these findings appear to contrast with those we observe with <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> yeasts. However, while <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> yeasts are nearly exclusively intracellular during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref033">33</xref>], <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> has multiple mechanisms to avoid long-term residence within macrophages (e.g., formation of phagocytosis-resistant titan cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref037">37</xref>], production of the anti-phagocytic capsule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref038">38</xref>], secretion of anti-phagocytic protein App1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref039">39</xref>], and vomocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref040">40</xref>]). Thus, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> infection studies indicating the lung is not copper limiting likely include the general extracellular environment, whereas <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> yeasts indicate phagosome-specific copper concentrations. Indeed, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> infection of RAW264.7 or J774.1 macrophages in vitro show up-regulation of <italic>CTR4</italic> but not <italic>CMT1</italic> expression in intracellular yeasts consistent with our data showing the phagosome in these macrophage cell lines have low available copper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref035">35</xref>]. In addition, Ding et al. found that expression of the mammalian phagosomal copper transporter ATP7A decreased in bronchoalveolar lavage cells at day 14 following <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> infection consistent with reduced transport of copper into the phagosome during adaptive immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref017">17</xref>]. These findings and our results with <italic>Histoplasma</italic> establish a general model that while the extracellular lung environment has ample copper, the phagosome of lung phagocytes becomes copper limiting, particularly following IFN-γ activation.</p>
<p>Copper restriction as a mechanism to control fungal pathogens contrasts with copper toxicity as a means to control bacterial pathogens. Phagosomes of macrophages infected with the intracellular bacterial pathogen <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> have approximately 400 μM Cu after 1 hour which decreases to 20 μM after 24 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref041">41</xref>]. Despite this decrease in copper, 20 μM is still a considerably high amount of copper. Consistent with elevated copper levels in the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-containing phagosome, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> bacteria which have lost the outer membrane copper export protein have reduced tolerance to copper and reduced virulence compared to wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref019">19</xref>]. Similarly, <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> mutants in the RicR regulon are inhibited by high copper (&gt; 60 μM) in vitro and are attenuated in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref042">42</xref>]. Loss of the CsoR regulon improves copper resistance of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> enabling full virulence during early stages of infection. These data indicate that the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic>-containing phagosome contains relatively high concentrations of copper. Supporting this, treatment of macrophages with LPS or IFN-γ increases the host copper transporting protein ATP7A on the phagosome membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref043">43</xref>]. Even though these studies lack direct measurement of intraphagosomal copper concentrations, they are consistent with findings of elevated copper within latex bead-containing phagosomes and a requirement for ATP7A for phagocyte killing of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref043">43</xref>]. In contrast, 14 days following <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> pulmonary infection (a time point consistent with IFN-γ production) alveolar macrophages have decreased ATP7A levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref017">17</xref>]. These differences and our data with intramacrophage <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> yeasts suggest that macrophages may differentiate between bacterial and fungal pathogens and employ copper toxicity or copper limitation, respectively, in their attempts to limit replication of these two classes of pathogens.</p>
<p>With the involvement of adaptive immunity, host utilization of copper for control of fungi switches from copper toxicity to copper restriction. <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> conidia infection of alveolar macrophages increases ATP7A expression consistent with elevation of phagosomal copper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref018">18</xref>] as an initial phagocyte response. <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> conidia lacking the AceA transcription factor are less tolerant of high copper and accordingly are less virulent in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref018">18</xref>]. Aspergillus cells lacking two Ctr transporters homologous to the fungal Ctr3/Ctr4 and Ctr1 proteins are unable to grow in low copper but lack any virulence defects in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007444.ref044">44</xref>]. These data indicate that copper toxicity is the primary host defense initially employed against fungal cells (i.e., during the innate immune response). In contrast to <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> yeasts, innate immune mechanisms are sufficient for control of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>fumigatus</italic> infections and cells that escape initial clearance by phagocytes grow as extracellular hyphae. <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic> yeasts, on the other hand, are not controlled by innate immunity and are primarily intracellular. Instead restriction of <italic>H</italic>. <italic>capsulatum</italic>, as well as <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>, requires activation of phagocytes by the adaptive immune system. Our data shows that IFN-γ is key to the switch of macrophage phagosomes from a high copper environment to a copper-limited environment, and it explains, in part, how adaptive immunity contributes to the control of intracellular primary pathogens.</p>

<p>Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were infected intranasally with 2×10<sup>4</sup> yeasts consisting of an equal amount of wild-type <italic>CTR3</italic> (RFP-negative) and <italic>ctr3/CTR3</italic> complemented (RFP-expressing) yeasts. At days 6 and 14 post-infection, the pulmonary fungal burden was measured by collecting lungs and plating lung homogenates on solid media for enumeration of RFP-fluorescent and non-fluorescent colony forming units (CFU). Data points represent the individual ratio of RFP-negative (<italic>ctr3/CTR3</italic>) yeasts and RFP-fluorescent (<italic>CTR3</italic>) yeasts at each time point (n = 3 mice) with horizontal bars representing the average ratio. No significant differences in the ratio of complemented and wild-type yeasts compared to the ratio of the number of yeasts in the inoculum were found by one-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests.</p>
