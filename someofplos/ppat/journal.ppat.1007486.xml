<abstract>
<p><italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> is a Gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacterium that infects the colon, causing symptoms ranging from infectious diarrhea to fulminant colitis. In the last decade, the number of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> infections has dramatically risen, making it the leading cause of reported hospital acquired infection in the United States. Bacterial toxins produced during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> infection (CDI) damage host epithelial cells, releasing erythrocytes and heme into the gastrointestinal lumen. The reactive nature of heme can lead to toxicity through membrane disruption, membrane protein and lipid oxidation, and DNA damage. Here we demonstrate that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> detoxifies excess heme to achieve full virulence within the gastrointestinal lumen during infection, and that this detoxification occurs through the heme-responsive expression of the <underline>h</underline>eme <underline>a</underline>ctivated <underline>t</underline>ransporter system (HatRT). Heme-dependent transcriptional activation of <italic>hatRT</italic> was discovered through an RNA-sequencing analysis of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> grown in the presence of a sub-toxic concentration of heme. HatRT is comprised of a TetR family transcriptional regulator (<italic>hatR)</italic> and a major facilitator superfamily transporter (<italic>hatT</italic>). Strains inactivated for <italic>hatR</italic> or <italic>hatT</italic> are more sensitive to heme toxicity than wild-type. HatR binds heme, which relieves the repression of the <italic>hatRT</italic> operon, whereas HatT functions as a heme efflux pump. In a murine model of CDI, a strain inactivated for <italic>hatT</italic> displayed lower pathogenicity in a toxin-independent manner. Taken together, these data suggest that HatR senses intracellular heme concentrations leading to increased expression of the <italic>hatRT</italic> operon and subsequent heme efflux by HatT during infection. These results describe a mechanism employed by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> to relieve heme toxicity within the host, and set the stage for the development of therapeutic interventions to target this bacterial-specific system.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p><italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> is a pathogenic bacterium that infects the colon and is the leading cause of infectious diarrhea in the United States. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> mediated disease is driven by the production of two toxins, TcdA and TcdB. The toxins cause severe damage to the intestinal epithelial layer of the colon resulting in inflammation and bleeding. Once in the intestinal lumen, red blood cells lyse, resulting in an abundance of extracellular heme at the site of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> infection. Due to the highly reactive nature of heme, elevated concentrations are toxic to bacteria. Here we describe a <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> system that allows for survival in the presence of heme intoxication. These results present a mechanism employed by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> to sense and reduce intracellular heme concentrations to relieve toxicity. We also demonstrate the importance of heme detoxification during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> infection, as strains lacking this system display reduced virulence in a murine model of infection. Collectively, these data provide insight into a mechanism that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> utilizes to survive in the host environment during infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> is a spore-forming, Gram-positive obligate anaerobe that is the most common cause of nosocomial infections in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref001">1</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> infects the colon, causing a wide range of diseases that vary from infectious diarrhea to pseudomembranous colitis. During infection, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> produces two potent toxins, TcdA and TcdB, which cause severe damage to intestinal epithelial cells resulting in inflammation, fluid secretion, and necrotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Perforations in the intestinal epithelial layer lead to bleeding in the gut and subsequent translocation of erythrocytes into the gastrointestinal lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref004">4</xref>]. Hemolysis due to pathophysiological stress occurs, resulting in the release of hemoglobin-bound heme and free heme at the site of damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref005">5</xref>]. Heme, an iron-containing porphyrin, is the most abundant source of iron in the human body and many invading pathogens have evolved mechanisms to utilize this rich metabolic resource [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref010">10</xref>]. Owing to its reactive nature, heme is toxic to bacteria at high concentrations through a variety of mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref014">14</xref>]. In order to defend against the stresses of heme-mediated damage, bacteria encode systems for heme sensing and detoxification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref021">21</xref>]. In the Gram-positive pathogens <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>, the heme stress response is controlled by the heme sensing two-component system, HssRS, which regulates transcription of the ABC transporter HrtAB to reduce heme toxicity through efflux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref022">22</xref>]. Reducing intracellular heme levels through export is a conserved microbial strategy as heme efflux systems have also been identified in <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>, and <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref023">23</xref>]. In each example, inactivation of heme detoxification machinery increases heme sensitivity and modulates virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref023">23</xref>]. Notably, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> does not contain orthologs of known heme detoxification systems, and it is also unknown if this organism encounters heme during infection.</p>
<p>The overall goal of this study was to investigate the occurrence of heme exposure to <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> within the gastrointestinal lumen during infection. Here, we visualize increased abundance of hemoglobin in the gastrointestinal lumen as a result of CDI using imaging mass spectrometry. A heme-inducible operon was identified that contains a TetR family transcriptional regulator and major-facilitator superfamily transporter. We have named these gene products HatRT for <underline>h</underline>eme <underline>a</underline>ctivated <underline>t</underline>ransporter (R = regulator, T = transporter). The transcriptional regulator HatR responds to intracellular heme concentrations through binding of heme leading to the de-repression and increased transcription of <italic>hatRT</italic>. Lack of the HatT transporter results in increased intracellular heme concentrations and a decrease in pathogenicity in a murine model of infection. Taken together, these results describe a mechanism by which <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> detoxifies heme and establishes a requirement for heme sensing and detoxification for full virulence during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> infection.</p>

<p>To identify host proteins that increase in abundance during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> infection (CDI), we applied matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) to a murine model that induces susceptibility to infection through administration of cefoperazone (0.5 mg/mL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref027">27</xref>].

This inflammatory response correlated with a high abundance of the alpha chain of hemoglobin at the sites of pathology and in the luminal space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007486.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007486.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). In contrast, mouse ceca mock infected with PBS did not exhibit pathology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007486.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) and displayed a low abundance of hemoglobin alpha concentrated at the periphery of the intestinal epithelial villi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007486.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007486.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).

<title>The transcriptional response of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> to heme exposure</title>
<p>Considering the high concentration of hemoglobin in the infected lumen and the reactive nature of heme, we investigated the sensitivity of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> to heme toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref013">13</xref>]. When <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> was grown over time in increasing concentrations of heme (0–200 μM), a dose-dependent increase in toxicity was observed with a complete inhibition of growth at the highest concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007486.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). To determine if <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> can adapt to heme exposure, the growth of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> cells pre-exposed to a low concentration of heme (1 μM) was measured following sub-culturing into media containing varying concentrations of heme (0–200 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007486.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).

<p>In order to identify the genes that encode proteins responsible for heme adaption, we performed an RNA-sequencing experiment comparing the total relative mRNA transcript abundance of early exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.3) untreated cultures of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> to cultures grown in 50 μM heme. Heme induced the transcription of 245 genes and decreased the transcription of 146 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007486.g002">Fig 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007486.s007">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007486.s008">S4</xref> Tables). This dataset was curated by grouping significantly upregulated genes that could function as a mechanism of heme sensing and detoxification.

<title>The <italic>hatRT</italic> operon increases expression in response to heme and confers heme resistance</title>
<p>To confirm that CDR20291_1227 and CDR20291_1226 are heme responsive, cultures were grown in equimolar concentrations of NaOH (vehicle), protoporphyrin IX (porphyrin ring without iron), iron sulfate, or heme prior to harvesting RNA at the early exponential phase of growth (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.3). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed on cDNA generated from these samples using primers specific for the genes within this operon. Transcription of both genes were minimally increased in the samples treated with NaOH, protoporphyrin IX, and iron sulfate in contrast to a 2–3 log increase in transcript abundance of the heme treated samples compared to the untreated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007486.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Due to this considerable transcriptional response to heme, as well as data described below, we named CDR20291_1227 <underline>h</underline>eme <underline>a</underline>ctivated <underline>t</underline>ransporter <underline>r</underline>egulator (<italic>hatR</italic>) and CDR20291_1226 <underline>h</underline>eme <underline>a</underline>ctivated <underline>t</underline>ranspor<underline>t</underline>er (<italic>hatT</italic>).</p>
<p>To investigate the heme responsive abundance of HatR, polyclonal antiserum was generated against recombinant HatR and immunoblot analyses were performed on whole cell lysates grown in increasing concentrations of heme. The increase in HatR protein abundance correlated with the increase in concentration of heme, further supporting the observation that <italic>hatRT</italic> is up-regulated upon heme exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007486.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). To demonstrate the specificity of this antisera, we generated a strain of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> inactivated for <italic>hatR</italic> (<italic>hatR</italic>::<italic>CT</italic>) using the ClosTron system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref028">28</xref>]. In this strain, HatR is no longer produced in response to heme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007486.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The lack of <italic>hatR</italic> renders the bacteria more sensitive to heme toxicity, as growth over time in the presence of 50 μM heme is delayed in the mutant compared to wild-type (WT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007486.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). A more significant growth delay is observed when <italic>hatT</italic> is inactivated (<italic>hatT</italic>::<italic>CT</italic>) using the ClosTron system and exposed to the same concentration of heme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007486.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). The growth of <italic>hatR</italic>::<italic>CT</italic> and <italic>hatT</italic>::<italic>CT</italic> strains are restored to WT levels by expressing <italic>hatR</italic> or <italic>hatT</italic>, respectively, <italic>in trans</italic> under the control of the intergenic region upstream of <italic>hatR</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007486.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Together these data suggest that HatR and HatT coordinate to sense, respond to, and alleviate heme toxicity.</p>

<title>HatR functions as a transcriptional repressor of the <italic>hatRT</italic> operon</title>
<p>As most members of the TetR family of transcriptional regulators directly bind their effector molecules, we examined the ability of HatR to bind heme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref029">29</xref>]. Recombinant HatR (10 μM) was incubated with heme (0–25 μM), resulting in the appearance of a Soret peak at 413 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007486.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), indicative of HatR-heme complex formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref030">30</xref>]. Differential absorption spectroscopy at 413 nm over a range of heme concentrations was used to determine that HatR binds heme at a 1:1 ratio using a single site binding model (k<sub>d</sub> = 9.2 ± 1.8 μM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007486.g004">Fig 4A</xref> insert). To identify the residues responsible for heme binding by HatR, each histidine within HatR was individually mutated. Histidine residues were chosen for substitution due to histidines commonly serving as axial ligands that bind heme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref017">17</xref>]. Recombinant proteins containing each individual histidine substitution were purified and heme binding was measured. Substitution of histidine 99 to leucine (H99L) was sufficient to abrogate heme binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007486.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The substitutions of the remaining four histidines to alanine or leucine (H121A, H126L, H165A, and H180A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007486.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) did not significantly alter heme binding. These data specify histidine 99 as a critical residue in the formation of the HatR-heme complex.</p>

<title>HatT reduces intracellular heme concentrations</title>

<title>HatT promotes pathogenicity in a mouse model of CDI</title>
<p>The abundance of heme in the lumen during infection combined with the observed functions of HatR and HatT to sense and reduce heme concentrations, suggest that strains lacking these proteins may have reduced pathogenicity during CDI. To test this, mice were infected with WT, <italic>hatR</italic>::<italic>CT</italic>, or <italic>hatT</italic>::<italic>CT</italic> spores and disease was monitored for 4 days. All strains were able to fully colonize the mice as exhibited by ~10<sup>8</sup> colony-forming units (CFU) per gram of stool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007486.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> infection of the colon causes severe epithelial cell damage, inflammation, and edema, which leads to the hallmarks of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic>-colitis. Importantly, this damage and subsequent inflammatory response also creates a hostile environment for bacteria within the gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref033">33</xref>]. Highly reactive heme molecules that can be toxic to bacteria are released into the lumen through erythrocyte lysis and necrotic epithelial cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref005">5</xref>]. Despite the hazard of heme toxicity, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> thrives in the colon and survives in the presence of high heme levels. Prior to this work, the mechanism by which <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> resists heme toxicity were unknown. Herein, we visualized the high abundance of hemoglobin during infection, serving as a proxy for heme, in the murine ceca during CDI. We identified a molecular mechanism encoded by the <italic>hatRT</italic> operon to sense and detoxify heme in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic>. HatR functions as a transcriptional repressor of the <italic>hatRT</italic> operon and responds to heme concentrations through direct binding of heme. HatR-heme complexes de-repress the <italic>hatRT</italic> operon, leading to the HatT-mediated reduction in intracellular heme concentrations, presumably through efflux. In support of these data, strains with inactivated <italic>hatR</italic> or <italic>hatT</italic> exhibited delayed growth in the presence of heme and the <italic>hatT</italic>::<italic>CT</italic> strain conferred reduced pathology in a toxin-independent manner in a mouse model of CDI.</p>
<p>While heme sensing and detoxification through efflux is a conserved strategy in multiple Gram-positive organisms, this report is the first to describe an obligate anaerobic pathogen containing such a system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref034">34</xref>]. TetR-family transcriptional regulators that bind heme have been identified, including HrtR in <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>, whereby HrtR regulates heme efflux through a system orthologous to HrtAB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref035">35</xref>]. However, HatR shares limited sequence homology (38% amino acid identity) with HrtR. Additionally, the heme binding motifs (single histidine versus two histidines) and the heme-complex disassociation constant (HatR k<sub>d</sub> = 9.2 ± 1.8 μM, HrtR k<sub>d</sub> = 0.4 ± 0.2 μM) differ between HatR and HrtR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref017">17</xref>]. The significant overexpression of the <italic>hatRT</italic> operon in the presence of heme but not protoporphyrin IX or iron suggests the formation of the heme-HatR complex involves direct binding to the coordinated iron center of heme. The increased heme sensitivity in the <italic>hatR</italic>::<italic>CT</italic> strain despite the constitutive expression of <italic>hatT</italic>, suggests HatR may also function to reduce heme toxicity through sequestration. The eventual <italic>in vitro</italic> growth observed when the <italic>hatT</italic>::<italic>CT</italic> strain is exposed to high heme suggests the existence of other mechanisms of heme detoxification in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> or the occurrence of suppressor mutations to relieve intracellular heme concentrations through a different transport system. A bioinformatics comparison of HatT with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> HrtAB and the dual <italic>S</italic>. <italic>agalactiae</italic> efflux system PefAB/CD, suggests that these systems arose through convergent evolution as there is little homology between these transporters despite their important role in heme detoxification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>The mechanisms of heme toxicity in bacteria are not completely understood. In an anaerobic environment, heme toxicity has been attributed to membrane disruption and DNA damage due to the hydrophobic structure of heme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref036">36</xref>]. Bilirubin, the terminal metabolite in heme catabolism in mammals is present in high concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract, and destabilizes the membrane of Gram-positive bacteria, suggesting that heme degradation products may also contribute to toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref037">37</xref>]. In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic>, heme enters the intracellular compartment through an unknown mechanism. It is also not known if <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> utilizes heme as a cofactor or metabolite. Bioinformatic analyses do not reveal heme degradation enzymes of the IsdG or HO enzyme families in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref040">40</xref>]. Additionally, it appears as if <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> cannot use heme as a sole iron source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref041">41</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrated that heme accumulates in the cytoplasm of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> and is subsequently detoxified through removal by HatT.</p>
<p>Results reported in this work demonstrate the importance of heme detoxification in CDI as the <italic>hatT</italic>::<italic>CT</italic> strain was less pathogenic in a mouse model of infection. The colonization of the WT, <italic>hatR</italic>::<italic>CT</italic>, and <italic>hatT</italic>::<italic>CT</italic> strains are at similar levels, supporting a model in which resistance to heme toxicity is important for the end stages of acute infection after serious injury to the intestinal epithelium has occurred. This observation is further supported by the reduction in disease that was only observed on days 3 and 4 following infection in the <italic>hatT</italic>::<italic>CT</italic> infected mice. The lack of phenotype of the <italic>hatR</italic>::<italic>CT</italic> strain suggests that continual expression of <italic>hatT</italic> in the absence of HatR in this strain is sufficient to cause full disease. Surprisingly, there were no differences in bacterial burdens at these days or differences in toxin production despite less overall pathology in the <italic>hatT</italic>::<italic>CT</italic> infected mice. This suggests <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> utilizes either additional heme detoxification operons or compensatory mechanisms to relieve intracellular heme stress outside of HatRT and reveals the importance of toxin-independent mechanisms of virulence. Alternatively, as <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> has been shown to occupy different nutritional niches during infection, and heme is heterogeneously distributed throughout the infected ceca, the heme sensitive strains may be able to maintain WT levels of colonization due to occupying niches of reduced heme concentrations at a cost of pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref042">42</xref>]. These results provide a molecular insight into how <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> adapts to the harsh environment of the inflamed gut. Further studies must be performed to elucidate additional mechanisms of protection that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> utilizes to survive during infection.</p>

Plates were scraped and transferred into 2 mL of BHIS prior to plating 200 μL onto BHIS plates containing 20 μg/mL thiamphenicol and 50 μg/mL kanamycin (BHIS<sub>thiamp20kan50</sub>). Colonies from these plates were patched onto new BHIS<sub>thiamp20kan50</sub> and BHIS plates containing 5 μg/mL tetracycline (BHIS<sub>tet5</sub>). Patched colonies that were tetracycline sensitive were patched again onto new BHIS<sub>thiamp20kan50</sub> and BHIS<sub>tet5</sub> plates. Colonies that remained tetracycline sensitive were streaked onto BHIS plates containing 20 μg/mL lincomycin (BHIS<sub>linc20</sub>). Inactivation of the <italic>hatR</italic> or <italic>hatT</italic> gene was confirmed by performing PCR to identify a 1.5 kbp shift in gene size using gDNA extracted as previously described on colonies that were lincomycin resistant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref044">44</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>xylE reporter and complementation plasmids</italic>. Reporter and complementation plasmids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007486.s005">S1 Table</xref>) were created by GenScript using the pJS116 plasmid as a backbone for the synthesized intergenic region (236 bp) of <italic>hatR</italic> fused to the <italic>xylE</italic> reporter gene, the intergenic and full coding region of <italic>hatR</italic>, and intergenic region of <italic>hatR</italic> fused to the full coding region of <italic>hatT</italic>. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> strains were transformed as described above with the removal of the lincomycin selection and were maintained on BHIS<sub>thiamp20</sub> to ensure plasmid retention.</p>

<title>RNA extraction and sequencing</title>
<p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> were grown anaerobically in triplicate in CDMM in 0 or 50 μM heme. Hemin (Sigma) was solubilized in 0.1 M NaOH. The cultures were grown at 37°C to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.3 abs. Upon reaching this density, a 1:1 solution of acetone:ethanol was added to an equal volume of the culture. Samples were stored at -80°C until used for RNA extraction. Samples were thawed on ice, pelleted, and resuspended in 750 μL of LETS buffer (1 M LiCl, 0.5 M EDTA, 1 M Tris pH 7.4). Cells were transferred to tubes containing lysing matrix B beads (MP Biomedicals) and lysed by a FastPrep-24 (MP Biomedicals) bead beater for 45 s at 6 m/s. Lysed samples were heated for 5 min at 55°C and pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and 1 mL TRIzol (Thermo Scientific) was added. Chloroform (200 μL) was added to each sample and vortexed prior to separation of the aqueous and organic layers by centrifugation for 15 min. The aqueous (upper) layer was transferred to a fresh tube and the RNA was precipitated through the addition of 1 mL isopropyl alcohol. Samples were incubated for 10 min and RNA was pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min. Supernatant was removed and the RNA pellet was washed with 200 μL of 70% ethanol. Samples were air dried for 1 min, then resuspended in 100 μL RNase free water. DNA contamination was removed through the addition of 8 μL RQ1 DNase, 12 μL 10x RQ1 buffer, and 2 μL RNase inhibitor (Promega) to the purified RNA. Samples were DNase treated for 2 h and purified using the RNeasy miniprep RNA cleanup kit (Qiagen). RNA concentration was determined using the Synergy 2 with Gen 5 software (BioTek).</p>
<p><italic>RNA-seq library preparation and sequencing</italic>. RNA-seq library construction and sequencing was performed by HudsonAlpha.

RNA was normalized to 500 ng of total RNA for each sample and the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was removed using Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina). Directly after rRNA removal, the RNA was fragmented and primed for first strand synthesis using the NEBNext First Strand synthesis module (New England BioLabs Inc.) followed by second strand synthesis using NEBNext Ultra Directional Second Strand synthesis kit. Library preparation was achieved using NEBNext DNA Library Prep Master Mix set for Illumina with minor modifications. PolyA addition and custom adapter ligation was performed following end–repair. Post-ligated samples were individually barcoded with unique in-house Genomic Services Lab (GSL) primers and amplified through 12 cycles of PCR. Library quantity was assessed by Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen), and quality was determined using a DNA High Sense chip on a Caliper Gx (Perkin Elmer). Final quantification of the complete libraries for sequencing applications was measured using the qPCR-based KAPA Biosystems Library Quantification kit (Kapa Biosystems, Inc.). Libraries were diluted to 12.5 nM and pooled equimolar prior to clustering. Paired-End (PE) sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer (Illumina, Inc.).

Liquid chromatography separations were achieved by linear gradient elution, transitioning from 15% to 95% solvent B over 6 min followed by a 2 min hold at 95% B. The column was re-equilibrated to 15% solvent B for 2 min in between injections of the same sample (two technical replicates run per sample, 2 μL injection volume, 600 μL/min flow rate, 50°C). Two blank runs were implemented between samples to ensure against column holdover of analytes. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis was carried out in positive mode with a capillary voltage of 2Hz (Agilent 6538 UHD Q-TOF).</p>

<title>Quantification of standards and analytes from LC-MS data</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using MassHunter Qualitative Analysis Software and MZmine 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref047">47</xref>]. Extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) were derived for each individual standard on the basis of its mass per charge (<italic>m/z</italic>) in positive ion mode, which is equivalent to the exact mass of its positive ion (M+H)<sup>+</sup>. Values for <italic>m/z</italic> were determined empirically for all standards. Peaks associated with each analyte were integrated. For the generation of standard curves, integrated peak areas were plotted versus concentration. Linear regression analysis (Kaleidagraph) was used to determine the correlation coefficient between integrated peak area and heme concentration (slope of standard curve, mporph). For the quantification of analytes from cells, values for the integrated peak intensities (measured in units of ion counts) were converted to units of concentration (μmol/L injected) via: counts x (mporph)<sup>-1</sup>. The concentration of each analyte in the injected volumes [A] was subsequently converted to units of nmol analyte per CFU in sample as: [A] x (volume used to resuspend dried sample) x (CFUs in analyzed cell pellet)<sup>-1</sup>. Reported values are averages of 3 biological samples and two technical replicates.</p>

<title>Mouse model of CDI</title>
<p>Adult (8–12 week old) age-matched male C57Bl/6 (Jackson Laboratories) were housed in groups of five and maintained at Vanderbilt University Medical Center Animal Facilities. Mice were subjected to a previously described model of CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref027">27</xref>]. Briefly, mice were treated with 0.5 mg/mL cefoperazone in their drinking water for 5 days. Mice were given a 2 day recovery period prior to administration of 10<sup>5</sup> spores of WT, <italic>hatR</italic>::<italic>CT</italic>, or <italic>hatT</italic>::<italic>CT C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> strains in PBS via oral gavage. Prior to infection, mice were confirmed to be <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> negative. After infection, mice were monitored for signs of disease, including diarrhea and weight loss. Mice that displayed severe disease or weight loss greater than 20% were humanely euthanized.</p>

<title>Histological analysis</title>
<p>On the final day of infection and necropsy, ceca were harvested, fixed in a 10% formalin solution and embedded in paraffin. Cut sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). Stained sections were assigned a disease score in a blinded fashion by a pathologist based on previously established criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref048">48</xref>]. Histological scores are presented as a sum of three independent criteria: epithelial damage, edema, and inflammation.</p>

<title>Imaging mass spectrometry</title>
<p>MALDI IMS was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref026">26</xref>]. Briefly, ceca were harvested after necropsy and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen in a 25% Optimal Cutting Temperature compound. Sections were sequentially washed to remove interfering lipids, salts, and OCT using 70% ethanol for thirty seconds, 100% ethanol for thirty seconds, 6:2:1 ethanol:chloroform:acetic acid for 2 minutes, 70% ethanol for thirty seconds, and 100% ethanol for thirty seconds. Slides were dried in a desiccator before MALDI matrix was applied. Fifteen mg/mL 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone was prepared in 90% acetonitrile with 0.2% TFA and crystals were dissolved by sonication for ten minutes. Matrix was applied six times using a TM-Sprayer (HTX Imaging) operated at 1100 mm/min and at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min using 90% acetonitrile as a pushing solvent. The spray nozzle was heated to 80°C with the track spacing set to 2 mm. Coating was rehydrated using 1 mL of 50 mM acetic acid in a sealed hydration chamber for 3 min at 85°C. IMS was performed using a rapifleX MALDI Tissuetyper (Bruker Daltonics) operated in linear positive ion mode. The laser was operated at 10,000 hertz in single mode and pixels were set to be 50 by 50 μm. A total of five-hundred laser shots were captured per pixel with fifty laser shots at each position within the pixel. Data were processed using fleXimaging version 4.1. Data were further analyzed using SCiLS Lab 2015b version 3.02.7774 (Bruker Daltonics). Spectra were normalized to total ion count and baseline subtracted using a top hat algorithm. The images display the ion map of the m/z value of 14,995 without denoising but with interpolation turned on.</p>

<p>Green African monkey kidney epithelial (Vero, ATCC CCL-81) cell-rounding cytotoxicity assays were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007486.ref027">27</xref>]. Cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Gibco Laboratories) with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco Laboratories) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco Laboratories) prior to plating at a total cell density of 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in a 96-well plate. Fresh fecal samples were normalized to weight, diluted and homogenized in sterile PBS. Fecal debris was pelleted by centrifugation (13,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 min) and tenfold serial dilutions of supernatants were added to the wells of Vero cells. Complete cell-rounding for each dilution was assessed after overnight incubation at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Confirmation of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>difficile</italic> toxin A and toxin B were achieved by neutralization of cell rounding with a combined antitoxin antisera (Techlab). Cell rounding cytotoxicity titers are presented as the log<sub>10</sub> of the reciprocal value of the highest dilution with complete rounding of cells.</p>
