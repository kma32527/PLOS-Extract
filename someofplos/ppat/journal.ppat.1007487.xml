<abstract>
<p>Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) encode cellular homologs to evade host immune functions. In this study, we analyzed the roles of GP33, a guinea pig CMV (GPCMV)-encoded G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) homolog, in cellular signaling, viral growth and pathogenesis. The cDNA structure of GP33 was determined by RACE. The effects of GP33 on some signaling pathways were analyzed in transient transfection assays. The redET two-step recombination system for a BAC containing the GPCMV genome was used to construct a mutant GPCMV containing an early stop codon in the GP33 gene (Δ33) and a rescued GPCMV (r33). We found the following: 1) GP33 activated the CRE- and NFAT-, but not the NFκB-mediated signaling pathway. 2) GP33 was dispensable for infection in tissue cultures and in normal animals. 3) In pregnant animals, viral loads of r33 in the livers, lungs, spleens, and placentas at 6 days post-infection were higher than those of Δ33, although the viruses were cleared by 3 weeks post-infection. 4) The presence of GP33 was associated with frequent lesions, including alveolar hemorrhage in the lungs, and inflammation in the lungs, livers, and spleens of the dams. Our findings suggest that GP33 has critical roles in the pathogenesis of GPCMV during pregnancy. We hypothesize that GP33-mediated signaling activates cytokine secretion from the infected cells, which results in inflammation in some of the maternal organs and the placentas. Alternatively, GP33 may facilitate transient inflammation that is induced by the chemokine network specific to the pregnancy.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a major pathogen that causes congenital diseases, including birth defects and developmental abnormalities in newborns. Better understanding of the immune evasion mechanisms may open the way to the development of new types of live attenuated vaccines for congenital CMV infection. In contrast to murine and rat CMVs, guinea pig CMV (GPCMV) causes infection <italic>in utero</italic>, which makes GPCMV animal models a useful tool for understanding the pathogenesis of congenital infection and evaluation of vaccine strategies. By constructing a GPCMV mutant lacking GP33, a viral G protein-coupled receptor homolog, this study found that GP33 was involved in the induction of significant inflammatory responses in pregnant but not in normal animals. As GP33 activated the NFAT- and CRE-, but not the NFκB-signal pathway, it is plausible that GP33 enhanced cytokine expression, which results in pathogenic outcomes in the maternal organs and placentas.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Congenital infection of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) occurs in 0.2–1% of all births and causes birth defects and developmental abnormalities, including neurological sequela [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref004">4</xref>]. In contrast to murine CMV (MCMV) and rat CMV (RCMV), guinea pig CMV (GPCMV) causes infection <italic>in utero</italic> and pathogenic outcomes similar to those caused by HCMV, which makes GPCMV animal models useful for studies on congenital CMV diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Virus-encoded G protein-coupled receptor homologs (vGPCRs) are characteristic of beta- and gamma-herpesviruses and are considered potential therapeutic targets. HCMV encodes four vGPCRs: UL33 and UL78 are conserved in all beta-herpesviruses, including MCMV, RCMV and GPCMV, whereas US28/US27 homologs are restricted to primate beta-herpesviruses. Although US28 and UL78 are expressed early after infection, US27 and UL33 are expressed during the late phase of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref009">9</xref>]. It is well known that stimulation of GPCR activates heterotrimeric G proteins, which are composed of α, β, and γ subunits, and dissociates them into α and βγ subunits, resulting in production of second messengers for transcriptional gene regulation. Among the Gα family, Gαs stimulates cyclic AMP (cAMP) production, resulting in cAMP response element (CRE) activation, while Gαi inhibits cAMP production. Gαq stimulates phospholipase C (PLC), resulting in activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT). GPCRs associate with G proteins through a DRY (Asp-Arg-Tyr) motif located at the cytosolic end of the third membrane-spanning segment, and the motif plays an important role in the conformational transition between active and inactive states of GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref010">10</xref>]. Although UL33 contains the conserved DRY motif, it activates PLC, p38, and CRE binding protein (CREB) constitutively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref011">11</xref>]. A structural study on US28 suggests that the DRY motif and its immediate environment affect constitutive activity of viral GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref012">12</xref>]. M33, an MCMV homolog of UL33, displays ligand-independent, constitutive signaling through the Gq/PLC pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref013">13</xref>]. M33 also activates CREB in a ligand-independent, constitutive manner. M33 contains a NRY motif at the amino acid (aa) position 130–132 in place of the DRY motif, and the alteration R131A but not N130D in the motif abolished the constitutive signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref014">14</xref>]. M33 and R33, but not UL33, activate the NFκB pathway. This activation by M33 is G protein-independent, but that by R33 is G protein-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref016">16</xref>]. Functional similarities in signaling activities between M33 and US28, including activation of the NFκB pathway and vascular smooth muscle cell migration, have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref017">17</xref>]. UL33 and UL78 form heterodimers with human CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5). The heterodimerization of UL33 impairs the CC chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5)-induced internalization of CCR5 and the CCR5-mediated cell migration and HIV entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>The roles of MCMV and RCMV vGPCRs <italic>in vivo</italic> have been studied intensively. After CMV infection, acute-phase replication in the primary organs is followed by dissemination to the secondary sites, such as the salivary glands, where the virus may replicate for several days, affording an opportunity for horizontal viral spread. The lack of M33-dependent signaling decreased viral loads in the salivary glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref019">19</xref>]. A recombinant MCMV expressing US28 partially complemented the defect due to the lack of M33 in BALB/c mice infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref020">20</xref>]. A recent study demonstrated that M33 is required for viral replication in the salivary glands in NOD/scid-/infg- (NSG) mice infected i.p. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref021">21</xref>]. Intranasal (i.n.) administration of MCMV lacking M33 also demonstrated that transmission from the lymph nodes (LNs) to the lungs requires M33 functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>As there are few studies on GPCMV GP33 and as the GPCMV animal model can address the question of whether GP33 plays any role in congenital infection, this study sought to characterize the roles of GP33 in cellular signaling and viral pathogenesis, particularly under pregnant conditions.</p>

<title>cDNA structure of the GP33 gene and localization of its product</title>
<p>RNA samples were prepared from guinea pig lung fibroblasts (GPL) at 3 days after infection with GPCMV.

<p>A plasmid encoding GP33 fused with EGFP at the carboxyl side was constructed.

<title>GPCMV strains derived from our BAC had attenuated phenotypes</title>
<p>Schleiss and his colleagues reported that the lack of the GP1 gene encoding a macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (MIP-1) homolog attenuated in vivo phenotypes of GPCMV and that the MIP-1 homolog signals via CCR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref031">31</xref>]. GPCMVΔ9K WT and its derivatives r33 and Δ33 were prepared from pBAC-GPCMVΔ9K that lacks a 9 kb region of the GPCMV genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref032">32</xref>]. At least MIP-1 homolog is encoded in the 9 kb region, although any other ORFs are not identified. To confirm that the lack of the 9 kb region results in the reported attenuated phenotypes and to see whether the lack of the region increases lung and liver pathology of pregnant guinea pigs, dams (Hartley) at 4 weeks’ GA were infected s.c. with GPCMVΔ9K WT lacking the 9 kb region or with GPCMV SG, a strain that contains the 9 kb region and has the full capacity to grow in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref033">33</xref>] (n = 4 each; 3x10<sup>6</sup> IUs) and sacrificed at 6 days p.i. As GPCMV SG was more virulent than GPCMVΔ9K WT in preliminary experiments, animals were infected with about one fourth of the dose used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007487.g005">Fig 5</xref>. We found that GPCMV SG showed more virulent viral growth phenotype, including more severe inflammatory lesions in their lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007487.g010">Fig 10A</xref>), a severe large necrotic lesion in one of the livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007487.g010">Fig 10B</xref>), and higher viral loads in the livers, lungs, and salivary glands as compared to GPCMVΔ9K WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007487.g010">Fig 10D–10F</xref>). In addition, in a separate experiment, viral genome copies per 10<sup>6</sup> cells (Log10) in the salivary glands of dams at 4 weeks’ GA (n = 4) that were infected s.c. with GPCMV SG (3 x 10<sup>6</sup> IUs/animal) and sacrificed at 3 weeks p.i. were 6.5 ± 0.9, whereas those of dams infected with the BAC-derived strains were negligible as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007487.g008">Fig 8</xref>. Thus, the lack of the 9 kb region attenuated GPCMV infection significantly but it did not increase lung and liver pathology.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we determined the cDNA structure of GP33 and demonstrated that GP33 activated the CRE- and NFAT-, but not the NFκB-signal pathway. Phylogenetically, GPCMV lies between MCMV and HCMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref034">34</xref>], but in the case of GP33 homologs, it is likely that GP33 is functionally closer to HCMV UL33, as i) GP33 and UL33 contain the DRY motif, whereas M33 and R33 contain the NRY motif, and ii) GP33 and UL33 activate the CRE- and NFAT-, but not the NFκB-signal pathway, whereas M33 and R33 activate all three pathways. Although M33 and R33, but not UL33, induce migration of smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref035">35</xref>], it remains unclear whether GP33 behaves in a similar manner to rodent GP33 homologs or to UL33.</p>
<p>GP33 was dispensable for infection both in tissue cultures and in normal animals. In pregnant animals, however, r33 encoding GP33 induced significantly more frequent lesions and higher viral loads in the maternal organs at 6 days p.i. Potential factors affecting the difference in disease pathogenesis between normal and pregnant animals could include i) age of animals, ii) immune responses, iii) chemokine network, and iv) routes of viral inoculation. First, it is unlikely that older animals, in this case, the dams, are more susceptible to GPCMV, as younger animals were more prone to body weight loss after virus challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref008">8</xref>]. While there is a recent study demonstrating functional impairment of CMV-reactive cellular immunity in pregnant women based on an IFN-γ ELISPOT assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref036">36</xref>], issues surrounding immune responses and susceptibility to infectious diseases during the pregnancy have long been controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref037">37</xref>]. As the chemokine network in pregnancy significantly contributes to the maintenance of pregnancy, especially to maternal-fetal tolerance and to placentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref039">39</xref>], the chemokine profiles specific to the pregnancy may have impact on GP33-mediated pathogenesis. M33 plays an essential role in smooth muscle cell migration in a CCL5-dependent manner, despite its ligand-independent activation of signal pathways in transiently transfection experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref017">17</xref>]. As an analogy, GP33 could respond to a certain ligand in vivo, such as in the context of pregnancy, in spite of ligand-independent activation shown in this work. Finally, infection via different inoculation routes yields different disease outcomes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref040">40</xref>]). For example, CX3CR1 deficiency of mice compromised dissemination of MCMV to the salivary glands from a local footpad inoculation but not from systemic intraperitoneal inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref041">41</xref>]. A recent study demonstrated that the lack of M33 hampered viral spread from lymph nodes to the lungs after the i.n. administration of MCMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref022">22</xref>]. One of the limitations of our study is the artificial routes of infection, i.p. for non-pregnant normal animals and s.c. for pregnant animals, while i.n. infection apparently represents the natural infection route.</p>
<p>The most striking phenotype for M33 or R33 mutant viruses is the inability to replicate in the salivary glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref043">43</xref>]. However, we could not evaluate whether GP33 is essential for replication in the salivary glands, as the GPCMV strains used in this study showed significantly reduced viral loads in the salivary glands, probably due to the lack of the MIP-1 homolog. Although the lack of the 9 kb region encoding the MIP-1 homolog resulted attenuated phenotypes, it did not increase lung and liver pathology in pregnant animals. Therefore, it is clear that the deletion of GP33 confers additional attenuation that could be observed in pregnant animals.</p>
<p>The maternal organs of the dams infected with GPCMV r33 showed higher viral loads and active viral replication at 6 days p.i. and more severe inflammation in the lung at 3 weeks p.i., although viral loads in the maternal organs were almost undetectable at 3 weeks p.i. Our hypothetical view would be that GP33 transiently increases viral activities, which triggers inflammation in the maternal visceral organs, but the balance between viral activities and viral clearance by immune responses determines pathological outcomes. Further studies on immune correlates will be required. In addition to the maternal organs, higher viral loads in the placentas of the dams at 6 days p.i. suggest that GP33 has some pathological roles in congenital diseases. However, due to the small size of the infected fetuses, we could not obtain organs from a sufficient number of fetuses to analyze fetal transmission at 6 days p.i. In addition, the lack of the difference in the weights of the placenta and fetus as well as in viral loads of any of the examined fetal organs, between r33- and Δ33-infected dams at 3 weeks p.i., makes it hard to conclude that GP33 is involved in fetal transmission. Not only direct infection of fetuses causes congenital diseases but also infection of the placenta may impair the normal growth of fetuses indirectly, for example, by CMV-induced cytokine modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref044">44</xref>]. Also vascular insufficiency due to CMV-mediated injury of endothelial cells could compromise perfusion to the developing fetus or to the placenta, resulting in hypoxia and growth restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref046">46</xref>]. Therefore, it would be essential to analyze pup survival and pup viral loads to see whether GP33 contributes to any of the pathogenic aspects of congenital infection.</p>
<p>The importance of our study lies in the demonstration of GP33 involvement in the pathological effects in some organs. It is intriguing that GP33 appears to enhance the accumulation of GPCMV-infected cells in the spleen. We hypothesize that an increase of inflammatory cytokines by GP33 allows the infection and migration of monocytes/macrophages in the spleen to the organs for viral dissemination as well as for the induction of pathological lesions. Alternatively, GP33 may facilitate transient inflammation that is induced by the chemokine network specific to the pregnancy. Expression of GP33, such as by transduction with a recombinant adenovirus vector, in the absence of GPCMV infection or in the presence of Δ33 infection might help the understanding of the observed phenomena. In addition to GP33, GPCMV encodes GP78, the UL78 homolog. It would be interesting to see whether the presence of GP78 compensates for the GP33 defect and whether GP33 forms a heterodimer with GP78 or other GPCR homologs for unexpected functions. Although our study had some limitations, our observations regarding the pathogenic role of GP33 during pregnancy warrants further studies on the functions of GPCMV vGPCRs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, GP33, a GPCR encoded by GPCMV, contributes to increasing viral activities transiently in the maternal spleens and livers and in the placentas as well as to inducing inflammation in some maternal organs during pregnancy.</p>

<title>RACE and construction of GP33-expressing plasmids</title>
<p>GPL (CCL-158, ATCC USA) were cultured in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone, USA) and infected with GPCMV. Two days later, RNA samples were extracted from the infected cells with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The cDNA was synthesized from the extracted RNA with SMARTer RACE 5´/3´Kit (Clontech). The obtained PCR products were purified using a DNA fragment purification kit (MagExtractor, TOYOBO, Japan), and their nucleotide sequences were determined. The UL33 ORF prepared from HCMV-infected fibroblasts, the ORF predicted initially as GP33 (GP33s), the GP33 ORF in the cDNA obtained by the RACE analyses, and the GP33 ORF with FLAG-tag at the carboxyl end were cloned into pcDNA3.0 (Invitrogen), resulting in pcDNA-UL33, -GP33s, -GP33 and -GP33F, respectively. The GP33 ORF was also cloned between EcoRI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), resulting in pEGFP-GP33 to express GP33-EGFP fusion protein. Cells transfected with pEGFP-GP33 were fixed with paraformaldehyde and observed under a confocal microscope.</p>

<title>Construction of GP33 mutants</title>
<p>pBAC-GPCMVΔ9K, a BAC that contains a GFP expression cassette and the GPCMV genome lacking an 8.9-kb sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref032">32</xref>], was used for the generation of GP33 mutants as follows. GPCMV with a knock-out mutation in the GP33 gene and that with a wild-type sequence were prepared from the same backbone as follows. First, the rpsL-neo cassette was amplified by PCR using primers GP33rpsL-F and GP33rpsL-R (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007487.s001">S1 Table</xref>) that add a 50-bp GPCMV sequence flanking the GP33 ORF and used for recombination with the GPCMV region 54,807–56,090 (the numbers are based on Genbank acc. no. AB592928;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref033">33</xref>]) of pBAC-GPCMVΔ9K using the RedET recombination system (GeneBridges), resulting in pBAC-GPCMVΔ9K::rpsL-neo/GP33. A fragment containing the GPCMV region 54,698–56181 was amplified by PCR with primers GP33BS-F and -R, and cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pBluescriptII KS(+). Next, the resultant plasmid was mutagenized using a commercial kit (QuickChange Lighting, Agilent) with the primers GP33KO-F and -R (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007487.s001">S1 Table</xref>) to introduce a “TGAT” sequence, which inserts a stop-codon mutation at amino acid position 30, accompanied by a frame-shift mutation, into the GP33 ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007487.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The rpsL-neo cassette in pBAC-GPCMVΔ9K::rpsL-neo/GP33 was replaced with the GPCMV sequences containing the mutated “TGAT” or wild-type sequence by electroporation of the PCR fragments (54,698–56,179) amplified from the plasmids using primers GP33-F and -R (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007487.s001">S1 Table</xref>), resulting in pBAC-GPCMVΔ9K-r33 and -Δ33.</p>
<p>GPCMV WT, r33 and Δ33, were recovered by transfection of BAC DNAs, the parental pBAC-GPCMVΔ9K and the manipulated pBAC-GPCMVΔ9K-r33 and -Δ33, respectively, into GPL cells. After observation of plaque formation, the recovered viruses were amplified a couple of times by the co-culturing of infected cells with uninfected cells. Finally, cell-free virus stocks were prepared and concentrated by ultracentrifugation (20,000 <italic>g</italic> for 2 h) in a 20% sucrose step gradient as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007487.ref032">32</xref>]. RFLP analyses of the GPCMV-BACs with EcoRI and HindIII demonstrated no apparent differences in the genome structures among GPCMV WT, r33 and Δ33. In addition, the integrity of the locus encoding GP129, GP131, and GP133 was confirmed. As the viral stocks prepared from the two BAC clones for each strain behaved similarly in the following experiments, the results obtained from only one of them are shown. Titers of the GPCMV-BAC stocks were determined by counting GFP-positive foci after infection of GPL cells. Although the infectivity depended on cell type, we used those titers to calculate multiplicities of infection (MOIs).</p>

<p>Four- or 5-week-old female normal guinea pigs (strain Hartley) and pregnant guinea pigs at 4 weeks’ GA were all purchased from a commercial breeder (SLC Inc., Hamamatsu, Japan). Since the company allows mating for two weeks, 4 weeks’ GA means 4 ± 1 weeks’ GA. Animals were randomly grouped based on the body weights. Blood specimens were drawn from ear veins using heparinized micro-hematocrit capillaries (Harschmann, Germany) for serological tests. All tested animals were seronegative for GPCMV. Normal and pregnant animals were infected with GPCMV i.p. and s.c., respectively. Animals were euthanized at the indicated days p.i. The visible lesions on the surface of the lungs were scored blindly from “1” to “10” based on numbers and sizes of lesions, by 5 lab members who worked in the bacteriology field and were not involved in this study.</p>
