<abstract>
<p>The molecular basis for the formation of functional, higher-ordered macro-molecular domains is not completely known. The Kaposi’s Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) genome forms a super-molecular domain structure during latent infection that is strictly dependent on the DNA binding of the viral nuclear antigen LANA to the viral terminal repeats (TR). LANA is known to form oligomeric structures that have been implicated in viral episome maintenance. In this study, we show that the LANA oligomerization interface is required for the formation of higher-order nuclear bodies that partially colocalize with DAXX, EZH2, H3K27me3, and ORC2 but not with PML. These nuclear bodies assemble at the periphery of condensed cellular chromosomes during mitotic cell division. We demonstrate that the LANA oligomerization interface contributes to the cooperative DNA binding at the viral TR and the recruitment of ORC to the viral episome. Oligomerization mutants failed to auto-regulate LANA/ORF73 transcription, and this correlated with the loss of a chromosome conformational DNA-loop between the TR and LANA promoter. Viral genomes with LANA oligomerization mutants were subject to genome rearrangements including the loss of subgenomic DNA. Our data suggests that LANA oligomerization drives stable binding to the TR and formation of an epigenetically stable chromatin architecture resulting in higher-order LANA nuclear bodies important for viral genome integrity and long-term episome persistence.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>KSHV genomes persist in large nuclear bodies in latently infected cells. The KSHV encoded nuclear antigen LANA is required for the efficient replication and stable maintenance of viral genomes during latent infection. LANA is also known to form oligomeric structures, but it is not known how these structures contribute to LANA function in living cells. Here, we show that LANA oligomerization is required for cooperative binding to the KSHV terminal repeat (TR), and the recruitment of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) to viral TR. LANA oligomerization is required for a chromosome conformation DNA loop between TR and the LANA promoter implicated in LANA transcription autoregulation. LANA oligomerization is also required for formation of large nuclear bodies that colocalize with DAXX, EZH2, ORC2, but not PML. LANA nuclear bodies distribute along the nuclear periphery, and their arrangement is transmitted faithfully to daughter cells during mitotic cell division. Finally, we show that KSHV genomes containing mutations in the LANA oligomerization interface fail to maintain the complete viral genome, suggesting they are defective in DNA replication or repair. These findings reveal new mechanisms of LANA episome maintenance through formation of higher-order chromosome-conformations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Kaposi’s Sarcoma Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) is a human gammaherpesvirus responsible for Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS), Pleural Effusion Lymphoma (PEL), and multicentric Castleman’s Disease (mCD) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref002">2</xref>]). KSHV is a large double-stranded DNA virus that establishes life-long latent infection in B-lymphocytes and potentially other cell types, such as mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells. Most KSHV-associated cancers harbor latent viral genomes in the nucleus of tumor cells. The latent genomes form covalently closed circular genomes, termed episomes, that establish a local chromatin structure similar to that of cellular genomic DNA (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref005">5</xref>]). During latency, viral gene expression is restricted to a small set of viral genes. Viral DNA replication occurs coordinately with host cell division cycle utilizing host cellular DNA replication machinery.</p>
<p>Stable maintenance of the latent episome requires the regulated assembly of chromatin factors on the viral genome to enable selective expression of latent, but not lytic viral genes. Furthermore, the viral episome must replicate on average once per cell cycle and be transmitted faithfully to each daughter cell to maintain stable copy number in each daughter cell. The KSHV encoded Latency Associated Nuclear Antigen (LANA) is a multifunctional DNA binding protein that is essential for stable maintenance of KSHV episomes during latent infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref008">8</xref>]. The LANA DNA binding domain shares structural homology to the DNA binding domains of EBV EBNA1 and HPV E2 proteins ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref012">12</xref>] reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref013">13</xref>]). LANA binds directly to three recognition sites in the terminal repeats (TR) of the KSHV genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref009">9</xref>]. These sites represent a minimal origin of plasmid DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref014">14</xref>], and at least two or more TRs are required for episome maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref015">15</xref>]. LANA is required for the efficient recruitment of cellular replication initiation factors, such as the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) and the Mini Chromosome Maintenance (MCM) complex to the viral TR region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref017">17</xref>]. LANA binding to the TR is thought to influence the chromatin organization of the viral episome through recruitment of ORC and other chromatin-regulatory proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref019">19</xref>]. LANA can also interact with core histones H2A/H2B through its amino terminal domain that facilitates attachment of the virus genome to a metaphase chromosome and is essential for viral genome transmission during cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>LANA is also thought to influence the higher-order chromatin and chromosomal structure of the KSHV episome during latency. Fluorescent light microscopy reveals that LANA forms large aggregate structures, often termed LANA speckles, that colocalize with KSHV episomes in the nucleoplasm during interphase and with telomeric and centromeric regions of the metaphase chromosome in mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref025">25</xref>]. Some of these LANA structures were found to colocalize with heterochromatin-associated proteins, such as DAXX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref027">27</xref>] and the Polycomb-associated histone H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref028">28</xref>]. Super resolution imaging studies indicate that LANA coordinates a higher-ordered architecture at the TR of stable episomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref029">29</xref>]. Live cell imaging studies indicate that KSHV episomes can form large, multigenome clusters connected through LANA bivalent C-terminal DNA binding and N-terminal histone tethering activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref031">31</xref>]. The LANA DNA binding domain (DBD) by itself can form a variety of higher-order oligomeric structures, as determined by X-ray crystallography and biochemical methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref011">11</xref>]. Mutations in LANA that disrupt these higher order oligomers in vitro inhibited cooperative DNA binding and plasmid maintenance, but had no observable effect on DNA binding to single LANA binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref010">10</xref>]. It remains unclear whether molecular oligomerization of LANA DBD is directly associated with the higher order nuclear structures observed by microscopy methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we examine the role of the LANA DBD oligomerization interface in the assembly of these higher-order structures observed by fluorescence light-microscopy. In addition, we assessed if this process influences viral gene expression, chromosome conformation, and viral genome stability. Our data suggest that LANA DBD oligomerization provides the molecular basis for KSHV chromosome conformation and super-molecular nuclear bodies required for stable episome maintenance during latency.</p>

<title>LANA forms nuclear bodies that colocalize with DAXX and EZH2, but not PML</title>
<p>LANA has been shown to form multiple aggregate structures of various sizes in the nucleus of latently infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref025">25</xref>]. These structures have also been shown to colocalize with several other nuclear factors, including DAXX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref026">26</xref>] and EZH2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref028">28</xref>]. We confirmed these findings in BCBL1 pleural effusion lymphoma cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). To further investigate the formation and transmission of these LANA structures in living cells, we fused an amino-terminal RFP to the N-terminus of LANA in the infectious KSHV bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone BAC16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). We generated stable iSLK cell lines carrying latent KSHV BAC16 genomes that constitutively express RFP-LANA. RFP-LANA in iSLK cells formed similar nuclear body patterns as was observed for endogenous LANA in BCBL1 cells, including the colocalization with DAXX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) and EZH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). We also found that RFP-LANA partially colocalizes with H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), consistent with the role of EZH2 in histone methylation. While DAXX commonly colocalizes with the anti-viral protein PML and PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), we found that RFP-LANA did not colocalize with PML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). These findings indicate that RFP-LANA expressed from KSHV BAC16 in iSLK cells forms similar nuclear bodies to that observed in naturally occurring latently infected PEL cells, and that these LANA bodies are distinct from PML-NBs.</p>

<title>LANA nuclear bodies remain stable and organized through cell division</title>
<p>To investigate the stability and transmission of LANA nuclear bodies through the cell cycle, we used live cell confocal microscopy of RFP-LANA in stable iSLK cells carrying KSHV BAC16 expressing RFP-LANA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g002">Fig 2</xref>). During cell division, RFP-LANA bodies assemble on the metaphase plate and segregate with equal partitioning to daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Within 20 min after metaphase LANA clusters reorganized in a distribution pattern strikingly similar to the parent cell, typically forming a ring of partially connected bodies along the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). High resolution 3D reconstruction of the Z-stacked confocal images suggest that these nuclear bodies are heterogeneous in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Visualization of the division cycle from three different viewpoints revealed that the ring of LANA nuclear bodies undergoes an orthogonal re-orientation during telophase and the formation of two new rings in similar distribution and planar orientation as the parent cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, supplemental movies <bold>M1-2</bold>). Costaining of mitotic figures with α-tubulin and Dapi further demonstrated that LANA bodies partition coordinately with host chromosomes with typical colocalization at the periphery of condensed metaphase chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). These findings indicate that LANA forms highly organized nuclear structures that undergo a coordinated transmission process and stable morphology in recipient daughter cells.</p>

<title>LANA oligomerization interface is important for cooperative DNA binding to TR</title>
<p>Previous structural and molecular genetic studies have demonstrated that amino acids F1037 and F1041 form the oligomerization interface of the LANA DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref010">10</xref>]. Mutation of this oligomerization interface (F1037A/F1041A) had no effect on LANA DNA binding to a single LANA binding site (LBS), but were found to disrupt oligomerization and cooperative DNA binding <italic>in vitro</italic>, and inhibit LANA-dependent plasmid maintenance <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref010">10</xref>]. Now, we demonstrate that LANA oligomerization is necessary for functional binding to the TR <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). To this end, LANA DBD wild type (WT) or LANA DBD containing oligomerization interface mutations (F1037A/F1041A) (MT) were fused to the VP16 transcriptional activation domain and FLAG-tagged. We then assayed these for their ability to bind and activate transcription from a luciferase reporter plasmid with either a single LANA binding site (1xLBS) or three naturally occurring LBS (3xLBS) as found in the TR origin of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). We found that LANA DBD WT could activate transcription ~2 fold from 1xLBS and ~20 fold from 3xLBS reporter, while LANA DBD MT failed to activate 1xLBS and activated 3xLBS ~4 fold. This difference was more striking considering that LANA MT was expressed at higher levels than LANA WT, as detected by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). These findings indicate that LANA oligomerization interface contributes to the functional binding at the LBS in living cells and support the model that cooperative DNA binding is important for LANA function at the TR.</p>

<title>LANA oligomerization interface is required for LANA nuclear body formation</title>

We generated at least two independent iSLK cell lines for each bacmid. We observed a significant difference in the frequency and abundance of nuclear bodies. LANA MT formed more diffuse nuclear fluorescence patterns compared to LANA WT (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g004">4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007489.s001">S1A</xref>).

<title>LANA oligomerization mutants destabilize LANA binding and ORC recruitment to viral TR</title>
<p>To evaluate the potential effects of LANA oligomerization mutants on the KSHV epigenome, we assayed the interaction of several DNA-binding and chromatin regulatory factors with the KSHV episome by chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g005">Fig 5</xref>). We first investigated LANA binding and observed that oligomerization mutants were significantly impaired for their ability to bind to the KSHV TR (primer h) relative to LANA WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). This is consistent with the previous finding that mutant LANA is compromised for activating a TR-dependent reporter gene in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g003">Fig 3</xref>). ORC2, a factor known to be recruited to TR by LANA and functionally important for viral DNA replication and episome maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref016">16</xref>], was completely eliminated from TR in LANA MT relative to WT KSHV genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Consistent with ChIP, we found that ORC2 colocalized with LANA WT foci, but only formed diffuse patterns with LANA MT (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g005">5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007489.s003">S3</xref>). Histone H3K27me3 was found to be enriched at the lytic control region (regions a, c, d), but enrichment at this region was not significantly affected by LANA oligomerization mutants. On the other hand, intermediate levels of H3K27me3 found at the latency control region (primers e) were significantly reduced by LANA MT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The pattern of binding of CTCF, H3K4me3, and total H3 were similar to that reported for BCBL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref032">32</xref>], but this binding was not significantly affected by LANA oligomerization mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007489.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). RAD21 trended to be generally reduced throughout the KSHV genome in LANA MT relative to WT, although the levels of binding were relatively low throughout the genomes in iSLK cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007489.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). These findings indicate that LANA oligomerization mutants have defects in binding to the TR, recruiting ORC2 to the TR, and maintaining H3K27me3 at the latency control region.</p>

<p>To investigate potential mechanisms for LANA autoregulation, we used chromatin conformation capture (3C) to determine if the LANA binding at the TR may contact potential regulatory regions controlling the LANA transcript. We have previously observed a strong 3C DNA loop between the latency control and lytic control regions that was dependent on CTCF and cohesin subunit RAD21 in BCBL1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref033">33</xref>]. We found that this 3C interaction was weak in iSLK cells, but completely undetectable in genomes with LANA oligomerization mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007489.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). To determine if there were 3C interaction with the TR element and the LANA promoter, we positioned a 3C anchor primer adjacent to the BamHI site closest to the KSHV TR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). We then assayed whether this anchor primer could form any detectable loops with other regions of the KSHV genome. We found that the TR anchor formed a robust interaction with the region at 130471, which is situated ~3 kb upstream from the ORF73 transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Importantly, this TR-mediated interaction was significantly reduced by LANA oligomerization mutants MT1 or MT2 relative to LANA WT. These findings suggest that LANA oligomerization is important for a viral chromosome conformation that involves contacts between the TR and other regulatory regions.</p>

<title>LANA oligomerization is required for viral genome integrity</title>
<p>Since LANA oligomerization mutants have defects in long-term episome maintenance, we considered the possibility that mutant viral genomes may be genetically unstable. We therefore quantified by qPCR a series of viral genomic regions in total DNA isolated from iSLK clones carrying MT and WT LANA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g007">Fig 7</xref>). We identified a large region spanning from base pair 1 to 110,000 in the virus genome that had a significantly reduced copy number relative to bacmid hygromycin gene sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g007">Fig 7A and 7C</xref>). This region contains lytic control genes and duplicated lytic origins. We did not detect any consistent loss of copy number at the latency control region and TR proximal regions ranging from 126.5–137.3 kb of the viral genome. Importantly, we did not detect any copy number variation in the starting bacmid DNA for MT1 or MT2 relative to the WT bacmid used for generating iSLK stable cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Sequencing of these starting bacmids did not reveal any deletions or mutations other than the expected point mutations in the LANA DBD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007489.s016">S1 Data</xref>). PFGE analysis of these cells indicated that episomal genomes were maintained in all cell lines, but gross rearrangements relative to parental and WT genomes were observed with MT1 and MT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g007">Fig 7D and 7E</xref>). Similar genetic instability and viral phenotypes were observed in an independently derived pair of cell lines using a different pair of bacmid clones (WTgfp and MTgfp), indicating that these phenotypes are attributable to LANA oligomerization mutation followed by propagation in cell culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007489.s007">S7</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007489.s009">S9</xref> Figs). These findings suggest that LANA oligomerization mutants fail to maintain the integrity of the complete KSHV genome, with loss of DNA encompassing the lytic origins and lytic control regions after prolonged selection in cell culture.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Formation of complex, higher-ordered structures from simple repetitive units is a common theme in biological systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref034">34</xref>]. LANA is a multifunctional protein that binds cooperatively to three tandem recognition sites in a single viral TR. The viral TR is an ~850 bp element that is tandemly repeated as many as 35 times in some viral genomes. Multiple tandem copies of TR are required for LANA-dependent long-term stable episome maintenance of the complete viral genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref035">35</xref>]. How LANA builds higher-ordered functional structures from this repetitive binding block is not completely clear. Here, we provide evidence that the simple homo-oligomeric interactions of the LANA DBD drive formation of higher-order chromatin architecture and nuclear domain structures required for stable episome maintenance of KSHV genomes during persistent latent infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g008">Fig 8</xref>).</p>

<p>LANA can self-assemble as a variety of different oligomeric forms in X-ray crystallographic lattices, including decamers, pentamers, and spirals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref012">12</xref>]. LANA can also form continuous filamentous oligomers when bound to non-specific DNA in electron microscopy studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref009">9</xref>]. There is evidence that LANA can initiate additional DNA interactions through a basic patch on the back surface of the sequence-specific DNA binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref009">9</xref>]. LANA is also known to have an N-terminal nucleosome interaction domain important for tethering to metaphase chromosomes and essential for episome maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref020">20</xref>]. These multiple DNA and chromatin interactions by LANA contribute to its ability to form complex architectural structures. Previous studies have shown that mutations in the LANA oligomerization interface have no measurable effect on LANA-DNA binding to a single LBS, but did have defects in cooperative binding to larger DNA containing multiple LBS as found in native TR elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref010">10</xref>]. We now find that LANA oligomerization mutants are compromised for binding to KSHV TR in living cells. This suggests that oligomerization is required for stable binding to multiple LBS in the TR. LANA oligomerization and cooperative binding may be necessary to overcome the energetic barriers of DNA and nucleosome structures that prohibit monomeric LANA binding. Our data suggest that cooperative assembly and precise geometry of LANA oligomers at TR is critical for the formation of these higher order structures and their associated functions.</p>
<p>The KSHV genome can form complex DNA interactions, including a DNA loop between the latent and lytic control regions that are mediated by CTCF-cohesin interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref036">36</xref>]. We now report the identification of an additional 3C DNA loop between the TR and the region upstream of the LANA promoter. Supporting evidence for this interaction is provided by ChIP-Seq experiments showing a high affinity interaction with the TR and a secondary, lower affinity LANA interaction with the region upstream of LANA transcription start site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref038">38</xref>]. The TR anchored DNA loop was disrupted by mutations in the LANA oligomerization interface, suggesting that higher-order LANA oligomerization is required for loop formation. Since LANA oligomerization was also required for efficient TR binding as well as ORC2 and RAD21 recruitment, it is likely that these factors and others also contribute to the formation of a stable DNA conformation. The function of this LANA-dependent loop may be in the auto-regulation of the LANA transcript. We observed that the LANA/ORF73 transcript and protein were up-regulated in the presence of mutations that abrogate LANA oligomerization. We suspect that LANA DNA loop formation between TR and LANA transcriptional regulatory region plays a role in the auto-repression of LANA transcription. Similar autoregulation is observed for EBNA1 binding to its transcription initiation site at the Qp promoter in the EBV genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref040">40</xref>]. Transcriptional autoregulation has been implicated in the copy number control mechanisms for several plasmid systems, including the yeast 2 micron plasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref041">41</xref>], and may play an important role in regulating KSHV episome copy number and latency control.</p>
<p>Genomes containing mutant LANA failed to maintain genetic stability over time, with a loss of viral DNA from regions more distal to the TR and latency control region. One potential explanation for this loss of genomic DNA is that TR fails to recruit ORC and function efficiently as a replication origin. Inefficient origin firing could result in the incomplete replication of the viral genome over multiple cell divisions. We also observed that the boundary for genetic loss appears to coincide with the TR and the right lytic origin (KSHV genome coordinates ~1–110,000), suggesting that lytic origin activation may have destabilized this region of the genome. Although the mechanism for loss of genetic material is not completely understood, these findings underscore the crucial role of LANA oligomerization in maintaining viral genome integrity.</p>
<p>The super-molecular structures formed by LANA and KSHV episomes can be readily visualized by light microscopy as LANA nuclear bodies. Large LANA bodies were observed in a large percentage of cells carrying LANA WT, but to a much lesser extent in oligomerization defective LANA MT. This suggests that LANA oligomerization is the driving force for the formation of these higher order structures. These large structures form at much higher frequency in cells where KSHV episomes are stably maintained, suggesting that additional epigenetic or stochastic factors contribute to the formation of a stable LANA nuclear body. We observed a high colocalization of LANA nuclear bodies with DAXX. These bodies lacked PML, suggesting they are distinct from traditional PML-NBs. DAXX has been implicated in histone H3.3 chaperone activity and transcription repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref044">44</xref>], but may also play a role in macromolecular protein complex assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref045">45</xref>]. We suggest that the function of DAXX in these LANA nuclear bodies is to facilitate formation and stabilize these large multi-protein, nucleic acid complexes. We also observed partial colocalization with EZH2 and H3K27me3, consistent with other studies showing the importance of polycomb repression in maintaining KSHV latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref046">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref048">48</xref>]. We also observed that ORC2 colocalized with a large fraction of LANA bodies. Numerous other factors have been shown to colocalize with LANA, including γH2AX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref049">49</xref>], H3K9me3[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref050">50</xref>], KDM3A[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref051">51</xref>], RFC[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref052">52</xref>], NRF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref053">53</xref>], as well as DAXX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref054">54</xref>]. Whether these other factors contribute to the formation of LANA nuclear bodies is not known. LANA nuclear bodies are typically only observed when LANA is associated with viral genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref015">15</xref>]. Super-resolution microscopy of LANA interaction with 2xTR DNA revealed LANA can nucleate a hub at the TR with multiple interactions to host chromatin and bending of nucleosomal DNA consistent with activated chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref029">29</xref>]. Live cell imaging using fluorescently tagged episomes indicate that KSHV genomes form multicopy clusters, that tend to segregate to a single daughter cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref030">30</xref>]. Our live cell imaging of RFP-LANA in stable iSLK cells suggests that the LANA nuclear bodies form large clusters and is consistent with the observation that these clusters can interact dynamically. However, we observed that LANA nuclear bodies are transmitted faithfully to daughter cells and retain similar copy number and perinuclear distribution as observed in the parent cell. We propose that these various and heterogeneous super-molecular LANA bodies acquire an epigenetic memory allowing their stable transmission through mitotic cell division.</p>
<p>Super-molecular structures are observed in many complex biological processes, including transcription, replication, and viral assembly. Chemical phase-changes due to the cooperative interactions of multi-valent proteins are thought to be the driving force for the assembly of these super-molecular structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref055">55</xref>]. Our findings support the model that modest changes in the molecular geometry of KSHV LANA can have a profound effect on the macro-molecular structure and biological function of the KSHV episome, including phenotypes in transcription, replication, and super-structures important for genome integrity and transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007489.g008">Fig 8</xref>). We propose that stable protein oligomeric architecture drives higher-order structures important for viral chromosome architecture and episome maintenance.</p>

<title><italic>Gaussia</italic> Luciferase Assay</title>
<p>HEK293T cells were seeded at a density of ~200,000 cells/well in 12-well plates. The following day, the cells were transfected with a <italic>Gaussia</italic> luciferase reporter plasmid (containing a single LBS1 or LBS2-LBS1-LBS3) and a plasmid for expression of a fusion protein containing an N-terminal FLAG tag, the VP16 (activation domain), and the wild-type (wt) or mutant (F1037A, F1041A) LANA DNA-binding domain (DBD). An empty FLAG vector was used to ensure that the total amount of DNA per transfection was equal to 225 ng. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 at a ratio of 1:3 (mass of DNA per volume of transfection reagent) in antibiotic-free media. After 6 hours, the antibiotic-free media was replaced with media containing antibiotics. Approximately 18.5 hours later, luciferase measurements were made by transferring 40 μL of media and 10 μL of substrate (BioLux Gaussia Luciferase Assay Kit, New England Biolabs) to a 96-well plate and measuring luminescense with an Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer). Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer containing 1 mM PMSF and supernatants were run on a NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris Gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a Power Blotter nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen) using a Power Blotter (Invitrogen). The membrane was probed using anti-FLAG M2-Peroxidase antibody (1:10,000) (Sigma-Aldrich) or β-tubulin loading control antibody (1:4,000) (Fisher).</p>

<title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay</title>
<p>ChIP assays were performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref059">59</xref>]. Briefly, cells (~ 1 x 10<sup>7</sup>) were crosslinked in 1% formaldehyde with shaking for 15 min, quenched by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M, and lysed in 1 ml SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma-Aldrich). The lysates were sonicated with a Diagenode Bioruptor, cleared by centrifugation to remove insoluble materials, and diluted 10 fold into IP Buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2mM EDTA, 16.7mM Tris pH 8.1, 167mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, and protease inhibitors cocktail) for IP reaction at 4°C overnight. Each immune complex was washed five times (1 ml wash, 10 mins each) in ChIP related wash buffer at 4°C, eluted by addition of 150 μl Elution buffer (10mM Tris, pH 8.0, 5mM EDTA, and 1% SDS) at 65°C for 30 min, and the elutes were placed at 65°C for overnight to reverse cross-linking. The elutes was further treated with Proteinase K in a final concentration of 100 μg/ml at 50°C for 2 hrs, and ChIP DNA was purified by Quick PCR Purification Kit (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s instruction. ChIP DNA was assayed by qPCR using primers specific for indicated KSHV regions and quantified as % input.</p>

<title>Chromatin conformation capture (3C)</title>
<p>3C experiments were carried out as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007489.ref033">33</xref>], with minor modifications. PCR data were normalized to cellular actin. Briefly, 5×10<sup>6</sup> KSHV iSLK WT or MT cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, followed by the addition of glycine at the final concentration of 125 mM for 10 min at room temperature. Cellular pellets were washed once with cold PBS and resuspended in 250 μL of ice cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8; 10 mM NaCl; 0.2% Igepal CA630;1 × complete protease inhibitor; 11836145001 Roche) for 30 min with rotation at 4°C, centrifuged for 5 min at 2500 g at 4°C and then washed once with 500 μL of ice-cold lysis buffer. Resultant pellets were gently resuspended in 100 μL of 0.5% SDS and incubated at 65°C for 10 min. After addition of 50 μL of 10% Triton X-100 to quench the SDS and 290 μL of distilled water, samples were incubated at 37°C for 15 min, centrifuged for 5 min at 2500 g at 4°C and washed once with 500 μL of ice-cold lysis buffer. Pellets were resuspended in 200 μL of 1X restriction enzyme buffer and digested with 100 units of BamHI overnight at 37°C. To inactivate the restriction enzyme, the digested samples were incubated at 65°C for 20 min. The samples were ligated in 1 mL of ligation buffer (1X T4 ligase buffer, 1% Triton X-100, 8μg/mL BSA, 10000 CEU of T4 DNA ligase) at room temperature for 6 hours with slow rotation. Ligated samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 2500 g at 4°C, resuspended in 368 μL of lysis buffer and treated with 10 μl of 20 mg/ml Proteinase K, 20 μL of 10% SDS, 40 μL 5M sodium chloride at 65°C overnight to reverse cross-linking.
