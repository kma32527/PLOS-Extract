<abstract>
<p>EBV latent antigen 3C (EBNA3C) is essential for EBV-induced primary B-cell transformation. Infection by EBV induces hypermethylation of a number of tumor suppressor genes, which contributes to the development of human cancers. The Ras association domain family isoform 1A (RASSF1A) is a cellular tumor suppressor, which regulates a broad range of cellular functions, including apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, mitotic arrest, and migration. However, the expression of RASSF1A is lost in many human cancers by epigenetic silencing. In the present study, we showed that EBNA3C promoted B-cell transformation by specifically suppressing the expression of RASSF1A. EBNA3C directly interacted with RASSF1A and induced RASSF1A degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pathway. SCF<sup>Skp2</sup>, an E3-ubiquitin ligase, was recruited by EBNA3C to enhance RASSF1A degradation. Moreover, EBNA3C decreased the transcriptional activity of RASSF1A promoter by enhancing its methylation through EBNA3C-mediated modulation of DNMTs expression. EBNA3C also inhibited RASSF1A-mediated cell apoptosis, disrupted RASSF1A-mediated microtubule and chromosomal stability, and promoted cell proliferation by upregulating Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E expression. Our data provides new details, which sheds light on additional mechanisms by which EBNA3C can induce B-cell transformation. This will also facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches through targeting of the RASSF1A pathway.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) which is associated with multiple lymphoid and epithelial malignancies was the first recognized oncogenic virus in humans. EBNA3C, an essential latent antigen encoded by EBV interacts with numerous host transcription factors and plays an important role in the transformation of primary B-cells. RASSF1A, a tumor suppressor plays a vital role in regulating apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and mitotic arrest and is implicated in the development of a number of different cancers. We now demonstrate that EBNA3C can physically interact with RASSF1A and induce RASSF1A degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pathway. Further, the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF<sup>Skp2</sup> was recruited by EBNA3C to mediate RASSF1A degradation. Moreover, RASSF1A mRNA expression was also suppressed by EBNA3C. EBNA3C repressed the transcriptional activity of the RASSF1A promoter through induction of its methylation by enhancing DNMT3a expression. EBNA3C regulation of RASSF1A promoted cell proliferation, inhibited RASSF1A-mediated apoptosis and disrupted RASSF1A-mediated microtubule and chromosomal stability. Overall, our results add to our understanding of the many strategies employed by EBNA3C to induce B-cell transformation, which will contribute to new therapeutics for interventions targeting EBV association malignancies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a double-stranded DNA gammaherpesvirus, was the first recognized and one of the most common oncogenic viruses in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref001">1</xref>]. It contributes to multiple lymphoid and epithelial malignancies, including Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL), gastric cancer (GC), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), AIDS-associated B-cell lymphomas, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and pyothorax-associated lymphomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref004">4</xref>]. B-cell infection by EBV normally results in persistence and latent infection, typically categorized into three major types of latency programs according to different gene expression. During latency III program, commonly established in AIDS-associated B-cell lymphomas, a full set of latency-associated transcripts including nine latent genes along with several small noncoding RNAs and miRNAs are expressed. The latent proteins include six nuclear antigens (EBNA1, EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3B, EBNA3C, and EBNALP) and three viral membrane proteins (LMP1, LMP2A, and LMP2B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref006">6</xref>]. Genetic studies have demonstrated that EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3C, EBNA-LP, and LMP1 are indispensable for the establishment of latency and EBV-mediated transformation of primary B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>EBNA3C (EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 3C), is an important transcriptional regulator with a critical role in viral and cellular gene expression by interacting with numerous host transcription regulators and subsequently modulating their functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref013">13</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that a wide range of cellular factors, including but not limited to E2F6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref014">14</xref>], Bcl6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref015">15</xref>], RBP/CSL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref016">16</xref>], RBP-Jkappa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref019">19</xref>], HDAC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref020">20</xref>], KDM2B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref021">21</xref>], p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref022">22</xref>], IRF-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref023">23</xref>], and Mdm2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref025">25</xref>] interact with EBNA3C. These interactions disrupt the normal functions of these cellular factors and can drive oncogenic activities. In addition to its transcriptional functions, EBNA3C is also involved in cell-cycle regulation by disrupting multiple cell cycle checkpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref026">26</xref>] and interacting with Cyclin proteins, including Cyclin D1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref027">27</xref>], Cyclin D2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref028">28</xref>], and Cyclin A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref029">29</xref>]. Furthermore, EBNA3C is also important in chromatin reprogramming by recruiting the modifying enzymes histone acetylases and deacetylases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref031">31</xref>]. Along with EBNA3A, EBNA3C can also repress several tumor suppressor genes, including p16<sup>INK4a</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref007">7</xref>], p14<sup>ARF</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref007">7</xref>], BCL2L11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref032">32</xref>] and Bim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref033">33</xref>] through enhancing H3K27me3 modification at the respective promoter regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>EBV infection of human cells is associated with tumor development, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and gastric cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref036">36</xref>]. Hypo- or hypermethylation-mediated tumor suppressor gene silencing, or oncogene activation, widely contributes to the development many of these human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref037">37</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrated that EBV infection can induce extensive DNA methylation to regulate expression of multiple tumor suppressor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref038">38</xref>]. Previous data from our lab and other groups had identified a number of tumor suppressor genes whose expression were modulated in EBV infected cells by DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref039">39</xref>]. The Ras association domain family isoform 1A (RASSF1A) is one of these candidates. RASSF1A, a known tumor suppressor gene, plays an essential role in a range of cellular processes by modulating multiple apoptotic and cell cycle checkpoint pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>RASSF1A localizes with microtubules and promotes their stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref043">43</xref>]. The dynamics of microtubule is affected by directly binding to microtubule-binding protein including Cdc20, to regulate cell migration and mitotic progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref045">45</xref>]. RASSF1A binds to the transcription factor, p120<sup>E4F</sup> and inhibits the transcription of Cyclin A2, inducing cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref046">46</xref>]. In addition, RASSF1A also induces G1 arrest by inhibiting the expression levels of Cyclin D1 via the JNK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref047">47</xref>]. RASSF1A has also been implicated in the modulation of apoptosis by interacting with multiple pro-apoptotic related proteins, such as MST1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref048">48</xref>], CNK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref049">49</xref>], MOAP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref050">50</xref>], and Salvador [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref051">51</xref>].</p>
<p>Although RASSF1A plays a pivotal role in normal growth control, its expression is lost in many human cancers by promoter hypermethylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref040">40</xref>]. Epigenetic studies with EBV-associated cancers show that EBV infection can be recognized as an epigenetic driver of tumorigenesis due to its ability to induce aberrant promoter methylation of a large number of tumor suppressor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref038">38</xref>]. During latent infection of EBV, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes methylate the EBV genome to repress expression of viral genes. The induced DNA methyltransferases can also suppress cancer-related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref052">52</xref>]. Three DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B catalyze methylation of DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref052">52</xref>]. It was reported that the activity of DNMT1 was increased in EBV-associated gastric cancer and in NPC cell lines, LMP1 up-regulates the expression of these three DNMTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref053">53</xref>]. Furthermore, LMP1 was shown to decrease the expression of RASSF1A by activating intracellular signaling of NF-κB and suppressing the transcriptional activity of the RASSF1A promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref054">54</xref>]. LMP2A, another EBV-encoded latent nuclear membrane protein, was also shown to upregulate DNMT1 expression and to enhance methylation of the PTEN promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref055">55</xref>]. Previous studies in our lab showed that EBNA3C not only upregulated the expression of DNMT1 but also interacted with DNMT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref056">56</xref>]. However, whether EBNA3C or another latent nuclear protein encoded by EBV inhibits expression, and associated functions of RASSF1A by increasing DNMT1 level remains unclear.</p>
<p>Ubiquitin-mediated degradation also plays an important role in RASSF1A regulation. Skp2, a component of the SCF<sup>Skp2</sup> complex, interacted with RASSF1A and enhanced the ubiquitination of RASSF1A, therefore promoting its degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref057">57</xref>]. Interestingly, data from our lab also demonstrated that EBNA3C could enhance degradation of two tumor suppressor proteins pRb and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> by directly interacting with Skp2 and other SCF components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref058">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref059">59</xref>]. RASSF1A has been implicated in the regulation of the p53–Mdm2 pathway by binding to Mdm2 and Daxx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref060">60</xref>]. The association of Mdm2, DAXX, and the deubiquitinase, HAUSP enhances the self-ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2, which blocks the degradation of p53 in response to DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref060">60</xref>]. Conversely, p53 also inactivated RASSF1A by binding to its promoter and recruiting Daxx and DNMT1 for DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref061">61</xref>]. Evidence to date has demonstrated that EBNA3C could interact with Mdm2 and p53 simultaneously to form a stable complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref062">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref063">63</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we explored the mechanism by which EBV regulates RASSF1A expression and its function. We investigated the role of EBNA3C in modulating RASSF1A expression in B-cells, and further explored the methylation status of its promoter. Our study now provides a more comprehensive understanding of the EBNA3C-mediated regulation of cellular functions through its regulation of RASSF1A, and facilitates additional therapeutic avenues to target EBV-associated cancers.</p>

<title>EBNA3C expression leads to a reduction in RASSF1A protein levels in human cells</title>
<p>Previous data demonstrated that EBV infection in nascent B-lymphocytes alters methylation status of RASSF1A promoter region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref039">39</xref>]. To test whether EBV infection regulates RASSF1A expression, the protein level of RASSF1A was determined in multiple EBV-negative and positive cell lines by western blot assays. We show that RASSF1A protein levels were dramatically decreased in EBV-positive BL41-B95.8, Akata-EBV, Mutu III and Sav III cells when compared with the matching isogenic EBV-negative BL41, Akata, Mutu I and Sav I cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Densitometric analyses showed a drop in greater than 5-fold as seen in the EBV positive cells and type III latency cells Mutu III and Sav III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). These results suggested that EBV infection inhibits the expression of RASSF1A in these human Burkitt’s cell lines. Additionally, the type I latency cells Mutu I and Sav I did not show a reduction in RASSF1A suggesting that this may be due to a latent antigen expressed in the latency III program.</p>

<p>To examine whether the reduction of RASSF1A expression was mediated by EBNA3C, one of the major viral oncoproteins in latency III program, western blot analysis was performed in EBNA3C expressing stable BJAB7 and BJAB10, and EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid LCL1 and LCL2 cell lines. The results clearly showed that EBNA3C can strongly suppress the expression of RASSF1A by approximately 70% or greater based on the western blot signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, to determine whether RASSF1A expression was specifically regulated by EBNA3C, a dose-dependent increase of EBNA3C was transfected with a constant amount of RASSF1A in three different cell lines—Saos2 (p53<sup>-/-</sup>), HEK293 (p53 is functionally challenged due to adenovirus E1A expression) and BJAB (mutant p53) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g001">Fig 1E–1G</xref>). The corresponding western blot data demonstrated that EBNA3C expression caused a dose-dependent decrease in RASSF1A protein levels in all three cell lines, irrespective of p53 expression and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g001">Fig 1E–1G</xref>). To further demonstrate a role for EBNA3C in regulating RASSF1A expression, EBNA3C was knocked-down by expressing a specific EBNA3C short hairpin RNA (sh-E3C) in both EBNA3C stably expressing BJAB cells (BJAB10) and EBV transformed LCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g001">Fig 1G and 1H</xref>). Compared to the control lines (sh-Ctrl), RASSF1A expression was significantly rescued in sh-E3C expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g001">Fig 1G and 1H</xref>). Taken together, these results strongly support a role for EBNA3C in suppressing RASSF1A expression.</p>

<title>EBNA3C associates with RASSF1A in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells</title>
<p>EBNA3C mediated suppression of RASSF1A expression prompted us to investigate whether these two proteins can associate with each other as a complex in cells. To this end, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed in different cell types to determine whether EBNA3C can form a complex with RASSF1A. Flag-tagged EBNA3C and Myc-tagged RASSF1A were co-expressed in Saos-2 cells. The Co-IP assays were carried out by using anti-Myc antibody and Flag antibody, separately.

<title>The amino terminus of EBNA3C and carboxy terminus of RASSF1A are important for the association between EBNA3C and RASSF1A</title>
<p>To map the specific region(s) of EBNA3C important for interaction with RASSF1A, Flag-tagged full length EBNA3C and three domains (1-365aa, 366-620aa and 621-920aa) were expressed in Saos-2 cells. Results from our Co-IP assays indicated that the residues 1–620 of EBNA3C were important for the interaction with RASSF1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Although domains which include the activation and other functional motifs showed lesser interaction, the predominant region with greater interaction was residues 1–365. However, the 366–620 residues also showed about 50% of the observed signal compared to the 1–365 amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).

<title>RASSF1A was translocated and co-localized with EBNA3C in nuclear compartments in EBV transformed LCLs</title>
<p>Since we demonstrated that EBNA3C specifically associated with RASSF1A in cells, immunofluorescence assays were performed to examine the subcellular localization of these two proteins. Flag-tagged EBNA3C was transfected alone or co-transfected with Myc-tagged full-length RASSF1A or RASSF1A-ΔRA in Saos-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Specific antibodies against EBNA3C and the Myc-epitope were used in the immunofluorescence analyses. Our results showed that the localization of RASSF1A was predominantly in the cytoplasm when it was transfected alone. However, in the presence of EBNA3C, RASSF1A signals co-localized with EBNA3C in punctate dots in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

To test whether EBNA3C-mediated RASSF1A down-regulation was due to modulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery, a stability assay was performed by expressing RASSF1A with or without EBNA3C in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). Saos-2 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged RASSF1A and Flag-tagged EBNA3C or Flag-tagged empty vector. 24 hours post-transfection, the transfected cells were treated with CHX and the expression of RASSF1A was detected by western blot at 0, 4, 8, 12 hours. The results demonstrated that RASSF1A expression levels were markedly reduced in the presence of EBNA3C. Whereas, RASSF1A was more stable in the absence of EBNA3C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). To further validate this observation, we extended the stability assays to EBNA3C negative BJAB and EBNA3C stably expressing BJAB10 cells. BJAB and BJAB10 cells were incubated with CHX for 0, 2, 4, 6 hours. The endogenous RASSF1A was monitored by western blot assays. As expected, our results showed that RASSF1A protein levels were significantly reduced in BJAB10 cells by 6 hours with the treatment of cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).</p>

<p>A-B) EBNA3C decreased RASSF1A stability. (A) 10 million Saos-2 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged RASSF1A and Flag-tagged vector or Flag-tagged EBNA3C. 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 40 μg/ml Cycloheximide. (B) 10 million BJAB and BJAB10 cells were treated with 40 μg/ml Cycloheximide. At the indicated time points, the cells were harvested and lysed for western blot. The relative density (RD) of RASSF1A was quantitated to measure RASSF1A rate of degradation. (C-D) EBNA3C decreased RASSF1A stability. C) 10 million Saos-2 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged RASSF1A alone or together with Flag-tagged vector or Flag-tagged EBNA3C. 24 h post-transfection, cells were incubated with 20 μM MG132 for another 16 hours. D) 10 million BJAB and BJAB10 cells were incubated with 20 μM MG132 for 16 hours. Then cells were harvested and RASSF1A expression was detected by western blot. (E) EBNA3C enhanced RASSF1A poly-ubiquitination. 10 million Saos-2 cells were transfected with the indicated constructs. 24 h post-transfection, cells were incubated with 20 μM MG132 for another 16 hours. Then the cells were harvested and subjected to immunoprecipitation using an antibody against Myc. The inputs and immunoprecipitated samples were detected by western blot. (F) Skp2 protein was recruited by EBNA3C to mediate RASSF1A degradation. GFP-tagged RASSF1A was co-transfected with plasmids encoding EBNA3C and/or Skp2 or Skp2 truncated mutant. 24 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and lysed for western blot. The expression of RASSF1A, EBNA3C, and Skp2 was detected with specific antibodies. (G) The effect of sh-Skp2 in reducing Skp2 expression was detected in Saos-2 cells. Myc-tagged Skp2 and sh-Ctrl, or sh-Skp2 were transfected into Saos-2 cells. 48 hours post-transfection, the cells were harvested and the expression of Skp2 was detected by western blot. (H-J) Silencing Skp2 rescued RASSF1A protein expression. Skp2 knocked down BJAB H), BJAB10 I), and LCL1 cells J) were constructed by lentiviruses and selected by puromycin. 3 days later, the cells were harvested and lysed for western blot analyses. The expression levels of RASSF1A, EBNA3C, Skp2, and GAPDH were detected. The relative density (RD) of RASSF1A was quantitated and shown.</p>

<p>Previous studies showed that RASSF1A protein was degraded via the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref057">57</xref>]. Therefore, it was expected that the increased instability of RASSF1A was likely due to the effects of EBNA3C-related ubiquitin-proteasome machinery as EBNA3C is able to recruit E3 ligases to degrade targeted cellular substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref066">66</xref>]. To test this possibility, Myc-tagged RASSF1A was transfected with Flag-tagged EBNA3C or empty vector in Saos-2 cells. 24 hours post-transfection, the cells were incubated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or DMSO for 16 hours. The results showed a substantial accumulation of RASSF1A protein in MG132 treated cells, even in the presence of EBNA3C, compared with that seen in mock treated and control vector groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). To further corroborate our results, we treated BJAB and BJAB10 cells with MG132 for 16 hours. Similar results were observed in MG132 treated B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the instability of RASSF1A was regulated by EBNA3C in association with the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.</p>
<p>Next, we performed in vivo poly-ubiquitination assays to further investigate the role of EBNA3C in regulating RASSF1A poly-ubiquitination. Saos-2 cells were co-transfected with Myc-tagged RASSF1A, HA-tagged Ubiquitin, with or without Flag-tagged EBNA3C. 24 hours later, the cells were treated with MG132 for another 16 hours. Specific antibody against the Myc-epitope was used in the following immunoprecipitation analysis. Enhanced poly-ubiquitination levels of RASSF1A were observed in the presence of EBNA3C when compared with that in RASSF1A and control vector or the HA-tagged Ubiquitin co-expressed group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). This result further corroborated the above results and strongly suggested that RASSF1A was degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway mediated by EBNA3C.</p>

<title>EBNA3C recruits Skp2 to enhance RASSF1A degradation</title>
<p>Earlier studies have shown that Skp2, a critical E3 ubiquitin ligase, was associated with RASSF1A and promoted RASSF1A ubiquitination and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref057">57</xref>]. Moreover, previous studies showed that Skp2 directly interacted with EBNA3C and facilitated the degradation of p27, E2F, c-Myc and the retinoblastoma protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref058">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref067">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref068">68</xref>]. These studies prompted us to test the possible role of Skp2 in EBNA3C-enhanced RASSF1A degradation. Wild-type Skp2 and the functional deficient mutant, Skp2 lacking the so-called F box domain, were co-expressed with EBNA3C and RASSF1A, separately. The following western blot results showed that when RASSF1A were co-expressed with EBNA3C, the protein levels were substantially reduced close to about 60% compared with RASSF1A expressed alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Skp2 and Skp2(ΔF-box) also decreased the expression of RASSF1A, but less dramatically. These results indicated that Skp2 has a limited role in regulating RASSF1A expression when Skp2 was expressed with RASSF1A alone. However, when RASSF1A was co-expressed with EBNA3C and Skp2, the protein levels of RASSF1A decreased sharply close to approximately 35%, while the RASSF1A protein levels were not changed and even slightly increased when it was co-expressed with EBNA3C and Skp2(ΔF-box) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). The protein levels of Skp2 also decreased when it was co-expressed with RASSF1A and EBNA3C, but no obvious change in protein levels was observed for the Skp2 (ΔF-box) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). To further examine the role of Skp2 in modulating RASSF1A protein expression, an sh-RNA targeted Skp2 was constructed and the effect of sh-Skp2 was tested in Saos-2 cells by co-transfecting Myc-tagged Skp2 with sh-Skp2. The expression of Myc-tagged Skp2 was dramatically decreased in sh-Skp2 transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). Then the effect of Skp2 on RASSF1A protein expression was determined in BJAB, BJAB10, and LCL1 cell lines. The results showed that silencing Skp2 in BJAB cells led to an increase in RASSF1A expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g005">Fig 5H</xref>). Furthermore, in BJAB10 and LCL1cells, knocking down Skp2 significantly increased RASSF1A expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g005">Fig 5I and 5J</xref>). This suggested that Skp2 played an important role in EBNA3C-associated RASSF1A downregulation. These results demonstrated that EBNA3C can enhance Skp2 mediated RASSF1A degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway.</p>

<title>EBNA3C suppresses RASSF1A mRNA expression by enhancing methylation of its promoter</title>
<p>Numerous studies have shown that a large number of tumor suppressor genes have been epigenetically modified in EBV infected cells, which resulted in a reduction in their mRNA expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref037">37</xref>]. To further determine whether EBNA3C regulates RASSF1A mRNA expression, endogenous RASSF1A mRNA expression was monitored by real-time PCR in EBV negative and positive cells. The results showed that RASSF1A mRNA expression was down-regulated approximately 2-fold in EBV positive cell lines when compared with EBV negative cell lines as well as type I and III latency cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). We further extended the real-time PCR assay in BJAB, BJAB7, BJAB10, LCL1, and LCL2. As anticipated, mRNA expression of RASSF1A was decreased significantly in EBNA3C stably expressing BJAB7, BJAB10 cells, and EBV-transformed LCL1 and LCL2 when compared with that in BJAB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>). To further exploit the role of EBNA3C in repressing RASSF1A mRNA expression, real-time PCR assays were performed in EBNA3C stably knocked down LCL1 cells and sh-EBNA3C transfected BJAB 10 cells. The results showed that RASSF1A mRNA expression was dramatically upregulated in EBNA3C knocked-down cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>). These results demonstrated that EBNA3C can suppress RASSF1A mRNA expression.</p>

<title>EBNA3C down-regulated RASSF1A mRNA expression by enhancing RASSF1A promoter methylation.</title>
<p>(A-D) RASSF1A mRNA expression was decreased in A-B) EBV positive cell lines and C-D) BJAB7, BJAB10, LCL1, and LCL2 cells. 5 million B-cells were collected and total RNA extracted via Trizol reagent. cDNAs were generated by reverse transcriptase kit and RASSF1A mRNA expression level was detected by real-time PCR. The mRNA expression of GAPDH was set as a control. Each sample was determined in triplicate. (E-F) Knock-down EBNA3C rescued RASSF1A mRNA expression. The mRNA expression of RASSF1A in EBNA3C knock-downed LCL1 cell lines or in sh-EBNA3C transfected BJAB10 cells was determined as described for A-D. (G-H) EBNA3C decreased the transcriptional activity of the RASSF1A promoter. 0.5 million Saos-2 and 293 cells were transfected with pGL4.2-R1A-promoter, pRL-TK and an increasing amount of Flag-tagged EBNA3C. Total amounts of plasmids were kept constant by co-transfecting with the vector. 36 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and lysed for dual-luciferase reporter assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the expression of Flag-tagged EBNA3C was detected by western blot. All assays were repeated at least three times for reproducibility. (I) The methylation levels of the RASSF1A promoter was specifically increased in BJAB7, BJAB10, LCL1, and LCL2 cells. 5 million BJAB, BJAB7, BJAB10, LCL1, and LCL2 cells were harvested and genomic DNA was extracted as described in materials and methods. 1 μg genomic DNA was used for bisulfite conversion and purification via the EZ DNA Methylation Gold Kit. 100 ng and 50 ng bisulfite-modified DNA was used in 15 μl methylation-specific PCR (MSP) reaction to amplify methylated (M) and unmethylated (U) DNA fragments. The relative density of methylated (M) and unmethylated (U) DNA fragments was measured using Image J software. The ratio of methylated (M) DNA fragments to unmethylated (U) DNA fragments of RASSF1A or c-Myc promoter in BJAB cells was set as the basic level separately. The methylation ratio was calculated by comparing the ratio of methylated (M) DNA fragments to unmethylated (U) DNA fragments of RASSF1A or c-Myc promoter in BJAB7, BJAB10, LCL1 and LCL2 cells to that in BJAB cells. Mean values and standard deviation of two independent experiment were presented. (J-K) Knockdown of EBNA3C decreased the methylation level of RASSF1A promoter. The methylation ratio of the RASSF1A and c-Myc promoter in LCL1-sh-EBN3C and sh-EBNA3C transfected BJAB10 cells were determined as described above. (L-N) RASSF1A mRNA, protein expression levels and methylation status were specifically increased in DAC-treated B cells. 5 million BJAB, BJAB7, BJAB10, LCL1, and LCL2 cells were treated with 5 μM DAC and the medium were refreshed every day. 5 days later, the cells were harvested and aliquoted into three fractions. The mRNA L) and protein M) expression levels of RASSF1A in DAC-treated B cells were detected by real-time PCR and western blot. The mRNA expression level of c-Myc and protein expression level of EBNA3C were determined simultaneously. N) The methylation status of RASSF1A and c-Myc were detected by methylation specific PCR.</p>

<p>To further define how EBNA3C represses RASSF1A mRNA expression, a dual-luciferase assay was performed to detect the transcriptional activity at the RASSF1A promoter in the presence of EBNA3C. The reporter, pGL4.2-RASSF1A-promoter (-629 to 1) was generated and tested. The RASSF1A-promoter reporter and thymidine kinase promoter-Renilla luciferase reporter were transfected into Saos-2 and 293 cells with a dose-dependent increase in Flag-tagged EBNA3C. The results of the luciferase assay suggested that EBNA3C inhibited RASSF1A promoter transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g006">Fig 6G and 6H</xref>).</p>
<p>In a variety of human cancers, RASSF1A was inactivated by epigenetic silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref040">40</xref>]. In the context of cancer progression, hypermethylation of CpG islands is one of the most common epigenetic modifications, which occurs at the RASSF1A promoter and results in the loss of RASSF1A transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref039">39</xref>]. To further explore the mechanism by which EBNA3C inhibited RASSF1A promoter activity, methylation specific PCR assays were performed to detect the methylation status of the RASSF1A promoter by using two different pairs of primers. The c-Myc gene, whose promoter was reported to be hypomethylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref069">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref070">70</xref>] was used as a negative control and the methylation status of its promoter was detected simultaneously. The results showed that the methylated ratio of the RASSF1A promoter was increased not only in EBNA3C stably expressing BJAB7 and BJAB10 cells but also in EBV transformed LCL1 and LCL2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g006">Fig 6I</xref>). No significant change was detected in the c-Myc promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g006">Fig 6I</xref>). EBNA3C was reported to interact with c-Myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref071">71</xref>], but it did not increase its methylation levels. These results suggested EBNA3C selectively induced methylation of the RASSF1A promoter. To provide additional evidence that the enhanced methylation status was related to the presence of EBNA3C, RASSF1A promoter methylation levels were determined in EBNA3C stably knocked-down LCL1 cells and sh-EBNA3C transfected BJAB 10 cells. The methylated ratio of the RASSF1A promoter was decreased in EBNA3C knocked down cells compared with the cells transfected with sh-control. However, no obvious change was observed in the c-Myc promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g006">Fig 6J and 6K</xref>).</p>
<p>5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (DAC), a DNA methylation inhibitor reported to lead to demethylation of the 5’CpG island of RASSF1A and re-expression of its transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref072">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref074">74</xref>] was used in our experiments to test whether DAC could relieve the repression of EBNA3C and rescue RASSF1A expression in EBNA3C and EBV positive cell lines. 5 million BJAB, BJAB7, BJAB, LCL1, and LCL2 cells were treated with 5 μM DAC for 5 days. The mRNA and protein expression levels of RASSF1A, and the methylation status of the RASSF1A and c-Myc promoters was examined. The mRNA and protein expression levels of RASSF1A were increased dramatically in DAC-treated EBNA3C and EBV positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g006">Fig 6L and 6M</xref>). However, no significant change was observed in c-Myc mRNA expression levels in any of the 5 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g006">Fig 6L</xref>). Methylation specific PCR was performed in DAC-treated B cells to determine the methylation status of the RASSF1A and c-Myc promoter. As expected, the methylation status of the RASSF1A promoter was increased, but there was no obvious change in the c-Myc promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g006">Fig 6N</xref>). These results further demonstrated that EBNA3C specifically down-regulated RASSF1A mRNA expression by enhancing methylation of its promoter.</p>

<title>EBNA3C enhances RASSF1A promoter methylation by modulating expression of DNMTs</title>
<p>Previous data from our lab have shown that EBNA3C could interact with DNMT1 and induce DNMT1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref056">56</xref>]. Earlier studies also showed that silencing DNMT1 could upregulate RASSF1A expression and suppress RASSF1A methylation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref075">75</xref>]. Further, DNMT1 and other DNMTs are involved in maintaining the overall methylation density in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref076">76</xref>]. We detected the expression of endogenous DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b in EBNA3C stably expressing BJAB7 and BJAB10 cells and EBV- transformed LCL1 and LCL2 cells. Western blot results showed that EBNA3C can also increase DNMT1 expression in EBNA3C stably expression BJAB7 and BJAB10 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). However, in the context of EBV positive cell lines, DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression levels were decreased in LCL1, LCL2, and BL41-B95.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g007">Fig 7A, 7B and 7C</xref>).

<p>RASSF1A was shown to play a role in cell apoptosis by interacting with a variety of cellular proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref049">49</xref>]. To evaluate the effect of EBNA3C on RASSF1A-mediated cell apoptosis, Saos-2 cells were transfected with Flag-tagged EBNA3C and Myc-tagged RASSF1A. The expression of the apoptotic pathway related proteins was determined by western blot. First, the expression of PARP-1(Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1), involved in DNA damage repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref078">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref079">79</xref>] was analyzed.

EBNA3C may protect PARP-1 from cleavage, and rescued the expression of PARP-1 when co-expressed with RASSF1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). It was reported that inactivation of PARP-1 was cleaved by activated caspase-1, caspase 3 or caspase 7. Full-length caspase proteins and their cleaved products were also monitored by western blot. Band intensities were quantified and relative density ratios of the cleaved products to total caspase proteins were determined. The cleavages of caspase 3 and caspase 7 did not show a significant change in RASSF1A expressed cells compared to other groups. However, activated caspase-1 was increased dramatically in RASSF1A expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g008">Fig 8A</xref>).

<p>To further define the effect of caspase-1 on RASSF1A-mediated cell apoptosis, a short hairpin RNA targeted caspase-1 (sh-CASP1) was constructed. sh-CASP1 effectively decreased caspase-1 and caspase-1 cleaved product expression in Saos-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). The effects of EBNA3C and RASSF1A on PARP-1 expression and cleavages of caspase proteins were monitored in caspase-1 knocked-down Saos-2 cells. Silencing caspase-1 significantly increased PARP-1 expression. However, EBNA3C failed to significantly increase PARP-1 expression when compared with control in caspase-1 knocked-down Saos-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). RASSF1A slightly decreased PARP-1 expression when compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). To our surprise, the cleavage of caspase-3 and caspase-7 were increased in RASSF1A expressed cells when caspase-1 was knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). These results suggested that caspase-1 played an important role in RASSF1A-mediated cell apoptosis. However, when caspase-1 was knocked down, RASSF1A may induce the cleavage of caspase-3 and caspase-7 to regulate cell apoptosis.</p>
<p>Next, we examined cell proliferation in EBNA3C and RASSF1A expressing cells. Saos-2 and 293 cells were transfected along with the control vector, RASSF1A, RASSF1A-E4F1 alone or together with EBNA3C and selected with G418 for colony formation. The results showed that a sharp decrease in colony number was seen in RASSF1A transfected Saos-2 cells when compared with mock transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). EBNA3C rescued the reduction in colony formation when it was co-expressed with RASSF1A. However, no obvious difference was observed between mock transfected cells and RASSF1A-E4F1 transfected cells. EBNA3C moderately increased the colony formation when co-expressed with RASSF1A-E4F1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). To further corroborate our results, cell proliferation assays were performed in Saos-2 cells and the cell numbers were counted. Consistent with our colony formation results, EBNA3C rescued RASSF1A-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). We also repeated these experiments in 293 cells and similar results were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g009">Fig 9C and 9D</xref>). The following CFSE assays were performed to detect cell proliferation in RASSF1A, RASSF1A-E4F1, and EBNA3C transfected Saos-2 cells. The results demonstrated that RASSF1A but not the RASSF1A-E4F1 mutant inhibited cell proliferation and that EBNA3C could promote cell proliferation by inhibiting RASSF1A activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g009">Fig 9E</xref>).</p>

<title>EBNA3C disrupted RASSF1A-mediated microtubule stability and induced chromosomal instability</title>
<p>RASSF1A was reported to co-localize and promote the stabilization of microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref040">40</xref>]. The interaction between RASSF1A and microtubule plays a critical role in genomic stability and mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref084">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref085">85</xref>]. Since we demonstrated EBNA3C negatively regulated RASSF1A expression, it is likely that it would have an effect on microtubule stability. Immunofluorescence assays were performed to monitor microtubule stability using the inhibitor, nocodazole in treated or untreated Saos-2 cells. When GFP-tagged RASSF1A was expressed with EBNA3C, RASSF1A co-localized with discrete, punctate EBNA3C signals in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g012">Fig 12A</xref>). Next, we set out to detect the effects of EBNA3C on RASSF1A stabilized microtubules. In the absence of nocodazole, RASSF1A co-localized with filamentous microtubules when RASSF1A was expressed alone. In EBNA3C and RASSF1A co-expressed cells, a fraction of the RASSF1A signals were translocated into the nucleus and formed discrete, punctate structures similar to those observed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g012">Fig 12B</xref>). Interestingly, there was no obvious co-localization of RASSF1A and microtubules visualized in the nucleus even if some RASSF1A signal co-localized with microtubules in the cytoplasm. Importantly, when cells were treated with nocodazole, the negative control, GFP could not protect microtubules from depolymerization, and unorganized microtubules could be observed in the whole cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g012">Fig 12B</xref>). However, in RASSF1A expressed cells, organized filamentous microtubules still co-localized with RASSF1A in the cytoplasm even when the cells were treated with nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g012">Fig 12B</xref>). This suggests that RASSF1A can play a role in enhancing microtubule stability. Furthermore, when RASSF1A was co-expressed with EBNA3C in nocodazole-treated cells, some discrete, punctate signals of RASSF1A was seen in the nucleus as expected. However, the organized filamentous microtubules were destroyed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g012">Fig 12B</xref>). These results suggested that EBNA3C can destabilize RASSF1A-related microtubule stabilization.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>RASSF1A is a member of a family of tumor suppressors. It lacks any obvious enzymatic activity, but it regulates multiple biological processes by directly interacting with many cellular proteins, including p120<sup>E4F</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref046">46</xref>], Cdc20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref086">86</xref>], MST1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref048">48</xref>], and MAP1B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref084">84</xref>]. Although RASSF1A serves as a scaffold protein for many signaling complexes, its level was reduced by promoter hypermethylation in a wide variety of human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref040">40</xref>]. RASSF1A promoter methylation has been seen in many EBV-related diseases, such as gastric cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and Hodgkin Lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref087">87</xref>]. The high inactivation frequency of RASSF1A in EBV related tumors suggests that it plays a pivotal role in EBV-related tumor development. However, the underlying mechanism of RASSF1A inactivation has not been fully explored. LMP1 was reported to regulate the expression of RASSF1A and to inhibit its transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref054">54</xref>]. Numerous studies had demonstrated that down-regulation of RASSF1A is strongly associated with promoter hypermethylation in EBV associated cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref061">61</xref>]. Conflicting results were obtained with LMP1 in regulating DNMTs expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref077">77</xref>]. LMP2A and EBNA3C were also shown to induce DNMT1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref055">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref056">56</xref>]. However, the details as to the mechanism of RASSF1A inhibition is still not fully understood. Our results clearly demonstrated that EBNA3C specifically downregulated RASSF1A expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007514.g013">Fig 13</xref>).</p>

<p>EBAN3C directly interacts with RASSF1A and induces RASSF1A degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. EBNA3C decreases RASSF1A promoter transcriptional activity by enhancing its methylation level, which is regulated by EBNA3C-induced DNMTs expression levels. EBNA3C inhibits RASSF1A-mediated cell apoptosis, disrupts RASSF1A-mediated microtubule and chromosomal stability and promotes cellular proliferation by upregulating Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E expression.</p>

</fig>
<p>Our data showed that EBNA3C specifically interacted with RASSF1A and suppressed RASSF1A expression through the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation pathway. Previous studies in our lab showed that EBNA3C could interact with several E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases, including SCF<sup>Skp2</sup> and Mdm2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref058">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref059">59</xref>]. Song MS, et al. reported that RASSF1A could directly interact with Mdm2, HAUSP, and Daxx protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref060">60</xref>]. Also, Skp2 was shown to regulate RASSF1A function by directly interacting with RASSF1A and mediating its degradation through the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref057">57</xref>]. In our study, we tested the effect of Skp2 mediated RASSF1A degradation. When Skp2 was co-expressed with EBNA3C, a significant decreased in RASSF1A expression was seen. However, the F-box deleted mutation of Skp2 failed to induce RASSF1A degradation. These results suggested that Skp2 was recruited by EBNA3C to regulate the degradation of RASSF1A. RASSF1A was also shown to regulate p53 degradation by Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. Conversely, p53 also induced RASSF1A suppression by recruiting DNMT1 and increasing the methylation levels of the RASSF1A promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref061">61</xref>]. Additionally, p53 was also shown to interact with EBNA3C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref024">24</xref>]. Therefore, we tested the possibility that EBNA3C repressed RASSF1A expression by a p53-mediated increase in DNMT1 expression. We tested the inhibition of EBNA3C on RASSF1A expression in several cell lines including Saos-2 cell, a p53 minus cell line, and p53 expressing cell lines, 293 and BJAB. RASSF1A expression was decreased to the same level in these three cell lines indicating that p53 is dispensable for EBNA3C-mediated RASSF1A down-regulation.</p>
<p>Transcriptional modification is another important strategy, which contributes to RASSF1A down-regulation. The evidence demonstrated that hypermethylation of the RASSF1A promoter can play a vital role in down-regulation of RASSF1A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref087">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref088">88</xref>]. Our results suggested that RASSF1A mRNA expression was decreased by EBNA3C, and that EBNA3C inhibited the transcription activity of RASSF1A promoter by enhancing the methylation level of RASSF1A promoter. A previous study by Young Seo et al. showed that LMP1 activated DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b expression in NPC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref053">53</xref>]. However, another study in Hodgkin’s lymphoma by Leonard et al. showed that LMP1 downregulated the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3b, but upregulated DNMT3a expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref077">77</xref>]. LMP2A also increased the methylation of PTEN in gastric cancer cell lines by inducing DNMT1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref055">55</xref>]. Earlier studies in our lab showed that DNMT3A and DNMT3B, but not DNMT1, gradually increased in EBV primary infected-B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref037">37</xref>]. Furthermore, studies in our lab showed that EBNA3C not only increased the expression of DNMT1 but also interacted with DNMT1 in EBNA3C-expressing cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref056">56</xref>]. In this study, we confirmed that DNMT1 was slightly increased in EBNA3C stably expressing BJAB7 and BJAB10 cell lines. However, the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3b was decreased in EBV-transformed LCL cell lines, as well as EBV positive BL41-B95.8 cell line. Our results are consistent with the results of Leonard et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref077">77</xref>]. The expression of DNMT3a was increased in EBNA3C positive and EBV positive cell lines, but we failed to detect the association between EBNA3C and DNMT3a or DNMT3b. These results suggested that other cellular proteins are likely mediating the interaction between EBNA3C and DNMTs. Additional efforts will elucidate the mediator, which bridges the interaction between EBNA3C and DNMTs. Although DNMT1 expression was decreased in EBV positive cell lines, we cannot rule out the possibility that EBNA3C-mediated DNMT1 plays a role in modifying RASSF1A promoter methylation levels. In EBV positive cell lines, the expression of DNMT1 is regulated by several viral proteins. DNMT1 expression was decreased in the cell, but for a specific gene, the methylation levels still can be enhanced by DNMT1. The same situation may apply to EBNA3C-mediated RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation. However, additional experiments are needed to fully understand this interplay.</p>
<p>RASSF1A plays an important role in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and microtubule and chromosome stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref040">40</xref>]. To explore the underlying mechanism for EBV-induced lymphomagenesis, the effect of EBNA3C on RASSF1A-related cell functions were evaluated. From our results, we know that RASSF1A induces apoptosis through the caspase dependent apoptotic pathway. EBNA3C can antagonize RASSF1A-mediated cell apoptosis and facilitates cell proliferation by regulating the levels of multiple Cyclin proteins. Previous reports have shown that the accumulation of Cyclin D1 and Cyclin A2 was inhibited in RASSF1A expressing cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref080">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref089">89</xref>]. In our study, we found that other cyclin proteins are also involved in RASSF1A-mediated cell cycle arrest. In RASSF1A knocked-down LCL1 cell lines, the expression of Cyclin D1 was increased slightly. However, Cyclin E expression was strongly increased. Cyclin E is a Cyclin member that determines the initiation of DNA replication and is indispensable for G1 to S transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref090">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref091">91</xref>]. Our cell cycle experiments showed an increase in the percentage of cell in the S phase, and Cyclin E promotes Cyclin A expression by phosphorylating p27<sup>Kip1</sup> with the help of Cdk2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref090">90</xref>]. Thus, even if we did not detect the expression of Cyclin A2, it is reasonable to speculate that knocking down RASSF1A would improve Cyclin A expression levels to facilitate the G1 to S transition. Furthermore, Cyclin B1 involved in mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref092">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref093">93</xref>] was dramatically decreased in RASSF1A knocked down BJAB and LCL1 cells. A decrease in the percentage of cells in G2 phase for BJAB sh-RASSF1A and LCL1 sh-RASSF1A was observed in our cell cycle experiments. These results suggested that RASSF1A not only modulated G1 to S transition but can also regulate mitosis.</p>
<p>Previous studies reported that RASSF1A localized to cytoplasmic microtubules during interphase, localized to the centrosome in prophase, and localized to spindle microtubules and spindle poles during metaphase and anaphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref040">40</xref>]. When RASSF1A Ser202/Ser203 was mutated to Glu202/Glu203, it would disrupt the interaction between RASSF1A and microtubules and so abolish its ability to induce M-phase arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007514.ref085">85</xref>]. These results indicate that microtubule stability and interaction were critical for RASSF1A to regulate mitotic arrest. When cells were treated with nocodazole, RASSF1A protected microtubule from depolymerization. However, EBNA3C attenuated RASSF1A function on microtubule stability. RASSF1A failed to protect microtubule from depolymerization in presence of EBNA3C in cells treated with nocodazole. A higher percentage of cells with &gt;4N DNA content was observed in RASSF1A knocked down BJAB and LCL1 cells when compared with the BJAB sh-Ctrl and LCL1 sh-Ctrl cells. These results indicated that knocking down RASSF1A induced chromosomal abnormalities and reduced genomic stability in these cells. Ultimately, knocking down RASSF1A contributed to an increase in cell proliferation and transformation in LCLs. However, the details of the RASSF1A-mediated regulatory network are yet to be fully unveiled in EBV-transformed LCLs. Further detailed investigation in RASSF1A knock-out mice will provide evidence of the biological function of RASSF1A in EBV-associated tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings now demonstrate a role for EBNA3C in regulating the activities of the tumor suppressor RASSF1A and have enhanced our understanding of the many roles of EBNA3C in EBV-infected B cells. These studies now reveal another layer to the mechanisms employed by EBNA3C in suppressing the function of RASSF1A to promote EBV-mediated transformation. Furthermore, it provides another valuable target for rationale antiviral strategies and the development of new drugs to combat the associated pathologies.</p>
