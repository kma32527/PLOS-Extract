<abstract>
<p>The cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) is a cell surface glycoprotein attached to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor and plays a critical role in transmissible, neurodegenerative and fatal prion diseases. Alterations in membrane attachment influence PrP<sup>C</sup>-associated signaling, and the development of prion disease, yet our knowledge of the role of the GPI-anchor in localization, processing, and function of PrP<sup>C</sup> <italic>in vivo</italic> is limited We exchanged the PrP<sup>C</sup> GPI-anchor signal sequence of for that of Thy-1 (PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1) in cells and mice. We show that this modifies the GPI-anchor composition, which then lacks sialic acid, and that PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 is preferentially localized in axons and is less prone to proteolytic shedding when compared to PrP<sup>C</sup>. Interestingly, after prion infection, mice expressing PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 show a significant delay to terminal disease, a decrease of microglia/astrocyte activation, and altered MAPK signaling when compared to wild-type mice. Our results are the first to demonstrate <italic>in vivo</italic>, that the GPI-anchor signal sequence plays a fundamental role in the GPI-anchor composition, dictating the subcellular localization of a given protein and, in the case of PrP<sup>C</sup>, influencing the development of prion disease.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) is a glycoprotein attached to the neuronal surface via a GPI-anchor. When misfolded to PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, it leads to fatal neurodegenerative diseases which propagates from host to host. PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is the principal component of the infectious agent of prion diseases, the “prion”. Misfolding occurs at the plasma membrane, and when PrP<sup>C</sup> lacks the GPI-anchor, neuropathology and incubation time of prion disease are strongly modified. Moreover, the composition of the PrP<sup>C</sup> GPI-anchor impacts on the conversion process. To study the role of the GPI-anchor in the pathophysiology of prion diseases <italic>in vivo</italic>, we have generated transgenic mice where the PrP<sup>C</sup> GPI-signal sequence (GPI-SS) is replaced for the one of Thy-1, a neuronal protein with a distinct GPI-anchor and membrane localization. We found that the resulting protein, PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1, shows a different GPI-anchor composition, increased axonal localization, and reduced enzymatic shedding. After prion infection, disease progression is significantly delayed, and the neuropathology and cellular signaling are changed.</p>
<p>The present work demonstrates that the GPI-SS <italic>per se</italic> determines the GPI-anchor composition and localization of a given protein and it stresses the importance of PrP<sup>C</sup> membrane anchorage in prion disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) is a cell surface GPI-anchored protein (GPI-AP) with two putative N-glycosylation sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref002">2</xref>] targeted to detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs; or lipid rafts)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref003">3</xref>]. All GPI-APs share a common GPI-anchor core structure which is highly conserved among species and consists of ethanolamine phosphate linked through an amide group to the carboxyl terminus of the protein, three mannose residues, glucosamine, and a phosphatidylinositol (PI) group. During biosynthesis, the signal sequence for a GPI-anchor (GPI-SS) is rapidly removed after ER translocation, and a common GPI-anchor core is attached to the protein via a GPI-transamidase. Once attached to the protein, this core undergoes several modification steps during ER and Golgi transport involving both elimination/addition of side branching sugars to the glycan moiety together with fatty acid remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref005">5</xref>]. How these side chains and lipid moieties are chosen, and how this, in turn, affects the trafficking of GPI-APs is unclear, but it is probably cell- and species-specific and may depend on the functional context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref006">6</xref>]. It could also be, that the GPI-SS itself influences GPI-anchor remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref007">7</xref>] which could then affect its intracellular sorting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref004">4</xref>]. In polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, N-glycosylated GPI-APs are mostly apically sorted, suggesting that the GPI-anchor is an apical sorting signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref008">8</xref>], yet PrP<sup>C</sup> is an exception in this regard being basolaterally sorted in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref010">10</xref>]. When the GPI-SS of PrP<sup>C</sup> is replaced by the one of the DRM-resident Thy-1, PrP<sup>C</sup> partially relocates from the basolateral to the apical side in MDCK cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref011">11</xref>]. Likewise, GPI-SS-dependent relocalization of EGFP-tagged proteins occurs in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Most recently, Bate <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that sialylation of the PrP<sup>C</sup> GPI-anchor plays a role in its synaptic targeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref013">13</xref>]. Although it has already been shown that the GPI-SS influences intracellular sorting <italic>in vitro</italic>, how differences in the GPI-SS impact on the GPI-anchor composition in neuronal cells or in the brain, has not been investigated yet.</p>
<p>A key event in the pathogenesis of prion diseases is a (templated) conformational change of PrP<sup>C</sup> to its misfolded isoform (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>), the critical component of prion infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref014">14</xref>]. Neuropathological characteristics of prion diseases include vacuolization of neuropil and white matter, astro- and microgliosis, neuronal loss and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref015">15</xref>]. Of outstanding importance for the pathogenesis of prion diseases are the membrane attachment and lipid raft localization of PrP<sup>C</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref016">16</xref>]. Thus, cells expressing GPI-anchorless PrP cannot be infected with prions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref017">17</xref>], and cholesterol depletion or expression of a transmembrane PrP-CD4 fusion protein (shifting PrP-CD4 out of DRMs) in cells, interferes with prion propagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref018">18</xref>]. Furthermore, when cell membranes are treated with analogs of GPI-anchors, such as glucosamine-PI, the membrane composition is altered, and the formation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is reduced, probably by displacing PrP<sup>C</sup> from lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref019">19</xref>]. Along the same line, enzymatic elimination of one GPI-anchor acyl chain in cells removes PrP<sup>C</sup> from DRMs and reduces PrP<sup>Sc</sup> amounts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref020">20</xref>]. Also, mice expressing GPI-anchorless PrP<sup>C</sup> show delayed clinical onset of prion disease together with altered clinical and neuropathological presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, the GPI-anchor of PrP<sup>C</sup> bears a sialic acid, a rare modification for a mammalian GPI-AP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref023">23</xref>]. PrP<sup>C</sup> lacking sialic acid in its GPI-anchor cannot convert to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref024">24</xref>]. Sialo and asialo GPI-anchored PrP<sup>Sc</sup> are equally present in infected mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref025">25</xref>]. Therefore, the contribution of the GPI-anchor sialic acid modification to the conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> clearly needs further investigations.</p>
<p>In the present study and based on our previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref011">11</xref>], we assessed how the substitution of the GPI-SS of PrP<sup>C</sup> for that of Thy-1 influences the biology of the resulting chimeric PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, and how this impacts on the pathophysiology of prion disease. We provide evidence that this replacement alters the resulting GPI-anchor composition regarding sialic acid content and leads to relocalization of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1, increasing its presence in axons when compared to wild-type PrP<sup>C</sup> (WTPrP<sup>C</sup>). This is accompanied by decreased proteolytic shedding of the protein. After intracerebral challenge with mouse-adapted prions, incubation time to clinical prion disease is extended, correlating with decreased activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK and reduced glial activation.</p>

<p>We generated four lines of transgenic mice (PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1) expressing PrP<sup>C</sup> with the GPI-SS of Thy-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007520.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) which were backcrossed into PrP knockout (<italic>Prnp</italic><sup>0/0</sup> in C57/Bl6 background) mice. Two of the lines, L27 and L16, had the 3F4 tag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref026">26</xref>]. However, since this modification can increase prion disease incubation time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref027">27</xref>], we also generated two other lines, L150 and L159, without the 3F4 tag, of which L150 was used for prion inoculation experiments. A WTPrP<sup>C</sup> line was generated with littermates of the founders, which did not contain the transgene but had an identical genetic background. WTPrP<sup>C</sup> mice were backcrossed with C57/Bl6 mice to avoid differences in prion incubation times depending on the genetic background. All lines described here developed normally for the period observed (&gt;350 days) and did not present any obvious phenotypic alterations.</p>

<title>Biochemical characterization of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 mice.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic representation of the PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 fusion protein. PrP<sup>C</sup> comprises an N-terminal and a C-terminal (GPI-anchor) signal sequence, both of them not being present in the mature protein. Positions of an octameric repeat region (OR), a hydrophobic domain (HD), two N-glycans (N), a disulfide bridge, the 3F4 tag and epitope (present in mouse lines L27 and L16) and of the cleavage site for the ADAM10-mediated shedding (scissors) are indicated. The substitution of the GPI-SS of PrP<sup>C</sup> for the one of Thy-1 is shown in the dotted box. The substitution of the GPI-SS of PrP<sup>C</sup> for the one of Thy-1 is indicated. (B) Relative amount of PrP<sup>C</sup> mRNA from WTPrP<sup>C</sup> (n = 5) and PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 (n = 5) measured by RT-qPCR. WTPrP<sup>C</sup> mRNA is set to one. Error bars are SEM. (C) Representative western blot showing PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 protein expression in brain compared to WTPrP<sup>C</sup>. Bar chart shows the mean of PrP relative intensity related to actin intensity (used as a loading control). WTPrP<sup>C</sup> is set to 100%. Error bars are SEM. (D) Triton X-114 phase partitioning assay. Both, WTPrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 were mainly found in the insoluble phase (ip), indicating that both carry a GPI-anchor as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref028">28</xref>] (dp: detergent phase; sp: soluble phase). Diagram shows the relative signal intensity of PrP from 3 independent experiments. WTPrP<sup>C</sup> ip is set to 100%. Error bars are SEM. (E) Representative western blot showing total homogenates (TH) from PrP KO (<italic>Prnp</italic><sup>0/0</sup>, used as a negative control), WTPrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 brains used for PNGase treatment (to eliminate N-glycans) followed by PrP immunoprecipitation (IP), shown in the adjacent western blot. PNGase+IP treated samples were then used to isolate the GPI-anchors, showed in (F). (F) Dot blot analysis of the GPI-anchors from deglycosylated, immunoprecipitated PrP and PK digested samples from mouse brain. Phosphatidylinositol (PI), mannose (man) and sialic acid (sial. acid) were detected as described in Methods. Note that the amounts of PI and mannose are similar between PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 and WTPrP<sup>C</sup> whereas sialic acid is almost absent in PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1. Sialic acid background signal in PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 could be explained by deglycosylation not being 100% achieved as shown in blot in (E).</p>

<p>To assess whether a proper GPI-anchor was added, we performed a Triton X-114 phase separation assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref028">28</xref>]. We found that PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1, like WTPrP<sup>C</sup>, is mainly present in the insoluble pellet, indicating GPI-anchorage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007520.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Thy-1 and PrP<sup>C</sup> are both DRM residents, but share different lipid domains at the plasma membrane that can, in principle, be isolated by differential detergent solubilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref029">29</xref>]. We hypothesized that the exchange of the GPI-SS of PrP<sup>C</sup> for the one of Thy-1 would alter the lipid subdomain localization of the protein. We isolated lipid rafts from frontal cortex using Brij 96 (0.5%) and sodium deoxycholate (NaDOC, 0.5%), as these detergents were described to discriminate between lipid subdomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref030">30</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007520.s002">S2A Fig</xref>, both WTPrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 were mainly solubilized and present at the bottom of the gradient (fractions 11 and 12), whereas flotillin, a marker of lipid rafts, and Thy-1 were found in the upper fractions of the gradient under these conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007520.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). We myelin-depleted the sample before detergent incubation, as myelin interferes with proper detergent solubilization. After solubilization with either a Brij 96 (0.5%)/NaDOC (0.5%) mixture or with Brij 98 (1%) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref031">31</xref>], we obtained similar results, with the majority of WTPrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 solubilized and present at the bottom of the gradient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007520.s002">S2C Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the PrP<sup>C</sup> GPI-anchor contains sialic acid and the Thy-1 GPI-anchor does not, we assessed sialic acid content of both GPI-anchors. WTPrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 brain homogenates were first deglycosylated (as the N-glycans of PrP<sup>C</sup> also contain sialic acid), immunoprecipitated with the PrP<sup>C</sup>-directed POM1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007520.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) and, after proteinase K (PK) digestion, their GPI-anchors were dot-blotted. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007520.g001">Fig 1F</xref>, the amounts of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and mannose (man) as controls did not differ substantially between samples, whereas the amount of sialic acid was drastically reduced in PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1, showing a GPI-anchor composition similar to Thy-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007520.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Thus, although the sublipid domain occupancy was not altered, the composition of the GPI-anchor was indeed changed. This suggests that the GPI-SS dictates the composition of the resulting GPI-anchor.</p>

<title>Altered sorting of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 compared to WTPrP<sup>C</sup></title>
<p>As we have described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref011">11</xref>], PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1, in contrast to WTPrP<sup>C</sup>, is mainly sorted to the apical compartment when expressed in a polarized model of epithelial cells, thus behaving like Thy-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007520.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In neurons, PrP<sup>C</sup> is mainly present in the somatodendritic compartment whereas Thy-1 is more uniformly present in cell bodies and axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>We could observe that, under non-permeabilizing conditions, PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 was found at the plasma membrane similarly to WTPrP<sup>C</sup>, indicating that GPI-SS does not act on overall plasma membrane localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007520.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Next, we evaluated the presence of PrP<sup>C</sup> in axons of primary hippocampal neurons isolated from PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 and WTPrP<sup>C</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007520.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 shows a significantly higher degree of localization in tau-positive axons than WTPrP<sup>C</sup> when assessed in primary neurons (100 ± 6.5% for WTPrP<sup>C</sup> vs. 176 ± 8.8% for PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1; ***<italic>p =</italic> 0.0001; unpaired t-test).</p>

<title>PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 mice challenged with prions show delayed clinical presentation and different neuropathology when compared to WTPrP<sup>C</sup> mice</title>
<p>As stated in material and methods, for prion inoculation experiments we generated new lines of transgenic mice lacking the 3F4 tag (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007520.s009">S1 Table</xref>).

<p>Sagittal brain sections of terminally prion-diseased WTPrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 L150 mice were neuropathologically examined. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007520.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, RML prion-infected PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 L150 mice presented with decreased spongiosis and less severe astro- and microgliosis when compared to WTPrP<sup>C</sup>.

<p>In another set of experiments, we also inoculated PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 L16 mice with RML and 22L mouse-adapted prions. RML-inoculated transgenic mice reached terminal disease after 400 ± 56 dpi (n = 10), whereas WTPrP<sup>C</sup> mice became terminally sick at 155 ± 1.6 dpi (n = 8), thus also showing a highly significant delay for PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1-expressing mice (Log Rank (Mantel-Cox)****<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007520.s006">S6A Fig</xref>).

<title>The PrP<sup>Sc</sup> pattern differs between PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 and WTPrP<sup>C</sup> mice</title>
<p>To investigate the amount and type of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, we performed biochemical analyses of brain samples from terminally prion-diseased mice. Interestingly, PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 L150 mice infected with RML showed decreased amounts of total PrP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007520.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) with significantly less PrP<sup>Sc</sup> compared to WTPrP<sup>C</sup> mice (100 ± 14.26% for WTPrP<sup>C</sup> mice vs. 29.4 ± 2% for PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 L150 mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007520.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>, **<italic>p</italic> = 0.0021; unpaired t-test).

The reduction in total PrP was not due to an age-dependent decrease in PrP<sup>C</sup> expression as we did not observe significant differences between 20 and 40 weeks-old PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 L150 mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007520.s007">S7A Fig</xref>).

Taken together, these findings suggest that the relative decrease of total PrP after infection in PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 is due to less efficient conversion to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in these mice compared to WTPrP<sup>C</sup>.

<title>Proteolytic shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 is reduced compared to WTPrP<sup>C</sup></title>
<p>PrP<sup>C</sup> undergoes several physiological cleavages which are highly conserved through evolution, indicating essential functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref034">34</xref>]. We have previously shown that the metalloprotease ADAM10 is the responsible protease for the shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup> <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref035">35</xref>] and that impaired shedding has significant consequences for prion diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref032">32</xref>]. Thus, to investigate the possible mechanisms implicated in the clinical delay and the altered neuropathology, we decided to analyze the shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1. We have recently generated an antibody (sPrP<sup>G228</sup>) that specifically recognizes shed PrP (as the antibody is directed against the carboxy terminus Gly228 only exposed upon ADAM10-mediated cleavage) allowing for the direct detection of shed PrP in mouse brain homogenates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref036">36</xref>]. By using this antibody, we found a significantly decreased shedding in PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 L150 and PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 L159 mice compared to WTPrP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007520.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>; 100 ± 72% in WTPrP<sup>C</sup> vs. 19.37 ± 3.5% in PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 L150; ***<italic>p</italic> = 0.0005; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007520.s008">S8A and S8B Fig</xref>, 100 ± 14.8% in WTPrP<sup>C</sup> vs. 37.5 ± 3.9% in PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 L159; *<italic>p</italic> = 0.015; unpaired t-test). This indicates that the altered GPI-anchor and/or localization of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 interferes with the ADAM10-mediated release from the plasma membrane. Remarkably, in terminally diseased RML-infected PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 mice, even though total PrP shedding is decreased compared to WTPrP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007520.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>, 100 ± 6.4% in WTPrP<sup>C</sup> vs. 37.77 ± 3.9% in PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 L150; ***<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001; unpaired t-test), it does not show differences when it is referred to total PrP amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007520.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). This indicates a relative increase of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1shedding upon infection, which was further confirmed by comparing levels of shed PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 between non-infected and infected mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007520.s007">S7B(i) Fig</xref>; 100 ± 11.8% in PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 L150 vs. 272 ± 21% in PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 L150 RML infected; ***<italic>p</italic> = 0.0004; unpaired t-test).

In conclusion, ADAM10-mediated shedding is significantly altered for PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 compared to WTPrP<sup>C</sup> under both physiological and pathological conditions. In order to properly interpret these results, one should keep in mind that shed PrP (made visible by the highly sensitive sPrP<sup>G228</sup> antibody) represents only a minor fraction of the total PrP pool (repeated own observations and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref037">37</xref>]).</p>

<title>Decreased ERK activation in brains of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 L150 mice after RML infection</title>
<p>Activation of ERK1/2, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, can promote the formation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in a cell model of prion infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref038">38</xref>]. In the same study, it was demonstrated that activation of other MAPKs, such as p38 or JNK, has an adverse effect on the formation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. We have recently shown that a C-terminal deletion retains PrP in the secretory pathway, leading to p38 activation and neuronal death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref039">39</xref>]. Since in the present study RML-infected PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 L150 mice showed decreased PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation and increased survival, we performed western blot analyses to assess the status of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation.

<title>PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1, like WTPrP<sup>C</sup>, mediates toxic PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-associated signaling</title>
<p>Since MAPK signaling was changed, and to assess whether PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 is capable of mediating pro-apoptotic signaling induced by PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, we employed a cell culture model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref040">40</xref>]. This assay is based on the co-cultivation of PrP<sup>C</sup>-expressing cells with chronically prion-infected cells that release PrP<sup>Sc</sup> into the cell culture medium. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007520.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, co-cultivation of SH-SY5Y cells expressing PrP<sup>C</sup> with prion-infected mouse neuroblastoma (ScN2a) cells increased apoptotic cell death, as determined by activation of caspase-3. In contrast, SH-SY5Y cells expressing a PrP mutant containing a heterologous C-terminal transmembrane domain instead of the GPI-anchor (PrP-CD4) could be co-cultured with ScN2a cells without signs of apoptosis. Notably, PrP-CD4 also inhibits PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-formation in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref018">18</xref>]. However, SH-SY5Y cells expressing PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 transduce PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-mediated toxicity similar to WTPrP<sup>C</sup>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The GPI-anchor is a complex structure for the attachment of proteins to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane that involves more than 20 proteins in its production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref005">5</xref>]. It bestows the capacity to localize in lipid rafts (determining compartmentalization), and although it does not reach the intracellular space, it can confer the ability of signal transduction through transmembrane spanning partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref042">42</xref>]. The signal sequence for GPI-anchor attachment has a wide range of sequence diversity and its participation in determining the final composition of the GPI-anchor itself is not known. It is assumed that remodeling of the core GPI-anchor depends on the protein it is attached to, and on the cell type by which it is synthesized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref042">42</xref>]. In the present study, we have made several novel observations important not only for prion diseases but the biology of GPI-APs. We could show in a newly generated transgenic mouse model that (i) by changing the amino acids of the GPI-SS, the composition of the GPI-anchor is modified, resulting in a differential sorting and proteolytic processing of the protein. Upon infection with prions, these alterations (ii) are associated with significantly prolonged prion disease incubation time, and (iii) influence the conversion to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> as well as the neuropathological presentation including decreased gliosis and spongiosis. Fittingly, we also found (iv) reduced activation of the ERK signal cascade during prion disease (please refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007520.g008">Fig 8</xref> for a graphical summary of the principal findings). To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate the importance of the GPI-SS in determining a GPI-anchor composition and sorting of a GPI-AP in a mouse model. In the specific case of PrP<sup>C</sup>, this has a direct link to the pathophysiology of prion disease.</p>

<title>Graphical summary of research aim and key findings.</title>
<p>(A) To study the role of the GPI-anchor signal sequence (GPI-SS) in determining localization and biology of a protein, the GPI-SS of PrP<sup>C</sup> (dark green) was exchanged for the one of Thy-1 (red). Both proteins, WTPrP<sup>C</sup> and the PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 mutant, are expressed at the cell surface and comprise a GPI-anchor. A sialic acid modification (green asterisk) typical for the GPI-anchor of PrP<sup>C</sup> is lacking in the GPI-anchor of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 (note its red GPI-anchor referring to the GPI-anchor of Thy-1 [in B]). This suggests that an altered GPI-SS in the mRNA results in a different GPI-anchor of the mature protein. (B) PrP<sup>C</sup> (green) and Thy-1 (blue) are both known residents of lipid rafts/DRMs. While PrP<sup>C</sup> is located in their periphery and able to leave and re-enter these membrane subdomains, Thy-1 has been shown to occupy more central regions therein. Despite several biochemical methods applied in our study, we were unable to demonstrate a relative re-distribution of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 towards Thy-1 compared to WTPrP<sup>C</sup>. (C) Nevertheless, the overall cellular sorting is altered with PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 being relatively more transported towards the apical compartment compared to WTPrP<sup>C</sup> with its predominant basolateral sorting in a polarized epithelial cell model such as MDCK cells. This also holds true in our transgenic mice and translates to an increased axonal sorting of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 in primary neurons compared to a mainly somatodendritic presence of PrP<sup>C</sup> in wild-type neurons. (D) Altered GPI-anchor composition and sorting of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 results in different biological consequences (in comparison to WTPrP<sup>C</sup>): (i) Endogenous proteolytic shedding by the metalloprotease ADAM10 (orange) at the cell surface is reduced. (ii) Although PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1, in principle, is able to transduce PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-associated toxic signaling (e.g. via cleaved caspase-3), signaling via the MAP kinase ERK1/2 is reduced upon prion infection. Though not investigated here, p38 signaling may be reduced at early time points, contributing to delay to terminal disease (showed as p38?). Key hallmarks of prion-associated neuropathology are also altered in the transgenic mice including (iii) decreased PrP<sup>Sc</sup> production and deposition, (iv) reduced vacuolization (spongiosis) of the brain parenchyma, and (v) reduced induction of astrocytes and microglia (reactive gliosis). These changes are accompanied with prolonged survival of the PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 mice and support a relevant impact of the GPI-SS on a GPI-AP`s biology.</p>

<p>Our previous observation in a model of polarized epithelial cells already indicated that the GPI-SS plays a role in protein sorting. We observed that, by changing the GPI-SS of PrP<sup>C</sup> for the one of Thy-1, PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 was partially, yet significantly, relocalized from the basolateral to the apical side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref011">11</xref>], confirming previous observations from others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref012">12</xref>]. In the present work, we extended our observations to transgenic mice expressing PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 on a Prnp knock-out background. PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 is correctly expressed at the plasma membrane, showing identical N-glycosylation as WTPrPC, and is located in lipid rafts. In primary hippocampal neurons, we showed a 1.8-fold increase of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 in axons when compared to controls, despite equal PrP<sup>C</sup> expression levels. Notably, we showed that by changing the GPI-SS, the biochemical composition of the GPI-anchor is altered, presenting with a loss of the sialic acid usually present in the GPI-anchor of PrP<sup>C</sup>. It has recently been shown that the sialic acid in the GPI-anchor of PrP<sup>C</sup> has a role in the synaptic targeting of PrP<sup>C</sup> in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref013">13</xref>]. Thus, when sialic acid from exogenously administered GPI-anchored PrP is depleted, or the lipid moiety is changed, PrP<sup>C</sup> still partitions in DRMs but is no longer targeted to synapses. In vivo, we also observed that PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 lacking sialic acid is differently sorted, but we observed an increase in axonal targeting. The fact, that not only the sialic acid is missing but also the GPI-SS was changed for PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1, may account for these differences.</p>
<p>The fact that in the GPI-anchor of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 not only the sialic acid is missing but also the SS-GPI anchor is changed, can account for these differences. Our mouse model provides the opportunity to address this on the molecular level.</p>
<p>In mammals, the sorting of GPI-APs is complex, and in epithelial cell models it appears to depend on (i) the presence of the GPI-anchor itself, (ii) its remodelling in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), (iii) its partitioning in DRMs, and (iv) the capacity to oligomerize in the Golgi, which in turn depends on the clustering of DRMs among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref043">43</xref>]. In neurons, the signals implicated in the targeting of proteins either exclusively to dendrites/axons or to both sides, are not clear. For GPI-APs, such as Thy-1, it has been suggested that early interaction with DRM components (especially with sphingomyelin and cholesterol) is necessary for axonal delivery of Thy-1 in mature neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref044">44</xref>]. According to our data and recent findings of others, it could be hypothesized that the GPI-SS itself directs the protein to different lipid environments, which then influence how the GPI-anchor will be remodeled in the TGN, thereby affecting its oligomerization capacity and, hence, its further sorting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref045">45</xref>]. Actually, PrP<sup>C</sup> and Thy-1 are both located in DRMs but occupy different subdomains therein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref030">30</xref>]. However, even after using different detergents previously reported to allow for discrimination between PrP<sup>C</sup>- and Thy-1-enriched DRM subdomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref031">31</xref>], we were unable to observe differences in the distribution between PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 and WTPrP<sup>C</sup>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, support for a relocalization of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 to a different subdomain comes from our finding of reduced ADAM10-mediated shedding. This proteolytic cleavage at the cell surface is likely to occur at the interface between raft and non-raft regions, where–supported by the ability of PrP<sup>C</sup> to leave and re-enter DRMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref046">46</xref>]–protease and substrate are thought to interact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref034">34</xref>]. In that regard, the <italic>in vivo</italic> data presented here complement our recent finding of significantly decreased shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 in N2a cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref036">36</xref>]. Relocalization of the prion protein from the periphery of rafts towards more central regions (where Thy-1 resides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref029">29</xref>]) could, therefore, explain the reduced shedding in PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 mice. It is interesting that, despite reduced shedding compared to WTPrP<sup>C</sup> under normal conditions, upon prion infection this cleavage is relatively increased in PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 mice. We and others have shown that shedding interferes with PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation and beneficially influences prion disease incubation times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref048">48</xref>]. Thus, upregulation of shedding during prion disease could represent a protective feedback mechanism to lower PrP<sup>Sc</sup> production and prolong survival in our transgenic mice.</p>
<p>Our further aim was to elucidate how the differential localization of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 impacts on prion disease. We intracerebrally inoculated our transgenic and WTPrP<sup>C</sup> mice with prions. Upon RML-infection, PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 mice showed (i) delayed onset of terminal disease, (ii) different neuropathological presentation with decreased spongiosis, gliosis, reduced PrP<sup>Sc</sup> amounts, and an altered PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-glycotype pattern, (iii) relatively increased shedding, and (iv) a decrease in ERK phosphorylation. Although, as demonstrated by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref050">50</xref>] and now confirmed by us, the 3F4 tag prolongs prion disease incubation times, we included these mice (PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 L16) as they showed several neuropathological characteristics that were likewise present in the non-3F4-tagged transgenic mice (PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 L150), thus strengthening our overall results.</p>
<p>It is known that not only the presence of PrP<sup>C</sup> but also its type of membrane anchorage is fundamental for the pathophysiology of prion disease. Briefly, (i) presence of extracellular PrP<sup>Sc</sup> does not lead to prion-induced neurodegeneration in the absence of PrP<sup>C</sup> on neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref052">52</xref>], (ii) cells expressing either anchorless PrP or PrP with a transmembrane domain instead of the GPI-anchor are resistant to prion infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref053">53</xref>], and (iii) prion-infected transgenic mice expressing low amounts of anchorless PrP do not show clinical symptoms of prion disease despite high titers of infectivity and high levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref054">54</xref>]. When the expression of anchorless PrP is increased, this leads to delayed onset of disease and generation of a new prion strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref055">55</xref>]. Remarkably, the type of GPI-anchor also affects PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation. Thus, when amino acids in the C-terminus or within the GPI-SS of the murine sequence are replaced by their cunicular homologs (with rabbits being naturally resistant to prion infection), this modified PrP<sup>C</sup> cannot be converted to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in a cell culture model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref056">56</xref>].</p>
<p>Moreover, the presence of sialic acid in the GPI-anchor can influence conversion as PrP with a desialylated GPI-anchor cannot be converted to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and can even stop an ongoing infection <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref057">57</xref>]. Thus, a desialylated GPI-anchor may modify the lipid environment leading to inhibition of the signal transduction associated with PrP<sup>Sc</sup> neurotoxicity. Fitting to this, our model with a PrP mutant lacking sialic acid in its GPI-anchor also shows delay to terminal disease as well as altered signal transduction when compared to WTPrP<sup>C</sup>, highlighting the importance of the sialic acid modification of the GPI-anchor in prion disease. However, <italic>in vivo</italic> we found conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 to be reduced, not completely abolished.</p>
<p>As stated above, the sialylation status of the PrP<sup>C</sup> GPI-anchor modifies the lipid environment <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref058">58</xref>]. PrP<sup>C</sup> and Thy-1 share different lipid environments, and it has been shown that the lipid environment composition is fundamental for conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref060">60</xref>]. PrP<sup>C</sup>-enriched lipid rafts isolated from rat brain have a significant increase in cholesterol compared to Thy-1-containing lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref030">30</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, desialylated PrP<sup>C</sup> is found in lipid rafts with increased cholesterol content, probably stabilizing PrP<sup>C</sup> in lipid rafts and increasing its half-life at the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref058">58</xref>]. Although, by performing differential detergent extraction, we could not detect a differential distribution of PrP<sup>C</sup>/PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 in lipid rafts, we cannot rule out that the lipid environment of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 is altered in a way that impairs the conversion to PrP<sup>Sc</sup>.</p>
<p>In prion-infected mice both, sialo and asialo GPI-anchored PrP<sup>C</sup> forms, can be converted to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and are present in infected brains and spleens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref062">62</xref>]. Our results, where delay to clinical disease is associated with a significant decrease in the amount of PK-resistant PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, suggest that asialo forms can be converted <italic>in vivo</italic> but with comparably low efficiency. Interestingly, Katorcha <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref063">63</xref>] have found that a decrease in PrP N-glycan sialylation leads to a different glycoform pattern after prion infection. They also observed that when prion-infected desialylated brain homogenates where inoculated to Syrian hamsters, there was a drop in infectivity and PK-resistance. Because in their experiments they used a sialidase that can also eliminate the sialic acid of the GPI-anchor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref025">25</xref>], and in view of our present results, it would be interesting to study if the sialic acid of the PrP GPI-anchor also partially contributes to the observations of Katorcha <italic>et al</italic>.</p>
<p>Several other aspects may also contribute to reduced PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conversion and prolonged survival of our PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 mice. On the one hand, Nemoto <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref064">64</xref>] have recently described that the behavior of Thy-1 and PrP<sup>C</sup> at the plasma membrane is different, with PrP<sup>C</sup> showing a slower membrane diffusion compared to Thy-1. This may increase the probability of homophilic interactions for WTPrP<sup>C</sup> but not for PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1. Since the conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> occurs at the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref065">65</xref>], this effect could favor interactions between WTPrP<sup>C</sup> and critical PrP<sup>Sc</sup> seeds, thus enhancing the propagation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. In contrast, the lateral diffusion behavior of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 may be more similar to that of Thy-1, thus decreasing the conversion rate. On the other hand, the GPI-anchor itself influences the structure of a given protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref041">41</xref>]. In the case of PrP<sup>C</sup>, this could result in structural hindrance and, thus, less efficient PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conversion.</p>
<p>PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 mice presented with significantly increased incubation times with two different prion strains, RML and 22L (with longest delay to terminal disease with RML prions). Several factors may account for that. On the one hand, each prion strain has different cellular tropism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref066">66</xref>] and 22L is mainly associated to astrocytes where it mediates indirect neuronal damage. On the other hand, the fact that RML and 22L prions use different endocytic pathways to infect the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref067">67</xref>], could indicate that PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 follows an altered endocytic pathway that facilitates 22L over RML infection.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, after prion infection, we observed a decrease in the glial response in all PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 lines compared to controls. Prion diseases, like other neurodegenerative diseases, are accompanied by an increase in microglia with a phagocytic phenotype and by reactive astrocytes. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, may act beneficial or detrimental in prion diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref068">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref069">69</xref>]. In the present study, a decreased amount of microglia in PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 mice coincides with a delay to the terminal stage of prion disease, but further experiments would be needed to establish a direct correlation. Of note, a recent study has functionally linked ADAM10-mediated shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup> to inflammatory responses and monocyte recruitment to the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref070">70</xref>]. So, it is conceivable that reduced levels of shed PrP (as a potential chemoattractant and activating factor) account for the impaired glial response in our mice. With regard to astrogliosis, it has been shown that astrocytes (i) accumulate PrP<sup>Sc</sup> early in the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref071">71</xref>], (ii) can rapidly internalize, traffic, and spread PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref072">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref073">73</xref>], and (iii) that astrocytic PrP<sup>C</sup> supports the development of prion disease in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref074">74</xref>]. Since astrogliosis is decreased in our transgenic mice, this could contribute to both, delay to terminal disease and reduced PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposition. Moreover, because destruction of the extracellular matrix due to factors released by microglia and astrocytes may lead to the vacuolization observed in prion diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref075">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref076">76</xref>], decreased gliosis in PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 mice could also explain their low degree of spongiosis. Interestingly, lack of vacuolization of the gray matter was also observed in prion-infected mice expressing GPI-anchorless PrP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>The GPI-anchor is necessary for toxic signaling associated to PrP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref040">40</xref>] and it seems plausible that an altered GPI-anchor and localization of PrP<sup>C</sup> affect its association with signaling-competent, membrane-spanning binding partners and, thus, signaling outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref077">77</xref>]. We observed that, <italic>in vitro</italic>, PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 is as able as WTPrP<sup>C</sup> to transduce neurotoxic signals, and, <italic>in vivo</italic>, we showed decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation whereas p38 MAPK was unchanged at a terminal stage of disease. Using an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of prion infection, Fang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref078">78</xref>] recently showed that phosphorylation of p38 is an early event in synaptotoxicity and that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> specifically targets post-synaptic PrP<sup>C</sup>. In our transgenic mice, PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 is partially depleted from the dendritic compartment, and we observed a delay in the clinical onset. We did not detected a decrease in p38 phosphorylation but we cannot rule out the possibility that, at an earlier disease state, p38 activation in PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 mice might be lower than in controls, thus contributing to delayed disease onset.</p>
<p>An increase in ERK1/2 signaling has been consistently observed in cellular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref079">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref082">82</xref>], mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref083">83</xref>] and hamster models of prion infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref084">84</xref>], and is probably related to neurodegeneration and cell death. Activated ERK1/2 also participates in the conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref038">38</xref>]. Accordingly, it could be hypothesized that the decrease in ERK phosphorylation in our model delays clinical disease and reduces PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposition. How exactly PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 affects MAPK signaling deserves further studies, but it is interesting that interfering with this signaling cascade is considered a potential therapeutic option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref080">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref081">81</xref>]. However, since astrocytes represent the main cell population that increases ERK phosphorylation after prion infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref083">83</xref>], it is also possible that the observed reduction is due to reduced astrogliosis in our transgenic mice.</p>
<p>Although PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 mice present with extended survival and delay to clinical disease, we observed a faster progression to terminal disease compared to controls. Several factors can account for this. On the one hand, the different localization of PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 may induce alternative signaling pathways not investigated in this study and these could follow a kinetic leading to rapid disease development once a critical threshold is reached [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref085">85</xref>]. On the other hand, glia is less activated (maybe due to decreased levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>), which may prolong survival (given less inflammatory brain injury) but could also contribute to toxicity as non-functional cells and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> may not be efficiently eliminated. The final sum up of positive and negative factors may influence the complex findings observed in PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 mice.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we showed that the GPI-SS influences GPI-anchor composition and localization of a GPI-AP <italic>in vivo</italic>. This study attributes a novel function to the GPI-SS in subcellular trafficking <italic>in vivo</italic> and sheds light on several molecular events underlying prion-associated neurodegeneration.</p>

PrP<sup>C</sup> was excised from mPrPHG by AgeI and PmlI (Fast Digest, Fermentas). PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 was cut with AgeI and PmlI and ligated into the mPrPHG. For pronuclear injection, the mPrPHG vector was cut with SalI and NotI and separated in an agarose gel. The pronuclear injection was performed at the Transgenic Mouse Facility (ZMNH, Hamburg).

Briefly, 10% mouse brain homogenates were prepared with RIPA buffer plus protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and protein content was determined as described before. As sialic acids in N-glycans would interfere with the analysis of GPI-anchor modifications, samples containing 100 μg of total protein were first subjected to deglycosylation for 4 h at 37°C using the PNGase F kit (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer`s protocol. To only yield PrP<sup>C</sup> and avoid presence of interfering IgGs in eluates, deglycosylated samples were subsequently used for immunoprecipitation using monoclonal antibody POM1 that had been covalently linked to beads following the instructions of the Pierce Co-Immunoprecipitation Kit (Thermo Scientific) before. Thy-1 was immunoprecipitated with the rat anti-mouse Thy-1 (MCA1474, Serotech). The eluted samples containing purified deglycosylated PrP<sup>C</sup> were digested with 100 μg/ml proteinase K, at 37°C for 24 hours, resulting in GPI anchors attached to the terminal amino acid. The released GPIs were extracted with water-saturated butanol, washed with water 5 times and loaded onto C18 columns. GPIs were eluted under a gradient of propanol and water. The presence of GPIs was detected by ELISA. Maxisorb immunoplates were coated with 0.5 μg/ml concanavalin A (binds mannose) and blocked with 5% milk powder.

After centrifugation at 500xg for 5 min to pellet nuclei and cell debris, the supernatant was further centrifuged for 40 min at 18,000xg to obtain a membrane-enriched fraction. The amount of protein from this fraction was quantified, and 1–2 mg of protein were diluted with 2x detergent buffer (10mM Tris-HCl pH 8.2, 1% Brij 96 (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma-Aldrich)) that had previously been mixed at least for 16h. Samples were then incubated for 30 min at 4°C and mixed at a ratio of 1:1 with 80% sucrose in the detergent buffer. 35% of sucrose (8 ml) and 5% of sucrose (1 ml) in detergent buffer were layered on top. After 18 h of centrifugation at 200,000xg, 12 fractions were taken and subjected to electrophoresis and western blot as previously described.

The resulting pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of ISB buffer without sucrose, the amount of protein quantified, and equal amounts of protein were further incubated either with 2X detergent (1% Brij 96/1% sodium deoxycholate in ISB buffer without sucrose) for 30 min at 4°C or with Brij 98 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at 37°C. After incubation, samples were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 with 80% sucrose in ISB buffer and proceeded with the sucrose gradient and ultracentrifugation as described above.</p>

<title>Cell culture, transfection, and co-cultivation</title>
<p>Cells were cultivated and transfected as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref089">89</xref>]. The human SH-SY5Y cell line is a human neuroblastoma cell line (DSMZ number ACC 209). Co-cultivation experiments were done as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref090">90</xref>]. In brief, SH-SY5Y cells were grown on glass cover slips and transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). 2 h after transfection cover slips were transferred into dishes containing a 90% confluent cell layer of either N2a (immortalized neuroblastoma cell line, ATCC No. Ccl 131) or chronically infected ScN2a cells (established by infecting N2a cells with an enriched preparation of prions isolated from the brains of mice infected with RML prions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007520.ref091">91</xref>]). After 16 h of co-cultivation, apoptotic cell death was analyzed (see below).</p>

<title>Apoptosis assay</title>
<p>16 h after co-cultivation, SH-SY5Y cells were fixed on glass cover slips with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were incubated with an anti-active caspase 3 antibodies overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with the fluorescently labeled secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 555 for one hour at room temperature. Cells were then mounted onto glass slides and examined by fluorescence microscopy using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope (Carl Zeiss). The numbers of cells positive for activated caspase-3 out of at least 1,000 transfected cells were determined in a blinded manner. All quantifications were based on at least three independent experiments.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>IBM SPSS Statistics 22 and GraphPad Prism 5 statistic software programs were used in the statistical analysis. To assess differences between Kaplan-Meier survival curves, the Breslow test was used. For comparison between the groups in western blots and neuronal countings, unpaired Student's <italic>t-</italic>test was used. Statistical significance was considered when <italic>p</italic>-values were as follows: *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005, ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, ****<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001.

<title>No differences in lipid subdomain localization are observed between PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 and WTPrP<sup>C</sup>.</title>
<p>(A) DRMs isolation of WTPrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1 mouse brain (n = 3 for each genotype) with a mixture of 0.5% Brij96 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. After extraction at 4°C and overnight centrifugation on a sucrose density gradient, twelve fractions were loaded on a gel. Flotillin is used as a marker for DRMs, whereas calnexin, a chaperone resident in the ER, is used as a marker of non-DRM fractions. Note that there no difference was found between controls and transgenic mice in the PrP solubilization pattern (quantifications are shown below). (B) Under the same conditions as in (A), Thy-1 stays in the DRMs (mainly in fractions 2 and 3). (C) Because myelin could impair the proper solubilization of the DRMs, in another set of experiments we depleted the samples from myelin and used the same procedure as in (A). Again, no differences in the solubilization pattern were seen by incubating with 0.5% Brij 96 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. With another detergent (Brij 98 at 37°C), although the isoform solubilization pattern differs between WTPrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>C</sup>GPIThy-1, no differences in the fraction distribution were observed.</p>
