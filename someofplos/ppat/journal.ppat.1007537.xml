<abstract>
<p>c-di-AMP is an important second messenger molecule that plays a pivotal role in regulating fundamental cellular processes, including osmotic and cell wall homeostasis in many Gram-positive organisms. In the opportunistic human pathogen <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, c-di-AMP is produced by the membrane-anchored DacA enzyme. Inactivation of this enzyme leads to a growth arrest under standard laboratory growth conditions and a re-sensitization of methicillin-resistant <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> (MRSA) strains to ß-lactam antibiotics. The gene coding for DacA is part of the conserved three-gene <italic>dacA/ybbR</italic>/<italic>glmM</italic> operon that also encodes the proposed DacA regulator YbbR and the essential phosphoglucosamine mutase GlmM, which is required for the production of glucosamine-1-phosphate, an early intermediate of peptidoglycan synthesis. These three proteins are thought to form a complex <italic>in vivo</italic> and, in this manner, help to fine-tune the cellular c-di-AMP levels. To further characterize this important regulatory complex, we conducted a comprehensive structural and functional analysis of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA and GlmM enzymes by determining the structures of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> GlmM enzyme and the catalytic domain of DacA. Both proteins were found to be dimers in solution as well as in the crystal structures. Further site-directed mutagenesis, structural and enzymatic studies showed that multiple DacA dimers need to interact for enzymatic activity. We also show that DacA and GlmM form a stable complex <italic>in vitro</italic> and that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> GlmM, but not <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> or <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> GlmM, acts as a strong inhibitor of DacA function without the requirement of any additional cellular factor. Based on Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) data, a model of the complex revealed that GlmM likely inhibits DacA by masking the active site of the cyclase and preventing higher oligomer formation. Together these results provide an important mechanistic insight into how c-di-AMP production can be regulated in the cell.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>c-di-AMP has recently emerged as an essential molecule in Gram-positive bacteria, controlling osmotic stress resistance and virulence. The molecule has also been linked to antibiotic resistance/sensitivity, as alterations in its levels have been shown to modulate the effect of cell wall-targeting antibiotics. c-di-AMP is produced and degraded by dedicated enzymes and the activities of these enzymes are tightly regulated in the cell for optimal bacterial growth. In the human pathogen <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, c-di-AMP is produced by the di-adenylate cyclase enzyme DacA, which is thought to form a complex and be regulated by YbbR and GlmM, two other conserved proteins. There are ongoing efforts to devise strategies to inhibit di-adenylate cyclase enzymes, as inhibition of c-di-AMP production will negatively impact bacterial growth and also re-sensitize methicillin-resistant <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> (MRSA) strains to ß-lactam antibiotics. Here, we investigated the activity and regulation of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> c-di-AMP cyclase DacA. We determined the atomic structures of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA and GlmM enzymes and show that GlmM readily binds to DacA <italic>in vitro</italic> and blocks its activity by masking its active site. With this, our work provides important insight into possible ways to ablate c-di-AMP production in bacterial cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>For pathogenic bacteria, the ability to rapidly adapt to the host cell environment or different host cell niches is essential for their infectivity. Nucleotide second-messenger molecules are critical components involved in such adaptive responses, allowing bacteria to simultaneously regulate multiple cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref001">1</xref>]. c-di-AMP has emerged as an important second-messenger, in particular in Gram-positive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref003">3</xref>]. Several recent studies have shown that c-di-AMP binds to and regulates cellular transport systems for potassium and osmolytes and in this manner likely controls the cellular turgor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref009">9</xref>]. Therefore c-di-AMP has an important role in preserving the integrity and viability of the cell when osmotic conditions change. Furthermore, in a number of Gram-positive bacteria, including the human pathogens <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, c-di-AMP impacts the susceptibility to ß-lactam antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref014">14</xref>]. More specifically, high cellular c-di-AMP levels lead to increased ß-lactam resistance and low cellular c-di-AMP levels to decreased resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref015">15</xref>]. Although the molecular mechanism behind this is still unclear, it has been suggested that c-di-AMP might at least in part impact ß-lactam resistance through its regulatory function of potassium and osmolyte transporters and changes in osmotic balance and pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref016">16</xref>]. These findings indicate that blocking c-di-AMP production could potentially be used to re-sensitize pathogens such as methicillin-resistant <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> (MRSA) strains to ß-lactam antibiotics. In order to exploit such strategies, a better knowledge of the structure and function of c-di-AMP synthesis enzymes and the modulation of their activity is required.</p>
<p>For optimal fitness, bacteria need to tightly regulate c-di-AMP production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref019">19</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref022">22</xref>]. Its cellular levels are regulated by the balance between its synthesis by dedicated di-adenylate cyclase enzymes (DacA in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>) and its degradation to pApA or AMP by specific phosphodiesterase enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref028">28</xref>]. These enzymes are part of three main classes, represented by DisA, DacA (CdaA) and CdaS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref029">29</xref>]. Structural and biochemical characterization of members of the different c-di-AMP cyclase families have revealed important information on their regulation. The first di-adenylate cyclase to be characterized was the DNA integrity scanning protein DisA from <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref023">23</xref>]. DisA is a modular cytoplasmic protein, in which the di-adenylate cyclase domain (from here on referred to as DAC domain) is linked by a helical linker region to a DNA-binding domain. The protein was present as an octamer (tetramer of dimers) in the crystal structure, with the DAC domains in a head-to-head conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref030">30</xref>]. DisA dependent c-di-AMP production is regulated through multiple mechanisms. Both, the interaction of DisA with the DNA repair protein RadA and the binding of the DisA-associated DNA-binding domain to damaged DNA, negatively impact its activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Besides DisA, the structure of the CdaS cyclase from <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> is available (PDB 2FB5) and the homologous proteins from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> have been characterized biochemically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref034">34</xref>]. The cyclase domain in CdaS proteins is preceded by an N-terminal regulatory YojJ domain that is composed of two long alpha-helices. The structural and biochemical analyses of CdaS proteins from different <italic>Bacillus</italic> species indicate that the protein is a hexamer in the crystal structure as well as in solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref034">34</xref>]. However, in contrast to the oligomeric DisA protein, the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> CdaS enzyme seemed to be only weakly active in this higher oligomeric form, as the DAC domains were not found in a head-to-head conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref033">33</xref>]. Deletion of the N-terminal regulatory helices of the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> CdaS protein disrupted hexamer formation, yielding protein dimers with high enzymatic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref033">33</xref>]. In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal regulatory domain in the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>thuringiensis</italic> CdaS protein greatly inhibited the enzymatic activity of this enzyme. Therefore, while it is clear that the c-di-AMP activity of CdaS-type proteins is regulated by the N-terminal YojJ domain, the exact regulatory mechanism is still unclear and might also differ between different <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp.</p>
<p>CdaA-type (DacA-type) enzymes are widely distributed among bacteria. As many important Gram-positive pathogens produce this type of cyclase, inhibiting the function of members of this class of enzyme will most likely have the biggest therapeutic potential. The soluble enzymatic domain of the membrane-bound CdaA enzyme from <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> has been crystallized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref035">35</xref>]. While the CdaA enzyme from <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> was present as a crystallographic tetramer in the structure, none of the subunits were engaged in a catalytically competent head-to-head conformation.</p>
<p>The <italic>cdaA</italic> genes (including <italic>dacA</italic> in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>) encoded by Firmicutes are located in a highly conserved three- or four-gene operon that includes the conserved genes <italic>ybbR</italic> and <italic>glmM</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref018">18</xref>], revealing a potentially interesting connection to cell wall biosynthesis. GlmM codes for the essential phosphoglucosamine mutase enzyme, required for the conversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate to the early peptidoglycan synthesis precursor glucosamine-1-phosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref037">37</xref>]. Recent work has highlighted a direct interaction between CdaA, YbbR and GlmM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref018">18</xref>]. Bacterial two-hybrid (B2H) assays performed with the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> or <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> proteins indicated that YbbR interacts with the transmembrane region of CdaA, whilst GlmM interacts with the cytoplasmic catalytic domain of CdaA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref038">38</xref>]. Further work in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic> indicated that the interaction of GlmM with CdaA leads to a decrease in the cellular levels of c-di-AMP, suggesting an inhibitory role of GlmM on the CdaA c-di-AMP cyclase enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref017">17</xref>]. However, biochemical and atomic level details of the GlmM/CdaA (DacA) interaction are currently lacking.</p>
<p>As part of this study, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> c-di-AMP cyclase DacA, including the interaction of GlmM with DacA, structurally and biochemically. We determined the structures of the two essential <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> enzymes, GlmM and the enzymatic domain of DacA and also showed that these proteins form a stable complex <italic>in vitro</italic> without the requirement of any additional factors. Upon binding, GlmM completely abolished the activity of the DacA cyclase enzyme, while GlmM activity was not significantly affected upon complex formation. SAXS envelope data of the purified DacA/GlmM complex allowed us to propose a molecular model for how GlmM inhibits the activity of the c-di-AMP cyclase by blocking access to its catalytic site. Thus, our study provides important new insight into how c-di-AMP production can be blocked, paving the way to devising new strategies to interfere with c-di-AMP production in important human pathogens such as <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>.</p>

<title>Apo-structure of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> c-di-AMP cyclase DacA<sub>CD</sub></title>
<p>The <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> c-di-AMP cyclase enzyme DacA has three N-terminal transmembrane helices, which are followed by the cytoplasmically located enzymatic DisA_N domain. To gain further insight into the function and catalytic mechanism of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> c-di-AMP cyclase DacA, the soluble catalytic domain starting from amino acid F101 (hereafter referred to as DacA<sub>CD</sub>) was expressed and purified as N-terminal His-tag fusion protein. Following removal of the His-tag, the protein was crystallized and the structure of the nucleotide-free DacA<sub>CD</sub> domain was obtained by molecular replacement using the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> CdaA protein (PDB 4RV7) as a search model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref035">35</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s010">S1 Table</xref>). The two proteins have an identify of 51.7% and the structures overlapped with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.438 Å. The <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub> protein displayed the expected globular fold, with a central β-sheet made up of 7 antiparallel strands flanked by 5 helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, left). While the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> CdaA<sub>CD</sub> protein was found to be a tetramer in the asymmetric unit (although dimeric in solution) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref035">35</xref>], the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub> was present as a symmetric dimer, with two protomers interacting via the backbone of α3, β2 and the loop connecting α3 and β3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). At the interface, residue N166 from one protomer formed a hydrogen bond interaction with residue T172 from the second protomer and a van der Waals interaction was formed between residue P173 and residues N166 and I165 of the neighbouring protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Further analysis using the PdbePISA program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref039">39</xref>] revealed a total buried surface area of 1450 Å<sup>2</sup> at the dimer interface with a ΔG (int) of -8.3 kcal/mol and a ΔG (diss) of 2.1 kcal/mol, indicative of a strong protein/protein interaction.</p>

<title>Structure of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub> bound to ApCpp</title>
<p>In order to condense two ATP molecules to c-di-AMP, two protomers need to be arranged in a head-to-head conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref035">35</xref>]. However, in the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub> dimer found in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, the active sites of the protomers are outward facing and hence are too far apart for c-di-AMP synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In addition, analysis of the crystal lattice did not reveal any symmetry-related molecule arranged with the catalytic sites in a head-to-head orientation. To determine whether nucleotide binding could trigger a conformational change of the protein leading to inter-protomer rearrangement, the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub> protein was crystallized in the presence of ApCpp, a non-hydrolyzable ATP substrate as well as 2 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>. Crystals were readily obtained and diffracted to 2.7Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s010">S1 Table</xref>). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the nucleotide-free <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub> domain as a search model. The DacA<sub>CD</sub> protein co-crystallized with ApCpp had the same dimeric arrangement as observed for the nucleotide-free protein, but extra densities for the ApCpp nucleotide were observed in each protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g001">Fig 1</xref>). As expected, the ApCpp molecule was found in the catalytic pocket with residues D176 and G177 interacting with the ribose moiety, residue T207 interacting with the phosphate backbone and residue Y192 engaged in a π-stacking interaction with the adenine base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, left). The overall protein structures of the nucleotide-free and the nucleotide-bound proteins were very similar and overlapped with an RMSD of 0.34 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Our data suggest that nucleotide binding does not trigger any major conformational changes leading to a rearrangement of the DacA<sub>CD</sub> dimer. However, we did observe a near head-to-head configuration of DacA<sub>CD</sub> by inspecting neighbouring molecules within the crystal lattice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). While the individual protomers in neighbouring units are too far apart to be engaged in a catalytic reaction, the data do suggest that the protein can form a catalytically active dimeric conformation by forming higher-order oligomers. Furthermore, overlaying the DacA<sub>CD</sub> -ApCpp structure with a dimer of the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> DisA structure highlighted that there is sufficient space for two <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub> dimers to interact in a head-to-head orientation as required for catalysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s001">S1B Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Enzymatic activity and characterization of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub> dimer interface</title>
<p>To determine whether the observed DacA<sub>CD</sub> dimer could be physiologically relevant and enzymatically active, we next performed enzyme activity assays using different DacA<sub>CD</sub> variants to test the relevance of the observed dimer interface. Two key interacting residues in the dimer interface are amino acids N166 and T172 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). To potentially disrupt this interaction, we mutated these two residues to lysines, yielding variant DacA<sub>CD</sub>-K. To “lock” the dimer conformation, we also mutated these residues to cysteines (DacA<sub>CD</sub>-C variant) to facilitate the formation of disulfide bonds between the two protomers. WT DacA<sub>CD</sub> and the DacA<sub>CD</sub>-K and DacA<sub>CD</sub>-C variants were purified and the oligomeric state of the proteins was estimated by size exclusion chromatography. The WT DacA<sub>CD</sub> and DacA<sub>CD</sub>-C variant had similar elution profiles and eluted at a retention volume as expected for a DacA<sub>CD</sub> dimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The main peak for the DacA<sub>CD</sub>-K variant eluted with the same retention volume as the WT DacA<sub>CD</sub> and DacA<sub>CD</sub>-C variants indicating that the protein was still able to form a dimer. However, additional faster and slower eluting peaks were observed for the DacA<sub>CD</sub>-K variant indicative of protein unfolding or aggregation (earlier eluting peak) and monomer formation (later eluting peak) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). These data indicate that introduction of lysine residues partially disrupts DacA<sub>CD</sub> dimer formation. To further assess if the DacA<sub>CD</sub>-C variant could form disulfide-bridge locked dimers, the purified protein was crystallized and its structure determined. The protein crystallized in the same dimeric conformation as the DacA<sub>CD</sub> protein and electron densities consistent with the formation of two disulfide bonds were observed for the DacA<sub>CD</sub>-C variant, which were absent in the DacA<sub>CD</sub> protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s010">S1 Table</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, the purified proteins were tested for enzyme activity by quantifying the conversion of α-P<sup>32</sup>-labelled ATP into P<sup>32</sup>-labelled c-di-AMP. First, the metal dependency of the WT DacA<sub>CD</sub> protein was assessed. To this end, DacA<sub>CD</sub> was incubated with ATP spiked with a small amount of α-P<sup>32</sup>-labelled ATP in buffers containing 1 or 10 mM of one of the divalent cations Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup>. After 4 h the reactions were stopped and the input ATP and c-di-AMP reaction product quantified by phosphorimaging. This analysis revealed that the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub> protein is most active in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and hence all subsequent experiments were performed in the presence of 10 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Next, a time course experiment was performed and the DacA<sub>CD</sub> enzyme displayed an <italic>in vitro</italic> catalytic activity with an average catalytic rate of 2.28x10<sup>-10</sup> M/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). This activity is slow, but consistent with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref023">23</xref>]. To assess the activity of the different DacA<sub>CD</sub> variants, enzyme activity assays were performed with the DacA<sub>CD</sub>, DacA<sub>CD</sub>-C, or DacA<sub>CD</sub>-K (either obtained from the predicted monomer or dimer peak) proteins. The DacA<sub>CD</sub>-C variant displayed very similar activity to the WT DacA<sub>CD</sub> protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), suggesting that locking the dimer through two disulfide bridges does not influence the activity of the enzyme. In contrast, the DacA<sub>CD</sub>-K variant derived either from the late eluting (predicted monomer) or earlier eluting (predicted dimer) peaks displayed very low activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). We reasoned that the activity loss could be due to an intrinsic instability of this protein variant. To test this, the stability of the DacA<sub>CD</sub>-K variant was assessed using a thermofluor assay and compared to that of the WT DacA<sub>CD</sub> and DacA<sub>CD</sub>-C variant. The melting curves for the DacA<sub>CD</sub> and DacA<sub>CD</sub>-C proteins were sigmoidal, which is typical for well-folded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). On the other hand, the DacA<sub>CD</sub>-K variant displayed high levels of fluorescence from the beginning of the melting curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), which is indicative of an unfolded protein and likely explains the low enzymatic activity of the DacA<sub>CD</sub>-K variant. Taken together, these data show that WT DacA<sub>CD</sub> and the ‘locked-dimer’ DacA<sub>CD</sub>-C variant show similar enzymatic activities, suggesting that the stable dimer we observed in our crystal structures will likely transiently interact with other dimers to form higher oligomers for catalysis and c-di-AMP product formation.</p>

<p>Results from <italic>in vivo</italic> crosslinking and bacterial two-hybrid experiments suggested that the phosphoglucosamine mutase GlmM can interact with the DacA homologs in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref018">18</xref>]. To assess whether the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub> protein can interact with the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> GlmM protein, a plasmid for the overexpression of a C-terminally His-tagged <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> GlmM protein (GlmM-His) was generated. Next, expression of the His-DacA<sub>CD</sub> and GlmM-His proteins was induced in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, the cells lysed and the proteins purified by Ni-affinity and size exclusion chromatography, or <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> lysates from His-DacA<sub>CD</sub> and GlmM-His overexpressing strains mixed before affinity and size exclusion chromatography. When the two proteins were purified together, a new faster eluting peak corresponding to a species of higher molecular weight and indicating the formation of a complex, was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). SDS-PAGE analysis of aliquots from the different elution fractions confirmed the co-elution of the His-DacA<sub>CD</sub> and GlmM-His proteins in the high molecular weight peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). To further confirm the interaction of DacA<sub>CD</sub> with GlmM <italic>in vitro</italic>, a pull-down assay was performed. For this purpose, the His-tag was removed from DacA<sub>CD</sub> and the purified tag-less protein subsequently mixed in equimolar amount with purified GlmM-His. The protein mixture was then applied to a Ni-NTA column and after two wash steps, bound proteins were eluted. The untagged DacA<sub>CD</sub> protein quantitatively co-eluted with GlmM-His, confirming the protein/protein interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). As control, the tag-less DacA<sub>CD</sub> protein was subjected to the same procedure in the absence of GlmM-His. In this case, the protein was found in the load and wash fractions. Taken together, these results show that DacA and GlmM can form a stable complex <italic>in vitro</italic>, and that the two proteins can be co-purified as a single species. To estimate the size and stoichiometry of the complex, the purified DacA<sub>CD</sub>-GlmM complex was further analyzed by SEC-MALS as well as native mass spectrometry. Based on the SEC-MALS elution profile, the complex had an estimated molecular weight of 129 kDa ± 0.4% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) and based on the native mass spectrometry analysis, the major species in the spectrum corresponded to a complex of 139.003 kDa ± 10.41 Da (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). These data are consistent with a DacA<sub>CD</sub>-GlmM complex comprising one GlmM dimer (theoretical mass 99.462 kDa) interacting with one DacA<sub>CD</sub> dimer (theoretical mass 19.374 kDa), with a theoretical molecular weight of 138.21 kDa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s011">S2 Table</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> GlmM is a negative regulator of DacA activity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>A study with <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic> indicated that GlmM might inhibit the activity of DacA upon binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref017">17</xref>]. To investigate this further, c-di-AMP production by the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub> enzyme was assessed in the absence or presence of GlmM. DacA<sub>CD</sub> was incubated alone or mixed at a 1:2 molar ratio with GlmM, and conversion of ATP to c-di-AMP assessed after 4 h incubation at 37°C. No ATP conversion was observed in the presence of GlmM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In a second experiment, a 2-fold molar excess of GlmM was added to a DacA<sub>CD</sub> reaction, 30 min after initiating the reaction, and the sample subsequently incubated for a further 150 min (180 min total reaction time). As controls, 30 and 180 min DacA<sub>CD</sub> enzyme reactions were also set up in the absence of GlmM. When GlmM was added 30 min following the initiation of the DacA<sub>CD</sub> enzymatic cycle, the production of c-di-AMP was arrested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Taken together, these data show that GlmM can effectively block the activity of the DacA<sub>CD</sub> cyclase domain <italic>in vitro</italic> without the need for any additional cofactors.</p>

<p>To investigate this further and confirm that GlmM can also inhibit the activity of the full-length membrane-anchored DacA enzyme, full-length DacA was expressed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> either alone, in the presence of YbbR or GlmM or in the presence of both, GlmM and YbbR, and c-di-AMP production assessed by ELISA. To this end, <italic>dacA</italic>, <italic>dacA-ybbR</italic> or the complete <italic>dacA-ybbR-glmM</italic> operon was cloned into plasmid pBAD33, allowing for arabinose inducible DacA, DacA/YbbR or DacA/YbbR/GlmM expression. For expression of DacA and GlmM only, the YbbR start codon was mutated and the <italic>dacA-no-ybbR-glmM</italic> operon inserted into plasmid pBAD33. Next, DacA and YbbR production from the different constructs was confirmed by western blot using protein-specific antibodies and GlmM production was assessed by visualizing proteins by Coomassie staining. With the exception of the empty vector control strain, similar DacA amounts were produced in all strains regardless whether or not YbbR, GlmM or YbbR and GlmM were co-expressed with the cyclase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). A clearly visible Coomassie stainable band of the expected size for GlmM was observed for the two strains overproducing GlmM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). YbbR production was also observed in the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain containing plasmids pBAD33-<italic>dacA-ybbR</italic> or pBAD33-<italic>dacA-ybbR-glmM</italic>. Mutating the YbbR start codon drastically reduced the production of YbbR but did not completely abolish its production, indicating that a second internal start codon might be utilized (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Next, the c-di-AMP production was assessed in the different strains. As expected, no c-di-AMP could be detected in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> containing the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). High amounts of c-di-AMP were detected upon DacA expression or expression of DacA/YbbR. On the other hand, c-di-AMP levels were drastically reduced upon co-expression of GlmM, which is consistent with the data reported by Zhu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref017">17</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Taken together, these data show that GlmM is a negative regulator of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> c-di-AMP cyclase DacA both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Of note, when GlmM activity was assessed <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of DacA<sub>CD</sub> using a previously reported coupled enzyme assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref040">40</xref>], no significant enzyme inhibition was observed. The specific activity of the pure GlmM enzyme was estimated at 15.9 ± 3.1 μmol/min/mg of protein in the assay conditions used. Addition of DacA in a 5- to 50-fold excess over GlmM did not at all inhibit the phosphoglucosamine mutase activity and its presence in 400-fold excess only led to a slight 15% reduction of GlmM activity. Taken together, these data indicate that only GlmM can impact the activity of the c-di-AMP cyclase enzyme but likely not <italic>vice versa</italic>.</p>

<title><italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> GlmM protein structure and small-angle X-ray scattering analysis of the DacA<sub>CD</sub>/GlmM complex</title>
<p>In order to gain structural information on the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub>/GlmM complex, we first set out to determine the structure of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> GlmM protein in isolation. To this end, the C-terminal His-tagged <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> GlmM protein was purified, the His-tag was removed, and the purified protein crystallized in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and glucosamine-6-P. The structure of GlmM was obtained by molecular replacement using the GlmM protein structure from <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> (PDB 3PDK) as a search model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref041">41</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g007">Fig 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s010">S1 Table</xref>). While the protein was crystallized in the presence of metal ion and substrate, no corresponding extra electron density was observed. The <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> GlmM protein and the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>anthracis</italic> protein, which share 67% identity on a protein level, displayed a similar fold and dimeric arrangement and the structures overlapped with an RMSD of 0.996 Å. One GlmM monomer consisted of four α-β domains with the fourth most C-terminal domain linked by a flexible loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Next, we attempted to crystallize and solve the structure of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub>/GlmM complex. While crystals were obtained under several conditions, poor diffraction prevented the structural determination of the complex. In order to gain structural information of the DacA/GlmM complex, the single proteins and complex were subjected to small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g008">Fig 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s006">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s007">S7</xref> Figs and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s012">S3 Table</xref>). The reconstructed model for the GlmM sample showed an elongated particle, consistent with the dimeric arrangement found in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g008">Fig 8B</xref>) and with previously published findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref042">42</xref>]. In the case of DacA, the model was most consistent with the particle being a DacA<sub>CD</sub> dimer, however an extra density was observed to one extremity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g008">Fig 8A</xref>), which we speculate is due to the presence of extra N-terminal amino acids, not visible in the X-ray structure, and hence appear as a flexible and unstructured region of the protein. The reconstructed envelope of the complex displays a bigger particle size as compared to GlmM dimer alone, consistent with a DacA<sub>CD</sub> dimer interacting with a GlmM dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). A sequential fitting of the GlmM dimer structure followed by the fitting of the DacA dimer structure into the SAXS envelope of the complex with Chimera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref043">43</xref>] yielded the best fit for a model with a correlation score of 0.9196 in which a DacA dimer is positioned on top of a GlmM dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). In this model, the active sites of DacA protomers are occluded through binding to the GlmM protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g008">Fig 8D</xref>), while the GlmM active sites are still accessible. To validate the SAXS analysis, the reconstructed envelopes were used to calculate theoretical Collision Cross Section (CCS) values using the program EM∩IM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref044">44</xref>]. These theoretical values were subsequently compared to those experimentally determined by Ion-Mobility Mass Spectrometry. The theoretical values agree with the CCS determination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s013">S4 Table</xref>), showing that the structural models of DacA, GlmM and their complex obtained by SAXS correspond to the shapes of the proteins in solution. Taken together, our model provides an explanation as to how the interaction of DacA with GlmM inhibits c-di-AMP production without affecting the activity of the GlmM enzyme.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have determined the structures of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> enzymes DacA and GlmM and provide structural and functional information on the complex formed between these two enzymes. Previously, these enzymes have been shown to interact, and using the information obtained here, we can now propose a speculative molecular mechanism for the regulation of the cyclase activity of DacA by GlmM. Specifically, our data suggest that GlmM blocks access to the active site of DacA and in this manner prevents the formation of catalytically active head-to-head DacA oligomers.</p>

The <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub> catalytic domain investigated as part of this study has, as expected, a very similar overall fold to the enzymatic domain of the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> CdaA cyclase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref035">35</xref>]. However, there were also notable and interesting differences. As expected, the side chains of amino acids D176 and G177 in the HDG motif and T207 before the RHR motif in the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub> enzyme made contacts with the ribose and the phosphate backbone of ApCpp, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g001">Fig 1</xref>). However, in addition to these residues, we also observe an additional π-stacking interaction between residue Y192 and the adenine base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g001">Fig 1</xref>) in the DacA<sub>CD</sub>-ApCpp structure. This residue is located in a loop region between ß4 and α4. A structure-based alignment using STRAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref046">46</xref>] showed that this residue is not conserved in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>maritima</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> DisA proteins, or in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cereus</italic> CdaS, but present in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> CdaA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). This indicates that this residue could potentially play an important role in fine-tuning c-di-AMP production in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> and other DacA/CdaA-containing bacteria by affecting the binding of the nucleotide substrate.</p>
<p>Similar to other c-di-AMP cyclases, which require a metal ion as cofactor (usually Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup> and/or Co<sup>2+</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref047">47</xref>], we found that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub> has the highest <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme activity in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, followed by Mg<sup>2+</sup> and was least active in the presence of Co<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This is very similar to what has been described for the <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> c-di-AMP cyclase Rv3586 (a DisA family enzyme), but differs from what has been reported for the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> CdaA enzyme, which was most active in the presence of Co<sup>2+</sup>, whereas Mg<sup>2+</sup> did not support enzyme catalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref047">47</xref>]. In addition to ATP, for some c-di-AMP cyclases it has been shown that ADP can also be used as substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref047">47</xref>]. Interestingly, when the <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> c-di-AMP cyclase Rv3586 was provided with ADP as substrate, the highest activity was seen in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, rather than Mn<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref047">47</xref>]. While the actual metal preference and requirement for the activity of c-di-AMP cyclases <italic>in vivo</italic> is not known, it is conceivable that metal ion availability as well as substrate availability (ATP versus ADP) might be an important factor in adjusting c-di-AMP levels in the cell.</p>
<p>c-di-AMP cyclase enzymes form higher-order oligomeric complexes in solution. The CdaS- and DisA-type enzymes form hexamers and octamers, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref034">34</xref>], whereas the catalytic domain of the <italic>L</italic>. <italic>monocytogenes</italic> cyclase CdaA was reported to be a dimer in solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref035">35</xref>]. Indeed, for the c-di-AMP condensation reaction to take place, the enzyme requires two catalytic sites in a symmetric head-to-head conformation. Here, we show that the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub> protein is a dimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s002">S2 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g008">Fig 8</xref>). However, based on the data presented in this study, we suggest that this dimer is not the active unit per se, as the protomers are not found in a head-to-head conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We propose that multiple dimers need to form higher oligomers (e.g. tetramers) in order to produce c-di-AMP (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g009">9</xref>). Therefore, by regulating the ability of DacA<sub>CD</sub> to form higher oligomers its activity can be regulated and as discussed below, we proposed that this is the mechanism by which GlmM inhibits the activity of DacA.</p>

<title>Proposed model of DacA inhibition by GlmM.</title>
<p>(Left) For active c-di-AMP synthesis, two (or more) DacA dimers interact forming catalytically active head-to-head oligomers. (Right) When GlmM binds to a DacA dimer, we speculate that this will prevent DacA from forming higher oligomers thereby turning off c-di-AMP production. GlmM dimer is colored in purple and a DacA dimer is colored in cyan (chain A) and brown (chain B). Bound ATP is colored in yellow. DacA transmembrane helices are modeled on the membrane plane and connected to the N-terminal helices of the DacA<sub>CD</sub> domain by dashed lines.</p>

<p>The same inactive (non-head-to-head) dimer conformation as observed in our DacA<sub>CD</sub> structure has also been observed in the hexamer model of the CdaS di-adenylate cyclase from <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. (PDB 2FB5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref033">33</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Mehne <italic>et al</italic>. proposed that the hexamerization of CdaS is driven by two sets of interactions: the interactions between the two N-terminal helices (YojJ domain) and the interactions between residues found at the dimer interface between two DAC domains. The latter interactions are similar the ones we observed in the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub> dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007537.s009">S9 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref033">33</xref>]. After deletion of the N-terminal helices, the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> CdaS enzyme formed dimers in solution and this truncated protein had high catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref033">33</xref>]. However, it was not further investigated if the CdaS dimers were the active unit or if they still needed to undergo higher oligomerization to be catalytically active, similar to what we observed for the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub> enzyme. While for the DisA-type enzyme it seems clear that the enzymatically active form is an octamer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref023">23</xref>], additional studies are needed to determine in which oligomeric state CdaS- and CdaA/DacA-type c-di-AMP cyclases function <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>The membrane-anchored DacA/CdaA-type c-di-AMP cyclase enzyme is encoded in a conserved three or four gene operon together with the predicted cyclase regulator YbbR (CdaR) and the phosphoglucosamine mutase enzyme GlmM producing the essential peptidoglycan synthesis intermediate glucosamine-1-P [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref048">48</xref>]. Indeed, for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> it has been shown that all three genes are co-expressed from an upstream promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref049">49</xref>]. However, a second internal promoter is present in front of <italic>glmM</italic> suggesting that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> produces higher GlmM protein levels as compared to DacA and YbbR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref049">49</xref>]. It is thought that both GlmM and YbbR can regulate the activity of the cyclase DacA/CdaA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref018">18</xref>]; however, for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> we could not find conclusive evidence for a regulatory function of YbbR in this nor in a previous study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g005">Fig 5</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref012">12</xref>]. Recently, the first experimental evidence that the c-di-AMP cyclase DacA (CdaA), GlmM and YbbR (CdaR) form a three-protein complex was obtained in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> and <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref018">18</xref>]. The data presented here provide the first structural insight into this regulatory complex and further mechanistic information. Consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> work in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref017">17</xref>], we show that the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> GlmM protein (but not the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli or P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> GlmM proteins) is a strong negative regulator of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> cyclase DacA<sub>CD</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Since we performed this work <italic>in vitro</italic> with purified proteins, it shows that no additional components are required for this inhibitory function.</p>
<p>Our SAXS envelope data are most consistent with the formation of a complex in which a DacA<sub>CD</sub> dimer sits on top of the GlmM dimer, forming a dimer of dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g008">Fig 8</xref>). The resolution of our SAXS reconstruction is too low to infer specific amino acid interactions between DacA<sub>CD</sub> and GlmM or to assess any conformational changes of DacA<sub>CD</sub> upon GlmM binding. However, the data are of sufficient quality to construct models of the of DacA<sub>CD</sub>-GlmM complex. In our model, the DacA<sub>CD</sub> active sites in both protomers are capped by the α<sub>5</sub> helix of GlmM and neighbouring residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007537.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Hence the interaction of the GlmM dimer with the DacA<sub>CD</sub> dimer will prevent DacA<sub>CD</sub> from forming higher oligomers required for activity. In addition, the interaction of GlmM with DacA<sub>CD</sub> could potentially block the binding of substrate to DacA<sub>CD</sub>. Interestingly, positioned next to the α<sub>5</sub> helix in GlmM is residue F155, which in a previous study was shown to modulate the GlmM-CdaA interaction in <italic>L</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref017">17</xref>]. Our SAXS-based model provides now a molecular rational as to why a residue in this position could modulate complex formation and hence cyclase activity.</p>
<p>Within bacterial cells, the GlmM/DacA complex will likely be dynamic and in this manner allowing for c-di-AMP levels to be adjusted based on to environmental signals. It is conceivable that depending on the cellular levels of the substrate or product for GlmM (glucosamine-6-P and glucosamine-1-P, respectively), the ability of GlmM to interact with DacA changes and that in this manner c-di-AMP production is synchronized with the production of peptidoglycan precursors. GlmM functions in a pathway together with GlmS, which produces the GlmM substrate glucosamine-6-P and converts as part of this reaction glutamine to glutamate, and GlmU, which acts after GlmM and produces UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine. It is also possible that the GlmM/DacA interaction could be affected by the activity of GlmS and GlmU and availability of their substrates. This possibility is intriguing, as previous studies have revealed an impact of cellular glutamine, glutamate and UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine levels on the cellular c-di-AMP levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007537.ref050">50</xref>].</p>
<p>Taken together, our results provide the first structural characterization of the DacA/GlmM complex providing mechanistic insight into how c-di-AMP production is controlled directly at the synthesis level through the binding of GlmM to DacA. Additional work is needed to better understand the dynamics of this complex, in particular in the context of the bacterial membrane and how this regulatory complex can be modulated by cellular or external stimuli.</p>

<title>DacA<sub>CD</sub> enzyme activity assay</title>
<p>To assess the metal dependency of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> DacA<sub>CD</sub> enzyme, enzyme reactions were set up as follows: 2 μl of 10X reaction buffer (400 mM Hepes pH 7, 1 M NaCl, 100 mM or 10 mM of MgCl<sub>2</sub>, CoCl<sub>2</sub> or MnCl<sub>2</sub>) was mixed on ice with 13.6 μl of water and 2 μl of 1 mM ATP. Next, 2 μl of DacA<sub>CD</sub> from a 50 μM stock solution and 0.4 μl of α-P<sup>32</sup>-labelled ATP (Perkin Elmer—3.3 μM, 250 μCi) were then added to the sample yielding a final reaction volume of 20 μl. The reactions were incubated at 37°C for 4 h. Reactions were stopped by heating for 5 min at 95°C and the conversion of ATP to c-di-AMP assessed by spotting 1 μl of each reaction onto a TLC plate (Millipore). The nucleotides were separated using a 3.52 M (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and 1.5 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (mixed in a 1:1.5 v/v ratio) buffer system, the TLC plate were subsequently dried and the radioactive signal detected using a Typhoon FLA 700 imager. The bands corresponding to radioactive ATP and c-di-AMP were quantified using the ImageQuant software and the % ATP to c-di-AMP conversion calculated. As the highest enzyme activity was seen in the presence of MnCl<sub>2</sub>, all subsequent enzyme reactions were set up in reaction buffer containing a final concentration of 10 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>. For the time course experiment, 100-μl reactions were set and 10-μl aliquots removed at the indicated time point and stopped by heating. The activity of the DacA<sub>CD</sub>-K and DacA<sub>CD</sub>-C variants was assessed by setting up 20-μl reactions as described above using a final protein concentration of 5 μM and incubating the reactions for 4 h at 37°C. To analyze the ATP conversion of DacA<sub>CD</sub> when bound to GlmM, 2 μl of GlmM from a 100 μM stock solution was added to a standard enzyme reaction yielding a DacA<sub>CD</sub>:GlmM molar ratio of 1:2 and the reactions were incubated for 4 h at 37°C. To evaluate the impact of the addition of GlmM when added to an ongoing DacA<sub>CD</sub> enzyme reaction, 2 μl of GlmM from a 100 μM stock solution were added 30 min after initiating the reaction and the reaction was incubation for a further 2 h.
