<abstract>
<p>Apicomplexan parasites are auxotrophic for a range of amino acids which must be salvaged from their host cells, either through direct uptake or degradation of host proteins. Here, we describe a family of plasma membrane-localized amino acid transporters, termed the Apicomplexan Amino acid Transporters (ApiATs), that are ubiquitous in apicomplexan parasites. Functional characterization of the ApiATs of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> indicate that several of these transporters are important for intracellular growth of the tachyzoite stage of the parasite, which is responsible for acute infections. We demonstrate that the ApiAT protein <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 is an exchanger for aromatic and large neutral amino acids, with particular importance for L-tyrosine scavenging and amino acid homeostasis, and that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 is critical for parasite virulence. Our data indicate that <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> expresses additional proteins involved in the uptake of aromatic amino acids, and we present a model for the uptake and homeostasis of these amino acids. Our findings identify a family of amino acid transporters in apicomplexans, and highlight the importance of amino acid scavenging for the biology of this important phylum of intracellular parasites.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The Apicomplexa comprise a large number of parasitic protozoa that have obligate intracellular lifestyles and cause significant human and animal diseases, including malaria, cryptosporidiosis, toxoplasmosis, coccidiosis in poultry, and various cattle fevers. Apicomplexans must scavenge essential nutrients from their hosts in order to proliferate and cause disease, including a range of amino acids. The direct uptake of these nutrients is presumed to be mediated by transporter proteins located in the plasma membrane of intracellular stages, although the identities of these proteins are poorly defined. Using a combination of bioinformatic, genetic, cell biological, and physiological approaches, we have characterized an apicomplexan-specific family of plasma membrane-localized transporter proteins that we have called the Apicomplexan Amino acid Transporters (ApiATs). We show that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3, a member of the family in the apicomplexan <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, is an exchanger for aromatic and large neutral amino acids. In particular, it is critical for uptake of tyrosine, and for parasite virulence in a mouse infection model. We conclude that ApiATs are a family of plasma membrane transporters that play crucial roles in amino acid scavenging by apicomplexan parasites.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Apicomplexans are intracellular parasites that cause a range of diseases in humans and animals, imposing a major health and economic burden on many countries. In humans, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species are the causative agents of malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref001">1</xref>], while <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> is a major cause of diarrheal disease and death in children in the developing world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref002">2</xref>]. <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> can infect virtually all nucleated cells in warm-blooded animals, and is thought to chronically infect one-third of the world’s human population. <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> infections are usually asymptomatic, but infection in immunocompromised patients may lead to life-threatening toxoplasmic encephalitis, and congenital toxoplasmosis may result in severe birth defects or death of the developing fetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>A common feature of parasites is that they rely on their hosts to supply them with the nutrients necessary for their growth and replication, such as sugars, amino acids, nucleosides, and vitamins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref006">6</xref>]. Transporters are integral membrane proteins that facilitate the transfer of substrates across biological membranes. In apicomplexans, transporters provide the major route for the acquisition of nutrients and the removal of waste products across the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref007">7</xref>], and these proteins are important for parasite survival and virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref009">9</xref>]. Despite this, the transporters responsible for the uptake of many essential nutrients in apicomplexans have not been defined.</p>
<p>A family of Novel Putative Transporters (the NPT family) was initially identified in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> using a bioinformatics approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref010">10</xref>]. The five <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> NPT family proteins were predicted to be polytopic membrane proteins with a secondary structure characteristic of solute transporters, although they have limited sequence similarity to other eukaryotic or prokaryotic transporters. The NPT family protein <italic>Pb</italic>NPT1 localizes to the plasma membrane of the mouse malaria-causing parasite <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic>, and is essential for gametocyte development in the murine host and subsequent mosquito transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref011">11</xref>]. Other <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> NPT family proteins, <italic>Pb</italic>MFR4 and <italic>Pb</italic>MFR5, are essential for progression through the insect stages of the life cycle, while <italic>Pb</italic>MFR2 and <italic>Pb</italic>MFR3 are important for exflagellation of male gametes and sporozoite formation, respectively, but are not essential for completion of the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref008">8</xref>]. A saturation mutagenesis screen revealed that all five NPTs in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> are dispensable for the growth of asexual blood stages of the parasite under <italic>in vitro</italic> culture conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref012">12</xref>]. In <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic>, <italic>Tg</italic>NPT1 localizes to the plasma membrane and is essential for parasite growth and virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref009">9</xref>]. Both <italic>Pb</italic>NPT1 and <italic>Tg</italic>NPT1 are cationic amino acid transporters, with <italic>Pb</italic>NPT1 functioning as a general cationic amino acid transporter and <italic>Tg</italic>NPT1 functioning as a selective arginine transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref009">9</xref>]. The functions of other NPT-family proteins are not known, although one member of the family has been associated with susceptibility to the anti-<italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> drug sinefungin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we have demonstrated that the NPTs are phylogenetically related, and broadly distributed within the apicomplexan phylum. We have characterized the NPT family proteins in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic>, demonstrating that 10 of the sixteen members of the family are expressed in the disease-causing tachyzoite stage of the parasite, and that the majority of these localize to the parasite periphery. We have demonstrated that at least three of these proteins are important for <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of the parasite. Using a combination of genetic, physiological and heterologous expression approaches, we have shown that one of the previously uncharacterized <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> NPT-family members transports aromatic and large neutral amino acids, and that this transporter is particularly important for the uptake of tyrosine into the parasite.

Using this search strategy, we were unable to identify ApiAT family proteins in chromerids. Using <italic>Pb</italic>NPT1 as a search query in profile hidden Markov Model searches, we identified the LAT3 and LAT4 proteins from humans (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmmer.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://hmmer.org</ext-link>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref017">17</xref>]; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).

<p>To determine the phylogenetic relationships between ApiAT family proteins, we constructed a multiple sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).

<title>CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of ApiAT-encoding genes identifies three family members that are important for parasite growth</title>
<p>To determine the importance of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiATs for parasite growth, we attempted to genetically disrupt all sixteen <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> ApiATs using a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref025">25</xref>]. With this strategy, we were able to disrupt fifteen of the sixteen <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s012">S2 Table</xref>). The mutant parasites all had frameshift mutations that will lead to the production of truncated (and likely non-functional) proteins. We refer to each of these mutants on the basis of which amino acids will be absent from the final protein (e.g. <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 encodes a protein of 504 amino acids; the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 mutant is truncated from residue 188 and is referred to as <italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup><italic>Δ188–504</italic></sup>). <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT1 could only be disrupted when parasites were grown in excess arginine, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref009">9</xref>]. We were unable to generate frameshift mutations in <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT6-1 after screening 12 clones from three separate transfections of a guide RNA targeting the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT6-1 locus.

<p>Our previous data indicated that some ApiAT family proteins transport amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref009">9</xref>].

<p><italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT proteins that are important for parasite growth are likely to have critical roles in nutrient acquisition. In the remainder of this manuscript, we focus on one such protein, <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3. Our previous study of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT1 and <italic>Pb</italic>ApiAT8-1 indicated a key role for these transporters in cationic amino acid uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref009">9</xref>], and we hypothesized that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 could also function as an amino acid transporter. To investigate this possibility, we incubated WT and <italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup><italic>Δ188–504</italic></sup> parasites in medium containing a mixture of [<sup>13</sup>C]-labelled amino acids for 15 mins. Polar metabolites were extracted from parasite lysates and analyzed by GC-MS. These analyses were used to quantitate the levels of intracellular amino acids and determine the extent of labeling with exogenous amino acids based on [<sup>13</sup>C]-enrichment in each of the two strains. Strikingly, both the abundance and fractional labelling of [<sup>13</sup>C]-L-tyrosine (L-Tyr) was reduced significantly in the <italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup><italic>Δ188–504</italic></sup> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g004">Fig 4</xref>).

The levels of several other amino acids were reduced in the <italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup><italic>Δ188–504</italic></sup> mutant, although the differences were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), possibly reflecting differences in the growth rate and physiological state of the two lines. In support of this notion, the rate of turnover of these amino acids, as indicated by rate of <sup>13</sup>C-enrichment in intracellular pools was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).

Under the conditions of the experiment, there was a significant, 7-fold increase in the initial uptake rate of [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr into oocytes expressing <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 compared to uninjected control oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Timecourse for the uptake of L-Tyr into <italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> oocytes expressing <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 (squares) or into uninjected oocytes (circles). Uptake was measured in the presence of 1 mM L-Tyr containing 0.5 μCi/ml [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr. Each data point represents the mean uptake in 10 oocytes from a single experiment ± standard deviation, and the data are representative of 3 independent experiments. A first order rate equation was fitted to each timecourse (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.97 for <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3-expressing oocytes and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.77 for uninjected controls). Both the rate constant for L-Tyr uptake and the maximal L-Tyr uptake measured in <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3-expressing oocytes were significantly higher than those measured in uninjected oocytes (P &lt; 0.01, Student’s <italic>t</italic> tests). (B) <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3-expressing oocytes (squares) and uninjected oocytes (circles) were preloaded (P.L.) with L-Tyr by incubation in 2.5 mM unlabelled L-Tyr (filled symbols) for 32 or 72 hr, respectively, or not preloaded (open symbols). Following the preincubation period, uptake of L-Tyr was measured in a solution of 1 mM L-Tyr containing 0.5 μCi/ml [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr. Data show the mean uptake in 10 oocytes from a single experiment ± standard deviation, and are representative of 3 independent experiments. First order rate equations were fitted to the uptake timecourses for the preloaded and non-preloaded <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3-injected oocytes (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.98 for preloaded, and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.95 for non-preloaded oocytes). Both the first order rate constants for L-Tyr uptake and the maximal L-Tyr uptake were significantly higher in preloaded compared to non-preloaded <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3-expressing oocytes (P &lt; 0.01, Student’s <italic>t</italic> tests). (C) <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3-expressing oocytes were preloaded by incubation in 1 mM L-Tyr containing 0.5 μCi/ml [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr for 32 hr. Subsequent efflux (filled symbols) and retention (open symbols) of the preloaded substrate was measured over the timecourse indicated, in the presence of an extracellular medium containing 2.5 mM L-Tyr (squares) or extracellular medium lacking of L-Tyr (circles). Data show the mean efflux and retention ± standard deviation in 3 replicates (measuring efflux/retention from 5 oocytes each) from a single experiment, and are representative of 3 independent experiments. (D) <italic>Trans</italic>-stimulated initial rate kinetic analysis of L-Tyr transport by <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3. The rate of L-Tyr uptake was measured at a range of [L-Tyr] concentrations in the external medium (i.e. [L-Tyr]<sub>cis</sub>) in <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3-expressing oocytes preloaded with 0 mM to 2.5 mM L-Tyr (i.e. [L-Tyr]<sub>trans</sub>). The <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3-mediated uptake (calculated by subtracting the uptake in uninjected oocytes from the uptake in <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3-expressing oocytes) at each [L-Tyr]<sub>trans</sub> condition tested conformed to a Michaelis-Menten kinetic model (R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.90 for all non-linear regressions). The data were fitted to a Scatchard linear regression (0.89 ≤ R<sup>2</sup> ≤ 0.98 for all linear regressions). Data show the mean uptake rate ± standard deviation in 10 oocytes from a single experiment, and are representative of 2 independent experiments.</p>

<p>To investigate the possibility that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 has exchange activity, we tested whether the uptake of [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr was stimulated by the presence of amino acids on the <italic>trans</italic> side of the membrane (i.e. <italic>inside</italic> the oocyte). Following preliminary experiments to optimise the preloading of L-Tyr into oocytes, we measured [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr uptake over 2 hr at an extracellular concentration of 1 mM L-Tyr in <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 cRNA-injected or uninjected oocytes that had been pre-loaded in medium containing 2.5 mM unlabelled L-Tyr. The initial rate of [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr uptake in <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3-expressing oocytes preloaded with L-Tyr was 3-fold higher than in <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3-expressed oocytes that were not pre-loaded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), indicating that L-Tyr uptake into <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3-expressing oocytes was stimulated by L-Tyr on the <italic>trans</italic> side of the membrane.</p>
<p>We next tested whether L-Tyr efflux was also <italic>trans</italic>-stimulated. We preloaded <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3-expressing and uninjected oocytes with radiolabelled L-Tyr and measured the efflux and retention of the radiolabel upon the addition of 2.5 mM unlabelled L-Tyr to the external medium. [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr efflux was increased, and [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr retention reduced, in <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3-expressing oocytes exposed to 2.5 mM L-Tyr compared to those in external medium lacking L-Tyr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Nevertheless, there was some [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr efflux over time in the absence of <italic>trans</italic>-substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), indicating that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 can mediate unidirectional flux of L-Tyr. We observed no differences in [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr efflux or retention in control uninjected oocytes upon incubation of oocytes in 2.5 mM L-Tyr compared to incubation in buffer lacking L-Tyr (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). These data indicate that the transporter operates more effectively under ‘exchange conditions’ than under conditions in which it is mediating a unidirectional flux.</p>
<p>To examine the exchange activity of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 further, we investigated the kinetic properties of L-Tyr transport in more detail. Steady-state kinetic parameters for exchangers must be conducted at different <italic>trans</italic>- and <italic>cis</italic>-substrate concentrations to determine accurate K<sub>0.5</sub> values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref026">26</xref>]. We examined the kinetics for the uptake of [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr following the preloading of oocytes with different L-Tyr concentrations (note that this, and all subsequent, uptake measurements were conducted over 10 min, which falls within the initial, approximately linear, phase of the influx timecourse; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Both Michaelis-Menten analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007577.t001">Table 1</xref>) and Scatchard linear regressions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g005">Fig 5D</xref>) demonstrated that the apparent K<sub>0.5</sub> values for L-Tyr uptake into oocytes was unaffected by the cytosolic L-Tyr concentration. The gradients of fitted Scatchard plots are negative reciprocals of the apparent K<sub>0.5</sub> and, therefore, equivalent slopes reflect similar apparent substrate affinities. K<sub>0.5</sub> values were consistent for both Scatchard and Michaelis-Menten plots derived from the same data, ranging from 0.25 to 0.40 μM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007577.t001">Table 1</xref>). As expected for <italic>trans</italic>-stimulated uptake, maximum rate (V<sub>max</sub>) values increased in proportion to the concentration of preloaded L-Tyr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g005">Fig 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007577.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess whether <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 might function as an ion:amino acid co-transporter, we conducted systematic ion-replacement uptake experiments as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref009">9</xref>]. We observed no significant change in [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr uptake under any ion-replacement conditions, suggesting that the transporter does not co-transport any of the ions tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s006">S6C Fig</xref>). To determine whether <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 is an electrogenic transporter (as is the case for <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref009">9</xref>]), we perfused oocytes expressing <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 with L-Tyr and measured the electrical current across the oocyte plasma membrane using a two-electrode voltage clamp configuration. We observed no net current under any of the conditions tested, including those in which the membrane potential and pH gradient across the membrane were altered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s006">S6D Fig</xref>). Together, these data indicate that L-Tyr transport by <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 does not co-transport any charged species.</p>
<p>Incubation of WT and <italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup><italic>Δ188–504</italic></sup> parasites in a [<sup>13</sup>C]-amino acid mix resulted in significant increases or decreases in the <sup>13</sup>C-labelling of several amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g004">Fig 4</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 may transport a range of amino acids. To investigate the substrate specificity of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 further, we measured the uptake of 500 μM [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr in oocytes expressing <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 in the presence of equimolar amounts of unlabelled L-amino acids on the <italic>cis</italic> side of the membrane. Only unlabelled L-tryptophan (L-Trp) caused a significant reduction of L-Tyr uptake under the conditions tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). To examine the <italic>trans</italic>-stimulated influx specificity of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3, we pre-injected mixtures of L-amino acids and other metabolites into oocytes expressing <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3, then measured uptake of [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr. <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3-mediated [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr uptake was <italic>trans</italic>-stimulated by pre-injected mixtures of L-amino acids, but not amino acid derivatives, D-amino acids, nucleotides, nitrogenous bases, or sugars (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s007">S7B Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s014">S4 Table</xref>). To identify which amino acids might be responsible for this <italic>trans</italic>-stimulation, we pre-injected oocytes expressing <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 with 19 of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, each to a final concentration of 5 mM. The one exception was L-Tyr which, in light of its low solubility, was preloaded to equilibrium instead of being injected. After pre-injecting or preloading of the amino acids, we measured the <italic>trans</italic>-stimulated uptake of [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr. We found that aromatic and large neutral amino acids, but not smaller or charged amino acids, <italic>trans</italic>-stimulated [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).</p>

<p>We tested the uptake of a range of [<sup>14</sup>C]-labelled aromatic and large neutral amino acids, including L-Trp, L-histidine (L-His), L-phenylalanine (L-Phe), L-leucine (L-Leu) and L-isoleucine (L-Ile), into oocytes expressing <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3. In the absence of a trans substrate, the rates of uptake of aromatic and large neutral amino acids were significantly increased compared to uninjected oocytes (1.7-fold increase for L-Trp, 3.1-fold increase for L-His, 5.5-fold increase for L-Phe, 2.2-fold increase for L-Leu, and 2.4-fold increase for L-Ile; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). The uptake of the cationic amino acid L-Arg did not differ between <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 injected and uninjected oocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s007">S7C Fig</xref>).

We next measured efflux of preloaded [<sup>14</sup>C]-labelled L-Tyr, L-Trp, L-His, L-Phe and L-Leu in the presence of all 20 proteinogenic amino acids in the extracellular medium. We observed the same substrate specificity, with aromatic and large neutral L-amino acids stimulating the efflux of the [<sup>14</sup>C]-labelled substrates tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).</p>
<p>From the experiments conducted in this section, we conclude that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 mediates the transport of aromatic and large neutral amino acids.

<title><italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 is important for tyrosine uptake into parasites</title>
<p>The [<sup>13</sup>C] amino acid uptake data and oocyte experiments indicate a role for <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 in L-Tyr uptake into the parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g004">Fig 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g005">Fig 5</xref>).

<p>To assess the physiological importance of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3-mediated L-Phe uptake for parasite growth, WT, <italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup><italic>Δ188–504</italic></sup> and complemented parasites were cultivated in medium containing 0 to 10 mM L-Phe (at a constant [L-Tyr] of 2.5 mM).

These data indicate that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 is required for parasite growth at both low and high exogenous concentrations of L-Phe, but not at intermediate concentrations.

<p>We next measured the growth of WT, <italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup><italic>Δ188–504</italic></sup> and complemented parasites in medium containing 0–2 mM L-Trp (and a constant [L-Tyr] of 2.5 mM).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Parasites must scavenge essential amino acids from their environment, although, in the case of apicomplexan parasites, how they do so is poorly understood. We showed recently that uptake of cationic amino acids in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> is mediated by members of a family of polytopic membrane transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref009">9</xref>]. Here, we have investigated the function of other members of this family and show that one of these proteins, <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 functions is an aromatic amino acid transporter. Based in these findings, we have renamed this family of proteins <underline>Api</underline>complexan <underline>A</underline>mino acid <underline>T</underline>ransporters (ApiATs).</p>
<p>The ApiAT protein family is found in all apicomplexan species that we analysed. The similarity of ApiATs to mammalian LAT3/4-type amino acid transporters suggests that the ancestral function of ApiATs was amino acid transport. The ApiATs appear to have undergone expansion in various apicomplexan lineages, including <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> and piroplasms such as <italic>Babesia</italic> spp and <italic>Theileria</italic> spp, whereas only a single representative is present in <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp, an early-diverging lineage of apicomplexans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref030">30</xref>]. These observations are consistent with ancestral apicomplexans having a single ApiAT protein that diversified in various lineages of the phylum to encompass new and/or more discriminating amino acid substrate selectivities.</p>
<p>A similar expansion has been observed in the amino acid/auxin permease (AAAP) family of trypanosomatid parasites, in which fourteen AAAP genes arose from a single AAAP gene locus through a series of gene duplication events in ancestral trypanosomatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref031">31</xref>]. AAAP expansion is likely to reflect an early parasitic innovation that contributed to establishing parasite dependency on the host organism, and thereby facilitating the evolution of parasitism in trypanosomatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref032">32</xref>]. By contrast, much of the expansion in the ApiAT family appears to have occurred subsequent to the diversification of the major lineages in the phylum. Of the eleven ApiAT subfamilies that we define, only the ApiAT2 subfamily is broadly distributed amongst the major apicomplexan lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g001">Fig 1</xref>), suggesting its presence before these lineages diverged. Several subfamilies have undergone expansion within lineages. For example, the ApiAT3, 5, 6 and 7 subfamilies contain multiple members within coccidians (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic>, <italic>N</italic>. <italic>caninum</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>tenella</italic>), while piroplasms contain multiple ApiAT2 subfamily proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Much of the expansion of ApiAT proteins, then, appears to have occurred subsequent to the evolution of parasitism in this phylum. An intriguing possibility is that expansion within ApiAT subfamilies is linked to expansion of these parasites into different hosts, and cell types within those hosts. Across their life cycles, apicomplexans such as <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic>, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp and piroplasms must infect different hosts and/or different cell types with those hosts, which may necessitate amino acid transporters with different substrate affinities and specificities. Our data indicate that ten of the sixteen ApiAT family proteins in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> are expressed in the tachyzoite stage of the life cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g002">Fig 2</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref009">9</xref>]). Of the ApiAT5 subfamily, we could only detect expression of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 in tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g002">Fig 2</xref>), and only <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 is important for growth of the tachyzoite stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This raises the possibility that other <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5 subfamily proteins are expressed, and function, at other stages of the life cycle. Interestingly, proteomic studies identified <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-5 in the oocyst proteome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.toxodb.org/" xlink:type="simple">www.toxodb.org</ext-link>), and it could be that this transporter has particular importance at this stage of the parasite life cycle.</p>
<p>Of the fifteen ApiAT family proteins that we were able to disrupt genetically, only the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT1, <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT2 and <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 mutants exhibited defects in tachyzoite growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This corresponds to results from a recent genome-wide CRISPR-based screen, in which these three <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT family proteins all had low ‘phenotype scores’ (scores between –3.91 and –4.73), an indicator of a gene’s importance for <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of tachyzoites ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref033">33</xref>]; scores below –1.8 are considered to be indicative of a gene being ‘important’ for parasite growth). The remaining <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT family proteins had phenotype scores &gt; –0.93 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref033">33</xref>], consistent with the results of our targeted disruption approach which indicated that these proteins are not important for parasite growth <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g003">Fig 3</xref>). However, we cannot rule out that parasites were able to ‘skip’ over the frameshifts to produce functional proteins in these mutants, or that parasites were able to adapt to these loss of function mutants (e.g. by upregulating other transporters to compensate for their loss). We were unable to disrupt the reading frame of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT6-1, despite multiple attempts using a guide RNA that targets the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT6-1 locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s012">S2 Table</xref>). <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT6-1 has a phenotype score of –5.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref033">33</xref>]. It is likely, then, that our inability to generate a <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT6-1 gene disruption is because it is essential for parasite growth.</p>
<p>Our studies of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 demonstrate that this protein is important for parasite growth. We demonstrated that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 is a high affinity L-Tyr uniporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g005">Fig 5</xref>; K<sub>0.5</sub> ~0.3 μM, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007577.t001">Table 1</xref>) and that loss of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 leads to defects in L-Tyr uptake into parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g004">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). These observations are supported by the results of a recent study by Wallbank <italic>et al</italic>., who also demonstrated that disruption of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 led to a depletion of L-Tyr levels in the parasite, and replicated our initial observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref034">34</xref>] that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 can transport L-Tyr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref035">35</xref>]. In our study, we demonstrate that parasites lacking <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 were avirulent in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g008">Fig 8D</xref>), and could only grow at extracellular L-Tyr concentrations above ~1 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g008">Fig 8A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s009">S9 Fig</xref>), well above the plasma concentration of L-Tyr in mammals (estimated to be 55–90 μM in human plasma and 50–70 μM in mouse plasma; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref037">37</xref>]). Together, our data point to an essential role for <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 in scavenging L-Tyr from the host.</p>
<p>Our oocyte studies indicated that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 can function as an exchanger, with the rate of uptake of L-Tyr and other aromatic and large neutral amino acids enhanced when equivalent amino acids were present on the <italic>trans</italic> side of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Mammalian amino acid transporters function either as ‘loaders’ (i.e. uniporters that facilitate the uptake of amino acids into cells) or ‘harmonizers’ (i.e. exchangers that are essential for the maintenance of homeostatic amino acid concentrations) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref038">38</xref>]. By contrast, our data indicate that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 performs an unusual dual function in facilitating both the net uptake of L-Tyr into the parasite, and maintaining intracellular pools of aromatic and large neutral amino acids through exchange. Maintaining amino acid homeostasis is critical for facilitating cellular metabolism and growth, and it is likely that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 has a critical role in balancing the intracellular concentrations of aromatic and large neutral amino acids in the parasite.</p>
<p><italic>X</italic>. <italic>laevis</italic> expression studies revealed that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 transports L-Phe and L-Trp, as well as large neutral amino acids such as L-Leu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g006">Fig 6</xref>). This raises the possibility that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 also functions in the net uptake of these amino acids in the parasite. We saw no differences in the fractional labelling of [<sup>13</sup>C]-labelled L-Leu or L-Ile in <italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup><italic>Δ188–504</italic></sup> parasites compared to WT parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g004">Fig 4</xref>), implying that the uptake of these branched-chain amino acids is facilitated by other transporters in the parasite. Similarly, we observed no defect in the fractional labelling of [<sup>13</sup>C]-labelled L-Phe in parasites lacking <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g004">Fig 4</xref>), although we did observe a defect in the uptake of [<sup>14</sup>C]Phe in <italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup><italic>Δ188–504</italic></sup> parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), and we observed decreased growth of the mutant strain at [L-Phe] of 39 μM and below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Notably, uptake of [<sup>14</sup>C]Tyr into oocytes expressing <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 was not impaired by the addition of equimolar amounts of unlabelled L-Phe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s007">S7A Fig</xref>), indicating that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 has a greater affinity for L-Tyr than L-Phe. If a transporter’s affinity for L-Tyr is much greater than that for L-Phe, uptake of the latter will be minimal in conditions where the amino acids are present at similar concentrations (as we observed in the oocyte experiments, and as appears to be the case in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref036">36</xref>]). This is consistent with the hypothesis that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 plays little role in net L-Phe uptake at physiological concentrations in the tachyzoite stage of the parasite life cycle. Instead, L-Phe is likely to be taken up via alternative transport pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g009">Fig 9</xref>).</p>

<title>Model for the roles of ApiAT proteins in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> tachyzoites.</title>
<p>Depiction of a <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> parasite (blue) inside a host cell. Aromatic amino acids, including L-Tyr, L-Phe and L-Trp, and large neutral amino acids are thought to be translocated across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane surrounding the parasite (dashed line) through non-selective channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref064">64</xref>]. <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 (red cylinder) functions as the major L-Tyr uptake pathway in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic>. Additionally, <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 functions as an exchanger, exporting aromatic and large neutral amino acids from the parasite, and thereby contributing to the homeostasis of these amino acids. The uptake of L-Phe and L-Trp is primarily mediated by alternate, and as yet undefined, uptake pathways (green cylinder). These alternate pathways can mediate sufficient L-Tyr uptake for parasite growth in the absence of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 at high L-Tyr concentrations (when L-Phe and L-Trp concentrations are not correspondingly high). We have previously demonstrated that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT1 (blue cylinder) facilitates the uptake of L-Arg into parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref009">9</xref>], and propose that other ApiAT-family proteins expressed in tachyzoites (gray and purple cylinders) facilitate the transport of other amino acids. Of these, <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT2 and <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT6-1 (purple cylinders) are important for parasite growth.</p>

<p>The importance of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 for L-Trp uptake in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> is less clear. We were unable to detect the uptake of either [<sup>13</sup>C]Trp or [<sup>14</sup>C]Trp into parasites under different experimental conditions. In oocyte experiments, L-Trp can effectively out-compete L-Tyr for uptake via <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 when present in equimolar amounts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s007">S7A Fig</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 has similar affinities for L-Trp and L-Tyr.</p>
<p><italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup><italic>Δ188–504</italic></sup> parasites are capable of growth when the concentration of L-Tyr in the growth medium is ≥1 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). This indicates the existence of an alternative L-Tyr uptake pathway that takes up sufficient L-Tyr to enable parasite growth when L-Tyr levels are high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g009">Fig 9</xref>). By contrast, <italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup><italic>Δ188–504</italic></sup> parasites grew normally at intermediate concentrations of L-Phe (78–625 μM) and L-Trp (31–250 μM), but exhibited a dramatic decrease in growth at higher concentrations of both these amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g008">Fig 8B and 8C</xref>). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the alternative L-Tyr uptake pathway(s) also functions in L-Phe and L-Trp uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g009">Fig 9</xref>). At high concentrations of L-Phe and L-Trp, uptake of L-Tyr by this alternative pathway(s) is inhibited by competition with the other aromatic amino acids, preventing parasite growth in the absence of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3. This mirrors similar observations in our previous study on the alternative L-Arg uptake pathway in the parasite, in which we showed that high levels of other cationic amino acids inhibit parasite growth in the absence of the selective L-Arg transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>On the basis of the results of this study, we propose a model in which the uptake of L-Tyr into <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> parasites is mediated primarily by <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g009">Fig 9</xref>). The uptake of L-Phe and L-Trp is mediated primarily by one or more alternative aromatic amino acid transporters. These transporters can also transport L-Tyr, and compensate for loss of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 when L-Tyr levels are high and corresponding levels of L-Phe and L-Trp are lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g009">Fig 9</xref>). <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 has an additional role in facilitating homeostasis of aromatic amino acids and large neutral amino acids, enabled by its exchange activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g009">Fig 9</xref>).</p>
<p>This model is based on our observations of tachyzoite stage parasites. A recent study examined <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> aromatic amino acid hydroxylase enzymes, which can interconvert L-Phe and L-Tyr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref039">39</xref>]. Knockout of these enzymes revealed that they are not required for tachyzoite growth, but are particularly important for producing oocysts following the sexual stages of the parasite life cycle that occur in the felid hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref039">39</xref>]. Given the differences in aromatic amino acid metabolism between tachyzoite and oocyst stages of the life cycle, it is likely that the nature and requirements for aromatic amino acid transporters differs across the life cycle of the parasite. Future studies that investigate the expression and importance of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 and other aromatic amino acid transporters (perhaps other members of the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5 family) across the entire life cycle will be of particular interest.</p>
<p>In summary, we describe an apicomplexan-specific family of plasma membrane transporters that appear to function primarily in amino acid uptake. Our findings highlight the evolutionary novelties that arise to enable parasites to scavenge essential nutrients from their hosts, as well as highlighting the importance of amino acid scavenging for the growth and virulence of the disease-causing tachyzoites stage of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic>. Future studies that examine the role of other members of this transporter family across the entire life cycle of the parasite will facilitate a better understanding of how these parasites acquire amino acids from their hosts.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic analysis of the ApiAT protein family</title>
<p>We sought to identify orthologues of the five previously identified <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> NPT proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref010">10</xref>] in the proteomes of the apicomplexans <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic>, <italic>Eimeria tenella</italic>, <italic>Neospora caninum</italic>, <italic>Babesia bovis</italic> and <italic>Theileria annulata</italic>, and the chromerids <italic>Chromera velia and Vitrella brassicaformis</italic>. First we performed Protein BLAST searches using each <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> NPT protein against each target species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eupathdb.org/" xlink:type="simple">www.eupathdb.org</ext-link>). We examined all ‘hits’ with an E value of &lt;10. Candidates that had &lt;8 or &gt;15 transmembrane domains were excluded from further analysis, since this would be inconsistent with them being MFS transporters, which typically have 12 transmembrane domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref020">20</xref>]. We also excluded any candidates annotated as proteins that were not transporters, or proteins already identified as members of other transporter families. Each remaining candidate was used as the query sequence for BLAST searches against the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> proteome, and we only accepted candidates for which the top match in the reciprocal BLAST search was to one of the five <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> NPTs. We next undertook BLAST searches with the candidate ApiAT against all organisms (using the NCBI BLAST search tool, excluding proteins in its own genus), and accepted only those candidates where the top hit was to proteins from other apicomplexans/chromerids. Of those, we included only candidate ApiATs where the top hit in members of the other target species was to proteins that had met all of the previous criteria (i.e. were already included as candidates on the list of potential ApiATs). This would theoretically exclude proteins that were not descended from the common ancestor of ApiATs. None of the candidate chromerid proteins met these latter criteria (all had top ‘hits’ in the NCBI BLAST search to proteins outside apicomplexans), and so were excluded from the subsequent phylogenetic analyses. We identified 66 proteins that met all the criteria. The gene IDs and nomenclature of these are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s011">S1 Table</xref>.</p>
<p>The 66 ApiAT protein sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega Version 1.2.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref041">41</xref>]. The multiple sequence alignment was edited in Jalview (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jalview.org/" xlink:type="simple">www.jalview.org</ext-link>) to remove poorly aligned blocks. After sequence editing, 464 residues were left for subsequent phylogenetic analysis using PHYLIP v3.69 (evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/getme.html) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref042">42</xref>]. Briefly, a consensus maximum likelihood tree and bootstrap values were generated by running the alignment file through the ‘seqboot’ program, which was used to generate 300 pseudosamples of the alignment. Next, multiple phylogenetic trees were generated from the pseudosamples using the ‘proml’ tree algorithm, using a randomised order of entry and three jumbles. Finally, the multiple phylogenetic trees were converted to a consensus tree with bootstrap values using the program ‘consense’.</p>

<title>Generation of genetically modified <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> parasites</title>
<p>Guide RNA (gRNA)-encoding sequences specific to target genes were introduced into the vector pSAG1::Cas9-U6::sgUPRT (Addgene plasmid # 54467; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref025">25</xref>]) using Q5 site-directed mutagenesis (New England Biolabs) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref025">25</xref>]. A list of the forward primers used to generate gRNA-expressing vectors for introducing frame-shift mutations are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s015">S5 Table</xref>. In each instance, the reverse primer 5’-AACTTGACATCCCCATTTAC was used. For generating frameshift mutations in <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT genes, gRNAs were designed to target the open reading frames of <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT genes, and transfected into parasites on a vector that also expressed Cas9-GFP. Transfections were performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref046">46</xref>]. GFP positive parasites were selected and cloned using flow cytometry 2–3 days following transfection using a FACSAria I or FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences). The region of the candidate genes targeted by the gRNAs were sequenced in clonal parasites, and clones in which the target gene had been disrupted by a frameshift mutation or insertion of a premature stop codon (i.e. where the open reading frame was disrupted) were selected for subsequent analyses. For 3’ replacements, gRNAs were selected to target a region near the stop codon of the gene of interest, using the primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s016">S6 Table</xref>. In addition, a donor DNA sequence encoding a 3x HA tag was amplified by PCR to contain 50 bp of flanking sequences homologous to the target gene either side of the stop codon. Template DNA encoding the 3x HA tag was generated as a gBlock (Integrated DNA Technologies), with the sequence listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s017">S7 Table</xref>.

Boron silicate microelectrodes capillaries (World Precision Instruments) with a tip resistance of: 1.5 ≥ <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> ≥ 0.5 MΩ were pulled by a P-97 Flaming/Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments) and filled with 3 M KCl. Silver microelectrodes were coated using a 5 M NaCl single-chamber galvanic cell to form AgCl<sub>2</sub> electrodes. The membrane potential was adjusted digitally in voltage-clamp mode between 0 and −50 mV. Oocytes were chosen for recording when they had a resting membrane potential −25 mV &lt; E<sub>m</sub> &lt; −45 mV. ND96 (pH 7.4) was used as the control solution for all electrophysiological recordings. Assay buffer pH was varied by mixing different ratios of acidic ND96 (pH 3.6) (5 mM MES instead of HEPES) with basic ND96 (pH 10) (5 mM Tris instead of HEPES).</p>

<p>For uptake experiments measuring <italic>trans</italic>-stimulation by a range of amino acids and other metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g006">Fig 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s007">S7B Fig</xref>), all L-amino acids substrates and metabolite mixes, except for L-Tyr, were pre-injected at 25 nl/oocyte using a Micro4 micro-syringe pump controller and A203XVY nanoliter injector (World Precision Instruments). All pre-injected oocytes were incubated on ice for 30 mins prior to uptake experiments to allow time for recovery from the injection. Stock solutions containing 100 mM L-amino acids in ND96 were pre-injected to give a calculated cytosolic concentration of 5 mM, based on an assumed free aqueous volume of 500 nl/oocyte. Stage 5 or 6 oocytes diameters vary from 1−1.3 mm and free aqueous oocyte volumes measured from 368 to &gt; 500 nl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref060">60</xref>]. Therefore, calculations of cytosolic concentrations from pre-injection should be treated as approximations only. For the experiments giving rise to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s007">S7B Fig</xref>, different metabolite groups were pre-injected to give estimated final concentrations of each metabolite as indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007577.s014">S4 Table</xref>. The low solubility of L-Tyr in aqueous solutions (0.453 g/L at 25°C, pH 7.4; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007577.ref061">61</xref>]) necessitated preloading of this amino acid by incubation, rather than injection. L-Tyr solutions were prepared by dissolving L-Tyr in ND96 to a final concentration of 2.5 mM and performing dilutions in ND96 to the required concentrations. Pre-loading of L-Tyr in <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3-injected oocytes was optimized by monitoring the time-dependent uptake of radiolabelled L-Tyr by oocytes in media containing either 2.5 or 1 mM L-Tyr. In <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3-expressing oocytes, L-Tyr equilibrium was reached after 10 to 12 hr, while uninjected oocytes reached a similar cytosolic concentration after incubation of approximately 68–72 hr. As a consequence, L-Tyr was preloaded for 32 hr in <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 injected oocytes and for 72 hr in uninjected oocytes for all <italic>trans</italic>-stimulation experiments.</p>
<p>All efflux substrate screening with [<sup>14</sup>C]labelled amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) were conducted by preloading L-amino acids for 3 hr prior to uptake.

Calculation of the pre-loaded [<sup>14</sup>C]labelled L-amino acids concentrations were conducted using a control set of oocytes for each substrate, pre-loaded in parallel to those used for efflux <italic>trans</italic>-stimulation.

<p>(A) Single cross-over recombination approach, where a vector containing a homologous flanking sequence to the target gene, in addition to a chloramphenicol resistance marker (ChlR), is introduced into <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> parasites. Single cross-over recombination results in the insertion of a HA tag into the 3’ region of the open reading frame of the target gene. The approximate position of the primers used to screen <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT7-1-HA clones are depicted. (B) CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing approach, where a guide RNA (gRNA) is designed to target a region near the stop codon of the target gene. When co-expressed with Cas9-GFP, the gRNA mediates a double-stranded break in the parasite genome near the stop codon of the target gene. The gRNA/Cas9-GFP vector is co-transfected with a donor DNA product that contains a HA tag flanked on either side with 50 bp of sequence homologous to regions immediately up and downstream of the stop codon in the target gene. Homologous repair results in introduction of the HA tag into the 3’ region of the open reading frame of the target gene. (C) PCR screen to test for integration of the HA tag into the <italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT7-1 locus. The presence of a 2.5 kb band that is absent from the wild type (WT) control indicates that clones 2–5 have successfully integrated the HA tag.</p>

<p>Fluorescence growth assays measuring the growth of WT (black), <italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup><italic>Δ188–504</italic></sup> (red), and <italic>apiAT5-3</italic><sup><italic>Δ188-504</italic></sup>/c<italic>Tg</italic>ApiAT5-3 (blue) parasites in DMEM containing the indicated concentrations of L-Tyr (A), L-Phe (B) and L-Trp (C). The growth of parasites is expressed as a percentage of the optimal concentration for each amino acid tested in each parasite strain, and was measured at mid-log phase for this optimal concentration (5 days post-inoculation). Parasite growth was determined using the same amino acid concentrations used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g008">Fig 8</xref>, but included a 0 mM concentration (which was not possible to depict in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007577.g008">Fig 8</xref> because of the log scale on the x axes). For simplicity, only the following amino acid concentrations are depicted in this figure: 0 mM, 0.423 mM and 2.5 mM L-Tyr (A), 0 mM, 0.32 mM and 10 mM L-Phe (B), and 0 mM, 0.063 mM and 1 mM L-Trp (C). The data for 0.423 mM L-Tyr (the normal DMEM concentration of L-Tyr) were interpolated from curve fitting while 0.32 mM L-Phe and 0.063 mM L-Trp (the nearest tested concentrations to those present in DMEM) were experimental data points. Data represent the mean ± SEM from three independent experiments (**** P &lt; 0.0001; two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test).</p>
