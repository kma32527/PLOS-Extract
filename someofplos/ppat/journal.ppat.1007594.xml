<abstract>
<p>Several naked virus species, including members of the Picornaviridae family, have recently been described to escape their host cells and spread infection via enclosure in extracellular vesicles (EV). EV are 50–300 nm sized lipid membrane-enclosed particles produced by all cells that are broadly recognized for playing regulatory roles in numerous (patho)physiological processes, including viral infection. Both pro- and antiviral functions have been ascribed to EV released by virus-infected cells. It is currently not known whether this reported functional diversity is a result of the release of multiple virus-containing and non-virus containing EV subpopulations that differ in composition and function. Using encephalomyocarditis virus infection (EMCV, Picornaviridae family), we here provide evidence that EV populations released by infected cells are highly heterogeneous. Virus was contained in two distinct EV populations that differed in physical characteristics, such as sedimentation properties, and in enrichment for proteins indicative of different EV biogenesis pathways, such as the plasma membrane resident proteins Flotillin-1 and CD9, and the autophagy regulatory protein LC3. Additional levels of EV heterogeneity were identified using high-resolution flow cytometric analysis of single EV. Importantly, we demonstrate that EV subsets released during EMCV infection varied largely in potency of transferring virus infection and in their kinetics of release from infected cells. These data support the notion that heterogeneous EV populations released by virus-infected cells can exert diverse functions at distinct time points during infection. Unraveling the compositional, temporal and functional heterogeneity of these EV populations using single EV analysis technologies, as employed in this study, is vital to understanding the role of EV in virus dissemination and antiviral host responses.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Picornaviruses constitute a family of viruses that cause many human and animal diseases. These ‘naked’ viruses are known to spread by causing infected cell to burst open. However, challenging recent data indicate that virions also escape intact cells enclosed in small lipid membrane-enclosed particles, called ‘extracellular vesicles’ (EV). Inside these cell-derived EV, virions can stay under the radar of the host’s immune system, but there is also evidence that EV can facilitate anti-viral immune responses. We therefore hypothesized that different types of EV are released by naked virus-infected cells. Testing this hypothesis required advanced methods with which the very small EV (50–300 nm) can be individually characterized. We investigated the pool of EV released by cells infected with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) using an in-house developed method for analysis and isolation of individual EV. We demonstrate that EMCV infection induces the release of several EV subpopulations that differ in the molecules they carry, the timing of their release from the infected cell, and in potency to transfer virus infection. Our discovery that EV released by naked virus-infected cells vary in composition and function is a critical step in further unraveling the role of EV in virus spreading and virus-host interactions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent discoveries indicate that several naked virus species can escape from intact cells via a non-lytic release mechanism involving enclosure in membranous structures that resemble extracellular vesicles (EV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref004">4</xref>]. EV are submicron-sized (50–300 nm) lipid bilayer-enclosed particles containing proteins and RNA, and are increasingly recognized as an important means of intercellular communication employed by all cells (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref005">5</xref>]). EV can play a role in maintaining homeostasis as well as in various pathologies via the delivery of cargo molecules that trigger a response in distant or neighboring recipient cells (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref006">6</xref>]). Enclosure of naked virus particles in EV has been predominantly observed for viruses belonging to the Picornaviridae family, a group of small RNA viruses implicated in many human and veterinary diseases. Examples include members of the genus <italic>Enterovirus</italic>, such as poliovirus, coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), and enterovirus 71 (EV71), as well as hepatitis A virus (HAV, genus <italic>Hepatovirus</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref007">7</xref>]. Furthermore, the phylogenetically distinct hepatitis E virus (HEV, family Hepeviridae), which like HAV is a hepatotropic virus, has been shown to leave cells in an EV-enclosed form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref008">8</xref>]. EV-enclosed naked viruses have also been observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, for example in serum of HEV and HAV-infected individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref010">10</xref>]. Enclosure of virus particles in EV can benefit virus infections in several ways. First, the EV can shield the virus from immune recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref012">12</xref>]. In addition, virus exit from host cells without inducing cell rupture limits tissue damage and consequent alarming of the immune system. Moreover, there is strong evidence that virus-containing EV can transfer the infection to new host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref007">7</xref>]. The co-transfer of host molecules may influence the uptake of virus-containing EV, as has been described for phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids that contribute to cellular entry of EV-enclosed poliovirus and HAV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref014">14</xref>]. Furthermore, the enclosure of multiple virions per EV could benefit infection by promoting cooperativity between genetic quasi-species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref001">1</xref>]. On the contrary, EV-mediated release of virus or host products from infected cells can also trigger the antiviral immune response in EV-targeted cells that are non-susceptible or non-permissive to infection with the naked virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref013">13</xref>]. The reported pro- and antiviral effects of virus-induced EV could be explained by experimental variation between studies, e.g. with regard to virus strains, producer and recipient cell types, and EV isolation methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref015">15</xref>]. Alternatively, multiple EV populations with variable composition and function could be released by infected cells.</p>
<p>Heterogeneity is an intrinsic feature of EV populations released by cells under various culture conditions. This heterogeneity is increased even further by external stimuli imposed on the producer cells that alter the cell’s activation or differentiation state. Factors known to influence the quantity and quality of released EV include receptor-mediated stimulation, tumorigenic transformation, or environmental conditions such as hypoxia or nutrient-starvation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref019">19</xref>]. Furthermore, EV that differ in size and/or molecular composition can be formed via distinct EV biogenesis routes involving either late endosomal compartments or the plasma membrane (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref005">5</xref>]). The formation routes of naked virus-containing EV are largely unknown and may be virus-type specific. Formation of EV-enclosed enteroviruses has been suggested to involve secretory autophagy, whereby virion-containing autophagosomes fuse with the plasma membrane to release their contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref020">20</xref>]. HAV- and HEV-containing EV, on the contrary, are proposedly formed via inward budding into endosomal compartments, and released upon fusion of these multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref022">22</xref>]. These data suggest that different virus types are released from cells enclosed in EV that originate from different biogenesis pathways. However, potential heterogeneity in molecular contents and function of EV within populations released by naked virus-infected cells has not yet been addressed. Furthermore, the virus-containing EV are likely produced against a background of constitutively released EV that do not enclose virus. To unravel the role of EV in naked virus infections, it is therefore crucial to gain in-depth knowledge on the complexity of EV populations released by infected cells.</p>
<p>Detection and characterization of naked virus-containing EV has until now mostly been performed by analyzing the presence of EV-related host proteins and viral components in bulk isolates of EV or by low-throughput electron microscopic analysis. These methodologies do not allow accurate assessment of EV population heterogeneity, because this requires high-throughput techniques that detect and analyze EV at the single particle level. Here, we employed an in-house developed high-resolution flow cytometric approach for qualitative and quantitative analysis of single EV to study EV release from naked virus-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref024">24</xref>]. We used this technique in combination with infectivity assays and analysis of EV-associated proteins to investigate whether virions were contained in different EV types, and how the release of different EV subpopulations changed over the course of infection. In addition, we used high-resolution flow cytometric sorting of single EV to study how efficiently distinct EV subpopulations could transfer virus infection. To study structural and functional heterogeneity in EV populations released by naked virus-infected cells we used encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) of the <italic>Cardiovirus</italic> genus as a model picornavirus with a rapid lytic life cycle. EMCV is a 30 nm sized virus that can cause a variety of symptoms and diseases in a broad range of mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Our data demonstrate that EMCV-infected cells release two distinct EV populations containing infectious virus, which differed in sedimentation properties and protein composition. Importantly, we obtained evidence for functional diversity in virus-induced EV by showing that EV subsets differed in potency of transferring infection to new host cells. Finally, we show that temporal release of the different subpopulations of EV is tightly regulated over the course of infection. These data illustrate that there are multiple levels of heterogeneity in EV released by naked virus-infected cells.</p>

<title>EMCV is released via a non-lytic route in the early stage of infection</title>
<p>We first investigated whether non-lytic virus release occurred after infection with EMCV. Hereto, HeLa cells were infected with a high multiplicity of infection (MOI = 10) and virus production and release were monitored over the course of infection. The earliest time point at which detectable levels of intracellular virus were observed was 4 hours post-infection (p.i.). From 6 hours p.i. onwards, virus could be detected outside cells in the culture supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In parallel we monitored cell viability and plasma membrane integrity over the course of infection by using flow cytometric analysis of cells stained with a fixable viability dye that labels cells with compromised plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007594.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). In addition, we performed assays measuring leakage of the intracellular enzyme LDH into the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). While at 20 hours p.i. complete cell disintegration had occurred, up to 10 hours p.i. minimal signs of cell death or loss of plasma membrane integrity were observed. In subsequent experiments, non-lytic virus release was therefore studied during the first 8 hours of EMCV infection.</p>

<title>During the pre-lytic phase of infection, cells release infectious virus in multiple types of EV</title>
<p>We next questioned whether infectious virus released during pre-lytic EMCV infection was contained in EV. In the field of EV research, a centrifugal force of ~100,000x<italic>g</italic> is often applied to collect EV from body fluids and cell culture supernatant. However, recent research has demonstrated that viable cells also release functionally active EV of larger size (up to 1 μm) that sediment at ~10,000x<italic>g</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref028">28</xref>]. In previous studies on EV-enclosed naked viruses, these low-<italic>g</italic>-force sedimenting large EV were often either co-isolated with smaller EV or were discarded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref015">15</xref>]. To assess whether EMCV was contained in large or small EV, culture supernatants of infected cells (8 hours p.i.) were subjected to consecutive centrifugation steps of 10,000x<italic>g</italic> (10K) and 100,000x<italic>g</italic> (100K). The percentage of infectivity remaining in the supernatant was determined after each of these steps. Centrifugation at 10K for 30 minutes depleted the supernatant of a large portion of the released infectivity whereas subsequent centrifugation at 100K for 1 hour further reduced the amount of infectious material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). With high-speed ultracentrifugation, also naked virus particles that overlap in size with small EV may sediment. We investigated this by applying the same centrifugal forces to virions derived from post-lytic culture supernatants, from which membranous structures were removed by detergent treatment. Naked EMCV virions sedimented at 100K, but not at 10K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Hence, the infectivity of particles pelleted at 10K in the pre-lytic supernatant cannot be attributed to naked virus, while the 100K pellets of this material could contain both naked and EV-enclosed infectious virus.</p>
<p>To further characterize the infectious particles pelleted at 10K or 100K in pre-lytic culture supernatant, we employed isopycnic density gradient centrifugation to distinguish between lipid bilayer-surrounded EV and naked virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref004">4</xref>]. Using this method, we confirmed that the buoyant density of naked EMCV virions was considerably higher (1.18 g/ml) than the density of EV released by the non-infected HeLa cells (1.06–1.13 g/ml) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007594.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). To investigate whether infectious virus was present in EV released during the pre-lytic phase, we separated 10K and 100K pelleted particles based on buoyant density and analyzed the different gradient fractions for infectivity. Based on densities reported above for naked virions and EV we subdivided the gradient in three segments with density ranges 1.15–1.35 g/ml, 1.06–1.13 g/ml, and 1.02–1.04 g/ml. In 10K-pelleted material, nearly all infectivity (87 ± 9.4%) was observed in the density fractions where EV reside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). For the 100K-pelleted material, the majority of the infectious particles resided in 1.15–1.35 g/ml density fractions, indicative of the presence of naked virus particles. Interestingly, however, infectivity (11 ± 5.7%) was also present in fractions with densities of 1.06–1.13 g/ml, characteristic for EV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). To further confirm that the infectious 10K and 100K particles in these fractions represented virus-containing EV, the presence of genomic viral RNA and the EV-associated tetraspanin proteins CD63 and CD9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref031">31</xref>] were assessed. Indeed, the viral RNA co-fractionated with CD63 and CD9 in the 1.06–1.13 g/ml density fractions. In contrast, high density fractions contained viral RNA but were devoid of CD63 and CD9, indicating the presence of naked virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g002">Fig 2C–2F</xref>). Within the 1.06–1.13 g/ml density range, we observed slightly different distributions of CD9, CD63 and viral RNA over the individual density fractions. This corresponds to previously published work indicating that different EV subpopulations are enriched in different tetraspanin proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref032">32</xref>]. Moreover, the data could indicate that viral RNA is present in specific EV subpopulations. Detection of histon protein H3 was included to confirm that no contamination with intracellular protein complexes through cell lysis or cell death had occurred. Although readily detected in cell lysates, histon H3 was indeed absent from extracellular 10K and 100K centrifugation pellets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g002">Fig 2D and 2F</xref>). In addition, we disrupted 10K and 100K EV by treatment with 0.1% triton ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref033">33</xref>] and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007594.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), prior to isopycnic density gradient centrifugation. This treatment depleted infectivity in the 1.06–1.13 g/ml fractions of the 10K and 100K pelleted material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g002">Fig 2G and 2H</xref>). The infectivity lost in these fractions shifted to the high density segment of the gradient where naked virions reside, supporting the notion that EV in the 1.06–1.13 g/ml fractions contained mature virus particles.</p>

<p>To further confirm that EMCV was enclosed in EV, we compared the sensitivity of EV-enclosed viruses and naked viruses to neutralization by anti-EMCV capsid antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g002">Fig 2I</xref>). Protection of EV-enclosed viruses against neutralizing antibodies was first described for HAV by the group of S. Lemon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref004">4</xref>]. Additionally, they showed that neutralizing antibodies could partially inhibit eHAV, but only after endocytosis of eHAV and degradation of the EV membranes. It is possible that co-endocytosed antibodies neutralize the virus upon degradation of the EV membrane, preventing interaction of the virus with viral receptors present in endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref021">21</xref>]. Partial neutralization of EV-enclosed virus has also been observed for EV71 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref007">7</xref>]. Similarly, we observed that EV enclosure significantly protected EMCV against neutralizing antibodies, while the infectivity of naked virus could be fully abolished by this antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g002">Fig 2I</xref>). Combined, these data indicate that infectious virus is released in both 10K and 100K EV populations during the pre-lytic phase of EMCV infection.</p>

<title>10K and 100K virus-containing EV differ in protein composition and release dynamics</title>
<p>To further assess differences in molecular composition between 10K and 100K EV released by virus-infected cells and mock cells, we performed western blot analysis for several proteins previously found to be associated with virus-containing EV. First we analyzed the presence of LC3, an autophagy regulatory protein previously detected on EV induced by picornaviruses of the <italic>Enterovirus</italic> genus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref034">34</xref>]. LC3 was found prominently in EV pelleted at 100K, but not in 10K EV and EV released by mock cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In contrast, virus-induced 10K EV were enriched in CD9 and Flotillin-1, proteins frequently associated with EV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref035">35</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g003">Fig 3</xref>). No clear differences were found between EV-associated levels of the tetraspanin CD63 in 10K and 100K EV from infected and mock cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Higher levels of CD9 and Flotillin-1 were observed in EV fractions from infected cells compared to EV from mock cells. Overall, these data indicate that EMCV infection affects EV release and that 10K and 100K EV induced by EMCV display prominent differences in protein composition.</p>

<p>During the first 8 hours of infection, the cells undergo rapid changes in cell signaling and remodeling of intracellular membranes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref037">37</xref>]). Since EV can be viewed as snapshots of their parental cell at the time of production, the composition and release of EV may change over the course of infection. We therefore analyzed the quantity and infectivity of virus-induced 10K and 100K EV at several time points during the pre-lytic phase of infection. For comparison, the release of 10K and 100K EV by non-infected cells cultured for the same period of time was analyzed in parallel. To assess quantitative differences between the EV, we employed an in-house developed high-resolution flow cytometry-based approach for high-throughput analysis of individual EV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref024">24</xref>]. A fluorescent lipophilic dye was used to label the lipid bilayer of EV prior to density gradient ultracentrifugation. Fluorescence threshold triggering was applied to distinguish labeled EV from noise signals. EV quantification indicated a slight increase in the number of 10K EV released by infected cells from 4–6 hours p.i., and a much more prominent increase between 6–8 hours p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Non-infected cells, on the contrary, released only very few 10K EV. Substantially different release profiles were observed for 100K EV. Already at 4 hours p.i., considerable numbers of 100K EV were released from infected cells and these numbers gradually increased until 8 hours p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). However, 100K EV released by non-infected cells followed a similar pattern. After 8 hours of infection, the cumulative number of 10K EV released by virus-infected cells was significantly higher than their counterparts released by non-infected cells, whereas comparable numbers of 100K EV were released by these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). In addition to EV quantification, we analyzed the infectivity of 10K and 100K EV fractions over the course of infection. At 4 hours p.i. no detectable levels of infectivity were present in 10K or 100K EV fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). At 6 hours p.i., infectious virus was primarily released in 100K EV, while the levels of infectivity in 10K EV were ~500-fold lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). After 8 hours, similar levels of infectivity were detected in both the 10K EV and 100K EV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>). These data demonstrate that the release of 100K EV-enclosed virus precedes the release of 10K EV-enclosed virus. Moreover, the combined EV quantification and infectivity data imply that there is temporal release of different EV subpopulations during the early phase of infection.</p>

</fig>
<p>First, we investigated whether the FSC<sup>hi</sup> EV could represent membranous fragments from a small number of dead/lysed cells that could be present 8 hrs p.i. (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We addressed the contribution of 10% cell lysis to the number and type of EV observed in the supernatant of infected cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007594.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Supernatant of infected cells lysed by freeze-thawing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007594.s004">S4E Fig</xref>) was mixed with supernatant of healthy cells (containing mock EV) in a volume ratio of 10:90. EV populations were isolated, after which the quantity and light scatter profile of these EV were analyzed by high-resolution flow cytometry. The data clearly indicate that the large increase in both the total numbers of 10K EV (low and high FSC) and in the percentage of FSC<sup>hi</sup> 100K EV released upon virus infection cannot be explained by contaminating material from lysed cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007594.s004">S4A–S4D Fig</xref>). To further characterize FSC<sup>hi</sup> and FSC<sup>lo</sup> EV populations, we analyzed the presence of the common EV marker CD9 on individual FSC<sup>lo</sup> and FSC<sup>hi</sup> EV using high-resolution flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007594.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). These data indicate that CD9 was a common marker of the various EV populations detected, but that the level of CD9 on FSC<sup>hi</sup> EV was generally higher than on FSC<sup>lo</sup> EV.</p>
<p>Next, the release of the different EV subpopulations was monitored over time. We observed a sharp increase in both 10K FSC<sup>hi</sup> and 10K FSC<sup>lo</sup> EV released by infected cells during the 6–8 hour p.i. interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>). This suggests that both of these EV subsets are induced by virus infection. In the 100K EV population, on the contrary, only the number of FSC<sup>hi</sup> EV was significantly increased upon virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g005">Fig 5E and 5F</xref>). The number of FSC<sup>lo</sup> EV released by infected cells increased over time to the same extent as FSC<sup>lo</sup> EV released by non-infected cells, suggesting that this population represents constitutively released EV. The observed temporal differences in release of these EV subpopulations may indicate that they play a distinct role during infection.</p>
<p>Since EMCV infection most prominently increased the release of FSC<sup>hi</sup> EV, we next investigated whether these EV were functionally different from FSC<sup>lo</sup> EV. We applied a unique approach using high-resolution flow cytometric sorting of single EV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref039">39</xref>] to physically separate FSC<sup>hi</sup> and FSC<sup>lo</sup> EV subsets. With this method we reached ~90% sort purity for the different EV subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g006">Fig 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Materials &amp; methods</xref>). To quantitatively compare the efficiency of virus transfer by FSC<sup>hi</sup> and FSC<sup>lo</sup> EV populations, defined numbers of EV (range 1–20,000) were sorted directly onto recipient cells in culture. Cells and EV were incubated for 3 days after which the occurrence of virus-induced cytopathogenic effect (CPE) was assessed. Interestingly, for some EV subpopulations as few as 6–32 sorted EV could cause infection of recipient cells. We compared the percentage of wells displaying CPE after incubation with different numbers of FSC<sup>hi</sup> or FSC<sup>lo</sup> EV and observed substantial differences in infectious potential between EV subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). Based on the calculated 50% tissue culture infectivity dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>), we show that both FSC<sup>hi</sup> 10K EV and FSC<sup>hi</sup> 100K EV were significantly more potent in transferring infection than their FSC<sup>lo</sup> counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007594.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>).

Together, these results show that EMCV-infected cells release various subsets of EV which differ in molecular composition and infection potential and that these distinct EV subsets are released at different time points after infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, our data provide first evidence that a picornavirus from the <italic>Cardiovirus</italic> genus, like other members of the Picornaviridae family, can exit cells via enclosure in EV. Using advanced single EV-based analysis and isolation methods, we demonstrated that host cells respond to EMCV infection by releasing a complex mixture of EV that are heterogeneous in their molecular composition and their capacity to transfer viral infection. In addition, we demonstrate differences in the release kinetics of these distinct EV subpopulations during the pre-lytic phase of infection.</p>
<p>Importantly, this study demonstrates that naked viruses can be released by infected cells in multiple subtypes of EV, which may form via different biogenesis pathways and perform different functions during infection. The distinct virus-containing EV populations released during EMCV infection differed in sedimentation efficiency, which could signify a difference in size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref028">28</xref>]. Although the differential (ultra)centrifugation method applied in our study does not allow complete separation of large (10K) and small (100K) EV, clear differences in protein composition were observed, with 10K EV bearing high levels of the plasma membrane resident proteins CD9 and Flotillin-1, and 100K EV prominently containing the autophagy regulatory protein LC3. Previous studies on EV-mediated naked virus release may have failed to recognize this heterogeneity among the virus-containing EV, because large 10K EV were either not separated from small 100K EV during sample preparation or omitted from analysis. In our recent review on methodologies to isolate naked virus-containing EV, we highlight the large diversity in methods that have been used in previously published studies on this subject [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref015">15</xref>]. Since these methods differ in yield and purity of EV and bias towards isolating specific EV subpopulations, this can greatly influence findings on the molecular composition and function of EV and can hamper data comparison between studies. Our data additionally indicate that virus-containing subpopulations can differ in release kinetics. Collection of EV during different phases of infection may therefore further hamper data comparability between studies. These findings stress the need to address temporal and compositional heterogeneity of EV populations induced by virus infection.</p>
<p>Heterogeneity in EV populations may arise from multiple biogenesis routes driving concurrent release of EV with different subcellular origin and different molecular composition. Since proteins involved in EV formation are also incorporated in EV, detection of such proteins in EV preparations could be indicative of their biogenesis route. The presence of LC3 on 100K EV released by infected cells could suggest the involvement of autophagosomal membranes in the formation of these virus-containing EV, as was described earlier for picornavirus species of the <italic>Enterovirus</italic> genus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref034">34</xref>]. Similar to poliovirus, CVB3, and EV71, EMCV has been shown to induce autophagy in host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref042">42</xref>]. Conversely, 10K EV released by infected cells were enriched in Flotillin-1, a caveolae-associated membrane protein, and CD9, a tetraspanin ubiquitously reported on EV originating from various cellular membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref032">32</xref>]. CD63, a tetraspanin more specifically associated with MVB-derived EV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref032">32</xref>], was detected at similar levels on 10K and 100K EV. The abundant presence of Flotillin-1 and CD9 without a corresponding enrichment in CD63 may imply that the 10K EV are not formed in MVBs but have a different subcellular origin, and could represent plasma membrane derived EV.</p>
<p>An additional source of heterogeneity within EV populations stems from the rapid and drastic morphological and metabolic changes that the EV-producing cells undergo over the course of the infection. Because EV are snapshots of their parental cell at the moment of production, over time this can lead to accumulation of EV with different molecular composition. In support of this idea, we showed that the composition and release of EV changes over the course of EMCV infection. This could imply that multiple EV formation pathways are active at distinct time points after infection. The sequential employment of different EV-formation routes may reflect virus-driven shut-down or activation of these pathways. Alternatively, it may be a coping mechanism of the host cell to deal with the accumulating intracellular viral burden. Upon sensing invading viruses, the host cell activates antiviral systems and the accompanying cellular signaling cascade may alter the release and composition of EV.</p>
<p>In-depth characterization of the compositional and functional heterogeneity of EV populations is lagging behind due to the lack of high-end technologies to analyze EV at the single particle level. We used our in-house developed high-resolution flow cytometric approach to detect and characterize individual EV. Using this technique we were able to distinguish as well as physically separate EV subpopulations that differ in their potential to transfer infection. We were able to discriminate these EV populations based on differences in the level of FSC light they generated. Due to the overlapping size and buoyant density of these EV subsets, they cannot be separated with any of the other frequently used EV isolation methods. FSC<sup>lo</sup> EV were much less potent in transferring virus infection to new cells than FSC<sup>hi</sup> EV. The differences in infection potential between these EV subsets may be explained in multiple ways. First, the proportion of virus-containing EV within the FSC<sup>lo</sup> EV population may be smaller than in the FSC<sup>hi</sup> EV population. Alternatively, FSC<sup>hi</sup> EV may enclose a higher number of virus particles than FSC<sup>lo</sup> EV and therefore promote infection, for example by facilitating cooperativity between virus genetic quasispecies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref044">44</xref>]. Secondly, since very small numbers of sorted FSC<sup>hi</sup> EV could drive infection of EV-recipient cells and 100% sort purity cannot be reached due to technical limitations, the observed infectivity in FSC<sup>lo</sup> EV may be caused by a minor contamination with FSC<sup>hi</sup> EV. Finally, it is possible that both FSC<sup>hi</sup> and FSC<sup>lo</sup> EV contain virus particles but that different sets of host molecules incorporated in these EV aid or restrict the entry of the virus or in establishing infection. The number of low infectivity FSC<sup>lo</sup> 10K EV was highly increased upon virus infection, suggesting that these EV could play a modulatory role in promoting or counteracting viral infection. For example, the EV-mediated transfer of various host antiviral molecules from virus-infected cells has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref047">47</xref>]. Whether the EV with different infection potential in our study carry distinct proteins, lipids, or RNA markers based on which they could be distinguished needs to be explored in future studies.</p>
<p>Overall, this study shows that naked virus-infected cells release multiple EV subpopulations that differ in physical properties, molecular content, and function. Additionally, we demonstrate that temporal release of the different subpopulations of EV is tightly regulated over the course of infection. This heterogeneity in EV populations may underlie the previously observed diversity in functional properties of EV released by naked virus-infected cells. In-depth characterization of the compositional, functional and temporal heterogeneity of EV released over the course of infection is essential to delineate the relationship between the structure of these EV and their function in virus spreading and host responses.</p>

<p>Human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa R19) were a gift from Dr G. Belov (University of Maryland, USA) and baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21, ATTC CCL-10) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD).

Unbound virus was removed at 1 hr p.i. by washing the cells 3 times with PBS. Cells were then cultured in culture medium containing EV-depleted FCS. To remove EV from FCS, 30% FCS in IMDM was ultracentrifuged for 16–20 hrs at 100,000x<italic>g</italic> in an SW32 rotor (<italic>k</italic>-factor 256.8) and passed through a 0.22μm filter.

<title>High-resolution flow cytometry</title>
<p>For high-resolution flow cytometric analysis of EV, 10K and 100K pelleted EV were labeled with 1.5 μl PKH67 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in 200 μl Diluent C. For detection of CD9 on single EV, antibody-labeling was performed prior to generic PKH67 labeling. 10K and 100K pelleted EV were labeled with 20 ng of PE-conjugated mouse-α-CD9 (clone HI9a; Biolegend, San Diego, CA) or a matched isotype control for 1 hr at 4°C. Unbound antibodies and unbound dye were separated from EV by density gradient centrifugation as described above. EV in gradient fractions were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and diluted 20x in PBS for high-resolution flow cytometric analysis on a BD Influx flow cytometer with optimized configuration, as previously described in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007594.ref024">24</xref>]. In short, threshold triggering was applied on fluorescence derived from PKH67-labeled EV passing the 488 nm laser. The threshold level was set to allow an event rate of ≤ 10 events per second when measuring PBS. Fluorescence of the 488 nm laser, and forward (FSC) and side (SSC) scattered light were recorded. FSC was detected with a collection angle of 15–25° (reduced wide-angle FSC). Fluorescent 100 nm and 200 nm polystyrene beads (FluoSpheres, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were used to calibrate the fluorescence and rw-FSC settings. Samples were measured at low pressure (5 PSI on the sheath fluid and 4.2 PSI on the sample) using a 140 μm nozzle at event rates below 10,000 per second. All measurements were acquired in a fixed time window of 30 seconds to allow direct comparison of EV concentrations in parallel samples.

<title>High-resolution flow cytometric single EV sorting</title>

An 8 mm obscuration bar and 200 μm pinhole were placed on the FSC detector. In addition, a 70 μm nozzle was used, sheath fluid pressure was increased to 30 psi and sample fluid pressure was raised to reach a maximum event rate of ≤ 10,000 events per second. Sort efficiencies remained high (~95%) at a drop frequency of 67.3 kHz. Sort purity was confirmed upon re-analyzing sorted samples and reached 76 ± 3.7% and 84 ± 13.0% for 10K and 100K FSC<sup>hi</sup> EV respectively, and 90 ± 1.9% and 88 ± 3.1% for 10K and 100K FSC<sup>lo</sup> EV respectively. Different numbers (1–20,000) of FSC<sup>hi</sup> and FSC<sup>lo</sup> EV subpopulations were sorted directly in 8-fold replicates onto HeLa R19 cells in 96-wells clusters seeded a day before at 5.0 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells mL<sup>-1</sup>.

<title>CPE in EV-recipient cells is caused by virus replication.</title>
<p>Viral genomic RNA levels in recipient cells of sort-purified EV subsets was assessed 3 days after sorting by RT-qPCR to confirm that the observed CPE was caused by EV-mediated transfer of infection and subsequent production of progeny virus. (A) Microscopic images showing recipient cells of EV that are healthy (left) or display CPE (right). Bar = 200 μm. (B) Cq values for viral genomic RNA in healthy cells that did not receive EV, healthy cells that received EV from mock-infected cells, and cells displaying CPE that received EV from EMCV-infected cells. Indicated are mean values ± s.d. for N = 3 independent experiments.</p>
