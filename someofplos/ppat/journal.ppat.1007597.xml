<abstract>
<p><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is one of the leading causes of invasive fungal infection in humans worldwide. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> uses macrophages as a proliferative niche to increase infective burden and avoid immune surveillance. However, the specific mechanisms by which <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> manipulates host immunity to promote its growth during infection remain ill-defined. Here we demonstrate that eicosanoid lipid mediators manipulated and/or produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> play a key role in regulating pathogenesis. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> is known to secrete several eicosanoids that are highly similar to those found in vertebrate hosts. Using eicosanoid deficient cryptococcal mutants <italic>Δplb1</italic> and <italic>Δlac1</italic>, we demonstrate that prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> is required by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> for proliferation within macrophages and <italic>in vivo</italic> during infection. Genetic and pharmacological disruption of host PGE<sub>2</sub> synthesis is not required for promotion of cryptococcal growth by eicosanoid production. We find that PGE<sub>2</sub> must be dehydrogenated into 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> to promote fungal growth, a finding that implicated the host nuclear receptor PPAR-γ. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> infection of macrophages activates host PPAR-γ and its inhibition is sufficient to abrogate the effect of 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> in promoting fungal growth during infection. Thus, we describe the first mechanism of reliance on pathogen-derived eicosanoids in fungal pathogenesis and the specific role of 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> and host PPAR-γ in cryptococcosis.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that is responsible for significant numbers of deaths in the immunocompromised population worldwide. Here we address whether eicosanoids produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> manipulate host innate immune cells during infection. <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> produces several eicosanoids that are notable for their similarity to vertebrate eicosanoids, it is therefore possible that fungal-derived eicosanoids may provoke physiological effects in the host. Using a combination of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> infection models we identify a specific eicosanoid species—prostaglandin E2 –that is required by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> for growth during infection. We subsequently show that prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> must be converted to 15-keto-prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> within the host before it has these effects. Furthermore, we find that prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>/15-keto-prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> mediated virulence is via activation of host PPAR-γ –an intracellular eicosanoid receptor known to interact with 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> is an opportunistic pathogen that infects individuals who have severe immunodeficiencies such as late-stage HIV AIDS. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> is estimated to infect 278,000 individuals each year resulting in 181,000 deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref002">2</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> infection begins in the lungs where the fungus is phagocytosed by host macrophages. Macrophages must become activated by further inflammatory signals from the host immune system before they can effectively kill <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref004">4</xref>]. When this does not occur <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> proliferates rapidly intracellularly and may use the macrophage to disseminate to the central nervous system leading to fatal cryptococcal meningitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Eicosanoids are an important group of lipid inflammatory mediators produced by innate immune cells such as macrophages. Eicosanoids are a diverse group of potent signalling molecules that have a short range of action and signal through autocrine and paracrine routes. Macrophages produce large amounts of a particular group of eicosanoids called prostaglandins during microbial infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref011">11</xref>]. Prostaglandins have a number of physiological effects throughout the body, but in the context of immunity they are known to strongly influence the inflammatory state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref012">12</xref>]. The prostaglandins PGE<sub>2</sub> and PGD<sub>2</sub> are the best-studied eicosanoid inflammatory mediators. During infection, macrophages produce both PGE<sub>2</sub> and PGD<sub>2</sub> to which, via autocrine routes, they are highly responsive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref012">12</xref>]. In vertebrate immunity, the synthesis of eicosanoids such as PGE<sub>2</sub> is carefully regulated by feedback loops to ensure that the potent effects of these molecules are properly constrained. Exogenous sources of eicosanoids within the body, such as from eicosanoid-producing parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref013">13</xref>] or tumours that overproduce eicosanoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref015">15</xref>], can disrupt host inflammatory signaling as they are not subject to the same regulation.</p>
<p>It is well known that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> produces its own eicosanoid species. These fungal-derived eicosanoids are indistinguishable from those produced by vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref018">18</xref>]. Only two <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> enzymes are known to be associated with cryptococcal eicosanoid synthesis—phospholipase B1 and laccase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref019">19</xref>]. Deletion of phospholipase B1 reduces secreted levels of all eicosanoids produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> suggesting that it has high level role in eicosanoid synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref019">19</xref>], perhaps fulfilling the role of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> in higher organisms. Deletion of laccase results in reduced levels of PGE<sub>2</sub> but other eicosanoids are unaffected suggesting that laccase has putative PGE<sub>2</sub> synthase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref018">18</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> produces eicosanoids during infection, these eicosanoids are indistinguishable from host eicosanoids so it is possible that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> is able to manipulate the host inflammatory state during infection by directly manipulating host eicosanoid signaling.</p>
<p>It has previously been reported that the inhibition of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> receptors EP2 and EP4 during murine pulmonary infection leads to better host survival accompanied by a shift towards Th1/M1 macrophage activation, however it was not determined if PGE<sub>2</sub> was derived from the host or the fungus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref020">20</xref>]. Therefore, a key aspect of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> pathogenesis remains unanswered: do eicosanoids produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> manipulate host innate immune cells function during infection?</p>
<p>We have previously shown that the eicosanoid deficient strain <italic>Δplb1</italic> has reduced proliferation and survival within macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref021">21</xref>]. We hypothesised that eicosanoids produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> support intracellular proliferation within macrophages and subsequently promote pathogenesis. To address this hypothesis, we combined <italic>in vitro</italic> macrophage infection assays with our previous published <italic>in vivo</italic> zebrafish model of cryptococcosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref022">22</xref>]. We found that PGE<sub>2</sub> was sufficient to promote growth of <italic>Δplb1</italic> and <italic>Δlac1</italic> independent of host PGE<sub>2</sub> production, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We show that the effects of PGE<sub>2</sub> in cryptococcal infection are mediated by its dehydrogenated form, 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub>. Finally, we determine that 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> promotes <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> infection via the activation of the host nuclear transcription factor PPAR-γ, demonstrating that 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> and PPAR-γ are new factors in cryptococcal infection.</p>

<title>Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> is required for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> growth in macrophages</title>
<p>We have previously shown that the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> mutant strain <italic>Δplb1</italic> has impaired proliferation and survival within J774 murine macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref021">21</xref>]. The <italic>Δplb1</italic> strain has a deletion in the <italic>PLB1</italic> gene which codes for the secreted enzyme phospholipase B1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref023">23</xref>]. The <italic>Δplb1</italic> strain is known to produce lower levels of fungal eicosanoids indicating that phospholipase B1 is involved in fungal eicosanoid synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref019">19</xref>]. It has been proposed that the attenuation of this strain within macrophages could be because it cannot produce eicosanoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref019">19</xref>]. A previous study has identified PGE<sub>2</sub> as an eicosanoid that promotes cryptococcal virulence and manipulates macrophage activation, however this study did not determine if PGE<sub>2</sub> was produced by the host or <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref020">20</xref>]. We hypothesised that PGE<sub>2</sub>—or other phospholipase B1 derived eicosanoid species—are produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> during infection and promote macrophage infection.</p>
<p>To test if PGE<sub>2</sub> promotes the intracellular growth of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> we treated <italic>Δplb1</italic> infected J774 macrophages with exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> and measured intracellular proliferation over 18 hours. The addition of exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> to J774 macrophages infected with <italic>Δplb1</italic> was sufficient to recover the intracellular proliferation of <italic>Δplb1</italic> compared to the H99 (parental wild type strain) and <italic>Δplb1</italic>:<italic>PLB1</italic> (<italic>PLB1 reconstituted ‘rescue’</italic> strain) strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g001">Fig 1</xref> p = 0.038). These findings support our initial hypothesis and identify PGE<sub>2</sub> as a mediator of cryptococcal virulence during macrophage infection.</p>

<p>We have previously shown that <italic>Δplb1</italic> has reduced intracellular proliferation due to a combination of reduced cell division and reduced viability within the phagosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref021">21</xref>]. In our intracellular proliferation assay the number of intracellular <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> cells is quantified by lysing infected macrophage and counting the number of <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> cells with a hemocytometer. Due to their structurally stable fungal cell wall, dead or dying <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> cells do not look noticeably different on a hemocytometer from viable cells. To quantifiy the viability of <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> cells retrieved from the phagosome we diluted the lysate to give an expected number of CFUs (in this case 200 CFU), spread the diluted lysate on YPD agar and count the actual number of CFUs produced–a difference between the expected CFU count (200 CFU) and the actual CFU count indicates a loss of <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> cell viability. In this case viability assays showed that exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> produced no significant increase in the viability of <italic>Δplb1</italic> cells within the phagosome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007597.s001">S1A Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Exogenous prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> rescues in vivo growth of <italic>Δplb1</italic>-GFP</title>
<p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data showed that PGE<sub>2</sub> promoted the intracellular proliferation of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> within macrophages. To confirm this <italic>in vivo</italic>, we injected 2-day post fertilisation (dpf) zebrafish larvae with <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP (a constitutively expressed GFP tagged version of the <italic>Δplb1</italic> generated for this study). One of the advantages of this model is that the fungal burden can be non-invasively imaged within infected larvae using fluorescently tagged <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> strains and we able measure the growth of the fungus at 1-, 2- and 3-days post-infection (dpi). We found that <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP infected larvae had significantly lower fungal burdens at 1-, 2- and 3-days post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007597.s001">S1B Fig</xref>) compared to the parental strain H99-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007597.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). These data demonstrated that the <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP mutant had a similar growth deficiency to our <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotype and with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref024">24</xref>]. To confirm that PGE<sub>2</sub> promotes cryptococcal infection <italic>in vivo</italic> we infected zebrafish larvae with <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP or H99-GFP and treated the larvae with exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub>. In agreement with our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g001">Fig 1</xref>), exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> increased the growth of both the parental H99 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, p = 0.0137, 1.35-fold increase vs. DMSO) and the <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g002">Fig 2E</xref>, p = 0.0001, 2.15-fold increase vs. DMSO) while PGD<sub>2</sub> did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g002">Fig 2C and 2F</xref>). Taken together these data show that PGE<sub>2</sub> is sufficient to enhance the virulence of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans in vivo</italic>, furthermore our <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggest that this is a result of uncontrolled intracellular proliferation within macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> must be dehydrogenated into 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> to promote <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> growth</title>
<p>PGE<sub>2</sub> can be enzymatically and non-enzymatically modified in cells to form a number of distinct metabolites. To distinguish the biological activity of PGE<sub>2</sub> rather than its metabolites we used an analogue of PGE<sub>2</sub> called 16,16-dimethyl PGE<sub>2</sub> that cannot be dehydrogenated but otherwise has comparable activity to PGE<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref025">25</xref>]). We found that unlike PGE<sub>2</sub>, 16,16-dimethyl PGE<sub>2</sub> treatment did not increase the fungal burden of <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g003">Fig 3C</xref> p = 0.9782) <italic>or</italic> H99-GFP infected larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g003">Fig 3A</xref> p = 0.9954). Therefore, the biological activity of PGE<sub>2</sub> alone did not appear to promote cryptococcal pathogenesis suggesting that dehydrogenation of PGE<sub>2</sub> was required. PGE<sub>2</sub> and 16,16-dimethyl PGE<sub>2</sub> both signal through PGE<sub>2</sub> receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4) but 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> does not. In a murine model of pulmonary cryptococcosis the PGE<sub>2</sub> receptors EP2 and EP4 have been identified as promoters of fungal virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref020">20</xref>]. To confirm that PGE<sub>2</sub> itself does not promote virulence in our model we treated zebrafish with antagonists against the EP2 and EP4 receptors. In support of our previous experiment we found that EP2 / EP4 inhibition had no effect on fungal burden in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). An abundant dehydrogenated form of PGE<sub>2</sub> is 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> (that has also been isolated from <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref018">18</xref>]) and we tested if 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> was sufficient to rescue the growth defect of the <italic>Δplb1</italic> mutant during infection. Therefore, we treated infected zebrafish larvae with exogenous 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> and found that this was sufficient to significantly increase the fungal burden of zebrafish larvae infected with both <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, p = 0.0119, 1.56-fold increase vs. DMSO) and H99-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, p = 0.0048, 1.36-fold increase vs. DMSO). To explore the <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> eicosanoid synthesis pathway further we used a second eicosanoid deficient <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> mutant <italic>Δlac1</italic>. Whereas <italic>Δplb1</italic> is unable to produce any eicosanoid species <italic>Δlac1</italic> is deficient only in PGE<sub>2</sub> and 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref018">18</xref>]. Using a <italic>Δlac1-</italic>GFP strain generated for this study we found that <italic>Δlac1-</italic>GFP also produced low fungal burden during <italic>in vivo</italic> zebrafish larvae infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007597.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). As with <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP, this defect could be rescued with the addition of exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007597.s002">S2C Fig</xref>), but not with 16,16-dm-PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007597.s002">S2D Fig</xref>) or with 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007597.s002">S2E Fig</xref>). PGE<sub>2</sub> is known to affect haematopoietic stem cell homeostasis in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref026">26</xref>]. This could affect macrophage number and subsequently fungal burden. We have previously observed that a large depletion of macrophages can lead to increased fungal burden in zebrafish larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref022">22</xref>]. We performed whole body macrophage counts on 2 dpf uninfected larvae treated with PGE<sub>2</sub> or 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> 2 days post treatment (the same time points used in our infection assay). Following PGE<sub>2</sub> and 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> treatment macrophages were still observable throughout the larvae. For PGE<sub>2</sub> treatment we saw on average a 15% reduction in macrophage number while 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> did not cause any decrease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007597.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). Due to the fact that fungal burden increased during both PGE<sub>2</sub> and 15-keto PGE<sub>2</sub> treatments it is highly unlikely that this reduction could account for the increases in burden seen.</p>

<title>Host derived prostaglandins are not required for growth of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic></title>
<p>After determining that PGE<sub>2</sub> promotes the growth of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> via its metabolite 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub>, we wanted to determine whether the source of these prostaglandins was the host or the fungus. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data show that the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> strain <italic>Δplb1</italic> has a growth deficiency <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> that can be rescued with the addition of PGE<sub>2</sub>, because this phenotype is mediated by cryptococcal phospholipase B1 it indicates that pathogen-derived rather than host-derived prostaglandins are required. A previous study reports that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> infection can induce higher PGE<sub>2</sub> levels in the lung during <italic>in vivo</italic> pulmonary infection of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref020">20</xref>], although it was not determined if the PGE<sub>2</sub> was host or pathogen derived. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that host prostaglandin synthesis was not required for cryptococcal virulence.</p>
<p>To block host prostaglandin synthesis <italic>in</italic> vitro we inhibited host cyclooxygenase activity because it is essential for prostaglandin synthesis in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref027">27</xref>]. We treated H99 and <italic>Δplb1</italic> infected J774 macrophages with aspirin at a concentration we determined was sufficient to block host PGE<sub>2</sub> synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007597.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). Aspirin is a non-reversible inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes, we therefore included a condition where J774 cells were pretreated with aspirin only prior to infection and then at a condition where aspirin was present throughout infection. We found that aspirin treatment did not affect the intracellular proliferation of H99 or <italic>Δplb1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), suggesting that host cyclooxygenase activity is not required for the phospholipase B1 dependent virulence of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> during macrophage infection. To confirm this <italic>in vivo</italic>, we pharmacologically blocked zebrafish COX-1 and COX-2. We used separate cyclooxygenase inhibitors with zebrafish larvae instead of aspirin because we found that aspirin treatment led to lethal developmental defects in zebrafish larvae (unpublished observation). We infected 2 dpf zebrafish larvae with H99-GFP and <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP and treated with inhibitors for COX-1 (NS-398, 15 μM) and COX-2 (SC-560, 15 μM). We found that both inhibitors decreased the fungal burden of H99-GFP, but not <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP infected zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g004">Fig 4Bi and 4Bii</xref>, H99-GFP—NS-398, p = 0.0002, 1.85-fold decrease vs. DMSO. SC-560 p = &lt;0.0001, 3.14-fold decrease vs DMSO). These findings were different to what we had observed <italic>in vitro</italic> but because this phenotype was phospholipase B1 dependent we reasoned that these inhibitors could be having off target effects on <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>.<italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> does not have a homolog to cyclooxygenase however other studies have tried to inhibit eicosanoid production in <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> using cyclooxygenase inhibitors but their efficacy and target remain uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref028">28</xref>]. To support our pharmacological evidence, we used a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockdown of the prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> synthase gene (<italic>ptges)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref029">29</xref>]. We used a knockdown of tyrosinase (<italic>tyr</italic>)–a gene involved in the conversion of tyrosine into melanin as a control because <italic>tyr</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> crispants are easy to identify because they do not produce any pigment. We infected 2 dpf <italic>ptges</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and <italic>tyr</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> zebrafish larvae with H99-GFP or <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP and measured the fungal burden at 3 dpi.

<title>Phospholipase B1 dependent factors are sufficient to support <italic>Δplb1</italic> growth in macrophages</title>
<p>To further evidence that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> was the source of PGE<sub>2</sub> during macrophage infection we used a co-infection assay which has previously been used to investigate the interaction of different <italic>C</italic>. <italic>gattii</italic> strains within the same macrophage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref030">30</xref>]. We hypothesised that if <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> derived prostaglandins promoted fungal growth, co-infection between H99 and <italic>Δplb1</italic> would support mutant growth within macrophages because the parental strain H99 would produce growth promoting prostaglandins that are lacking in <italic>Δplb1</italic>. To produce co-infection, J774 murine macrophages were infected with a 50:50 mixture of <italic>Δplb1</italic> and H99-GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref030">30</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g004">Fig 4Ei</xref>; as described previously for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>gattii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref030">30</xref>]). This approach allowed us to differentiate between <italic>Δplb1</italic> (GFP negative) and H99 (GFP positive) <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> strains within the same macrophage and to score their proliferation separately. The intracellular proliferation of <italic>Δplb1</italic> was calculated by counting the change in number of GFP negative <italic>Δplb1</italic> cells over an 18hr period from time-lapse movies of infected cells. We found that co-infected macrophages did not always contain an equal ratio of each strain at the start of the 18hr period so we scored the proliferation of <italic>Δplb1</italic> for a range of initial burdens (1:2, 1:3 and 1:4). We found that <italic>Δplb1</italic> proliferated better when accompanied by two H99-GFP yeast cells in the same macrophage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g004">Fig 4Eii</xref>, 1:2 p = 0.014) as opposed to when two <italic>Δplb1</italic> yeast cells were accompanied by one H99-GFP yeast cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g004">Fig 4Eii</xref>, 2:1). We observed a similar effect for ratios of 1:3 and 1:4, but these starting burden ratios are particularly rare, under powering our analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007597.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). This effect was also recapitulated for J774 macrophages co-infected with <italic>Δlac1</italic> and H99-GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007597.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). These data indicate that a phospholipase B1 dependent factor found in H99 infected macrophages, but absent in <italic>Δplb1</italic> and <italic>Δlac1</italic> infected macrophages, is required for intracellular proliferation within macrophages.</p>

<title>Production of PGE<sub>2</sub> by macrophages is not altered by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> infection</title>
<p>Our data indicate that host cells are not the source of virulence promoting prostaglandins, and that secreted factors produced by wild type—but not <italic>Δplb1</italic> or <italic>Δlac1 Cryptococcus</italic> strains–promote fungal growth within macrophages. We wanted to test if there were detectable differences in PGE<sub>2</sub> levels between infected and uninfected macrophages caused by cryptococcal prostaglandin synthesis. To do this we performed ELISA analysis to detect PGE<sub>2</sub> concentrations in supernatants from <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> infected J774 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g004">Fig 4Di</xref>). We found that J774 macrophages produced detectable levels of PGE<sub>2</sub> (mean concentration 4.10 ng/1x10<sup>6</sup> cells), however we did not see any significant difference between infected or uninfected macrophages (infected with H99, <italic>Δplb1</italic> or <italic>Δplb1</italic>:<italic>PLB1</italic> strains). To confirm our ELISA results, we performed LC MS/MS analysis of lysed J774 macrophages using a PGE<sub>2</sub> standard for accurate quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g004">Fig 4Dii</xref>). The concentrations detected were similar to those measured by our ELISA (mean concentration 6.35 ng/1X10<sup>6</sup> cells) and also did not show any significant differences between conditions. Taken together these data suggest that any <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>-derived prostaglandins present during infection were likely to be contained within the macrophage in low, localized concentrations and that the host receptor targeted by these eicosanoids is therefore likely to be intracellular.</p>

<title>15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> promotes <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> growth by activating host PPAR-γ</title>
<p>We next wanted to determine how PGE<sub>2</sub> / 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> promotes <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> infection. We hypothesized that these prostaglandins were interfering with inhibition of fungal growth via a host receptor. Our experiments inhibiting EP2 / EP4 suggest that 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> must signal through a different receptor to PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> is a known agonist of the peroxisome proliferation associated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref031">31</xref>]; a transcription factor that controls expression of many inflammation related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref034">34</xref>]. We first tested if PPAR-γ activation occurs within macrophages during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> infection by performing immunofluorescent staining for PPAR-γ in macrophages infected with H99 and <italic>Δplb1</italic>. To quantify PPAR-γ activation we measured its nuclear translocation by comparing nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence intensity in infected cells. PPAR-γ is a cytosolic receptor that translocates to the nucleus upon activation, therefore cells where PPAR-γ is activated should have increased nuclear staining for PPAR-γ. We found that J774 macrophages infected with H99 had significantly higher levels of nuclear staining for PPAR-γ compared to <italic>Δplb1</italic> infected and uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g005">Fig 5Ai</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007597.s003">S3C Fig</xref>).

<p>To test the activation of PPAR-γ during infection we first wanted to confirm that exogenous 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> activates zebrafish PPAR-γ <italic>in vivo</italic> by using transgenic PPAR-γ reporter zebrafish larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref036">36</xref>]. We treated these larvae at 2 dpf with 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> and Troglitazone (TLT) which is a specific agonist of PPAR-γ. TLT treatment was performed with a concentration (0.55 μM) previously shown to strongly activate PPAR-γ in these zebrafish larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref035">35</xref>]. We found that TLT treatment at 2 dpf strongly activated GFP reporter expression in the larvae. We employed a receptor competition assay as a sensitive measurement of binding by simultaneously treating zebrafish with with 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> and TLT. We observed a reduction in GFP expression compared to TLT treatment alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g005">Fig 5Aii</xref>), demonstrating competition for the same receptor. This could mean that 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> was a partial agonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref038">38</xref>] or an antagonist to PPAR-γ in this experiment. Existing studies suggest 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> is an agonist to PPAR-γ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref031">31</xref>] but to confirm this in our model we treated <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP infected zebrafish larvae with exogenous 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> as before but at the same time treated fish with the PPAR-γ antagonist GW9662. We found that 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> treatment significantly improved the growth of <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP during infection but that inhibition of PPAR-γ was sufficient to reverse this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Therefore, we could demonstrate that that 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> was an agonist to PPAR-γ, and that PPAR-γ activation was sufficient to promote a permissive environment for <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> growth during infection.</p>
<p>To determine if PPAR-γ activation by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> facilitates growth within macrophages we treated H99 and <italic>Δplb1</italic> infected J774 murine macrophages with the PPAR-γ antagonist GW9662. GW9662 treatment significantly reduced the proliferation of H99, but not <italic>Δplb1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, p = 0.026, 1.22-fold decrease vs. DMSO). Further supporting that PPAR-γ activation is necessary for the successful intracellular parasitism of host macrophages by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>. Finally, to confirm that PPAR-γ activation alone promoted <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> infection we treated 2dpf infected zebrafish larvae with TLT at the same concentration known to activate PPAR-γ in PPAR-γ reporter fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g005">Fig 5Aii</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref035">35</xref>]). We found that TLT treatment significantly increased the fungal burden of <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g005">Fig 5E</xref> and, p = 0.0089, 1.68-fold increase vs. DMSO), H99-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, p = 0.0044, 1.46-fold increase vs. DMSO) and <italic>Δlac1-</italic>GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007597.g005">Fig 5F</xref>, p = 0.01, 1.94-fold increase vs. DMSO) infected larvae similar to 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> treatment. Thus, we could show that host PPAR-γ activation was sufficient to promote cryptococcal growth during infection and was a consequence of fungal derived prostaglandins.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have shown for the first time that eicosanoids produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> promote fungal virulence both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this respect we have shown that the intracellular growth defects of two eicosanoid deficient <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> strains <italic>Δplb1</italic> and <italic>Δlac1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref023">23</xref>] can be rescued with the addition of exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, our <italic>in vitro</italic> co-infection assay, <italic>in vitro</italic> infection assays with aspirin, and <italic>in vivo</italic> infection assays provide evidence that the source of this eicosanoid during infection is from the pathogen, rather than the host. Using an <italic>in vivo</italic> zebrafish larvae model of cryptococcosis we find that that PGE<sub>2</sub> must be dehydrogenated into 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> before to influence fungal growth. Finally, we provide evidence that the mechanism of PGE<sub>2</sub>/15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> mediated growth promotion during larval infection is via the activation of PPAR-γ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>In a previous study it was identified that the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> mutant <italic>Δplb1</italic> (that lacks the <italic>PLB1</italic> gene coding for phospholipase B1) was deficient in replication and survival in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref021">21</xref>], a phenotype also observed by a number of studies using different <italic>in vitro</italic> infection assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref023">23</xref>]. In this study we demonstrate that supplementing <italic>Δplb1</italic> with exogenous prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> during <italic>in vitro</italic> macrophages infection is sufficient to restore the mutant’s intracellular proliferation defect. A key goal of this study was to investigate how eicosanoids produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> modulate pathogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref022">22</xref>]. To facilitate <italic>in vivo</italic> measurement of fungal burden we created two GFP-tagged strains with constitutive GFP expression - <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP and <italic>Δlac1-</italic>GFP—to use alongside the GFP-tagged H99 parental strain previously produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref042">42</xref>]. These two mutants are the only <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> mutants known to have a deficiency in eicosanoid synthesis. <italic>Δplb1</italic> cannot produce any eicosanoid species suggesting phospholipase B1 is high in the eicosanoid synthesis pathway while <italic>Δlac1</italic> has a specific defect in PGE<sub>2</sub> suggesting it might be a prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> synthase enzyme. To our knowledge these are the first GFP expressing strains of <italic>Δplb1</italic> and <italic>Δlac1</italic> created. Characterisation of <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP and <italic>Δlac1-</italic>GFP <italic>in vivo</italic> revealed that both strains have significantly reduced fungal burdens compared to H99-GFP. This is the first report of <italic>Δlac1</italic> in zebrafish but these observations do confirm a previous zebrafish study showing that non-fluorescent <italic>Δplb1</italic> had attenuated infectious burden in zebrafish larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref043">43</xref>]. To confirm that PGE<sub>2</sub> is also required for cryptococcal growth <italic>in vivo</italic> we treated <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP and <italic>Δlac1-</italic>GFP infected zebrafish larvae with exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> to determine how it would affect fungal burden. In agreement with our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings we found that PGE<sub>2</sub> significantly improved the growth of both of these strains within larvae. Interestingly we also found that PGE<sub>2</sub> improved the growth of H99-GFP, perhaps representing a wider manipulation of host immunity during <italic>in vivo</italic> infection.</p>
<p>In vertebrate cells, PGE<sub>2</sub> is converted into 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> by the enzyme 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15PGDH), furthermore it has been reported that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> has enzymatic activity analogous to 15PGDH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref018">18</xref>]. To investigate how the dehydrogenation of PGE<sub>2</sub> to 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> influenced fungal burden we treated infected larvae with 16,16-dm-PGE<sub>2</sub> –a synthetic variant of PGE<sub>2</sub> which is resistant to dehydrogenation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref025">25</xref>]. Interestingly we found that 16,16-dm-PGE<sub>2</sub> was unable to promote the growth of <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP, H99-GFP or <italic>Δlac1-</italic>GFP within infected larvae. These findings indicate that 15-keto-PGE<sub>2,</sub> rather than PGE<sub>2</sub>, promotes cryptococcal virulence. We subsequently treated infected larvae with exogenous 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> and confirmed that 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> treatment was sufficient to promote the growth of both <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP and H99-GFP, but not <italic>Δlac1-</italic>GFP (discussed below), without the need for PGE<sub>2</sub>. We therefore propose that PGE<sub>2</sub> produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> during infection must be enzymatically dehydrogenated into 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> to promote cryptococcal virulence. These findings represent the identification of a new virulence factor (15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub>) produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>, as well as the first-time identification of an eicosanoid other than PGE<sub>2</sub> with a role in promoting cryptococcal growth. Furthermore, our findings suggest that previous studies which identify PGE<sub>2</sub> as a promoter of cryptococcal virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref044">44</xref>] may have observed additive effects from both PGE<sub>2</sub> and 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> activity.</p>
<p>Our experiments with the <italic>Δlac1-</italic>GFP strain reveals that this strain appears to respond in a similar way to PGE<sub>2</sub>, 16,16-dm-PGE<sub>2</sub> and troglitazone as <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP but appears to be unresponsive to 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub>. At this time, we cannot fully explain this phenotype, <italic>Δlac1-</italic>GFP was generally less responsive to PGE<sub>2</sub> and troglitazone treatments compared to <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP so it is possible that that higher concentrations of 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> would be needed to rescue its growth defect, however experimentation with higher concentrations of 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> led to significant host toxicity. The unresponsiveness of <italic>Δlac1</italic> to eicosanoid treatment could be due to unrelated virulence defects caused by laccase deficiency. Cryptococcal laccase expression is required for the production of fungal melanin–a well characterized virulence factor produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref046">46</xref>]. It is therefore likely that virulence defects unrelated to eicosanoid synthesis are responsible for the differences between the two mutant phenotypes.</p>
<p>We have found that the phospholipase B1 dependent attenuation of <italic>Δplb1</italic> can be rescued with the addition of exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub>. This indicates that synthesis and secretion of PGE<sub>2</sub> by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> is a virulence factor. Although our data indicated that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> was the source of PGE<sub>2</sub> we wanted exclude the possibility that host-derived PGE<sub>2</sub> was also contributing to virulence. To explore this possibility, we blocked host prostaglandin synthesis—we reasoned that if host PGE<sub>2</sub> was not required that blocking its production would not affect the growth of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>. To do this we first treated J774 macrophages infected with H99-GFP and <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP with aspirin–a cyclooxygenase inhibitor that blocks both COX-1 and COX-2 activity–and found that this had no effect on intracellular proliferation. Subsequently we attempted to block cyclooxygenase activity in zebrafish but found aspirin was lethal at the zebrafish larvae’s currently stage of development, instead we used individual inhibitors specific for COX-1 (NS-398) and COX-2 (SC-560). We found that each inhibitor decreases fungal burden of H99-GFP infected larvae but not <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP infected larvae. Due to the phospholipase B1 dependence of this phenotype we think that these inhibitors might be affecting eicosanoid production by the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> itself. The ability of broad COX inhibitors like aspirin/indomethacin to inhibit eicosanoid production by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> is controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref028">28</xref>] however our study is the first to use selective COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors on <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>. This experiment remained inconclusive as to whether host PGE<sub>2</sub> synthesis promotes virulence so to block PGE<sub>2</sub> in zebrafish larvae without potential off target effects we used CRISPR Cas9 technology to knockdown expression of the prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> synthase gene <italic>ptges</italic> in zebrafish larvae. Ablating zebrafish <italic>ptges</italic> with this approach did not affect the fungal burden of <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP infected larvae but it did cause increased burden in H99-GFP infected zebrafish. This phenotype is interesting because it suggests host PGE<sub>2</sub> might actually be inhibitory to cryptococcal virulence, furthermore this phenotype was phospholipase B1 dependent which suggests host-derived PGE<sub>2</sub> might interact in some way with <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>-derived eicosanoids. This phenotype was not seen <italic>in vitro</italic> with aspirin so it is possible that the inhibitory effects of host-derived PGE<sub>2</sub> influence a non-macrophage cell type in zebrafish larvae.</p>
<p>To confirm our observations that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> was the source of PGE<sub>2</sub> during infection we performed co-infection assays with H99 wild type cryptococci (eicosanoid producing) and <italic>Δplb1</italic> (eicosanoid deficient) within the same macrophage and found that co-infection was sufficient to promote the intracellular growth of <italic>Δplb1</italic>. We also observed similar interactions during <italic>Δlac1</italic> co-infection (a second eicosanoid deficient <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> mutant). These observations agree with previous studies that suggest eicosanoids are virulence factors produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> during macrophage infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref028">28</xref>]. To identify if the secreted factor produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> was PGE<sub>2</sub>, we measured the levels of PGE<sub>2</sub> from <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> infected macrophages to see if there was an observable increase in this eicosanoid during infection. Although PGE<sub>2</sub> was detected, we did not see any significant difference between infected and uninfected macrophages, an observation confirmed using two different detection techniques–ELISA and LC MS/MS. These data suggest that PGE<sub>2</sub> produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> during macrophage infection is contained within the macrophage, likely in close proximity to the fungus and that the host receptor targeted by these eicosanoids is therefore likely to be intracellular. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> co-infection experiments indicate that <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> secretes virulence enhancing eicosanoids during infection.</p>
<p>The biological activity of 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> is far less studied than PGE<sub>2</sub>. It is known that 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> cannot bind to prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> EP receptors, this means it can act as a negative regulator of PGE<sub>2</sub> activity i.e. cells up-regulate 15PGDH activity to lower PGE<sub>2</sub> levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref047">47</xref>]. Our findings however suggested that 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> did have a biological activity independent of PGE<sub>2</sub> synthesis, possibly via a distinct eicosanoid receptor. It has been demonstrated that 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> can activate the intracellular eicosanoid receptor peroxisome proliferator associated receptor gamma (PPAR- γ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref031">31</xref>]. Activation of PPAR-γ by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> has not been described previously but it is compatible with what we know of cryptococcal pathogenesis. PPAR-γ is a nuclear receptor normally found within the cytosol. Upon ligand binding PPAR-γ forms a heterodimer with Retinoid X receptor (RXR) and translocates to the nucleus where it influences the expression of target genes which possess a peroxisome proliferation hormone response element (PPRE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref048">48</xref>]. If eicosanoids are produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> during intracellular infection, it is likely that they bind to an intracellular eicosanoid receptor. Additionally, activation of PPAR-γ within macrophages is known to promote the expression of anti-inflammatory genes which could make the macrophage more amenable to parasitism by the fungus.</p>
<p>To investigate whether PPAR-γ activation within macrophages occurs during <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> infection we performed immunofluorescent staining of H99 and <italic>Δplb1</italic> infected J774 macrophages. We found that infection with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> led to increased nuclear localization of PPAR- γ indicating that the fungus was activating endogenous PPAR- γ during infection. We also found that macrophages infected with H99 had higher levels of PPAR- γ activation than <italic>Δplb1</italic> infected macrophages. This strongly suggests that eicosanoids produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> are responsible for activating PPAR- γ.</p>
<p>To confirm that 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> is an agonist to PPAR-γ we performed experiments with zebrafish larvae from PPAR-γ GFP reporter fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref035">35</xref>] and demonstrated that 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> binds to zebrafish PPAR- γ. To determine if 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> is an agonist to PPAR- γ we found that treating <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP infected zebrafish larvae with GW9662 at the same time as 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> blocked the virulence enhancing effects of the eicosanoid. These data indicate that 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> is a partial agonist to PPAR-γ (in zebrafish at least). Partial agonists are weak agonists that bind to and activate receptors, but not at the same efficacy as a full agonist. Partial agonists to PPAR-γ have been reported previously, partial PPAR agonists bind to the ligand binding domain of PPAR-γ with a lower affinity than full PPAR agonists and as a result activate smaller subsets of PPAR-γ controlled genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref052">52</xref>].</p>
<p>We also found that activation of PPAR-γ alone was sufficient to mediate cryptococcal virulence. In this respect, we found that the <italic>in vitro</italic> intracellular proliferation of the wild type H99 cryptococcal strain within J774 macrophages could be suppressed using a PPAR-γ antagonist GW9662. We could also block the rescuing effect of 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> on <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP during zebrafish infection using GW9662. Finally we found that <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> infected zebrafish treated with troglitazone at a concentration that is known to activate PPAR-γ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref035">35</xref>] had increased fungal burdens when infected with <italic>Δplb1-</italic>GFP, <italic>Δlac1-</italic>GFP and H99-GFP strains. Taken together these experiments provide convincing evidence that a novel cryptococcal virulence factor—15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> –enhances the virulence of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> by activation of host PPAR-γ and that macrophages are one of the key targets of this eicosanoid during infection.</p>
<p>In this study, we have shown for the first time that eicosanoids produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> can promote virulence in an <italic>in vivo</italic> host. Furthermore, we have provided evidence that this virulence occurs via eicosanoid mediated manipulation of host macrophages. We have identified that the eicosanoid responsible for these effects is 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> which is derived from the dehydrogenation of PGE<sub>2</sub> produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>. We have subsequently demonstrated that 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> mediates its effects via activation of PPAR- γ, an intracellular eicosanoid receptor known to promote anti-inflammatory immune pathways within macrophages. We provide compelling evidence that eicosanoids produced by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> enhance virulence, identifies a novel virulence factor– 15-keto-PGE<sub>2</sub> –and describes a novel mechanism of host manipulation by <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic>—activation of PPAR- γ. Most importantly this study provides a potential new therapeutic pathway for treatment of cryptococcal infection, as several eicosanoid modulating drugs are approved for patient treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref053">53</xref>].</p>

<title>J774 Macrophage infection–with exogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> treatment</title>
<p>J774 macrophage (J774 cells were obtained from the ATCC, American Type Culture Collection) infection was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref021">21</xref>] with the following alterations. J774 murine macrophage-like cells were cultured for a minimum of 4 passages in T75 tissue culture flasks at 37 <sup>o</sup>C 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM (High glucose, Sigma) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Calf Serum (Invitrogen), 1% 10,000 units Penicillin / 10 mg/ml streptomycin and 1% 200 mM/L–glutamine, fully confluent cells were used for each experiment. Macrophages were counted by haemocytometer and diluted to a concentration of 1x10<sup>5</sup> cells per ml in DMEM supplemented with 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, Sigma L2630) before being plated into 24 well microplates (Greiner) and incubated for 24 hours (37 <sup>o</sup>C 5% CO<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p>Following 24-hour incubation, medium was removed and replaced with 1 ml DMEM supplemented with 2 nM prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (CAY14010, 1mg/ml stock in 100% ethanol). Macrophage wells were then infected with 100 μl 1x10<sup>6</sup> yeast/ml <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> cells (from overnight culture, washed. See above) opsonized with anti-capsular IgG monoclonal antibody (18b7, a kind gift from Arturo Casadevall). Cells were incubated for 2 hours (37 <sup>o</sup>C 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) and then washed with 37 <sup>o</sup>C PBS until extracellular yeast were removed. After washing, infected cells were treated with 1ml DMEM supplemented with PGE<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>To calculate IPR, replicate wells for each treatment/strain were counted at 0 and 18 hours. Each well was washed once with 1ml 37 <sup>o</sup>C PBS prior to counting to remove any <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> cells released by macrophage death or vomocytosis. Intra-macrophage Cryptococci were released by lysis with 200 μl dH<sub>2</sub>O for 20 minutes (lysis confirmed under microscope). Lysate was removed to a clean microcentrifuge tube and an additional 200 μl was used to wash the well to make a total lysate volume of 400 μl. <italic>Cryptoccoccus</italic> cells within lysates were counted by haemocytometer. IPR was calculated by dividing the total number of counted yeast at 18hr by the total at 0hr.</p>
<p>To assess the viability of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>neoformans</italic> cells recovered from macrophages we used our previously published colony forming unit (CFU) viability assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007597.ref021">21</xref>].

<p>After 18 hours supernatants were removed and J774s were fixed with cold methanol for 5 minutes at -20 <sup>o</sup>C before washing with PBS three times, leaving PBS for five minutes at room temperature between washes. Coverslips were blocked with 5% sheep serum in 0.1% triton (block solution) for 20 minutes before being transferred into the primary PPAR-γ antibody (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-7273 lot #B1417) with 1:10 human IgG in block solution for one hour. Coverslips were washed 3 times in PBS and incubated with 1:200 anti-mouse TRITC, 1:40 anti-human IgG, and 0.41 μl/ml DAPI in block solution for one hour. Coverslips were then washed three times with PBS, three times with water, and fixed to slides using MOWIOL. Slides were left in the dark overnight and imaged the following day.
