<abstract>
<p>Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is causally associated with Kaposi’s sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman’s disease. The IFIT family of proteins inhibits replication of some viruses, but their effects on KSHV lytic replication was unknown. Here we show that KSHV lytic replication induces IFIT expression in epithelial cells. Depletion of IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 (IFITs) increased infectious KSHV virion production 25-32-fold compared to that in control cells. KSHV lytic gene expression was upregulated broadly with preferential activation of several genes involved in lytic viral replication. Intracellular KSHV genome numbers were also increased by IFIT knockdown, consistent with inhibition of KSHV DNA replication by IFITs. RNA seq demonstrated that IFIT depletion also led to downregulation of IFN β and several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), especially OAS proteins. OAS down-regulation led to decreased RNase L activity and slightly increased total RNA yield. IFIT immunoprecipitation also showed that IFIT1 bound to viral mRNAs and cellular capped mRNAs but not to uncapped RNA or trimethylated RNAs, suggesting that IFIT1 may also inhibit viral mRNA expression through direct binding. In summary, IFIT inhibits KSHV lytic replication through positively regulating the IFN β and OAS RNase L pathway to degrade RNA in addition to possibly directly targeting viral mRNAs.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The innate immune response to infections is triggered by recognition of pathogens as foreign or non-self. Recognition of invading pathogens is carried out by various sensors or pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect conserved features of pathogens including lipids, nucleic acids and proteins. PRR activation triggers pathways that ultimately lead to pathogen destruction, including the interferon response. Interferons, in turn induce many interferon-stimulated genes, which inhibit or destroy a wide variety of pathogens, including viruses. IFITs are a family of interferon induced proteins that are thought to recognize RNAs and have antiviral effects primarily on RNA viruses. Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a DNA virus, is associated with Kaposi’s sarcoma and lymphoid malignancies. In this study we show that IFITs restrict replication of KSHV and does so not only by inhibiting KSHV mRNA abundance but also by enhancing other effectors of the interferon response. This study reveals that the innate immune response can control not only invading viruses but ones that reactivate from latency, that IFITs can inhibit herpesvirus replication and that IFITs may amplify the innate immune response by a feed-forward mechanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, HHV8) is causally associated with Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman’s disease (for a review, see reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref001">1</xref>]). KSHV maintains a persistent latent infection in B lymphocytes, from which it occasionally reactivates, enters a lytic cycle of replication, and produces infectious virions. Transmission occurs by both sexual and nonsexual contact as well as blood and organ transfusion. Cell-mediated immunity is important for limiting KSHV reactivation and pathogenesis. KSHV infection activates several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including cGAS, IFI16, RIG-I, NLRP1, and several Toll-like receptors (TLRs) which play an important role in promoting the innate immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref007">7</xref>]. KSHV pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognized by the innate immune system remain to be fully characterized but are primarily thought to reside on viral glycoproteins and nucleic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Much of the work done on the innate immune response to KSHV has used systems in which the cellular response to incoming virus has been examined. These studies have shown that cytoplasmic and endosomal viral nucleic acids may be detected by one or more PRRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref009">9</xref>] and that viral glycoproteins may activate PRRs upon viral entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref012">12</xref>]. Several DNA sensors may be important in recognition of viral DNA, including cyclic GMP synthetase (cGAS) and IFI16. IFI16 has recently been shown to act in the nucleus to activate a nuclear inflammasome in response to KSHV and EBV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref014">14</xref>]. cGAS mediated recruitment of STING and IRF3 activation requires association with a ribonucleoprotein complex which is remodeled by foreign DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref015">15</xref>]. Several components of these cytoplasmic innate immune pathways are involved in the innate immune response to KSHV. TLR9 appears to act as a sensor for incoming KSHV DNA and partly contributes to the activation of IFN-α [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref010">10</xref>]. Both NLRP1, a protein component of the inflammasome, and IFI16 may restrict KSHV reactivation, since depletion of NLRP1 or IFI16 results in increased lytic replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref016">16</xref>]. Similarly, RIG-I, a cytosolic RNA sensor, may be important in limiting KSHV reactivation from latency as KSHV lytic replication was enhanced in RIG-I<sup>-/-</sup> cells. The importance of these pathways is emphasized by the fact that KSHV counteracts the host response via vIRF-1, LANA and ORF52 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>The PAMPs displayed by herpesviruses are predicted to differ considerably depending on the stage and type of their replicative cycles. During latency, herpesviruses exist as chromatinized nuclear episomes. During stringent latency, few, if any, lytic proteins or RNAs are synthesized, and virion DNA is not produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref001">1</xref>]. In contrast, once reactivation occurs, and the virus enters the lytic replicative cycle, abundant amounts of viral mRNAs and non-coding RNAs are produced and newly replicated genomes are produced, encapsidated, and egress from the nucleus prior to tegumentation, final envelopment and transit through the plasma membrane. Thus, while virion DNA is not expected to be exposed to endosomes and cytoplasm in the same context as during primary infection of the cell, there is nevertheless ample of opportunity for virus components such as mRNAs, non-coding RNAs, and viral proteins to be detected by cytoplasmic PRRs and trigger innate immune responses. We therefore wished to extend our study of host cellular factors to cytoplasmic PRRs that could contribute to establishment of an antiviral state and restrict lytic KSHV replication and reactivation from latency. These include human IFIT proteins that have been recently demonstrated to play important roles in the inhibition of several viruses besides herpesviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>The IFN induced tetratricopeptide repeat containing proteins (IFITs) are among the most highly interferon-induced proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref020">20</xref>]. They constitute a family of related genes that have been identified in a wide variety of mammals from mouse to man [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref021">21</xref>]. The human genes, encoded on chromosome 10, are IFIT1 (ISG56), IFIT2 (ISG54), IFIT3, IFIT5 and IFIT1B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref021">21</xref>]. Several of the IFITs have been implicated in an important antiviral response pathway dependent on recognition of foreign RNAs. In mice, Ifit1, a homolog of human IFIT1B, specifically recognizes uniquely modified viral RNAs that lack 2'O-methylation of their 5' mRNA caps (cap0-mRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref023">23</xref>]. Viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm that have either “snatched” a cap or encode their own 2”O-methyltransferase may thereby evade recognition as non-self [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref024">24</xref>]. In humans however, IFIT1 protein differs significantly from IFIT1B, and may play a broader role in antiviral function, with different RNA binding specificities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref021">21</xref>]. IFIT1 forms a tripartite complex with IFIT2 and IFIT3 and binds to 5’ mRNA caps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref025">25</xref>]. In addition to inhibiting replication of viruses that are predicted to have 2’O-methylated caps, IFIT1 inhibits papillomavirus replication by binding its E1A protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref026">26</xref>]. IFIT1 inhibits translation of viral mRNAs by preferentially binding their 5’ cap and preventing association with eukaryotic initiation factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref023">23</xref>]. In addition, IFIT1 has been shown to affect protein translation by interacting with eukaryotic initiation factor eIF3 and may thereby inhibit additional virus families by different mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref018">18</xref>]. It was therefore of interest to determine whether IFIT proteins could inhibit KSHV, whose replication strategy differs considerably from other virus families in which IFITs have been shown to exert antiviral activity.</p>
<p>In this study, we examined the effect of IFIT proteins on KSHV replication by depleting IFITs under conditions whereby highly efficient KSHV lytic replication and infectious virion production was enabled in epithelial cells. KSHV lytic gene expression, DNA replication and virion production were enhanced by depletion of IFITs. Further, IFIT expression, which was undetectable during latent infection, was induced during the course of KSHV reactivation and lytic replication. Using deep sequencing of mRNA, we analyzed the effects of IFITs on KSHV and cellular transcript accumulation during lytic KSHV replication. In addition to IFIT effects on the viral transcriptome, we discovered an unexpected positive effect on the expression of other members of the interferon-induced response that is predicted to amplify the antiviral effect of IFIT proteins.</p>

<title>KSHV lytic replication induces IFIT expression</title>
<p>IFIT genes are strongly induced by several viral infections, including the betaherpesvirus hCMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref027">27</xref>]. Although several innate immune pathways are induced by KSHV infection or reactivation, it was not known whether IFITs were induced by KSHV lytic replication during reactivation from latency. We therefore examined the status of IFIT protein expression in iSLK/Bac16 cells stably transduced with a doxycycline-inducible viral transactivator, KSHV ORF50/Rta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref059">59</xref>]. These Rta-inducible SLK cells (iSLK) are stably and latently infected with the Bac16 KSHV strain that expresses hygromycin resistance and GFP, and robust and synchronous reactivation of KSHV from latency is achieved by doxycycline treatment. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref030">30</xref>]. Infected cells were 100% GFP positive when maintained under hygromycin selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007609.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). iSLK/Bac16 cells were treated with doxycycline and cells were harvested at serial time points from 0–72 hrs at 12 hr intervals. We measured IFIT1 and IFIT3 protein levels in iSLK cells by Western blotting. Both IFIT1 and IFIT3 were not detectable in uninduced cells but were expressed after KSHV reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007609.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). IFIT1 protein was first detectable at 36hr post induction (p.i.) and continued to increase to 72 hr. IFIT3 was first detectable at 12 hr and reached peak expression by 48 hr. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). In order to confirm that exogenous Rta expression itself did not affect IFIT expression, we also assessed IFIT1 and IFIT3 expression in doxycycline treated or untreated uninfected iSLK cells. Neither IFIT1 and IFIT3 was detectable at 48 hr and 72 hr (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007609.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Induction of KSHV Bac16 lytic replication was confirmed by immunoblotting for ORF57 which was expressed by 12hr after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). qPCR also showed IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 expression peaking by 36hr which was consistent with the results of Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). These results clearly demonstrate that KSHV lytic replication induces IFIT expression.</p>

<p>In order to confirm induction of IFITs as a result of KSHV replication and to determine their cellular location, we examined lytically induced KSHV infected cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. iSLK cells were grown on glass coverslips and treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline to induce virus lytic replication.

<title>IFIT depletion enhances lytic KSHV replication and virus production</title>
<p>In order to investigate IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3’s effect on KSHV lytic replication and reactivation from latency, we measured virion production in KSHV infected cells (iSLK/Bac16) after depletion of IFITs. IFIT depletion was carried out by lipid-mediated transfection of iSLK cells with siRNA specific for IFITs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g003">Fig 3A–3C</xref>). Cells were transfected with siRNAs 6 hr prior to inducing lytic replication. We first measured IFIT RNA abundance at 48 hr post induction by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Approximately 90% depletion of IFIT mRNAs was apparent in cells induced to permit KSHV replication. We next examined expression of IFIT1 and IFIT3 by immunoblotting from samples harvested at 48 hr post induction. Approximately 90% depletion of IFIT1 protein was achieved by 48 hr post-transfection as assessed by densitometry of the Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). There was approximately 73% depletion of IFIT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). In order to assess the effect of IFIT depletion on KSHV reactivation and virion production, cells were transfected with either IFIT siRNAs or control siRNA, and 6 hours later KSHV reactivation was induced by addition of doxycycline. Virion-containing supernatant was harvested at 120 hours after induction of lytic replication. Infectious virus production was measured by infection of 293T cells with serial dilutions of virus supernatant followed by flow cytometry of infected cells. Virus titer in the supernatant can thus be accurately quantitated as GFP-transducing units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref029">29</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g003">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007609.s005">S5 Fig</xref> (IFIT KD and virion titration repeated in a separate experiment), IFIT depletion led to a marked increase in virion production (25–32 fold), compared to control siRNA-transfected cells induced in parallel. There was no microscopically detectable release of infectious virus in the absence of doxycycline from either IFIT depleted cells or in control cells, indicating that Rta is still absolutely required for lytic replication. These data indicate that the IFITs act as a restriction factor for KSHV virus production.</p>

IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 mRNA expression was measured by qPCR. Cells were either untreated (-D) or treated with doxycycline (+D) to induce replication. RQ (relative quantity). Each experiment was performed with biological triplicates and technical triplicates. Error bars show SEM of qPCR from triplicate samples. B, C. Effect of IFIT KD on IFIT protein levels. Immunoblotting of lysates from cells used in panel A above was performed with anti-IFIT1 and anti-IFIT3 antibodies to verify completeness of IFIT1 and IFIT3 depletion. Lysates were prepared from cells harvested at the time of replication induction with doxycycline. Immunoblots for tubulin are shown as loading controls. D. Effect of IFIT depletion on infectious virion production. KSHV-infected iSLK cells were transfected with either control siRNA (NC Si) or a mixture of IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3-specific siRNA (IFITs Si) and KSHV replication was induced by treatment with doxycycline. Supernatants from induced cells were used to infect 293T cells, leading to GFP expression in infected cells. Infectious virus titer in the supernatants was measured by flow cytometry to quantitate GFP-positive 293T cells. Each transfection/induction was performed in triplicate and three replicate infections were performed with each supernatant. Error bars show SEM of titration from triplicate samples. E. Effect of individual IFIT depletion on infectious virion production. KSHV-infected iSLK cells were transfected with either control siRNA (NC Si) or IFIT1, IFIT2 or IFIT3-specific siRNA individually. KSHV replication was induced by treatment with doxycycline and infectious virus titration was performed as in D. Each transfection/induction was performed in triplicate and three replicate infections were performed with each supernatant. Error bars show SEM of titration from triplicate samples. F.

<p>IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 may form a tripartite complex and cooperate in RNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref030">30</xref>]. Therefore, we performed virion titration as was done in the previous experiments to examine the effect on virion production of individual depletion of each IFIT. Individual depletion of the three IFITs had a similar effect on virion release, with each IFIT depletion leading to a marked increase in virion production (about 22–25 fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). The magnitude of this effect is similar to that observed upon depletion of all three IFITs together. These data suggest that each of the three IFITs is important for restriction of KSHV virus production.</p>
<p>We next wished to ask at which stage of KSHV lytic replication IFITs might be exerting an inhibitory effect on KSHV virion production. To determine whether the IFIT effect was due to inhibition of KSHV DNA replication, we measured KSHV genome abundance by qPCR on DNA samples from cells that were induced to replicate after depletion or mock depletion of IFITs. The results demonstrated that intracellular KSHV genome copy numbers increased at least 9-fold upon IFIT KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). However, this increase was not as large as the increases observed in infectious virus titer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007609.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), suggesting that IFITs may affect other steps in the lytic KSHV cycle in addition to DNA replication.</p>

<title>IFIT depletion broadly upregulates KSHV gene expression</title>
<p>IFIT depletion enhanced KSHV virion production (25–32 fold) while KSHV DNA copy number increased only 9-fold, suggesting that IFITs may restrict expression of late genes that are needed for virion formation, egress or infectivity. In order to assess the global effect of IFITs on KSHV lytic gene expression, we performed high-throughput deep sequencing of mRNA from KSHV-infected cells in which IFITs were depleted prior to induction of lytic replication. KSHV-infected iSLK cells were transfected with either control siRNA or IFIT siRNAs as was done in the previous experiments to examine the effect on virion production. Six hours after siRNA transfection, cells were treated with doxycycline to induce KSHV lytic replication, and cells were harvested at 48 hours post induction, RNA was isolated, oligo-dT selected, and processed for deep sequencing. The effects of IFIT KD on lytic cycle transcription were compared to the transcriptional profile of induced cells transfected with control siRNA. A comparison of the transcriptional profiles is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g004">Fig 4A</xref>. Consistent with its effect on virus production, IFIT KD was associated with broad enhancement of KSHV lytic gene expression. Approximately two thirds of genes demonstrated increased expression: 6 genes increased &gt; 2-fold and 35 genes increased 1.2-2-fold. 30 genes did not exhibit increases (less than 20% change) while 15 genes decreased 20% -85% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Of the six genes whose expression was increased more than two-fold, 5 are involved in lytic KSHV DNA replication: ORF56, the helicase primase; ORF54, the deoxyuridine triphosphatase; ORF6, the single-stranded DNA-binding protein; ORF70, thymidylate synthase; and ORF57, a post-transcriptional regulator that preferentially enhances mRNA accumulation of several genes involved in DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref031">31</xref>]. The sixth gene ORF47, encodes glycoprotein L. The preferential enhancement of genes involved in KSHV DNA replication is consistent with the effect of IFIT KD on KSHV DNA replication shown above. However, the increased expression of the majority of KSHV lytic genes suggested that IFITs may have general effects beyond inhibition of specific KSHV genes.</p>

<p>In order to determine whether IFITs have a generally inhibitory effect on KSHV replication, we set out to examine the effect of IFIT KD in the BCBL1 KSHV-infected primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cell line. The TREx BCBL1-Rta cell line employed carries a doxycycline-inducible Rta gene, allowing robust KSHV lytic replication upon doxycycline treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref032">32</xref>], kind gift of Jae Jung.</p>
<p>TRExBCBL1-Rta cells were treated with doxycycline and cells were harvested at serial time points from 0–48 hrs at 12 hr intervals. IFIT1 and IFIT3 protein were not detectable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007609.s006">S6A Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007609.s006">S6B Fig</xref>) by Western blotting although KSHV ORF57 was strongly induced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007609.s006">S6C Fig</xref>). IFIT expression in iSLK Bac16 cells was easily detectable under the same conditions. These results indicated that the innate immune response in TRExBCBL1-Rta is different from that in iSLK/Bac16, consistent with prior reports that IFIT expression is nonfunctional in a large percentage of cancer cell lines and primary cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref034">34</xref>]. Regardless, we asked whether KD of IFIT mRNAs could affect KSHV gene expression even though IFIT protein expression was undetectable by immunoblotting. Lentiviruses containing shIFIT1 were constructed and tested by infecting induced iSLK/Bac16. Three clones of shIFIT1s (258, 316 and 581) achieved efficient knockdown of IFIT1 in iSLK/Bac16 without cellular toxicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007609.s006">S6D Fig</xref>). These three lentiviral preparations were combined and used to infect TRExBCBL1-Rta at an MOI of 15. After infection by lentivirus, cells were either treated or mock-treated with doxycycline and harvested at 48hr post induction. Flow sorting was performed to confirm transduction by GFP-expressing lentivirus. Lysates from control or IFIT1 shRNA transduced TREX BCBL1-Rta cells showed no differences in ORF57 (early) or K8.1 (late) lytic protein expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007609.s006">S6G Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007609.s006">S6H Fig</xref>).

<title>IFIT depletion downregulates the cellular type 1 interferon pathway</title>
<p>IFIT depletion enhanced KSHV DNA replication and upregulated viral mRNA expression, contributing to increased virion production. We also wished to determine the effects of IFIT KD on cellular gene expression. There were 99 cellular genes whose transcript abundance decreased by 50% or more upon IFIT KD when KSHV lytic replication was induced. Analysis of this gene set by GO Enrichment Analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://geneontology.org/page/go-enrichment-analysis" xlink:type="simple">http://geneontology.org/page/go-enrichment-analysis</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref037">37</xref>] showed high enrichment in genes assigned to the type 1 interferon pathway. 11 of the 99 genes whose transcript abundance decreased on IFIT KD were assigned to this pathway (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007609.t001">Table 1</xref>). This represents a 35 fold enrichment over expected (p value 6.94 X 10<sup>−14</sup>). Among these ISGs, the OAS family (OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, OASL) was most significantly enriched. We performed qPCR for these OAS genes to validate and confirm the RNA Seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). All OAS genes were significantly down regulated (p&lt;0.0002) to less than 17% after IFITs were depleted compared to mock depletion, suggesting that IFITs may affect KSHV replication through the OAS-RNase L pathway. Since several other ISGs belonging to the type 1 interferon pathway were also downregulated by IFIT KD, we performed qPCR to measure the expression of the most upstream regulator, IFN β. Lytic replication of KSHV induced IFN β expression in the control transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). IFN β expression was downregulated significantly (p&lt;0.0001) to 7% in IFIT KD cells compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Therefore, IFITs appear to enhance IFN β production and downstream ISG expression during KSHV lytic replication, and depletion of IFITs results in a blunted type 1 interferon response.</p>

<title>IFIT KD leads to decreased OAS function, RNase L activity and RNA accumulation</title>
<p>The 2’,5’-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase (OAS)-RNase L system is an interferon-induced antiviral pathway. Induction of OAS proteins by IFN and viral replication leads to synthesis of 2’5’ oligoadenylates which activate RNase L. OASs (OAS1, OAS2, OAS3) synthesize 2’-5’ oligoadenylates and activate RNase L leading to degradation of viral and cellular RNAs, thereby restricting viral infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref038">38</xref>]. Activated RNase L preferentially cleaves target RNAs produced by viruses as well as several cellular RNAs at specific sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref040">40</xref>]. To confirm that the OAS expression that was inhibited by IFIT KD was functionally relevant, we compared RNase L activity in IFIT depleted and mock-depleted cells. Donovan et al. have demonstrated that RNA cleavage by activated RNase L can be quantitatively measured by RtcB-ligase assisted qPCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref040">40</xref>]. In this assay, RtcB ligase, which is capable of ligating 2’,3’-cyclic phosphates (generated by RNase L cleavage) to 5’OH RNAs, is used to ligate all such ends in the total cellular RNA pool to an RNA-DNA adapter with a 5’OH group. The ligated RNA is then reverse-transcribed and the cDNA is analyzed by qPCR. By using forward primers complementary to specific individual cleavage sites in known RNase L targets, measurement of the cleavage at each such site is achieved, serving as a quantitation of RNase L activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). In order to serve as an internal control, U6 RNA, which has a naturally occurring cyclic 2’3’ phosphate, was also analyzed and used for normalization. We prepared and purified recombinant RtcB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007609.s007">S7 Fig</xref>) and then performed a ligation-PCR assay to measure the effect of OAS downregulation on RNase L activity. The RtcB analysis demonstrated that upon IFIT KD, RNase L cleavage decreased significantly at site 36 in tRNA-His, site 27 in non-protein-coding RNA RNY4 and site 30 in non-protein-coding RNA RNY5. The differences between RNase L directed cleavage in the presence and absence of IFITs were statistically significant as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g006">Fig 6B–6D</xref>. Consistent with lower cleavage activity of RNase L, total RNA yield increased significantly upon IFITs KD compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Thus, IFITs may inhibit KSHV replication through the OAS-RNase L pathway.</p>

<title>IFIT1 and IFIT3 bind KSHV mRNAs</title>
<p>IFIT1 has been shown to preferentially recognize certain types of capped RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref041">41</xref>]. Recently published data indicate that IFIT3 stabilizes IFIT1 and increases its affinity for cap0 mRNAs (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g007">Fig 7</xref> for a diagram of the various types of RNA 5’ caps) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref043">43</xref>]. However, IFIT1 is also capable of binding cap1 mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g007">Fig 7</xref>), albeit at lower affinities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref041">41</xref>]. It was therefore possible that IFIT1 might recognize and inhibit translation or stability of KSHV mRNAs directly in addition to indirect effects mediated via other ISGs as shown with OASs. We performed immunoprecipitation experiments to determine if IFIT1 bound viral mRNA specifically or preferentially. iSLK cells were treated with doxycycline to induce KSHV replication, lysates were harvested at 48 hr post induction and immunoprecipitated with IFIT1 and IFIT3 antibodies. Immunoprecipitated RNAs were isolated and measured by qPCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g008">Fig 8A</xref>, viral RNAs were enriched 5~11-fold in the immunoprecipitation using IFIT1 and IFIT3 antibodies compared to control IPs. The cellular GAPDH mRNA was enriched 4.8-fold. It should be noted that the degree of binding of individual RNAs to IFITs was not related to their overall abundance. For example, ORF6, which was present at 330 FKPM was enriched similarly to K4, which was highly abundant at 50,000 FKPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Uncapped MT-ADP6 RNA, a cellular mitochondrial transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref044">44</xref>], as well as uncapped snoRNAs U15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref045">45</xref>] and U16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref047">47</xref>] were enriched only 1.7-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). U6 RNA, which has a gamma-monomethyl phosphate cap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref048">48</xref>], was enriched in only 2.2-fold in the immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). U1, U2 and U5 have a trimethylation cap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref049">49</xref>], and they were similarly enriched less than 1.8-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). All these snoRNA are expressed at more than 10,000 copies per cell which is a much higher abundance compared to cellular genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref051">51</xref>]. Therefore, IFIT1 and IFIT3, while preferentially recognizing cap0 structures, are also capable of binding to both viral and cellular capped mRNA (cap1 or cap2). However, their ability to bind uncapped, monomethyl capped, or trimethyl capped RNAs appears to be extremely limited.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we examined the effects of cellular IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 on KSHV lytic replication. Heretofore, IFIT proteins have been primarily implicated in antiviral responses against RNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref019">19</xref>]. IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 form multimeric complexes that initially were shown to bind 5’ tri-phosphate RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref025">25</xref>]. Such RNAs are produced by several negative strand RNA viruses such as Rift Valley virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus against which IFITs exhibit antiviral activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref019">19</xref>]. However, IFITs were subsequently shown to also preferentially bind cap0 mRNAs which lack 2’O-methylation at the first and second transcribed ribonucleotides (as seen in cap1 and cap2 mRNAs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007609.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Many viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, including flaviviridae, poxviridae and coronaviridae, have evolved enzymes to independently perform 2’O-methylation of their mRNAs. Mutants of these viruses that have lost 2’O methyltransferase activity exhibit increased susceptibility to IFIT dependent immune responses, suggesting that IFITs allow discrimination between self and non-self RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref052">52</xref>]. Although IFIT induction by RNA viruses is common, herpesviruses may also induce IFIT gene expression, by direct or indirect mechanisms. Indeed, IFIT2 and IFIT3 were identified as hCMV induced genes (cigs) over twenty years ago by the use of differential display [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref027">27</xref>]. HSV infection also leads to IFIT induction, albeit less strongly than CMV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref027">27</xref>]. It was therefore of interest to determine whether a gammaherpesvirus such as KSHV could induce IFIT gene expression. KSHV, similar to other herpesviruses which undergo lytic replication in the nucleus, are presumed to have cap structures similar if not identical to host mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref024">24</xref>]. Nevertheless, IFIT1 has also been shown to exert inhibitory effects on translation independent of mRNA sequestration by interacting directly with eIF3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref018">18</xref>], also raising the question of whether IFITs could establish an antiviral state that would inhibit KSHV virion production.</p>
<p>We first established that KSHV reactivation and lytic replication results in IFIT induction. While all three IFIT mRNAs were measurably induced upon KSHV lytic replication, we were only able to detect increased expression of IFT1 and IFIT3 proteins. While the IFIT2 antibodies we employed were able to detect exogenously overexpressed IFIT2, we did not detect IFIT2 protein expression by either immunoblotting or immunofluorescence microscopy. This may be due to minimal IFIT2 protein induction as a consequence of KSHV replication but our finding that IFIT2 depletion enhanced KSHV production suggests that functional IFIT2 is present and the failure to detect IFIT2 protein is likely due to inadequately sensitive IFIT2 antibodies. Nevertheless, it is clear that although KSHV lytic reactivation occurs from the nucleus, PAMP exposure sufficient to engage PRRs and induce ISG expression occurs. Future studies to examine the nature of the non-self signatures, whether DNA, RNA or protein, that evoke the innate immune response to reactivating herpesviruses, and whether the PRRs that recognize them are nuclear and/or cytoplasmic, will be very informative. Both IFIT1 and IFIT3 proteins that we detected by IF studies were localized to the cytoplasm in KSHV infected cells. Although virtually all studies have focused on the interaction of IFITs with cytoplasmic RNAs, it has been suggested that IFIT1 may also have transcriptional activating functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref053">53</xref>].</p>
<p>We examined the potential role of IFITs as KSHV inhibitory proteins by knocking down IFITs and then inducing KSHV lytic replication. As expected, IFIT expression was minimal in the absence of KSHV replication, and expression of IFITs was also severely curtailed after siRNA treatment. Blocking IFIT production resulted in a 25–30 fold increase in infectious KSHV virion production. Consistent with these findings, IFIT KD also led to increased lytic KSHV mRNA accumulation. Importantly, the increase in mRNA abundance, while not completely equal amongst all KSHV mRNA, was nevertheless broad, with over 65% of lytic mRNAs increasing in abundance. However, these findings pose a difficulty in interpretation due to the fact that herpesvirus late gene transcription, including that of KSHV, is dependent on DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref054">54</xref>]. Since the most highly IFIT restricted KSHV mRNAs encode proteins that are either essential or important for KSHV lytic DNA replication, the broad inhibitory effect on KSHV mRNAs may be partly indirect, with late gene repression by IFITs due to the inhibitory effect of IFITs on viral DNA replication. We confirmed that IFITs do have an inhibitory effect on DNA replication by directly measuring KSHV DNA abundance in the presence and absence of IFITs.</p>
<p>KSHV is thought to most likely enter the human host by oral epithelial cell infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref055">55</xref>] and has been demonstrated to infect a variety of human epithelial cells including oral keratinocytes as well as epithelial cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref057">57</xref>]. These experiments were carried out in the iSLK/Bac16 cell line, an epithelial cell line that supports efficient KSHV lytic replication and has served as a model for KSHV infection and reactivation from latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref058">58</xref>]. We also examined the potential role of IFITs in KSHV reactivation from latent infection in a PEL cell line, BCBL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref059">59</xref>]. However, cells from BCBL1 did not express detectable IFITs and it was therefore not possible to determine whether IFITs may play a role in restricting KSHV replication in B lymphocytes. As loss of ISG expression is not uncommon in many human tumors, these findings do not rule out the possibility of IFITs playing a physiological role in regulating KSHV replication in B lymphocytes in vivo.</p>
<p>These data also raised the possibility that IFITs exerted at least some of their antiviral function by other indirect mechanisms that did not depend on specific targeting of KSHV mRNAs, especially since there are no known differences in cap structures between herpesvirus mRNAs and host cellular mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref024">24</xref>]. Our analysis of the cellular transcriptome suggested an effect of IFITs on the type I interferon pathway, as several ISGs, including several known to be important for establishing an antiviral state, decreased upon IFIT KD in comparison to infected cells in which IFITs were not depleted. These findings do not differentiate between transcriptional or post-transcriptional effects of IFITs in enhancing ISG expression. However, the fact that interferon mRNA levels were decreased in the absence of IFITs suggests that the simplest model for a positive feedback loop maintained by IFITs might be an effect on type I IFN transcription or RNA stability. A recent report implicated IFIT1 in nuclear regulation of transcription, both acting to negatively regulate the inflammatory response as well as enhancing IFN β1 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref053">53</xref>]. The IFN β 1 response to pathogens was also blunted in IFIT1-depleted cells in this study. Our data support a model in which IFITs maintain an antiviral state by promoting enhanced IFN and ISG production.</p>
<p>OAS proteins are established components of the innate immune response to viruses. OASs synthesize 2’-5’ oligoadenylates and activate RNase L leading to degradation of viral and cellular RNAs and thereby block viral infections as well as amplification of IFN α/β by RNase L-generated small RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref038">38</xref>]. Because OAS mRNAs were the most highly downregulated upon IFIT KD, we examined whether this correlated with a functional decrease in potential antiviral activity. By using the RtcB-ligase assay, which measures the production of cyclic 3’ phosphate moieties at specific RNase L cleavage sites, we were able to determine that ISG KD does lead to a functional decrease in RNase L activity. The observed decrease in RNase L activity is consistent with the generalized decrease in KSHV lytic mRNA abundance and in total cellular RNA.</p>
<p>We also examined the ability of IFITs to bind several types of capped RNA. By direct immunoprecipitation of IFIT proteins, we found that cap1/2 host cell mRNAs and KSHV mRNAs were widely represented in IFIT immunoprecipitates. Despite the fact that IFIT complexes were originally isolated by using triphosphate uncapped RNAs as bait, we found very little representation of naturally uncapped RNAs such as certain mitochondrial or snoRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref060">60</xref>] in IFIT immunoprecipitates. Whether interactions of IFITs with cap1/2 mRNAs exert negative effects on their stability or translation or if such interactions could even have positive effects on target mRNA remains to be determined. Although the enhanced affinity of IFIT1 complexes for cap0 mRNAs has been adduced as evidence of a PAMP recognition by IFITs that allows them to distinguish between self and non-self, the fact remains that the majority of viral mRNAs are 2’-O-methylated. In addition, some viruses, such as parainfluenza virus, whose mRNAs are 2’-O-methylated, are nevertheless inhibited by IFITs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref061">61</xref>]. Our findings demonstrating that IFITs exert antiviral effects on KSHV, a herpesvirus, which has neither genomic RNAs nor atypically capped mRNAs, provide further evidence that IFITs may have antiviral effects beyond direct sequestration of mRNA. Although IFIT complexes do not appear to be highly enriched for specific transcripts, we cannot rule out the possibility that sequestration by IFITs may have varying effects on different targets, affording a degree of specificity. Variation in the effects of IFIT binding to different targets could arise from intrinsic differences in translatability or stability of individual target mRNAs, especially lytic herpes virus transcripts, which are primarily intronless [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref062">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref063">63</xref>].</p>
<p>In summary we have shown that IFITs exert an antiviral effect on a herpesvirus which does not express any of the putative pathogen associated RNA signatures expressed by RNA viruses. In addition, in infected cells, IFITs do associate with canonically capped viral and cellular mRNAs that are not known to be possess cap0 structures. Further, IFIT depletion led to decreases in IFNβ as well as several other antiviral effectors of the interferon pathway, suggesting that IFITs may possess broad antiviral effects by virtue of their ability to amplify the interferon response. Finally, by virtue of the IFITs ability to interact with canonically capped cellular and viral transcripts, they may also affect both host cell and viral gene expression by direct effects on mRNA.</p>

<title>High-throughput deep sequencing of RNA and Bioinformatic analysis</title>
<p>High-throughput deep sequencing of RNA was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref029">29</xref>] with some modifications. Briefly, iSLK cells were transfected with a mixture of 10 nM final concentration of each IFIT siRNA or negative control siRNA (30nM final concentration) and were treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline after 6 hrs. Cells were harvested at 48 hr post induction for RNA isolation. RNA samples from iSLK cells were prepared using Qiagen miRNeasy kits according to the manufacturer’s protocols. cDNA libraries were prepared from poly(A) RNA and were sequenced on a HiSeq2000 instrument with 50 cycle single end reads. Sequenced reads obtained from Bac16 KSHV-infected iSLK cells were aligned to the KSHV Bac16 (GenBank accession no. GQ994935.1) and Hg19. Differential gene expression was measured using USeq’s Defined Region Differential Seq application as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref029">29</xref>].</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title>
<p>iSLK cells were grown on glass coverslips plated at 120,000 cells per well in six-well dishes and treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline to induce virus lytic replication. Cells were fixed at 48hr, 72hr and 96hr post induction, washed with 1x PBS, fixed and permeabilized with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15–20 minutes at room temperature, and then washed two times with 1x PBS followed by incubation with blocking buffer (20% goat serum in PBS) for 30 mins at room temperature. Cells were incubated with anti-IFIT3 polyclonal antibody (Thermo Science) or anti-IFIT1 polyclonal antibody (Thermo Science) at a dilution of 1:500, at 37°C for 1 hour. The slides were washed three times with 1x PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (A11072, Invitrogen) for 1 hour at 37°C (in the dark). Nuclear staining was performed with 4',6- diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen). Images were collected and analyzed with a Zeiss Imager M2 microscope system. To determine cells staining positive for IFIT3, more than 6 fields in which each field included more than 2000 cells (totally at least 12000 cells) were counted with a 20x objective. Statistical testing for comparison of proportions and p values was performed using MedCalc software, which uses the "N-1" Chi-squared test (MedCalc software, Ostend Belgium)</p>

<title>Induction of lytic gene expression, virus replication and quantification of infectious virus release and virus replication</title>
<p>To induce KSHV lytic gene expression or virus replication, iSLK cells were treated with 1 μg/ml doxycycline. Where KD of IFITs was performed, siRNA transfections were performed 6 hours prior to induction. Cells were harvested at 48 hr post induction for RNA preparation. At 48 hrs post-induction, cell viability was greater than 94% by vital dye staining. For virus production, supernatants of the cells were harvested 5 days post induction, cleared by centrifugation twice, and filtered through a 0.80 μm pore size cellulose acetate filter. Serial dilutions of supernatants were used to infect 293T cells. 48 hours after infection, flow cytometry was performed to measure the number of GFP positive cells, each representing a cell infected by a GFP expressing KSHV virion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref029">29</xref>]. Each infection was done in triplicate and each infected cell sample was assayed by flow cytometry in technical triplicates. Based on the dilution factor, infectious virus titers in the iSLK cell supernatant were calculated. Pellets of the cells from which supernatant was harvested were processed for DNA isolation using Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit. 50 ng of each DNA were used for qPCR using primers specific for ORF59 (see above) and SYBR green PCR MasterMix (ABI).</p>

<title>RtcB enzyme preparation</title>
<p>RtcB expression plasmid (kind gift from Dr. Alexei V. Korennykh), contains the RtcB gene from E. coli cloned into pGEX-6P and expressed with an N-terminal GST-tag. Protein isolation and purification were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref040">40</xref>] with some modifications. Briefly, E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3) carrying the RtcB expression plasmid was grown at 37°C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin until the A600 reached 0.6 to 0.7. The culture was chilled down to 20°C and protein expression was induced by IPTG (0.25mM final concentration). Incubation was continued at 20°C for 16 hr with constant shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80°C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4°C. The cell pellet was suspended in 50 ml buffer A (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) with proteinase inhibitor (0.3μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5μg/ml leupeptin and 0.7μg/ml pepstatin A), 10μg/ml DNase and 10μg/ml lysozyme. After mixing for 30 min, cells were sonicated and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The clarified lysate was added to a column with 10ml glutathione resin washed with buffer A. The column was rotated for 1h at 4°C to bind GST-RtcB to the resin. Washing was performed with buffer A and the resin was resuspended in low salt buffer A (100mM NaCl without Triton X-100). PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) was added and the column was gently rotated overnight at 4°C. The cleaved RtcB was then eluted from the column in 10ml buffer A. Ion exchange (MonoQ) purification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007609.s007">S7 Fig</xref>) followed by S200 gel filtration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007609.s007">S7 Fig</xref>) was performed with unsalted buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5), high salt buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1M NaCl) and buffer B (buffer A without 1% Triton X-100). Purified RtcB was eluted and diluted to 100μM in buffer B with 0.5% Triton X-100, aliquoted and stored at -80°C.</p>

<title>RNase L activity assay by RtcB-ligase assisted qPCR</title>
<p>We measured several specific cleavage sites generated by RNase L to analyze its activity as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007609.ref040">40</xref>]. Briefly, RtcB ligase and RtcB ligation adaptor (5’-OH-<underline>GAUCGU</underline>CGGACTGTAGAACTCTGAAC-3’) were added to cellular RNA (500ng) to ligate 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate containing RNAs to the adapter. The underlined bases in the ligation primer were RNA and the remainder were DNA. EDTA-quenched ligation reaction (1μL) was used as a template for reverse transcription with Multiscribe reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher) and RT primer (5′-TCCCTATCAGTGATAGAGAGTTCA GAGTTCTACAGTCCG-3′). SYBR-green based qPCR was conducted using a universal rev qPCR primer (5’-TCCCTATCAGTGATAGAGAG-3’) and cleavage site-specific forward primers designed for each RNA target: tRNA His-36 (5’-GTTAGTACTCTGCGTTGTGGA-3’), RNY4-27 (5’-GATGGTAGTGGGTTATCAGAT-3’) and RNY5-30 (5’-GTGTTGTGGGTTATTGTTAGA-3’). U6, which has a naturally occurring 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate and an RNase L independent cleavage site, was used as endogenous control. Primers for the U6 site were U6 Q1F: 5’-GCTTCGGCAGCACATATACTA-3’ and U6 Q1R: 5’-CGAATTTGCGTGTCATCCTTG-3’, qPCR was carried out for 60 cycles using 62°C annealing/extension for 1 min.</p>
