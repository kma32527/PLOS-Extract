<abstract>
<p>The biotrophic fungal pathogen <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> causes the powdery mildew disease of cereals and grasses. We present the first crystal structure of a <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> effector of pathogenicity (CSEP0064/BEC1054), demonstrating it has a ribonuclease (RNase)-like fold. This effector is part of a group of RNase-like proteins (termed RALPHs) which comprise the largest set of secreted effector candidates within the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> genomes. Their exceptional abundance suggests they play crucial functions during pathogenesis. We show that transgenic expression of RALPH CSEP0064/BEC1054 increases susceptibility to infection in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. CSEP0064/BEC1054 interacts <italic>in planta</italic> with the pathogenesis-related protein PR10. The effector protein associates with total RNA and weakly with DNA. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) levels modulate susceptibility to aniline-induced host RNA fragmentation. <italic>In planta</italic> expression of CSEP0064/BEC1054 reduces the formation of this RNA fragment. We propose CSEP0064/BEC1054 is a pseudoenzyme that binds to host ribosomes, thereby inhibiting the action of plant ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) that would otherwise lead to host cell death, an unviable interaction and demise of the fungus.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Powdery mildews are common plant diseases which affect important crop plants including cereals such as wheat and barley. The fungi that cause this disease are obligate biotrophs: they have an absolute requirement for living host cells which they penetrate with feeding structures called haustoria. These fungi must be highly effective at avoiding immune recognition which would lead to death of the host cell and the pathogen. We assume they do this by delivering effector proteins to the host. While several hundred secreted effectors have been described in cereal powdery mildews, it is unknown how they work. Here, we use X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structure and interactions of the effector CSEP0064/BEC1054, representative of the largest class of effectors resembling fungal RNases. We find that this effector binds nucleic acids. Expression of the effector in plants increases susceptibility to infection. Moreover, transgenic CSEP0064/BEC1054 expression in wheat inhibits the degradation of host ribosomal RNA induced by ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs). We propose a novel mechanism of action for the RNase-like effectors in powdery mildews: they may act as pseudoenzymes to inhibit the host RIPs, known components of plant immune responses that lead to host cell death.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The obligate biotrophic fungus <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> causes powdery mildew disease on some small grain cereals and grasses (Poaceae). A high degree of host specificity is displayed by the fungus, with at least eight <italic>formae speciales</italic> (f.sp.), each infecting a different host genus. <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>hordei</italic> and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>tritici</italic> colonise barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> L.) and wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.), respectively, and they can result in large crop losses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref001">1</xref>]. In the case of powdery mildews, the only part of the fungus that actually penetrates the plant during infection is the haustorium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref002">2</xref>], a dedicated fungal infection structure thought to absorb plant nutrients. The success of infection is determined by the outcome of a “secretory warfare” between the host and the pathogen, which produces effectors at the haustorial complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Genomes of powdery mildew fungi code for several hundred effector-like proteins: 491 Candidate Secreted Effector Proteins (CSEPs) were initially identified in the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>hordei</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref004">4</xref>], and it has become clear that there are even more in this f.sp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref005">5</xref>], while 844 are currently described in the recently updated <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>tritici</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref006">6</xref>]. These putative effectors have a predicted amino-terminal signal peptide for secretion, lack recognisable transmembrane domains, and have no relevant BLAST hits outside of the powdery mildew family (Erysiphaceae). As for most other pathogen effectors, their mode of action is not yet understood. Previously, two complementary bioinformatic procedures were used to identify CSEPs with predicted RNA-binding or RNase folds: InterProScan combined with Gene Ontology characterisation, and IntFOLD, an integrated structure prediction server. In total, 72 out of the then 491 known <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>hordei</italic> CSEPs were found by these approaches, with 54 predicted by InterProScan and 37 by IntFOLD (19 of which were found by both techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref004">4</xref>]). Proteins occurring within CSEP families with structural similarity to RNase and/or RNA-binding activity were termed RNase Like Proteins expressed in Haustoria (RALPHs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref007">7</xref>]. Some of the RALPH CSEP families contain members for which the RNase domain is not recognised by the current prediction algorithms. If the latter are included, the RALPHs comprise the biggest subset of effector candidates within the <italic>Blumeria graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>hordei</italic> genome, numbering at least 113 of the previously analysed 491 CSEPs. Their abundance, and their proliferation within a genome that otherwise has lost numerous genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref008">8</xref>], suggests that they play a prominent role during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref004">4</xref>]. This notion is further supported by the fact that some RALPH effectors are recognised by dedicated plant immune receptors and thus act as avirulence factors in the plant-powdery mildew interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref009">9</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref010">10</xref>]. The genes encoding RALPHs, and other CSEPs, are often physically closely linked to (retro-)transposable elements, indicating that the duplication of these effectors may have occurred through illegitimate recombination of (retro-)transposon sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref004">4</xref>]. An RNA interference (RNAi)-based screen for functionally important effector genes in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>hordei</italic> identified eight genes whose expression is required for full pathogenic development. These included two genes encoding RALPH effectors: CSEP0064/BEC1054 and CSEP0264/BEC1011, both belonging to family 21 of the predicted CSEPs in this powdery mildew pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>We have previously found four barley proteins that interact with CSEP0064/BEC1054 by <italic>in vitro</italic> affinity assays followed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. These proteins comprise a eukaryotic Elongation Factor 1 gamma (eEF1γ), a Pathogenesis Related Protein 5 (PR5), a Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) and a Malate Dehydrogenase (MDH). The respective protein-protein interactions were confirmed by subsequent yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref012">12</xref>]. Other barley proteins bind to CSEP0064/BEC1054 <italic>in vitro</italic> but do not interact in yeast. These are Pathogenesis Related Protein 10 (PR10), a ribosomal 40S subunit protein 16 (40S 16), and a eukaryotic Elongation Factor 1 alpha (eEF1α) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>The predicted RNase structure of CSEP0064/BEC1054 was originally determined by <italic>in silico</italic> homology modelling. However, the protein, like other RALPHs, is unlikely to be catalytically active, because it lacks the critical active site residues known to be required for RNase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref004">4</xref>]. Plants also possess RNases that are proposed to be implicated in defence against pathogens. Examples are the RIPs, which depurinate the sarcin-ricin loop (SRL) in the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of the large ribosomal subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref013">13</xref>]. In barley, the jasmonate-induced protein of 60 kDa (JIP60) is a RIP involved in mediating host-induced cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we show that heterologous transgenic expression of CSEP0064/BEC1054 in wheat enhances susceptibility to <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>tritici</italic>. Similarly, expression of this protein in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> increases the susceptibility to the oomycete pathogen <italic>Peronospora tabacina</italic>, suggesting that CSEP0064/BEC1054 subverts a defence mechanism/ pathway conserved among monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant species. To provide mechanistic insights into the function of CSEP0064/BEC1054, we solved the structure of the first RALPH by X-ray crystallography, determining unequivocally a high degree of structural similarity with fungal RNases. Furthermore, we confirm that CSEP0064/BEC1054 interacts with ribonucleic acid, and interferes with methyl-jasmonate induced cleavage of RNA in wheat. Together, these findings provide the first evidence for a RALPH-mediated interference with host RNA metabolism. Given the similarity of the predicted structure of <italic>Blumeria</italic> RALPH proteins to RNases and to the core region of fungal RIPs, we hypothesise that RALPHs may stoichiometrically outcompete host RIPs, thereby inhibiting their cell death-promoting activity and thus act as a pseudoenzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref016">16</xref>].</p>

<title>CSEP0064/BEC1054 increases susceptibility to adapted pathogens</title>
<p>We previously assessed the contribution of CSEP0064/BEC1054 to the interaction of barley and its adapted powdery mildew pathogen, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>hordei</italic>, by Host-Induced Gene Silencing (HIGS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref011">11</xref>]). In this native context, CSEP0064/BEC1054 contributes significantly to fungal virulence: when the respective gene is silenced by HIGS, the infection success (haustorial index) drops to less than half of the value obtained with a control construct.</p>
<p>To explore the effect of CSEP0064/BEC1054 on interactions with additional pathogens, we generated transgenic bread wheat (<italic>T</italic>. <italic>aestivum</italic>) lines constitutively expressing a codon-modified version of <italic>CSEP0064/BEC1054</italic> lacking the N-terminal signal peptide for secretion (termed <italic>wBEC1054</italic>), which was also used in our previous HIGS experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref011">11</xref>]. We selected progeny of three homozygous T3 lines, two carrying single expressed copies of the <italic>CSEP0064/BEC1054</italic> transgene (+/+, lines 3.3.7 and 3.3.14) and one null segregant (lacking the transgene), referred to as azygous (-/-, line 3.3.12), which served as a negative control in our study.</p>
<p>We first determined whether expression or potential unintended gene disruption by the transgene affects morphology and/or development of the wheat lines. To this end, we investigated the phenotype of adult T4 plants homozygous for the effector transgene (+/+) or respective azygous controls (-/-) under the same experimental conditions as used for subsequent assays. According to common practice for the phenotypic characterisation of wheat plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref020">20</xref>], eleven characteristics were assayed quantitatively: leaf number, maximum height, peduncle (internode 1) and other internode lengths, ear length, subcrown length, fertile tiller number, tiller mass and grain number. The respective values for these parameters from the azygous individuals and the transgenics were indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007620.s001">S1 Fig</xref>); that is, the presence of transgenic <italic>CSEP0064/BEC1054</italic> does not affect the adult phenotype of wheat, in our experimental conditions.</p>
<p>We next measured the effect of the <italic>CSEP0064/BEC1054</italic> transgene on the susceptibility of the wheat lines to its adapted powdery mildew pathogen, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>tritici</italic>. Microcolonies with epiphytic hyphae formed can be used as a proxy for the presence of functional haustoria. This parameter can be expressed as the proportion of microcolonies relative to the number of germinated conidia (propH; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). We determined the propH value at the base, the middle and the tip of both young and mature leaves of T4 individuals of the transgenic lines (+/+) and the azygous plants (-/-). The median propH was consistently higher in a statistically significant manner in leaf blades of plants derived from the transgenic lines (+/+) as compared to the controls (-/-), irrespective of the position within the leaf (base, middle, tip) or the age of the leaf (young, mature; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007620.s007">S1 Table</xref>).

<p>To test the contribution of CSEP0064/BEC1054 to a plant-microbe interaction with a dicotyledonous host species and an adapted pathogen different from powdery mildew, we opted for transient expression of <italic>CSEP0064/BEC1054</italic> in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> and subsequent challenge with the oomycete pathogen <italic>Peronospora tabacina</italic>, the causal agent of the tobacco downy mildew disease. <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>-mediated transformation was used to transiently express either Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-tagged CSEP0064/BEC1054 (C terminal tag), or GFP alone as a control, in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> (in each case co-expressed with RFP as a transformation marker).

<title>CSEP0064/BEC1054 interacts with PR10 <italic>in planta</italic></title>
<p>In order to test physical <italic>in planta</italic> interactions between CSEP0064/BEC1054 and several host proteins previously identified by protein <italic>in vitro</italic> affinity-LCMS experiments and targeted Y2H assays (PR5, PR10, eEF1α, eEF1γ, ribosomal protein 40S 16, MDH and GST; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref012">12</xref>]), we performed BiFC experiments with the fungal effector and the respective candidate targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref021">21</xref>]. We excluded PR5 from this analysis since PR5 is known to represent a secreted protein with extracellular localisation, but included in addition a barley nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDPK) that was used as a negative control in previous Y2H assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref012">12</xref>]. Apart from CSEP0064/BEC1054 we added a closely related CSEP (CSEP264/BEC1011, CSEP family 21, 45% amino acid identity to CSEP0064/BEC1054) and a more distantly related CSEP (CSEP0102, CSEP family 20, 17% amino acid identity to CSEP0064/BEC1054) as bait proteins to these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

<p>A) Multiple amino acid sequence alignment of CSEP0064/BEC1054, CSEP0264/BEC1011 and CSEP0102. The alignment was generated by CLUSTALW using the mature polypeptides (i.e., the predicted N-terminal signal peptides removed). Amino acids that are identical between all three proteins are highlighted in black, amino acids shared by two of the three proteins are shown in gray. B) The host plant, barley, was used to perform a BiFC assay via particle bombardment-mediated transient gene expression in single leaf epidermal cells. As bait proteins, CSEP0064/BEC1054, CSEP0264/BEC1011 and CSEP0102 were used. The barley prey proteins were: Pathogenesis-Related protein 10 (PR10), eukaryotic Elongation Factor 1 Gamma (eEF1γ), eukaryotic Elongation Factor 1 Alpha (eEF1α) isoforms 1 and 3, malate dehydrogenase (MDH), Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK; negative control). BiFC signals were scored semiquantitatively by assigning transformed (DsRED-expressing) cells manually to one of four categories based on YFP fluorescence intensity. Center lines of box plots show the medians of the scores; box limits indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles as determined by R software; whiskers extend 1.5 times the interquartile range from the 25th and 75th percentiles; outliers are represented by dots; crosses designate the arithmetic mean of the scores; and numbers of inspected cells are given below the boxes.

<p>We first analysed the <italic>in planta</italic> subcellular localisation of all putative interaction partners (three CSEP bait and eight barley prey proteins). The bait and prey proteins were translationally fused at the C-terminus with monomeric yellow fluorescent protein (mYFP) and transiently co-expressed with the red-fluorescent protein DsRED (as a transformation marker) in barley leaf epidermal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref022">22</xref>]. Expression and subcellular localisation were determined via confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007620.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). In the case of all CSEPs, there was a weak and diffuse fluorescence signal in the cytoplasm and the nucleus; in addition, occasionally a punctate distribution of these proteins was observed in the cytoplasm. The PR10-mYFP fusion was distributed fairly homogeneously throughout the cytoplasm, with brighter fluorescence evident in the nucleus. The GST-mYFP fusion protein yielded a very diffuse and faint signal in the cytoplasm and nucleus, with bright puncta in the cytoplasm, and a bright signal in a section of the nucleus. Fluorescence of three elongation factor fusions (eEF1γ-mYFP, eEF1α(1)-mYFP and eEF1α(3)-mYFP) was detectable in the cytoplasm, and for eEF1α(1)-mYFP and eEF1α(3)-mYFP (two paralogs of eEF1α we cloned from barley) fluorescence was also observable in the nucleus. The 40S 16-mYFP fusion protein yielded a very diffuse and faint signal in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, with bright puncta in the cytoplasm, and a bright signal in the nucleus. The NDPK- and MDH-mYFP fusions were both observed in the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007620.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Taken together, all bait and prey fusion proteins yielded detectable <italic>in planta</italic> mYFP fluorescence and were present in the cytoplasm and in part in the nucleus, allowing for potential interaction in these cellular compartments.</p>
<p>BiFC analysis was performed in barley leaf epidermal cells by co-expression of the three CSEP proteins (CSEP0064/BEC1054, CSEP0264/BEC1011 and CSEP0102), N-terminally tagged with the C-terminal half of mYFP, the barley prey proteins C-terminally tagged with the N-terminal domain of mYFP, and DsRED (as a transformation marker). We semiquantitatively assessed BiFC-mediated YFP fluorescence intensity based on 9–45 inspected cells per tested bait-prey combination and four distinct phenotypic categories (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec016">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). Overall, we noticed some cell-to-cell variation of the BiFC signal, consistent with the known propensity of the BiFC assay to stabilise weak protein-protein associations depending on experimental conditions and expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref023">23</xref>]. Nonetheless, for CSEP0064/BEC1054, a high number of cells with a clear YFP signal was found upon co-expression with PR10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). This situation differed from the six other tested barley candidate proteins and the NDPK negative control, for which only occasionally fluorescent cells, typically with lower fluorescence intensity, were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). For CSEP0264/BEC1011, which is closely related to CSEP0064/BEC1054 (45% amino acid identity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), we likewise scored a positive interaction with PR10. In addition, the CSEP0264/eEF1α(3) combination yielded a high number of fluorescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). By contrast, all tested interactions of barley prey proteins with CSEP0102, which is more distantly related to CSEP0064/BEC1054 (17% amino acid identity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), failed to show a consistent BiFC signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In case of the positive bait-prey pairings, YFP fluorescence was observed in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. This pattern largely matched the subcellular localisation of the CSEP bait proteins expressed alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007620.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>CSEP0064/BEC1054 shows structural similarity to T1 RNases</title>
<p>To provide detailed insights into the molecular architecture of RALPH effectors, we determined the structure of CSEP0064/BEC1054 by X-ray crystallography. An initial model obtained from a dataset phased by iodide-SAD (single-wavelength anomalous diffraction) was subsequently used to calculate phases for a native dataset at 1.3 Å via molecular replacement.

<p>Analysis using the Dali server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref024">24</xref>] confirmed that CSEP0064/BEC1054 is a close structural homologue of T1 RNases, a family of enzymes with high degree of specificity for cleavage of substrates at the 3’ end of guanosyl residues. The crystal structure reveals a canonical (α+β) fold comprising a core four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet packed against an α-helix, and a second shorter peripheral anti-parallel β-sheet formed from the N-terminal hairpin and C-terminal strand β7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).

<p>In T1 RNases, a catalytic triad is located inside a concave face formed by the main β-sheet and loops β3-β4/β6-β7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref027">27</xref>]. Notably, this triad is absent in CSEP0064/BEC1054 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g003">Fig 3B</xref>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref004">4</xref>]), but several other features in the protein suggest a role in nucleic acid binding. Structural superposition of CSEP0064/BEC1054 with <italic>F</italic>. <italic>moniliforme</italic> F1 RNase (1FUS), indicates that contacts made by the RNase with the phosphate and ribose moieties of 2’ guanosine monophosphate (2’GMP) are conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Residues Y34 and Q52 in CSEP0064/BEC1054 overlay with residues Y38 and E58 from the F1 RNase that form contacts with the phosphate moiety of 2’GMP. Additionally, catalytic residue R77 is replaced by Y70 in CSEP0064/BEC1054, a residue that may form polar contacts with the phosphate.</p>
<p>Differences in the conformation of loops β3-β4 and β6-β7 account for the main variations in the active site architectures between CSEP0064/BEC1054 and other T1 RNases. In the crystal structures of T1 RNases, these loops form an occluded binding cleft for the substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref029">29</xref>]. In the crystallized conformation of CSEP0064/BEC1054, these loops do not fold over, leaving the main β-sheet with a larger exposed hydrophobic surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Relative to the T1 RNases, CSEP0064/BEC1054 has a more compact β3-β4 loop, as it is two residues shorter and contains a single-turn 3–10 α-helix. In this loop, Y42 and Y45 of the F1 RNase are involved in π stacking interactions with the guanosine base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref028">28</xref>]. Reconstruction of a comparable active site geometry would require displacement of F38 and F44 in the loop upon the concave surface of CSEP0064/BEC1054 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Additionally, residues N43 and N44 in F1 RNase establish hydrogen bonds with guanosine base substrates via backbone atoms; a conformational change has been observed for these residues between ligand-free and 2’GMP-bound forms of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref028">28</xref>]. For a comparable interaction, a movement in the same loop would be required to bring the backbone atoms of residues I39 and I40 in CSEP0064/BEC1054 within hydrogen bonding distance of the guanosine base.</p>
<p>Charged amino acid residues are clearly segregated on the protein surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Most of the negatively charged side chains cluster in the vicinity of a small β-sheet: strands β1, β2 and β7 (residues D5, D7, E10, E13, E56, D57, D59, E81 and E98), whereas the majority of positively charged residues localises to the periphery of the concave surface (R27, K28, K68 and K91, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). In T1 RNases, these positions flank the RNA binding site, and it is thus feasible that these residues in CSEP0064/BEC1054 interact with the phosphate backbone of nucleic acids. Intriguingly, the structures of RNases T1 from <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic> (9RNT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref027">27</xref>] and F1 from <italic>F</italic>. <italic>moniliforme</italic> (1FUS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref028">28</xref>] do not display the same segregation of positive and negative charges on the protein surface.</p>
<p>The concave surface of CSEP0064/BEC1054 is lined with aromatic residues (Y34, F38, F44, Y70, Y79 and F83) that could be involved in base-stacking interactions with nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Alternatively, these residues could contain a binding site for host proteins, resembling the conserved hydrophobic patches of effectors AVR1-CO39 and AVR-Pia from the rice blast fungus <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref030">30</xref>].</p>

<title>CSEP0064/BEC1054 interacts with RNA <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>Due to the structural similarity between CSEP0064/BEC1054 and other fungal RNA-binding proteins, we tested potential association of the protein with RNA. Firstly, CSEP0064/BEC1054 was labelled with the fluorophore NT-927 and titrated against increasing concentrations of total RNA extracted from barley up to a final concentration of 10 μg/μl in microscale thermophoresis (MST) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g004">Fig 4</xref>). An interaction with total RNA was observed, and whilst the complex nature of the substrate precludes accurate calculation of a K<sub>D</sub>, we estimate this to be in the low micromolar range based on an averaged molecular weight for the most abundant RNA species (rRNA) within a pool of extracted total RNA.</p>

<p>To further probe interactions with specific rRNA sequences, the protein was titrated with an RNA oligonucleotide corresponding to specific 32 bp sequence derived from the SRL of the barley 28S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Affinity for this substrate was over two orders of magnitude weaker than for barley total RNA and the interaction could not be saturated with up to 1 mM ligand using MST, preventing a precise estimation of a K<sub>D</sub>. Isotherms suggest that the interaction affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) is likely to be in the high μM-low mM range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g004">Fig 4</xref>), suggesting that this rRNA region may not be the biologically relevant ligand for CSEP0064/BEC1054. However, no binding was observed to an RNA oligonucleotide with the sequence of the bacteriophage T7 promoter (a non-rRNA control) under the same conditions, suggesting that CSEP0064/BEC1054 exhibits some binding specificity to ribosomal ribonucleic acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g004">Fig 4</xref>). No further evidence for sequence specificity was observed.</p>

<p>CSEP0064/BEC1054 was further structurally characterised in solution via NMR spectroscopy following isotopic <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>13</sup>C labelling of the protein. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007620.s003">S3 Fig</xref> shows the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum for CSEP0064/BEC1054, where each cross peak corresponds to an amide group in the protein.

Using conventional 3D experiments (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec016">Methods</xref>), backbone resonances from 89 out of 94 residues were assigned (i.e. excluding the backbone imines of three prolines). Unassigned residues also display large crystallographic B factors (S42, F44, G46, G64 and S88), indicating that they experience motions that prevent sampling of a defined chemical environment (e.g. at intermediate exchange regime in NMR timescales). These residues map to loop regions on opposite faces of the core β sheet, which suggests that ligand binding by CSEP0064/BEC1054 may involve displacement of these regions towards a structure that resembles the ligand bound conformation of T1 RNases.</p>
<p>To provide further insights into the nature of these interactions and the mechanism of binding, chemical shift perturbation (CSP) analyses using <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC NMR spectra were analysed upon titration of CSEP0064/BEC1054 with the barley SRL RNA sequence. Titration with 8 mole equivalents of this ligand induced discrete chemical shift changes in a subset of resonances. To reach saturation of CSEP0064/BEC1054, the titration was repeated with a single-stranded SRL DNA oligonucleotide predicted to have the same fold as the RNA SRL oligonucleotide (it was not possible to obtain enough single-stranded RNA, for this purpose). This induced small CSPs for the same residues observed in the RNA SRL titration, which showed saturation at ~50 molar equivalents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The continuous shift in the position of resonances upon titration indicated that binding was weak, with a K<sub>D</sub> above 10 μM (i.e. in fast chemical exchange in NMR timescales), thus correlating with the results obtained from MST. In these experiments, solution conditions were carefully controlled after each titration to ensure that the observed CSPs were not an artefact from pH changes.</p>

<title>CSEP0064/BEC1054 inhibits MeJA-dependent degradation of host rRNA</title>
<p>JIP60 is a RIP ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref032">32</xref>]) whose transcript and protein accumulates in response to treatment with MeJA, a stress-related phytohormone in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref013">13</xref>].

We incubated primary leaves of the transgenic wheat plants constitutively expressing CSEP0064/BEC1054 with MeJA, extracted total RNA, and treated it with aniline. We then analysed the respective RNA fragments by separation in a microchannel-based electrophoretic cell. In the RNA samples obtained from leaves of azygous wheat (negative controls), the aniline treatment resulted in the appearance of a small peak that migrated at an apparent size of about 1,200 bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g006">Fig 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007620.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). In the RNA profiles from CSEP0064/BEC1054 transgenic leaves processed in the same way, the area of this peak was reduced.

In the controls with no MeJA induction, the area of the peak was very small or not detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). In sum, these data suggest that MeJa treatment triggers fragmentation of rRNA, which is indicated by the occurrence of a presumptive degradation product.

<p>We then measured these effects quantitatively. The area of the peak representing the presumptive rRNA degradation product was determined, relative to the area of the small (18S) and large (28S) rRNAs. The abundance of the newly occurring RNA species was estimated to be up to about 10% of the 28S rRNA peak, depending on the experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). The average areas of the peak corresponding to the putative degradation product in RNA from uninfected plants homozygous for the CSEP0064/BEC1054 transgene (line 3.3.14) was lower than in the azygous controls (line 3.3.12), but this difference is not statistically significant. In azygous plants, powdery mildew infection further decreased the formation of the degradation peak, almost completely abolishing it. The infection status had a statistically significant effect on the mean area of the presumptive degradation peak: overall, powdery mildew infection prevented the formation of the peak. The marked decrease in the degradation peak area also occurred in another transgenic line (line 3.3.7; S7 Fig). The statistical analysis of the effect of the transgene showed that the peak area was intermediate between that of the azygous infected and non-infected leaves, and was not significantly different from either. Therefore expression of CSEP0064/BEC1054 was not sufficient to inhibit the action of the MeJA-induced RNA degradation, to the extent seen in infected plants.</p>

<title><italic>In planta</italic> expression of CSEP0064/BEC1054 enhances susceptibility to diverse pathogens</title>
<p>CSEP0064/BEC1054 is a barley powdery mildew candidate effector protein that is highly expressed at early stages of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref034">34</xref>]. Full expression of the gene is necessary for virulence of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>hordei</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref011">11</xref>]. Here we investigated further the molecular and structural basis for function of this presumptive pathogen effector.</p>
<p>First, we measured the proportion of germinating conidia that lead to the formation of functional haustoria (propH) as deduced by the development of fungal microcolonies on the surfaces of infected leaves on transgenic wheat expressing CSEP0064/BEC1054. PropH was significantly higher in leaves from plants that are homozygous for the transgene, compared to the azygous controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). We noted differences in the outcome along the leaf blade: the effect of the transgene was more marked at the base of the leaf blades, intermediate in the middle sections and all but disappeared at the apical sections. This is not altogether surprising as leaf maturation in monocots displays a basipetal pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref036">36</xref>], and gene expression also occurs in a longitudinally non-uniform manner for leaves of species belonging to the Poaceae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref039">39</xref>]. The slope in propH could be related to the basipetal gradients observed for immune-related transcripts. Genes encoding transcriptional regulators, such as WRKY factors, display differential expression along leaf blades, with two rice genes coding for WRKY proteins being expressed most highly at the leaf tip, and 13 most highly at the leaf base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref039">39</xref>]. Several WRKYs play central roles in modulating disease resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref040">40</xref>]. Therefore, a gradient in WRKYs and other proteins that control disease resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref039">39</xref>] could explain the differences along the leaf blades in the effectiveness of CSEP0064/BEC1054 in counteracting host defence we observed in our experiments. Similar patterns of susceptibility were also recently observed in barley leaves infected by <italic>P</italic>. <italic>palmivora</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>In a separate set of experiments, leaves subjected to <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>–mediated transient expression of CSEP0064/BEC1054 with a C-terminal GFP tag in the dicot <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> were subsequently inoculated with the oomycete <italic>P</italic>. <italic>tabacina</italic>. Expression of CSEP0064/BEC1054-GFP led to an increase in the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>tabacina</italic> sporangia formed when compared with a GFP-only control, indicating an increased susceptibility to the oomycete pathogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results point to CSEP0064/BEC1054 affecting plant immunity that limits the infection with pathogens adapted to their specific host. Importantly, the immune pathways targeted by the candidate effector appear to be conserved in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant species, and affect defence against both fungal and oomycete biotrophic pathogens.</p>

<title>Interaction of CSEP0064/BEC1054 with host protein PR10 and RNA</title>
<p>Several host proteins interact with CSEP0064/BEC1054 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref012">12</xref>]. Here, we used BiFC to test whether these host targets associate with CSEP0064/BEC1054 in barley epidermal cells, i.e. in the native cell context of this powdery mildew effector candidate. The fluorescence signal of CSEP0064/BEC1054 tagged with intact mYFP, as control, was diffuse and less intense in comparison to the fluorescence of mYFP-tagged candidate interaction partners (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007620.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Faint signals could be due to poor translation, misfolding and/or rapid turnover of this fusion protein–processes that might be indicative of intolerance of this protein—at least at high levels—in eukaryotic/host cells. This scenario would be consistent with the cell growth interference phenotype previously observed in yeast expressing CSEP0064/BEC1054 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Of the seven tested proteins, only PR10 interacted reproducibly with CSEP0064/BEC1054 in BiFC experiments in barley (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). The fluorescent signal matched the expression and subcellular localisation pattern observed for CSEP0064/BEC1054-mYFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007620.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). While this interactor was originally identified in affinity-LCMS experiments, the Y2H tests for PR10 had given inconclusive evidence of interaction due to up-regulation of the β-galactosidase reporter gene, and inconsistent results from the other reporter systems used. Apart from CSEP0064/BEC1054, also the closely related CSEP0264 gave positive BiFC signals with PR10. This CSEP in addition interacted with eEF1α(3), while all other tested interactions yielded essentially background signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Absence of positive BiFC signals does not necessarily mean that the respective interactions do not occur <italic>in planta</italic>. We only tested one of the four possible BiFC constellations regarding the tagging of the bait and prey proteins with halves of the YFP fluorophore. Further experiments will thus be needed to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the <italic>in planta</italic> host targets of CSEP0064/BEC1054.</p>
<p>The fact that the PR10 host protein is capable of consistently associating with CSEP0064/BEC1054 in independent, orthogonal assays (affinity-LCMS and BiFC) supports the notion that this interaction may reflect the situation in the true powdery mildew (barley–<italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> interaction) context. This idea is further supported by the fact that the closely related CSEP0264, but not the distantly related CSEP0102, also interacts with PR10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). The existence of multiple interactions between single effectors and host proteins is not unprecedented and has been well documented in several instances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref043">43</xref>]. The fact that eEF1α(3), which was originally identified as an interactor of CSEP0064/BEC1054 in <italic>in vitro</italic> and Y2H assays, yielded positive BiFC signals with CSEP0064 but not CSEP0064/BEC1054 may indicate that CSEP0264 is the <italic>bona fide</italic> interactor of this host protein <italic>in planta</italic>. Cross-interaction of eEF1α(3) and CSEP0064/BEC1054 in affinity-LCMS and in yeast could be based on the high sequence similarity of CSEP0064/BEC1054 and CSEP0264 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), which may allow for the association of CSEP0064/BEC1054 with eEF1α(3) in non-native conditions.</p>
<p>The significance of interactions between pathogen effectors and the PR10 protein may be that they are capable of modulating the antimicrobial activity of these defence-related polypeptides. PR10 proteins belong to the family of Bet v 1 (birch pollen allergen) homologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref044">44</xref>]. Interestingly, some PR10 proteins have been reported to have RNase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref045">45</xref>]. An unrelated barley PR protein (PR17c) that is required for defence against <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>hordei</italic> also physically interacts with a <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>hordei</italic> candidate effector protein (CSEP0055; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref046">46</xref>]). These putative effectors may somehow modulate the antifungal activity of the PR proteins. It remains to be seen whether this is indeed the case for the CSEP0064/BEC1054-PR10 interaction.</p>
<p>Our studies also aimed to test whether CSEP0064/BEC1054 binds RNA. Binding isotherms using MST show a clear interaction with total RNA, suggesting that the protein can either bind to RNA unspecifically or that it is capable to recognise a distinct sequence in a well populated species, e.g. an rRNA motif. Experiments using RNA oligonucleotides show that CSEP0064/BEC1054 recognises the SRL of rRNA as a specific ligand, relative to a sequence encoding the bacteriophage T7 promoter, used as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Using <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC NMR spectra, we observed discrete chemical shifts changes upon titration of the SRL RNA oligonucleotide, indicating a weak interaction. This implies that, for a biologically relevant association, the protein may require additional binding elements such as those present in an RNA-protein complex like the intact ribosome, or that a different RNA sequence is recognised <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Structural similarity of CSEP0064/BEC1054 to RNases and RIPs</title>
<p>Structural modelling of CSEPs from the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>hordei</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref004">4</xref>] suggested that RNase-type folds are considerably overrepresented relative to other protein folds. For example, CSEP0064/BEC1054 (from CSEP family 21) was predicted to exhibit a fold characteristic to members of the T1 RNase family. As previously noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref004">4</xref>], <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>hordei</italic> RALPHs lack the canonical catalytic triad of RNases and are thus unlikely to possess RNase activity. Nonetheless, two main structural features indicated that CSEP0064/BEC1054 may be an RNA-binding protein. In fact, (<italic>1</italic>) the distribution of specific positive charges and (<italic>2</italic>) the clustering of aromatic side chains in the concave face of the domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) are similar to that observed on the surfaces of F1 RNases involved in RNA ligand binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref047">47</xref>]. However, it appears that these features would not confer CSEP0064/BEC1054 the same substrate specificity observed in case of these RNases. In particular, this RALPH candidate effector lacks the specific arrangement of backbone and sidechain atoms required for guanosine binding and could instead display a preference for other RNA substrates, or even bind nucleic acids non-specifically, as observed in members of the RNase T2 family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref048">48</xref>].</p>
<p>A defined negatively charged patch on the CSEP0064/BEC1054 surface is evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). This feature contrasts with the widespread occurrence of positively charged patches in RNA-binding proteins, with an average area five times larger than negatively charged ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref049">49</xref>]. In CSEP0064/BEC1054, this region may serve to bind RNA via a counterion, as observed in the interaction of ribosomal protein L11 to rRNA using Mg<sup>2+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref050">50</xref>], or to repel the ligand and electrostatically orient it towards the proposed binding site, as demonstrated for the negatively charged patch of the Gp2 inhibitor of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNA polymerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref051">51</xref>].</p>
<p>Fungal ribotoxins are another class of proteins related to T1 RNases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref052">52</xref>]. Submission of CSEP0064/BEC1054 to the Dali server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref053">53</xref>] identified fungal ribotoxins as structural homologues of this effector candidate. Ribotoxins display elongated loop regions and a stretch of lysine residues (K111-K113) that are critical for interaction with the SRL bulged G motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref055">55</xref>]. Although CSEP0064/BEC1054 does not display comparable loop regions, it may specifically recognise RNA and/or protein features on the host ribosome to protect rRNA from the action of RIPs from the host. Many other plant ribotoxins also lack the triple lysine motif of fungal ribotoxins (including JIP60), and contact the SRL via alternative sequences, namely conserved tyrosine and tryptophan residues that form the “N-glycosidase signature” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref056">56</xref>].</p>
<p>An additional observation is that CSEPs that are predicted to possess an RNase-like fold, also show some conservation of specific amino acid residues within the putative RNA-binding site but not elsewhere (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007620.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). This conservation underscores the potential importance of the role for RALPHs’ RNA-binding for their effector function: effector paralogues may recognise the same host target, and might have diverged under strong evolutionary pressures to escape recognition by surveilling host resistance (R) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Notably, a CSEP with a predicted RNase-like fold (CSEP0372) has been recently recognised as a CSEP with <italic>MLA</italic> avirulence activity (AVR<sub>a13</sub>) in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>hordei</italic>. Perception of CSEP0372 by the cognate barley nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) R protein MLA13 results in isolate-specific resistance. Among 17 fungal isolates examined, this <italic>CSEP</italic> gene was found to be present as five allelic variants of which two confer virulence and three confer avirulence to the fungal pathogen. Another avirulence protein reported in this study (AVR<sub>a1</sub>) shows only weak predicted structural similarity with RNAses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref009">9</xref>]. More recently, four additional CSEPs with different <italic>MLA</italic> avirulence activities were identified in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>hordei</italic> (AVR<sub>a7</sub>, AVR<sub>a9</sub>, AVR<sub>a10</sub> and AVR<sub>a22</sub>). When analysed on the basis of the CSEP0064/BEC1054 X-ray structure resolved in the present work, only AVR<sub>a7</sub> and AVR<sub>a13</sub> exhibited significant structural similarity with CSEP0064/BEC1054, while no meaningful structural similarities with CSEP0064/BEC1054 were noted in the case of AVR<sub>a1</sub>, AVR<sub>a9</sub>, AVR<sub>a10</sub> and AVR<sub>a22</sub>. In summary, these data suggest that allelic MLA immune receptors are capable to mount potent immune responses upon recognition of structurally unrelated CSEPs as avirulence determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref057">57</xref>].</p>

<title>CSEP0064/BEC1054 interferes with induced rRNA cleavage</title>
<p>The structural similarity of CSEP0064/BEC1054 with RNases and ribotoxins raises the possibility that RALPHs like CSEP0064/BEC1054 bind motifs similar to those recognised by RIPs expressed by the plant host. This prompted us to test the effect of CSEP0064/BEC1054 expression on the integrity of host RNAs. In general, MeJA can induce production of RIPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref013">13</xref>], which cleave an adenine base from the large rRNA subunit sugar-phosphate backbone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref060">60</xref>]. This exposes the phosphodiester bond in the sugar-phosphate backbone, which can then undergo chemical hydrolysis within the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref058">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref062">62</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the process can be reconstituted by treatment of depurinated rRNA with aniline, which cleaves the sugar-phosphate backbone at the site of the modified nucleotide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref063">63</xref>]. This results in the formation of two defined rRNA fragments, ca. 3,000 and 400 nucleotides long, respectively. The smaller rRNA fragment has been observed in barley and is an indicator of RIP activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref033">33</xref>]. Our experiments showed that RNA extracted from MeJA-induced wheat leaves, treated with aniline, contains a new fragment with an apparent size of about 1,200 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). This new RNA species is likely to be a product of depurination/cleavage from a large, abundant RNA, such as rRNA, because it only appears after <italic>in vitro</italic> treatment with aniline. At present we do not know its exact identity, but the size of the RNA fragment is consistent with the products of RNA cleavage previously observed in MeJA-induced RIP, such as JIP60 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref033">33</xref>]. The area under the peak was significantly reduced in plants infected with <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>tritici</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Furthermore, we observed no additional peaks in RNAs from leaves infected by <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>tritici</italic>. The expression of a single transgenic RALPH effector was not as potent as actual infection, but resulted in an intermediate effect which was not statistically different from either the uninfected or infected (azygous) samples. Moreover, the combination of infection and transgenic expression of CSEP0064/BEC1054 was similarly intermediate. It remains to be seen whether expression of multiple RALPH effectors, observed during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref034">34</xref>], would result in an inhibition that is statistically significant.</p>

<sec id="sec014">
<title>Is CSEP0064/BEC1054 an inhibitor of host RIPs?</title>
<p>We have observed an increased susceptibility in different plants to filamentous pathogens upon expression of CSEP0064/BEC1054 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This effect is consistent with the activities displayed by secreted effectors dedicated to modulate or inhibit the immune system of the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref064">64</xref>]. Although the precise activity of CSEP0064/BEC1054 has not yet been determined, the observations made so far suggest an RNA-binding function that counteracts the role of endogenous plant RNases like RIPs. Depurination of a specific nucleotide in the SRL RNA by RIPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref065">65</xref>] is a mechanism in plants to limit the spread of fungal infections: it impairs binding of the eEF2/GTP complex to the ribosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref066">66</xref>]. This, in turn, inhibits protein synthesis and ultimately leads to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref067">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref068">68</xref>]. Thus, suppressing the function of RIPs could be a prime target for CSEP0064/BEC1054 and other proteins in the large family of RALPHs encoded in the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> genomes. Several lines of experimental evidence are consistent with this hypothesis. Firstly, our sequence and structural analyses show that this protein is a non-catalytic homolog of fungal RNases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Secondly, our binding data demonstrate that CSEP0064/BEC1054 is capable of recognising host RNA (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g005">5A</xref>). While the interaction measured is weak, we cannot rule out that the binding affinity of CSEP0064/BEC1054 <italic>in vivo</italic> is enhanced by extended contacts with an RNA motif like the SRL and neighbouring proteins on the ribosomal surface. A similar binding mode has been invoked for ribotoxins and RIPs. For example, structural studies show that the fungal ribotoxin restrictocin can form a stable interaction in solution with the SRL RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref069">69</xref>], and docking of the restrictocin-SRL RNA complex into the structure of the ribosome showed proximity of this enzyme to ribosomal proteins L6 and L14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref055">55</xref>]. Thirdly, our data also show that CSEP0064/BEC1054 interacts <italic>in planta</italic> with PR10 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). At least some PR10 protein variants have been shown to function as RNase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref045">45</xref>] CSEP0064/BEC1054 may thus interfere with barley PR10 RNase function.</p>
<p>In this work we found that the presence of a single CSEP0064/BEC1054 <italic>in planta</italic> appears to afford some protection of a major host RNA species from MeJA-induced cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), but this effect is weak and barely significant on its own. It may be that the expression of several RALPHs are needed to obtain a clear and significant impact. The data is consistent with a model in which CSEP0064/BEC1054 competes with a RIP like JIP60 for an RNA-binding site whose integrity is critical for ribosomal function. This would then meet the need of an obligate biotrophic pathogen, such as the powdery mildew fungus, to deal with the consequences of MeJA induction at early stages of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref070">70</xref>]. Given the predicted structural similarity of CSEP0064/BEC1054 with more than 100 paralogs in the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>graminis</italic> f.sp. <italic>hordei</italic> CSEP repository [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref004">4</xref>], it can be expected that additional effector candidates of this pathogen play a similar role. The predicted functional redundancy of these CSEPs might be explained by buffering against the loss of individual effector genes in the highly plastic fungal genome and/or the potential sequential delivery of effector variants during pathogenesis to escape detection by the plant immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref071">71</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We hypothesise that CSEP0064/BEC1054 could protect rRNA from the activity of plant RIPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007620.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Preventing the degradation of rRNA would help to preserve the living cell as a food source for the fungus. This is an essential role for a fungus that is an obligate biotrophic pathogen of plants and goes some way to explain why these candidate effectors are such a prominent component of the CSEP complement in grass powdery mildew fungi.</p>

<title>Transient expression in barley</title>
<p>Bacteria, containing the plasmids to be used for biolistic transformation of barley primary leaves, were cultured overnight in 200 μl LB media with ampicillin, and purified using the NucleoBond Xtra Midi kit (Machery-Nagel, Düren, Germany). Gold micro-carriers (Gold powder, spherical, APS 0.8–1.5 μm, 99.96 (Alfa Aesar, Karlsruhe, Germany), were prepared previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref076">76</xref>]. In summary, they were weighed in 30 mg aliquots, coated with 5 μl of DNA solution at 100 ng/μl (one μl of DsRED plasmid, 2 μl of bait plasmid and 2 μl of prey plasmid; or for the positive expression controls, 1 μl of DsRED plasmid and 2 μl of expression control plasmid, where all DNA solutions were prepared at 100 ng/μl) whilst being vortexed.

<p>Primary leaves were harvested from seven-day-old barley leaves, and their adaxial surfaces bombarded with coated micro-carriers using a PDS-1000/He System with a Hepta Adaptor as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany).

Transformed cells were identified through observation of DsRED fluorescence, which was excited at 561 nm using the 560 nm diode laser. Fluorescence emission was detected between 600 and 640 nm using a photomultiplier tube detector. mYFP fluorescence was excited at 514 nm with an argon laser at 20% base power and 5% laser power for imaging. Fluorescence emission was detected between 520 and 540 nm using a HYD detector with 250 V gain for all images. Sequential imaging was conducted by 400 Hz scanning speed and 5x frame averaging.

<p>Purified CSEP0064/BEC1054 was dialysed into crystallisation buffer (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0) and concentrated to 10 mg/ml for crystallisation. A variety of commercially available solution conditions for crystallisation (Hampton Research,CA, USA) were screened using the sitting-drop vapour diffusion method. CSEP0064/BEC1054 was combined with the mother liquor on a 1:1 ratio in 200 nl drops. Crystals obtained in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0, supplemented with 30% PEG 4000, 0.4 M (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> were cryoprotected with 30% glycerol and flash frozen for data collection. A native dataset to 1.3 Å resolution was collected at a wavelength of 0.92 Å using the I04 beamline (DIAMOND Light Source, Oxford, UK) and a second derivative dataset collected at a wavelength of 0.95 Å (above the iodide f” edge) from crystals that had been soaked in mother liquor supplemented with 0.5 M sodium iodide. Initial processing, scaling and structure factor calculation of native and iodide SAD datasets was performed using XDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref083">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref084">84</xref>] and TRUNCATE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref085">85</xref>] respectively, from within the XIA2 program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref086">86</xref>].

<p>A GLMM was used, as non-normal repeated measures (i.e. the fact that the old and young leaves were from the same plants, and the different leaf sections used originated from the same leaves), can be accounted for through the addition of random effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007620.ref095">95</xref>].

<p>Multiple Comparisons of Means with Tukey Contrasts were conducted to identify whether the mean propH differed for plants homozygous (+/+) or azygous (-/-) for CSEP0064/BEC1054, or for samples taken from the base, middle or tip of the leaf. Significant difference is indicated by “***” for p≤0.005.</p>
