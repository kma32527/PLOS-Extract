<abstract>
<p><italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, the causative agent of Lyme disease in humans, is maintained in a complex biphasic life cycle, which alternates between tick and vertebrate hosts. To successfully survive and complete its enzootic cycle, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> adapts to diverse hosts by regulating genes required for survival in specific environments. Here we describe the first ever use of transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-seq) to identify genes required for <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> survival in its tick host. We found that insertions into 46 genes resulted in a complete loss of recovery of mutants from larval <italic>Ixodes</italic> ticks. Insertions in an additional 56 genes resulted in a &gt;90% decrease in fitness. The screen identified both previously known and new genes important for larval tick survival. Almost half of the genes required for survival in the tick encode proteins of unknown function, while a significant portion (over 20%) encode membrane-associated proteins or lipoproteins. We validated the results of the screen for five Tn mutants by performing individual competition assays using mutant and complemented strains. To better understand the role of one of these genes in tick survival, we conducted mechanistic studies of <italic>bb0017</italic>, a gene previously shown to be required for resistance against oxidative stress. In this study we show that BB0017 affects the regulation of key borrelial virulence determinants. The application of Tn-seq to <italic>in vivo</italic> screening of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> in its natural vector is a powerful tool that can be used to address many different aspects of the host pathogen interaction.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p><italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, the causative agent of Lyme disease, must adjust to environmental changes as it moves between its tick and vertebrate hosts. We performed a screen of a <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> transposon library using massively parallel sequencing (Tn-seq) to identify fitness defects involved in survival in its tick host. This screen accurately identified genes known to cause decreased fitness for tick survival and identified new genes involved in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> survival in ticks. All of the genes tested individually confirmed the Tn-seq results. One of the genes identified encodes a protein whose function was previously unknown that appears to be involved in regulating expression of proteins known to be involved in environmental adaptation. Tn-seq is a powerful tool for understanding vector-pathogen interactions and may reveal new opportunities for interrupting the infectious cycle of vector-borne diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete, <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>. In nature, <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> is maintained in a cycle between mammalian or bird hosts and <italic>Ixodes</italic> ticks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref001">1</xref>] Newly hatched ticks can acquire <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> from infected animals during their larval feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref001">1</xref>]. After molting to the nymphal stage, those infected ticks can transmit the pathogen to a new vertebrate host during their next blood meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref001">1</xref>]. The challenges posed by the vertebrate and tick environments are quite different. <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> must adapt to changes in temperature, pH, nutrient availability and immune defense mechanisms between its vertebrate and arthropod hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> adapts to its host environments through controlling the expression of proteins that aid in survival at specific points in its life cycle in its different hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref009">9</xref>]. For example, proteins such as outer surface protein C (OspC), variable-major- protein (Vmp)-like sequence E (VlsE) and decorin binding protein A (DbpA) are expressed to differing amounts during particular time points in the mammalian and tick phases of the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorfer</italic>i life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref014">14</xref>]. The regulation of gene expression in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> is complex, often involving multiple layers of control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Expression of proteins required during the mammalian phase involves two alternative sigma factors, RpoS and RpoN, the enhancer binding protein Rrp2, as well as the transcription factors BosR and BadR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref026">26</xref>]. In addition to controlling virulence gene expression, BosR also controls expression of genes involved in resistance to reactive oxygen species and affects metal homeostasis, while BadR controls expression of many genes involved in metabolite uptake and utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref028">28</xref>]. Other regulators such as carbon storage regulatory protein A (CsrA) appear to exert their effects outside the RpoS/RpoN axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>Much less is known about gene regulation and proteins critical for <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> survival while in its tick host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref006">6</xref>]. Histidine kinase 1 (Hk1) and response regulatory protein 1 (Rrp1) are highly expressed during the tick phase and appear to work together to regulate expression of genes involved in tick survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref032">32</xref>]. Rrp1 is a diguanylate cyclase required for the synthesis of cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP), an important second messenger signaling molecule in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> and other bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref035">35</xref>] The exact mechanisms by which Hk1 is activated and how Rrp1 is regulated are not known.</p>
<p>Proteins that have been shown to be important in survival in ticks include outer surface protein A (OspA), which binds to the tick mid gut protein TROSPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref036">36</xref>]. GuaA and GuaB, two enzymes that contribute to the purine salvage pathway, have also been shown to provide a fitness advantage in the tick host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref037">37</xref>]. The glycerol utilization operon (<italic>glpF</italic>, <italic>glpK</italic>, <italic>glpD</italic>) encodes proteins that allow the bacterium to utilize glycerol as the carbohydrate source for glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref038">38</xref>]. This operon is upregulated during all tick life cycle stages, and has been shown to be specifically involved with persistence and survival of the molt, but not early colonization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref038">38</xref>]. Another protein shown to be essential for infection of the tick host is the manganese transporter BmtA. This transporter is required for <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> to colonize and survive in ticks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we describe the use of transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-seq) to identify genes that are critical for <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> survival during infection of <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic>, the tick vector most commonly associated with Lyme disease transmission in North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref001">1</xref>]. Tn-seq is a high- throughput approach that enables the quantification of the frequency of individual transposon (Tn) mutants in a population before and after a selective pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref040">40</xref>]. Tn-seq has been widely used for <italic>in vitro</italic> assays of bacterial fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref044">44</xref>]. It has also been used to perform <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in mice, although <italic>in vivo</italic> Tn-seq studies are often limited by tight bottlenecks causing stochastic loss of mutants unrelated to the Tn insertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref043">43</xref>]. This report represents the first use of a Tn insertional library combined with massively parallel sequencing to identify bacterial genes involved in colonization of an arachnid. Using Tn-seq, we were able to accurately identify a number of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> mutants with impaired fitness for survival in <italic>Ixodes</italic> ticks. The process is easily scalable though testing additional ticks, which reduces misidentification of mutants that are lost for reasons other than fitness. As opposed to mammalian studies, in which the number of animals is often limiting, we were able to readily screen very large numbers of larval ticks, thereby mitigating bottleneck issues. As part of our studies, we have identified a potential new regulator of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> gene expression, BB0017, which may contribute to expression of genes involved in tick and mammalian survival.</p>

<title>Feeding of ticks with <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> by immersion</title>
<p>Infection of ticks with <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> from the mutant library was performed using a method previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref048">48</xref>]. Briefly, before immersion, spirochete cell density was determined by dark field microscopy. Cell suspensions were centrifuged for 10 min at 8,000 x g and were resuspended at the desired cell density and in the desired medium. <italic>I</italic>. <italic>scapularis</italic> larvae were obtained from the National Tick Research and Education Resource at Oklahoma State University and were maintained in a humid tick incubating chamber at room temperature. Larvae were used within 4 months of emergence.</p>
<p>Before immersion, <italic>I</italic>. <italic>scapularis</italic> larvae were removed from the chamber and allowed to sit at ambient humidity in an air-conditioned room for 2h. The larvae were then transferred with a small brush into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> culture suspension of 108 bacteria in 1 ml was then added to the ticks. For the Tn-seq studies, the suspension consisted of the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> Tn mutant library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref043">43</xref>]. For confirmatory experiments, individual mutants, mixtures of mutants and complemented mutants, or mixtures of mutants and controls were used in the suspension. The tubes were gently vortexed to suspend larvae in the culture and incubated at 32°C for 1 h. Tubes were gently vortexed every 15 min to redistribute ticks in the culture. After incubation at 32°C, tubes were centrifuged at 200 x g for 1 min. The supernatant was removed, and ticks were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).</p>
<p>Larvae were then transferred from the microcentrifuge tube to a sealed mouse restraining device. The mice were of C57BL/6 background and were all females aged 4-6 weeks old. A mouse was placed into the restrainer containing the larvae, and the larvae were allowed to attach. Mice were removed from the restrainer after 30 min and transferred to cages suspended over water moats. Engorged larvae were collected from the moats 3 to 5 days after placement and transferred into a tick incubation chamber.</p>

<title>Tick processing for Tn-seq analysis</title>
<p>Ticks were collected as they completed feeding from the animals. Cages were checked daily to collect ticks. Ticks were batched and processed for Tn-seq up to 48 hrs after collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref048">48</xref>]. Briefly, ticks were washed in 3% hydrogen peroxide, 70% ethanol, and finally in PBS. The ticks were allowed to dry before placement in 500 μl of BSK-II medium with kanamycin and gentamicin. To isolate spirochetes from the ticks, the ticks were crushed with a plastic pestle (Fisherbrand RNase- Free Disposable Pellet Pestles). These tick homogenates were inoculated into 5 ml of BSK-II containing kanamycin and gentamicin. The cultures were incubated for two days to allow outgrowth. Following this, the spirochetes were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 8,000 x g. Bacterial pellets were washed once in PBS, and then the dry pellet was stored at -80°C until further processing for Tn-seq.</p>

Chromosomal DNA was sheared using the M220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris) in microTUBEs with a target peak at 350 bp.

<title>Tn-seq data analysis</title>
<p>Sequenced reads were clustered by barcode sequence. Data analysis were performed using the Galaxy platform and followed a previously published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref043">43</xref>]. We obtained an average of 1.2 x 10<sup>7</sup> reads per barcode, with 1.7 x 10<sup>6</sup> reads per condition for analysis after removal of low quality sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref043">43</xref>]. Reads were mapped to the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> B31 genome using Bowtie, and a custom script was used to count the number of sequence reads corresponding to each insertion site in the genome. Sequence reads were analyzed “by-site” and “by-gene”. Only Tn mutants that were represented by at least ten sequence reads in both input samples were included in the “by site” analysis. In contrast, the “by-gene” analysis included all sequence reads mapping within a particular gene. Genes represented by less than ten sequence reads in both untreated samples were excluded from the “by-gene” analysis. Tn mutants with zero reads in the output samples were assigned a value of one for the purpose of calculation. The frequency of each Tn mutant in a particular condition was determined by dividing the number of sequence reads corresponding to each Tn mutant by the total number of sequences in the barcode. A frequency ratio was then determined by dividing the frequency of a Tn mutant in the output (bacteria recovered from the ticks) sample by its frequency in the input population. For the purposes of prioritizing mutants for follow-up, frequency ratios between 0.5 and 2 were considered neutral.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> mutant and complemented strains</title>
<p>A plasmid for complementation of the Tn::<italic>bb0164</italic> mutant was generated previously by overlap PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref043">43</xref>]. A plasmid for directing <italic>cis</italic> complementation of Tn::<italic>bb0412</italic> via allelic exchange was generated from three PCR fragments: intact <italic>bb0412</italic> with 995 bp upstream sequence (F1), P<italic>flgB</italic>-<italic>aadA</italic> for antibiotic selection (F2), and 1022 bp downstream of <italic>bb0412</italic> (F3). Primers were designed with approximately 30 bp on the 5' end for overlap, with the numerically assigned PCR products assembled in order into the final construct. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007644.s001">S1 Table</xref> for a list of all primer sequences used in this study. Individual PCR fragments were amplified with AccuPrime Pfx (ThermoFisher Scientific, MA) per the manufacturer's instructions. An overlap PCR was performed with equal volumes of the appropriate number of PCR fragments with AccuPrime Pfx reagents per the manufacturer's recommendations. Following PCR, the products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and gel-purified (Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) for cloning into pCR-Blunt (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY) following the manufacturer's protocol. The <italic>bb0412</italic> complementation vector was designated pAK412 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007644.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Plasmid pMR05 was constructed for <italic>trans</italic> complementation of the Tn::<italic>bb0017</italic> mutant was generated by amplifying a DNA sequence containing the <italic>bb0017</italic> open reading frame and the 298-bp upstream region from 5A18NP1 genomic DNA via PCR using the primers bb0017FLAG-F-SacI and bb0017FLAG-R-XbaI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007644.s001">S1 Table</xref>). The resulting PCR products as well as pKFSS1 were digested with SacI and XbaI, and the resulting PCR product and pKFSS1 fragments were ligated together using T4 DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs), generating pMR05 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007644.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Plasmid pBS01 was constructed to direct allelic exchange at the <italic>bb0017</italic> locus, resulting in deletion of the <italic>bb0017</italic> open reading frame (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007644.t001">Table 1</xref>). Plasmid pBS01 contains 1835 bp of sequence upstream of <italic>bb0017</italic> (amplified from genomic DNA using primers bb0017del1 and bb0017del2), followed by a sequence containing the constitutive P<italic>flgB</italic> promoter and a streptomycin resistance gene (<italic>aadA</italic>, amplified from pKFSS1 using primers bb0017del3 and bb0017del4), followed by 1999 bp of sequence downstream of <italic>bb0017</italic> (amplified from genomic DNA using primers bb0017del5 and bb0017del6). PCR products were purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit and were subsequently assembled into the pBlueScript cloning vector using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit.</p>
<p>Plasmid pBS02 was constructed to direct expression of <italic>bb0017</italic> in the Δ<italic>bb0017</italic> mutant. Plasmid pBS02 is identical to pMR05, except for replacement of the streptomycin resistance cassette by a gentamicin cassette (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007644.t001">Table 1</xref>). The streptomycin cassette was excised from pMR05 by restriction digest with AatII and NdeI. The gentamicin cassette had been previously subcloned into the pCR2.1cloning vector. The gentamicin resistance gene was excised from this vector using the same restriction enzymes as above, and the resulting fragment was ligated with the digested pMR05 backbone (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007644.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Plasmid pMH88R was used to constitutively express the <italic>glp</italic> operon in the Δ<italic>bb0017</italic> mutant. Plasmid pMH88R was a kind gift of Dr. Frank Yang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref033">33</xref>]. All completed plasmids were verified by restriction digest and dideoxy sequencing.</p>
<p>Plasmids were introduced into <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> by transformation as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref051">51</xref>]. <italic>Cis</italic> complementation vector pAK412 was transformed into <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> Tn::<italic>bb0412</italic>, and transformants were designated AK102 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007644.t001">Table 1</xref>).

<title>Tick competition assays</title>
<p>To evaluate survival in the tick host, individual Tn mutants of interest were combined with their respective complemented strain or wild type bacteria in a 1:1 mixture. Each strain was grown independently. Cell density was determined by microscopy, and 5 x 10<sup>7</sup> <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> were harvested by centrifugation. The pellets from both cultures were then resuspended in the same 1 ml of BSK-II medium to a final overall density of 1 x 10<sup>8</sup> cells/ml. Ticks were submerged in the cultures as described, placed on mice for feeding, and collected over three days as described above. Each tick was washed successively with 3% hydrogen peroxide, 70% ethanol and PBS, then crushed into 250 μl of BSK-II containing kanamycin and 5 μg/ml amphotericin B. The cultures were allowed to acclimate in liquid medium for a period of 2 h before plating, to allow the bacteria to escape from the crushed tick into the medium. Plating in semi-solid agarose overlay was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref050">50</xref>]. These plates were then sealed in plastic bags and placed at 32°C for 10 days. The plates were removed from the incubator and colonies were enumerated. The ratio of the wild-type or complemented strains to the Tn mutant was determined by counting the colonies on the appropriate antibiotic selective plates. A competitive index was calculated for these experiments by dividing the amount of mutant recovered by the amount of complement or WT that was recovered. In the case where no mutant was recovered, its value was set to one for the purposes of calculation of the competitive index.</p>

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> Tn-seq screen in larval ticks</title>
<p>In order to use Tn-seq to determine genes involved in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> fitness for survival in ticks, we first needed to decide the number of ticks to include in the experiments. Using immersion feeding, it has previously been shown that approximately 103 <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> could be recovered per tick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref052">52</xref>]. However, these experiments examined a single strain of bacteria, and since bacteria were allowed to replicate within the tick before recovery, the actual number of bacteria entering to establish colonization was likely less than 10<sup>3</sup>. We were also concerned that the bottleneck may be further exacerbated by plasmid loss in the parental strain of the transposon library. It has previously been reported that the mean number of spirochetes per tick with 5A18NP1 lacking both lp28-4 and lp56 plasmids was lower than that in ticks infected with <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> harboring all plasmids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref053">53</xref>]. The ordered transposon library contains insertions into 45.5% of the predicted protein encoding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref045">45</xref>]. To ensure sufficient coverage of the pooled library of around 4,000 mutants we chose to target approximately 150 ticks per experiment. If only half the predicted number of bacteria established infection (500 bacteria per tick), this approach should still provide approximately 20- fold coverage of the mutants within our library.</p>
<p>In each of two independent experiments, approximately 300 larval ticks were immersed in a culture solution containing the entire Tn library and then fed on mice. This resulted in the collection of approximately 160 fed ticks per experiment. Fed ticks were processed and cultured in BSK medium for 2 days. The input culture was also cultured for an additional 2 days to match the tick cultures. Bacteria from both cultures were harvested and sequencing libraries prepared.</p>
<p>Reproducibility was high between the two input libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007644.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, Pearson coefficient R2=0.98). The correlation between the Tn frequencies of the populations recovered from the two groups of tick larvae was also high with a Pearson coefficient R2= 0.85 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007644.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). A frequency ratio was calculated for each Tn mutant in the library by comparing its frequency in the output library to its frequency in the input library. For analysis, we included only Tn mutants represented by at least 10 sequence reads (out of a total of approximately 1.7 x 10<sup>6</sup> sequence reads per experiment) in both replicates of the input libraries. This number was chosen to reduce the risk of stochastic loss after selection in the ticks. Tn mutants that were represented in the input library but had zero reads in the output library were assigned a value of one read in order to be able to calculate a frequency ratio. A frequency ratio less than one indicates that the Tn mutant decreased in frequency after recovery from fed ticks suggesting that the disrupted gene is involved in survival in the larval host. A frequency ratio greater than one indicates that the Tn mutant increased in frequency after larval colonization suggesting that the disruption of the corresponding gene provides a fitness advantage. An overall frequency ratio was also calculated for each gene by aggregating all of the sequence reads mapping to Tn insertions within the same gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007644.s006">S1 File</xref>). A complete list of mutant fitness for larval colonization by gene and by site is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007644.s006">S1 File</xref>.</p>

<p>In order to validate our screen, we began by analyzing genes that have been previously shown to be essential for tick survival, to ensure that these genes had been identified in the screen. Borrelial genes that have been described in the literature as critical to tick survival for which mutants are present in the library include: <italic>bb0419</italic> and <italic>bb0420</italic>, respectively encoding a response regulator designated Rrp1 and a histidine kinase designated Hk1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref035">35</xref>]; <italic>guaA</italic> and <italic>guaB</italic>, two genes involved in the purine salvage pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref037">37</xref>]; <italic>glpD</italic>, encoding a glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref038">38</xref>]; and <italic>bptA</italic>, a surface-expressed lipoprotein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref008">8</xref>]. In the Tn-seq experiment, consistent with previously published results, insertional mutants in each of these genes except <italic>glpD</italic> showed attenuated ability to survive in the tick, with median frequency ratios of &lt;0.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007644.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). GlpD has been shown to be important following the molt from larvae to nymph when carbon sources are less abundant and the organism begins to utilize glycerol, which may explain why Tn::<italic>glpD</italic> mutants did not exhibit phenotypes in our screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref035">35</xref>].</p>

(B) Individual Tn mutants were mixed in a one to one ratio with the parental strain 5A18NP1 or the respective complemented strain, and the mixtures were used to infect larvae. After a blood meal these larvae were crushed and plated with appropriate antibiotics to distinguish between the Tn mutant and the complemented strain (or parental strain). Competitive Indices (CI) were determined. Closed shapes indicate that the Tn mutant was recovered following the competition experiment. Open shapes indicate no Tn mutants were recovered following competition experiment. In these cases, the number of Tn mutants recovered was set to one for the purposes of calculation. Statistical significance was determined by one sample t test (***, P&lt;0.0001). (Statistics performed on GraphPad Prism version 7, GraphPad Software, LaJolla California).</p>

<p>Further analysis was performed to identify new genes involved in tick survival. A large number of mutants (N=309) had a frequency ratio of less than 0.5 compared with the input library. In order to prioritize mutants with the strongest phenotypes for follow-up analysis, we focused on mutants with a fitness ratio of less than 0.1. Mutants with insertions in 102 genes had an average overall frequency ratio below 0.1 in both experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007644.s006">S1 File</xref>). However, this group of 102 mutants included some with insertions into genes that have been shown not to be required for tick colonization (e.g. <italic>ospC</italic>). While many of this group of 102 genes may be involved in tick survival as it includes many of the genes previously identified as involved in tick colonization, to further reduce the chance of false discovery by the screen, we increased the stringency of our criteria and focused on the subset of 46 genes that had &gt;100 reads in the input library but were completely absent in the processed ticks from both experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007644.t002">Table 2</xref>). These genes would be predicted to have the greatest impact on fitness for survival in larval ticks. Of these 46 genes, many have no predicted function and have not been previously characterized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007644.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Approximately 22% of the genes are predicted lipoproteins, while 7% are involved in carbohydrate transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007644.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p>

<p>To confirm the results of the Tn-seq screen, we chose mutants with insertions in five genes (<italic>bb0017</italic>, <italic>bb0164</italic>, <italic>bb0412</italic>, <italic>bb0050</italic> and <italic>bb0051</italic>) that showed the strongest fitness defects, and that have not previously been reported to be involved in tick survival. Each of these genes was well represented by insertion mutants in the input library and had an overall frequency ratio of less than 0.1 following the ingestion of a blood meal by larval ticks. Competition assays were conducted to assess the capability of each individual mutant to survive the larval blood meal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007644.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Three of the transposon mutants were competed against a complemented strain, while the remaining two transposon mutants were competed against the parental strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007644.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The Tn::<italic>bb0017</italic>, Tn::<italic>bb0164</italic>, Tn::<italic>bb0412</italic>, Tn::<italic>bb0050</italic> and Tn::<italic>bb0051</italic> mutants were all outcompeted by the parental or respective complemented strains, confirming a role for all five genes in blood meal survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007644.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). We were also able to further confirm this phenotype when competing a <italic>bb0017</italic> clean deletion strain against its complemented strain. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007644.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The complemented strain greatly outcompeted the deletion strain confirming the role of <italic>bb0017</italic> in surviving the blood meal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007644.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>

<title>Identifying the role of identified genes in tick survival</title>
<p>The Tn-seq and competition experiments do not distinguish between the possibilities that 1) the identified genes are required for initial entry into the tick during immersion; or 2) they are required for surviving the blood meal taken by the tick. The competition experiment that was described previously was modified so that the ticks were not allowed to take a blood meal after immersion in the culture containing the two competing strains, allowing us to separate fitness defects due to uptake from fitness defects due to blood meal survival. The ticks were crushed after two hours of immersion feeding or kept overnight and crushed 24 hours post-immersion. The relative frequencies of the mutant and complemented or parental strains were then determined as before. However, in contrast to the competitive defect exhibited by all five Tn mutants after the blood meal, we were able to recover all Tn mutants after immersion feeding in equal or greater numbers compared to the WT or complemented mutants. However, in the absence of a blood meal, as expected, the numbers of bacteria were greatly reduced and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> was not recovered from all individual ticks. The results of these studies are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007644.t003">Table 3</xref>. These data support a role for these five borrelial genes in surviving changes associated with the blood meal. Also, importantly, because several of these genes have identified roles in ROS resistance and hydrogen peroxide was used in washing the ticks, these experiments confirm that the hydrogen peroxide wash did not affect selection of these mutants.</p>

<title><italic>In silico</italic> analysis predicts BB0017 is a membrane-associated signal transduction protein</title>
<p>To begin to better understand the mechanisms by which the genes identified in the Tn-seq screen contribute to tick-phase survival, we performed further investigation into one of the genes identified as critical for survival of the blood meal: <italic>bb0017</italic>. The gene <italic>bb0017</italic> was previously identified in a screen for genes that confer resistance to ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref043">43</xref>]. BB0017 is highly conserved among both <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> sensu stricto and other sensu lato strains (&gt;99% and &gt;94% identity at the amino acid level, respectively). BB0017 homologues are also conserved in the relapsing fever strains (&gt;80% identity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref054">54</xref>]. In the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> strain B31, <italic>bb0017</italic> is annotated an integral membrane protein of the YitT family. BB0017 contains four predicted transmembrane domains as well as a C-terminal soluble domain and contains the conserved domain of unknown function DUF2179 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007644.s003">S1A &amp; S1B Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref055">55</xref>]. A structure-based similarity search using Phyre2 suggested that the C-terminal domain of BB0017 is structurally similar to PII and PII-like proteins, despite low overall sequence identity (&lt;27% identity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref056">56</xref>]. No high confidence predictions were made for the N-terminal domain of BB0017.</p>
<p>PII proteins are a broadly conserved class of signal transduction proteins found in bacteria, archaea, and plants and are generally small cytoplasmic proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref057">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref059">59</xref>]. PII proteins generally function as trimers and control the activity of their regulatory targets through direct protein-protein interactions in response to both post-translational modifications (such as uridylylation) and ligand binding (including ADP, ATP, and 2-oxoglutarate). The long, flexible T- loop mediates interactions with regulatory targets, while a conserved motif in the shorter B-loop is involved in ligand binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007644.s003">S1C Fig</xref>, GlnKEc). More recently, several PII-like families of proteins have been identified in bacteria, including a family of proteins in Gram-positive bacteria that bind cyclic diadenylate monophosphate (c-di-AMP) as well as a broadly conserved family of proteins (CutA) that confer copper tolerance in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and bind acetylcholinesterase in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref060">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref066">66</xref>].</p>
<p>While the PII and PII-like proteins share a common ferredoxin-like fold, the lengths of the T and B loops differ significantly between the different protein families. In the case of the PII-like c-di-AMP binding proteins, the lengths of the B and T loops are reversed relative to the PII proteins and are referred to as the B´ and T´ loops (PstASa, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007644.s003">S1C Fig</xref>). Structural data suggests that the functions of the B´ and T´ loops are also reversed relative to the PII proteins, with the short T´ loop being involved in ligand binding and the long flexible B´ loop possibly involved in effector binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref061">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref064">64</xref>]. In the case of the copper tolerance protein CutA1, both the B and T loops are truncated, and the same is true for BB0017. Interestingly, BB0017 appears to lack conserved residues involved in ligand binding by both the PII and PII-like protein families. The presence of the N-terminal transmembrane domain also distinguishes BB0017 from the PII and PII-like protein families and suggests that membrane localization may be important for BB0017 function.</p>

<title>BB0017 downregulates expression of mammalian-phase lipoproteins</title>
<p>Because BB0017 contains a putative signal transduction domain, we hypothesized that the Tn::<italic>bb0017</italic> mutant would exhibit global differences in gene expression compared to the parental strain. Total RNA was isolated from the parental and Tn::<italic>bb0017</italic> strains, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to compare the transcriptomes of both strains. We identified 16 genes that were significantly downregulated more than twofold in the Tn::<italic>bb0017</italic> mutant compared to the parental strain and 25 genes that were significantly upregulated more than twofold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007644.s002">S2 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007644.g004">Fig 4</xref>). It is important to note that <italic>bb0017</italic> does not appear in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007644.s002">S2 Table</xref>. While expression of <italic>bb0017</italic> was significantly different between the Tn::<italic>bb0017</italic> and parental strains, the difference was less than twofold, and <italic>bb0017</italic> expression was actually higher in the Tn::<italic>bb0017</italic> mutant compared to the parental strain. Sequence coverage maps confirm that transcription in the Tn::<italic>bb0017</italic> mutant is abrogated downstream of the Tn insertion as expected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007644.s004">S2 Fig</xref>).

It is unclear whether there is translation of the 5’ portion of <italic>bb0017</italic> in the Tn::<italic>bb0017</italic> mutant, resulting in a truncated protein, but if a truncated protein is produced in the Tn::<italic>bb0017</italic> mutant, these results could suggest that the C-terminal portion of BB0017 is the critical portion for survival in the tick.</p>

<p>To confirm the results of the RNA-seq screen, we generated a mutant lacking the entire <italic>bb0017</italic> open reading frame. A survey of available <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> genome sequences revealed two different annotated start sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007644.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). We chose to delete the region encompassing the first start site, which includes a putative 71 bp small RNA (SR0011) in the <italic>bb0016-bb0017</italic> intergenic region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref068">68</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007644.s003">S1 Fig</xref>).

<p>We performed qRT-PCR on the Δ<italic>bb0017</italic> mutant as well as the complemented strain to validate the results of the RNA-seq using the transposon insertion strain.

Transcription of <italic>glpD</italic> was decreased in the transposon mutant and its complement as well as the deletion strain and its complement in comparison to the wild type making it unlikely that this difference was due to secondary site mutations or polar effects as each of the mutants and complements were created from separate isolations from the parental strain. Of note is that all the changes are small (fourfold) compared to the other genes tested by qRT-PCR. Given the lack of involvement of <italic>glpD</italic> involvement in tick survival as assayed by the Tn-seq and its established role at a different stage in tick survival, it is likely that the change is not physiologically relevant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper, we report the use of massively parallel, next generation sequencing technology to identify genes important in survival in the larval tick host. This study represents the most complete survey of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> genes that are required for tick survival performed to date and greatly increases our understanding of this critical phase of the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> life cycle. We have identified many genes that have not previously been associated with tick survival, confirmed the involvement of a subset in tick survival, and began to characterize a mechanism of action for one of the genes, <italic>bb0017</italic>. Notably, because we were able to quickly and inexpensively screen large numbers of ticks, we were able to minimize bottleneck issues that have arisen in other animal studies, and our results showed a high level of experimental reproducibility. The robustness of the technique is exemplified by our ability to identify genes known to be required for tick-phase survival and our ability to validate the phenotypes of all five mutants we selected for further analysis.</p>
<p>There are several caveats in the interpretation of the Tn-seq screen data. First, the transposon library is not saturated and does not contain insertions into all non-essential genes. Mutants for several genes known to be important in tick colonization are not included in the library. Next, the transposon library we used for this study was generated in the 5A18NP1 background, which is missing two plasmids, lp56 and lp28-4. It is possible that the loss of the genes on these plasmids affects the requirement for certain genes or that the regulatory patterns are altered in their absence. Finally, the mechanism we used to infect the tick larvae, immersion feeding, is artificial and may lead to identification of genes that are not involved in natural transmission or, more likely, miss genes that are involved.</p>
<p>A more general caution about screening techniques such as Tn-seq is that the false discovery rate is dependent upon the stringency of the analysis used. We analyzed the data in two tiers. Using our most stringent criteria of no mutants isolated in either replicate, we did not detect any mis-identification in the subset of genes that were confirmed by additional experimental testing. Using slightly less stringent criteria of a 90% decrease in fitness, we already noted some false identifications of genes that have been previously shown to not be involved in tick survival including <italic>ospC</italic>. As with any screen, the goal is to enrich the identification of genes that are actually involved in a process while minimizing false identifications, but regardless of the stringency of the criteria, each of the genes will still need to be confirmed by additional testing. There was quite a bit of variability in frequency between genes that were not completely absent. This occurs because of stochastic loss of mutants due to bottleneck issues that can result in differences in the recovered mutants. One way to minimize this variability is to perform more experiments, which in our case, would mean adding more ticks for each replicate. By averaging results over more experiments, stochastic variability will decrease and we would have increased ability to identify genes with partial fitness impacts. At the numbers of ticks we used, the greatest confidence is for an extreme phenotype.</p>
<p>Understanding these caveats, we identified 46 genes whose disruption resulted in complete loss of Tn mutants from the population following colonization of larval ticks. Of these 46 genes, almost all have not previously been reported to be involved in survival in the tick, and thus the current study represents a significant advancement in our understanding of the genetic factors required for <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> survival in the tick. Of note, many of the tick-phase genes we identified encode membrane-localized lipoproteins, and a significant portion (14 genes, including the five we selected for follow-up analysis), have been previously identified as important for resistance to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007644.t002">Table 2</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
<p>We confirmed the phenotype for five of the novel tick-phase genes (<italic>bb0017</italic>, <italic>bb0164</italic>, <italic>bb0412</italic>, <italic>bb0050</italic>, and <italic>bb0051</italic>) by individual competition assays for survival in the tick following a blood meal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007644.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Prior to our study, relatively little was known regarding the functions of these gene products, other than their predicted role in ROS resistance. All five gene products are predicted to be membrane-localized, and BB0164 has previously been shown to be involved in controlling intracellular manganese homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref043">43</xref>]. To better understand whether these genes aid 1) the entry of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> into tick larvae during artificial infection, or 2) bacterial adaptation as the tick takes a blood meal, additional competition studies were carried out following the culture immersion step, but before the blood meal. All of the mutants tested survived as well as (or better than) the controls in the competition assays, suggesting that these genes are involved with survival of the blood meal and not with entry into the tick. That survival of the blood meal poses the larger barrier is not surprising. The blood infusion that the <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> encounters in the midgut of the tick during feeding creates a rapidly changing environment for the spirochete. During the blood meal, there are changes in pH and temperature and exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS), natural antibodies, and components of complement that can mediate spirochete killing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref071">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref078">78</xref>]. Our results suggest that the ability to resist oxidative stress is likely critically important for survival in the tick host.</p>
<p>We performed further investigations to better understand the mechanisms by which one of the genes identified in our screen, <italic>bb0017</italic>, contributes to survival in the tick. Our <italic>in silico</italic> analysis suggested that BB0017 is part of a larger family of PII and PII-like proteins. However, there are some notable differences that distinguish BB0017 from these protein families, including differences in the lengths of two key loop regions (B/B’ and T/T’) and absence of key conserved residues involved in ligand binding. Thus, if BB0017 does bind ligands such as copper or c-di-AMP as has been previously shown for PII and PII-like proteins, it does so via a unique mechanism. c-di-AMP is produced in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic>, although its potential function as a second messenger in this organism remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref079">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref080">80</xref>]. It is certainly possible that the true ligand for BB0017 is a different molecule as there are significant differences between BB0017 structure and the structure of other P<sub>II</sub> proteins. Given the downstream effects of BB0017, it is tempting to speculate that it may bind c-di-GMP, which plays a critical role in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> gene regulation, however identification of binding of other molecules by BB0017 requires further experimentation.</p>
<p>RNA-seq analysis revealed that interruption of <italic>bb0017</italic> by the Tn insertion results in significantly higher levels of transcription of the genes encoding DbpA and OspC; these results were corroborated by qRT-PCR as well as by immunoblot analyses using strains that had a complete deletion of <italic>bb0017</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007644.s002">S2 Table</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007644.g005">Fig 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007644.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). This regulatory effect in the mutant appears to be mediated by increased levels of BosR and RpoS suggesting that BB0017 acts as a potential negative regulator of these important pathways. Repression of genes highly expressed during mammalian infection would be consistent with a role for BB0017 in tick colonization. Previous studies have shown that expression of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> genes that are required for one host may result in a fitness defect in colonization of the other host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref069">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref073">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref076">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref077">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref081">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref083">83</xref>]. The effects of deletion of <italic>bb0017</italic> on RpoS are also likely to affect expression of genes in the <italic>glp</italic> operon as seen by the RNA-seq studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007644.s002">S2 Table</xref>). However, altered expression of the <italic>glp</italic> operon does not appear to account for the survival defect of the <italic>bb0017</italic> mutant in our Tn-seq experiments as overexpression of the <italic>glp</italic> operon was not sufficient to restore the ability to survive the blood meal in a Δ<italic>bb0017</italic> background. This is consistent with the fact that we did not observe a fitness defect for the Tn::<italic>glpD</italic> mutant and that prior studies have shown that the <italic>glp</italic> genes are required at a time point later in the tick cycle than was evaluated in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>The elevated lipoprotein expression profile observed in the <italic>bb0017</italic> mutant is strikingly similar to the phenotype of a mutant lacking the BmtA manganese (Mn) transporter. The <italic>bmtA</italic> mutant exhibits decreased intracellular Mn concentrations, which was shown to result in increased levels of <italic>ospC</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref084">84</xref>]. In the case of the <italic>bmtA</italic> mutant, the increased <italic>ospC</italic> expression is due to an increase in BosR protein levels at the post-transcriptional level, leading to increased transcriptional activation of RpoS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref084">84</xref>]. The post-transcriptional regulation of BosR has also been observed in conditions where CO<sub>2</sub> is limiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref085">85</xref>]. Our RNA-seq analysis suggests that <italic>bosR</italic> and <italic>rpoS</italic> transcript levels are similar in the Tn::<italic>bb0017</italic> mutant and parental strains, despite the increase we observe in protein levels (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007644.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007644.g006">6</xref>) suggesting that BB0017 affects BosR at the post-transcriptional level. In the <italic>bb0017</italic> mutant, RpoS also appears to be upregulated at the post-transcriptional level, suggesting that some mechanism other than direct transcriptional activation by BosR is responsible for increased RpoS levels. There is also precedent for post-transcriptional regulation of RpoS, both in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> and in other bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref069">69</xref>].</p>
<p>The reciprocal expression of two sets of genes required for survival in the tick or mammalian hosts in response to a variety of environmental signals is paradigmatic to borrelial pathogenesis. However, the mechanisms by which these external stimuli are sensed remain to be fully characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref069">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref073">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref076">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref077">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref081">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref083">83</xref>]. Given that BB0017 is predicted to be a membrane-localized signal transduction protein, we hypothesize that this protein may sense changes in the environment to regulate downstream effectors accordingly. The nature of the external signal, if any, sensed by BB0017 remains unclear, although it is likely not Mn. We previously showed that Mn levels are similar in the Tn::<italic>bb0017</italic> mutant compared to the parental strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007644.ref043">43</xref>]. Given that PII and PII-like proteins generally affect downstream targets at the post-transcriptional level via direct protein- protein interactions, we predict that the BB0017 regulon may be larger than the list of genes identified in the RNA-seq analysis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have found that Tn-seq is a powerful tool in identifying <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> genes important for fitness in surviving the blood meal. We have identified a large number of previously uncharacterized genes involved in the survival of the bacterium in its tick host. These results may provide important new avenues for exploration and understanding how the bacterium adapts to its different hosts. To this end we have further investigated the role of one of the genes identified, <italic>bb0017</italic>. We propose that BB0017 is a potential global regulator in <italic>B</italic>. <italic>burgdorferi</italic> that affects resistance to oxidative stress, survival in the arthropod host, and expression of key virulence determinants. As several of the other genes identified as important for survival of the bacteria during the early stages of tick larval infection also have been identified in prior screens for genes of ROS resistance, our results suggest the importance of ROS resistance in the initial colonization and persistence during the acquisition of the blood meal. Future Tn-seq screens can be tailored to identify genes required for survival during other parts of the bacterial lifecycle within the tick host. This approach will allow investigators to map the network of adaptations used by the bacteria to complete its life cycle.</p>
