<abstract>
<p>Throughout evolution, cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) have been capturing genes from their hosts, employing the derived proteins to evade host immune defenses. We have recently reported the presence of a number of <italic>CD48</italic> homologs (vCD48s) encoded by different pathogenic viruses, including several CMVs. However, their properties and biological relevance remain as yet unexplored. CD48, a cosignaling molecule expressed on the surface of most hematopoietic cells, modulates the function of natural killer (NK) and other cytotoxic cells by binding to its natural ligand 2B4 (CD244). Here, we have characterized A43, the vCD48 exhibiting the highest amino acid sequence identity with host CD48. A43, which is encoded by owl monkey CMV, is a soluble molecule released from the cell after being proteolytically processed through its membrane proximal region. <italic>A43</italic> is expressed with immediate-early kinetics, yielding a protein that is rapidly detected in the supernatant of infected cells. Remarkably, surface plasmon resonance assays revealed that this viral protein binds to host 2B4 with high affinity and slow dissociation rates. We demonstrate that soluble A43 is capable to abrogate host CD48:2B4 interactions. Moreover, A43 strongly binds to human 2B4 and prevents 2B4-mediated NK-cell adhesion to target cells, therefore reducing the formation of conjugates and the establishment of immunological synapses between human NK cells and CD48-expressing target cells. Furthermore, in the presence of this viral protein, 2B4-mediated cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production by NK cells are severely impaired. In summary, we propose that A43 may serve as a functional soluble CD48 decoy receptor by binding and masking 2B4, thereby impeding effective NK cell immune control during viral infections. Thus, our findings provide a novel example of the immune evasion strategies developed by viruses.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>In order to evade detection and destruction by cytotoxic lymphocytes and successfully persist within their hosts, cytomegalovirus (CMVs) have evolved a number of genes dedicated to block immune recognition. Certain CMVs and other large DNA viruses encode homologs of the cell-surface molecule CD48, a ligand of the 2B4 receptor involved in regulating the function of cytotoxic lymphocytes. Here, we have investigated for the first time the immunomodulatory potential of one of these viral molecules. We show that A43, a CD48 homolog encoded by owl monkey CMV, is a soluble molecule that exhibits exceptional binding kinetics for 2B4, and is furthermore capable of blocking the interaction with its counter-receptor CD48. Moreover, we reveal how this viral protein interferes with human NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity by inhibiting the immune synapse between human NK cells and target cells. Thus, these findings not only underscore the importance of 2B4-mediated immune responses in controlling CMV infections, but also unveil the shedding of a virally-encoded soluble variant of CD48 as a new viral counteract mechanism for subverting immune surveillance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Natural killer (NK) cells are circulating lymphocytes that play a pivotal role in the rapid recognition and control of viral infections. NK functions are regulated by a repertoire of specific receptors that, upon engagement with their respective ligands on target cells, transmit stimulatory or inhibitory signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref001">1</xref>]. The net balance of activating/inhibitory signals determines whether the NK cell will initiate its cytolytic activity through the degranulation of specialized secretory lysosomes into the immune synapse, ultimately causing the destruction of the target cell. One such receptor is 2B4 (or CD244), a member of the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref002">2</xref>]. In human NK cells, 2B4 predominantly provides co-stimulatory signals, activating NK cytotoxicity and cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref003">3</xref>]. 2B4 interacts with CD48, another member of the SLAM family that is broadly expressed on the surface of most hematopoietic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref006">6</xref>]. Both receptors contain an ectodomain composed of an N-terminal Ig membrane-distal variable (IgV) domain followed by an Ig constant-2-set domain, characterized by conserved cysteines. However, while CD48 is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, 2B4 is a type I transmembrane molecule that contains four copies of the immune receptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM) in its cytoplasmic tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref008">8</xref>]. 2B4 engagement by CD48 occurs through their N-terminal IgV domains, resulting in the recruitment of specific adaptor molecules by the ITSM motifs followed by signaling transduction events that ultimately modulate immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref009">9</xref>]. In addition to NK cells, 2B4 is expressed at lower levels on other cytotoxic cells, including CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, γδ T cells, basophils and eosinophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref011">11</xref>]. Therefore, the 2B4:CD48 interaction also contributes to the regulation of additional aspects of the innate and adaptive immune responses.</p>
<p>NK cells are crucial for the successful control of infections by cytomegaloviruses (CMVs). Consequently, these pathogens have evolved a wealth of strategies to hinder or abrogate NK functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref015">15</xref>]. Most of these strategies are based on mechanisms designed to avoid recognition of infected cells by activating NK cell receptors or to trigger inhibitory NK cell signaling. To this end, within their large and densely packed genomes, CMVs encode multiple immunosubversive proteins, meticulously shaped for these purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref017">17</xref>]. Some of these immunoevasins are of cellular origin, having been captured from their hosts at different times during their co-evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref020">20</xref>], and often employed to mimic or interfere with the original host function. Given the relevance of 2B4 for the regulation of NK cell activity, it is not surprising that among their immune evasion strategies CMVs have developed mechanisms to counteract CD48:2B4 interactions. In this regard, we have reported that CMVs reduce the expression of the CD48 receptor on the surface of infected target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref021">21</xref>]. Indeed, our group identified, in murine CMV, the mucin-like m154 protein as the viral molecule responsible for reducing CD48 macrophage surface expression. We showed that m154 targets CD48 for degradation and helps to impair antiviral NK-triggered cell responses, thereby meliorating viral growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, we have recently identified several CD48 homologs (vCD48s) among CMVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref023">23</xref>]. In particular, two primate cytomegaloviruses, SMCMV that infects squirrel monkeys and OMCMV that infects owl monkeys, encode copies of <italic>vCD48s</italic>, which arose from a unique gene-capture event in an ancestor CMV genome and subsequent gene duplication episodes. One of these vCD48s, A43, which shows the highest homology to host CD48, is a secreted molecule that preserves ligand-binding properties, being able to interact with host 2B4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref023">23</xref>]. However, to date, the biological significance of A43 and the rest of these vCD48s remains unknown. Thus, the potential of these molecules to function in immune evasion mechanisms warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>Here, we have characterized the OMCMV encoded CD48 homolog A43. We show that this viral protein can act as a soluble decoy CD48 receptor, protecting cells against NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. By binding with high affinity to 2B4, this viral protein is capable of preventing CD48:2B4 interactions. In addition, we present that A43 limits human NK cell adhesion to CD48-expressing target cells, inhibiting the formation of the NK cell immunological synapse. Thus, our findings point to a novel class of immunoevasins.</p>

<title><italic>A43</italic> is an immediate early (IE) gene encoding a protein shed from virally infected cells</title>
<p>We first sought to analyze the expression of A43 in the context of the infection. To determine the kinetic class of this viral protein, owl monkey kidney (OMK) epithelial cells were mock-infected or infected with OMCMV at a moi of 1 in the absence or presence of two chemical inhibitors, cycloheximide (CHX) or phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), which prevent translation and viral DNA replication, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from the cultures and reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR (RT-PCR) analysis was performed using specific primers for this vCD48. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, <italic>A43</italic> was detected under all conditions tested, including in the presence of CHX, when the immediate-early OMCMV gene <italic>IE1</italic> was abundantly expressed, but not the early <italic>UL54</italic> viral polymerase or the late <italic>UL73</italic> virion envelope glycoprotein N genes. Hence, <italic>A43</italic> can be considered an immediate early gene. We then examined the presence of the viral protein in infected cells. OMK cells, mock-infected or infected with OMCMV, were analyzed at different days after infection by flow cytometry using a polyclonal antibody that we raised against the viral protein. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, at the three time points examined, 1, 3 and 5 days post infection, A43 could be detected at very low amounts at the surface of the infected cells. To directly investigate whether A43 was shed during infection, culture supernatants were collected at different times post-infection over a 9 day period and examined by ELISA using the A43 polyclonal antibody. Remarkably, and depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, A43 was found in the extracellular milieu since the first 6 h after infection and accumulated over time, thereby indicating that the A43 protein is released as a soluble molecule soon after infection.</p>

<title>A43 is proteolytically processed through its transmembrane proximal region</title>
<p>Ectodomain shedding of transmembrane proteins primarily occurs by proteolytic cleavage at sites in close proximity to the cell surface. In this process, the length of the proximal region and the structure of the cleavage site region of the protein tend to be more relevant than the specific amino acid sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref024">24</xref>]. A43 contains a 12 aa-long membrane proximal (MP) region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Therefore, to gain insight into the cleavage site of A43, and assess whether the integrity of the MP region was fundamental in this process, different mutants of the viral protein containing deletions or point mutations in this region were engineered. To this end, we used an HA-tagged A43 plasmid, encoding the viral protein with the hemagglutinin (HA) tag positioned immediately after its signal peptidase cleavage site. In two of the variants the length of the MP region was shortened, deleting either the six aa immediately juxtaposed to the transmembrane domain (aa 214–219, in plasmid HA-A43 ΔT-R), or the six aa more distal (aa 220–225, in plasmid HA-A43 ΔG-A) to this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In addition, the lysine at position 216 within the A43 MP region was substituted by a proline, which would be expected to disrupt its secondary structure, or alternatively by an alanine as a control, in mutant plasmids HA-A43 K216P and HA-A43 K216A, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with wild type HA-A43 or the constructed plasmids and the effects of the removed amino acid stretches or the mutated lysine residue were quantitatively assessed by measuring HA-A43 surface expression by flow cytometry. Surprisingly, there were no substantial differences in cell surface expression between the deletion mutants HA-A43 ΔT-R or HA-A43 ΔG-A and the wild type HA-A43 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In contrast, a pronounced increase of surface staining was observed in cells transfected with the HA-A43 K216P mutant, but not with HA-A43 K216A. Consistent with these results, when we directly evaluated the release of soluble A43 by a sandwich ELISA of supernatants from COS-7 cells transfected with HA-A43 or HA-A43 K216P, at various time points, constitutive shedding of HA-A43, but not of HA-A43 K216P, was evident at every time point analyzed, from day 1 to 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate the absence of key particular MP sequences required for the proteolytic cleavage of A43, and suggest that mutation of lysine 216 to a proline may induce a conformational change resulting in impaired shedding of A43.</p>

<title>A43 binds with high affinity and slow dissociation kinetics to host 2B4</title>
<p>To study in more detail the interaction of A43 with 2B4, we generated an A43-Fc fusion protein, composed by the extracellular region of A43 fused to the Fc domain of the human IgG<sub>1</sub>. We first confirmed by flow cytometry the capacity of A43-Fc to bind host (<italic>Aotus trivirgatus</italic>) 2B4 by incubating increasing amounts of the fusion protein with COS-7 cells transiently transfected with host 2B4, using an expression vector encoding an N-terminal HA-tagged version of this receptor. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g003">Fig 3A</xref> (left graph), A43-Fc efficiently interacted, in a dose-dependent manner, with cell surface host 2B4. Indeed, the observed number of 2B4-transfected COS-7 cells binding A43-Fc (80.90%) was comparable to the percentage of COS-7 cells expressing 2B4 (85.19%) at the highest dose of A43-Fc evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, compare upper and bottom panels in the right). Next, we carried out surface plasmon resonance (SPR) kinetic analyses to quantify in real time the biochemical interaction of A43 and host 2B4. To this end, host 2B4-Fc fusion protein was immobilized in the sensor chip and the capacity to bind different concentrations of soluble A43-Fc was examined. In addition, host CD48-Fc was employed as a control, allowing us to compare the interaction of A43:host 2B4 with that of host CD48:host 2B4, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g003">Fig 3B</xref>. The binding kinetics revealed that A43 interacts with host 2B4 with an association rate (K<sub>a</sub>) of 1.16 x 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and a dissociation rate (K<sub>d</sub>) of 1.88 x 10<sup>−4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, yielding an equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 1.3 nM. These results evidenced a high affinity and stable interaction between A43 and host 2B4. When compared to control host CD48, the kinetic measurements were quite similar (K<sub>D</sub> of 3.3 nM), with A43 binding host 2B4 with a 2.4-fold higher affinity, and dissociating 2.6-times slower.</p>

<title>Host CD48:2B4 interaction is competed by A43</title>
<p>We next explored whether soluble A43 was able to block the host CD48:2B4 interaction. To directly prove this, we employed an ELISA assay, in which the host 2B4-Fc protein immobilized on the plate was exposed to increasing amounts of A43-Fc and subsequently incubated with biotinylated host CD48-Fc. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g004">Fig 4A</xref> (left graph), the A43-Fc protein markedly decreased the interaction of host CD48 to its countereceptor.

Moreover, we assessed whether this viral protein produced during infection was also capable to prevent the interaction of host CD48 with host 2B4. Notably, we found that A43 containing supernatants from infected cells also resulted in an efficient and dose-dependent inhibition of the binding of biotinylated host CD48-Fc to the host 2B4-Fc protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, right graph).</p>

<p>We further studied the ability of the A43-Fc fusion protein to compete the host 2B4:CD48 interaction when both receptors were expressed at the cell surface, by carrying out cell binding assays. We employed host EBV-transformed B lymphocytes, which express CD48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), and COS-7 cells transiently transfected with host 2B4. The binding of these B lymphocytes to host 2B4-expressing COS-7 cells or untransfected control COS-7 cells was assessed in the presence or absence of A43, by analyzing a number of fields under the light microscope. B lymphocytes showed a specific binding to host 2B4-expressing COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, compare panels a and b). Importantly, when the host 2B4<sup>+</sup> COS-7 cells were incubated with A43-Fc, a substantial decrease of the interaction between these cells and B lymphocytes was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, panel d), whereas this interaction was unaltered after treatment with an unrelated Fc protein (CTL-Fc; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, panel c). To quantitatively measure these effects, cell binding assays were performed using host B lymphocytes previously labelled with calcein, allowing the determination of the number of bound B cells by flow cytometry. As observed before, while the binding of B cells to COS-7 cells transfected with host 2B4 was not significantly affected by the presence of the control fusion protein, it markedly decreased after addition of A43-Fc, yielding an inhibition of around 60% of the host 2B4-induced binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that soluble purified A43 can impair the interaction between cells expressing host 2B4 and host CD48<sup>+</sup> cells.</p>

<title>A43 efficiently binds to human 2B4</title>
<p>We then decided to investigate whether A43 displayed cross-species receptor binding properties, by analyzing its interaction with human and mouse 2B4 (h2B4 and m2B4, respectively). To this end, COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the plasmid HA-A43 K216P, which allows high expression levels of A43 at the cell surface, were tested by flow cytometry in binding assays performed with the h2B4-Fc or m2B4-Fc fusion proteins. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g005">Fig 5A</xref> shows that while m2B4-Fc did not interact with A43, a strong binding activity of h2B4-Fc to the viral protein was observed. Human 2B4 is mainly expressed in NK cells, although it is also present at lower levels on other cytotoxic cells, such as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, γδ T cells, basophils, and eosinophils. Taking this in consideration, we evaluated the capacity of A43-Fc to bind different human cell lines constitutively expressing h2B4, either derived from NK cells (NK-92 and YT) or T lymphocytes (HSB2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). In these assays, COS-7 cells transiently transfected with h2B4 were used as a positive control, whereas the human T lymphoblast cell line MOLT-4 that does not express h2B4 and untransfected COS-7 cells were employed as negative controls. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, A43 displayed a clear reactivity with the four cell lines tested that expressed 2B4 (NK-92, YT, HSB2, and h2B4-transfected COS-7 cells), staining them at nearly the same extension than the h2B4 specific monoclonal antibody (mAb; compare MFI values in corresponding panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>).

<p>Target cell adhesion is an indispensable event for NK cell activation, and the 2B4:CD48 interaction has been shown to contribute to this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref025">25</xref>]. To evaluate the effects of A43 on NK cell adhesion, we performed cell binding assays using COS-7 cells transiently transfected with hCD48 and NK-92 cells. The binding of NK-92 cells to hCD48-expressing COS-7 cells or untransfected control COS-7 cells was determined in the presence or absence of A43, by examining a number of fields under the microscope. As expected, NK-92 cells exhibited a specific binding to hCD48-expressing COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, compare panels a and b). Rosettes of NK cells adhering to the cell surface of the COS-7 cells transfected with hCD48 could be observed. The specificity of this CD48-induced adhesion was further confirmed using a blocking anti-h2B4 mAb. In this case, binding abrogation to almost background levels (observed in COS-7 cells and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, panel a) was found upon preincubation of the NK-92 cells with the anti-h2B4 mAb, but not with an isotype control mAb (see panels c and d in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Notably, when NK-92 cells were exposed to A43-Fc, a marked reduced interaction between these cells and hCD48-transfected COS-7 cells was observed, with barely any visible rosette of NK-92 cells in the cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, panel f). In contrast, cell adhesion remained unaffected after incubation with an unrelated Fc protein (CTL-Fc; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, panel e). We then proceeded to quantitatively measure these effects by flow cytometry using NK-92 cells labelled with calcein. As observed before, while the binding of NK-92 cells to COS-7 cells transfected with hCD48 was not altered significantly after incubating the NK-92 cells with an unrelated fusion protein, it substantially decreased after addition of A43-Fc, resulting in an inhibition of around 50% of the hCD48-induced binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Again, the specificity of the binding, abrogating nearly 80% of the hCD48-induced adhesion, was proven with the mAb directed to h2B4. These data demonstrate that soluble A43 can function interfering with h2B4-mediated NK cell adhesion to target cells.</p>

<title>Soluble A43 blocks conjugate and the immune synapse formation between human NK cells and hCD48-expressing target cells</title>
<p>Formation of conjugates between NK and target cells is an important step required for efficient NK cell activation and subsequent cytolytic functions. We therefore examined the impact of the binding of soluble A43 to NK cells on conjugate formation. To this end, we transfected HEK cells with hCD48 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) and employed a flow cytometry-based assay that enabled to determine the frequency of the stable conjugates formed between these target cells and YT cells after being labelled with two distinct fluorophores (cell tracker for YT cells and CFSE for target cells). Conjugates were identified after co-incubating for 10 min these labelled cells in suspension as double fluorescent events. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, after this incubation time, the expression of CD48 on the surface of HEK cells conferred to these cells the ability to form conjugates with YT cells. Notably, exposure of the YT cells to A43-Fc, but not of an unrelated fusion protein, provoked a pronounced reduction of conjugate formation with hCD48-expressing HEK cells. As a control, the anti-h2B4 blocking mAb was also included in the assay and shown to drastically diminish the proportion of conjugates to levels comparable to those observed after incubation with HEK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Identical results were observed when the assays were conducted with NK-92 cells instead of YT cells, further confirming that the binding of A43 to h2B4 in NK cells severely affects their ability to form conjugates with target cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g007">Fig 7C</xref>).</p>

<p>Following the interaction of the NK cell with the target cell, the establishment of a highly stable immunological synapse is needed to ensure the directed release of perforin-granzyme granules toward the target cell. 2B4 has been shown to rapidly accumulate at the cell-cell contact site and participate in the formation of the lytic NK cell immune synapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref026">26</xref>]. Thus, we next assessed the potential of A43 to interfere with the establishment of the mature cytotoxic NK cell immune synapse. To investigate this, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy assays on conjugates established between YT cells and target HEK cells transfected with hCD48 or the corresponding empty plasmid and labelled with the cell tracker, using phalloidin and an anti-perforin mAb to visualize NK polymerized actin and cytotoxic granules, respectively. We examined the occurrence of three different stages in the progression of the formation of the functional NK cell lytic immune synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Stage 0, corresponding to conjugates in which actin and cytotoxic granules were not polarized toward the synapse. Stage 1, corresponding to conjugates in which polymerized actin, but not cytotoxic granules, accumulated at the synapse. And stage 2, corresponding to conjugates in which both polymerized actin and cytotoxic granules had reached the synapse. In this latter case, co-localization of phalloidin (actin) and perforin could be clearly visualized (right bottom panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). We first evaluated the ability of the YT cells to form an immune synapse with hCD48-transfected HEK cells as compared to control HEK cells, analyzing the same number of conjugates. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g008">Fig 8B</xref> (upper panel) shows an augmented proportion of conjugates exhibiting fully polarized granules (stage 2) upon expression of hCD48 on the surface of the target cells. This effect was associated with a concomitant decrease of conjugates in stage 0, lacking acting polymerization and granule polarization. These data are consistent with a role of hCD48 promoting the progression of the NK immune synapse. Remarkably, when YT cells were pre-treated with the A43-Fc protein, a clear decrease of conjugates with hCD48-transfected HEK cells in stage 2 was found as compared to those established by YT cells pre-incubated with an unrelated Fc fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, bottom panel). In conclusion, A43 inhibits the formation of the mature cytotoxic NK cell immune synapse.</p>

<title>Impairment of 2B4-dependent human NK cell cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production by soluble A43</title>
<p>We then investigated whether soluble A43 had functional consequences on NK cell-mediated lysis of target cells. We performed cytotoxicity assays using as effectors the YT cell line at various E/T ratios, and untransfected or hCD48-transfected HEK cells stained with calcein, as targets. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g009">Fig 9A</xref>, in these assays the killing displayed by the YT cells toward untransfected HEK cells was minimal. In contrast, the expression of hCD48 substantially stimulated killing of HEK cells by the YT cells at all the different ratios tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). We then assessed the effects of pre-treating YT cells with the A43 fusion protein or the anti-h2B4 mAb as a control. As expected, a drastic reduction of the cytotoxicity was observed when the NK cell receptor was masked with the anti-h2B4 mAb, confirming that NK cell-mediated lysis of hCD48-transfected HEK cells is h2B4 dependent. Remarkably, preincubation of the YT cells with the A43-Fc protein, but not with an unrelated Fc fusion protein, significantly inhibited NK-cell-mediated lysis at every E/T ratio tested in 3 independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). Similar results were obtained when employing the NK-92 cell line as effector cells, although in this case the base-line killing of these cells toward untransfected HEK cells was higher, slightly reducing the window in which to visualize the contribution of the h2B4-NK dependent lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). Of note, the blockade exerted by the viral protein did not require the pre-treatment of the NK cells with the A43-Fc protein, since when the viral protein was simultaneously added with the hCD48-expressing target cells to the effector cells, the h2B4-dependent NK cytotoxicity was inhibited at the same levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). To assess if reduced NK cytolytic functions by A43 were also associated with diminished NK cytokine production, we examined the ability of the YT cells to secrete IFN-γ during the 4h cytotoxicity assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g009">Fig 9D</xref>, the expression of hCD48 in HEK cells significantly enhanced IFN-γ secretion by YT cells as compared with the untransfected HEK cells. Furthermore, A43-Fc, but not the CTL-Fc protein, caused a profound decrease of the CD48-stimulated YT cell production of IFN-γ.</p>

<p>We also examined the ability of soluble A43 to functionally block primary human NK cells. To this end, and to avoid potential complications derived from the use of human Fc fusion proteins and the Fc receptors present on the surface of the primary NK cells, we constructed a new version of the A43-Fc fusion protein, named A43-Fc*, containing six specific residues of the Fc region mutated that abrogate its binding to Fc receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref027">27</xref>]. When examined by flow cytometry, A43-Fc*, but not an unrelated control Fc* fusion protein (CTL-Fc*), was capable to interact with the isolated primary blood NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g010">Fig 10A</xref>). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g010">Fig 10B</xref>, hCD48-transfected HEK cells were more susceptible to lysis by primary NK cells than untransfected HEK cells. Moreover, as it occurred in YT and NK-92 cells, a pronounced inhibition of the cytotoxicity was observed when the primary NK cells were preincubated with the A43-Fc* protein, but not with the CTL-Fc* protein, at the two different E/T ratio tested. In addition, treatment with A43-Fc* resulted in a significant and specific reduction of the hCD48-dependent NK cell production of IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g010">Fig 10C</xref>).</p>

<p>Due to the impossibility of obtaining host NK cells, and therefore in the absence of a cell system that allowed us to assess the activity of A43 on host NK cell functions, we analyzed if A43 was able to inhibit human NK cell cytotoxicity towards target cells expressing host CD48. For this purpose, we first confirmed by flow cytometry that YT cells could bind host CD48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g011">Fig 11A</xref>). Thereafter, we performed cytotoxicity assays employing as targets either HEK cells transfected with host CD48 or the immortalized host B lymphocytes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g011">Fig 11B</xref>, YT cell lysis was higher in host CD48-expressing HEK cells than in HEK cells. Importantly, a substantial and specific block of the h2B4-dependent NK cell killing was observed when the YT cells were treated with A43-Fc at the two E/T ratios analyzed. Moreover, comparable results were observed when the host B lymphocytes were used as targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g011">Fig 11C</xref>).

<title>The A43 protein secreted during viral infection reduces human NK cell killing against hCD48-expressing target cells</title>
<p>Lastly, we explored whether the viral A43 protein secreted during infection could also interfere with NK cell-mediated lysis. To this end, we measured YT or NK-92 cell-mediated cytotoxicity against hCD48-expressing HEK cells in the presence of the supernatant from OMCMV infected cells, using the supernatant from mock infected cultures as controls. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g012">Fig 12A</xref>, the supernatant from the OMK infected cells, but not from OMK mock-infected cells, led to a marked reduction of the 2B4-dependent YT and NK-92 cell-mediated killing at the two different E/T ratios evaluated. These observations were in corcordance with the specific ability of the infected culture supernatant to substantially inhibit the binding of hCD48-Fc to the two NK cell lines, in particular at the highest concentration evaluated, which was the one used in the cytotoxicity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g012">Fig 12B</xref>). Furthermore, to demonstrate that the viral A43 protein present in the supernatant fom the OMCMV infected cells was responsible of the blockade of the h2B4-dependent NK cell cytotoxicity, we depleted A43 from the supernatant of the infected cultures by pre-adsorbing it with the anti-A43 polyclonal antibody attached to beads. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007658.g012">Fig 12C</xref>, the supernatant from OMK infected cells depleted of A43 was not longer capable to decrease the h2B4-dependent YT cell-mediated killing.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Acquisition of host defense genes via horizontal gene transfer constitutes an important process by which CMVs develop new immunomodulatory strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref030">30</xref>]. The existence of different versions of several SLAM family receptors, including <italic>CD48</italic>, among CMV genomes indicates that the targeting of SLAM-mediated immune responses is evolutionarily advantageous for these pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref023">23</xref>]. Here, we have performed an in-depth functional analysis of the OMCMV encoded CD48 homolog A43, showing that it serves as a decoy molecule blocking 2B4-mediated NK cell cytotoxic responses.</p>
<p>Our assays demonstrate that <italic>A43</italic> is an immediate early gene that gives rise to a protein released from the infected cells within hours after infection. SPR assays indicated that soluble A43 binds to host 2B4 with high affinity and stability, exhibiting a K<sub>D</sub> of 1.3 nM, in a comparable way than its natural ligand (K<sub>D</sub> of 3.3 nM). In this sense, we must take into account that the N-terminal IgV-like domains of host CD48 and A43 are highly conserved (91% amino acid identity). All consensus residues of Ig superfamily members and those characteristic of SLAM family receptors are preserved in A43. Moreover, only one of the 14 amino acids of CD48 involved in the CD48:2B4 interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref031">31</xref>] has been substituted by a different residue in A43. This is especially relevant since it has been estimated that the CD48 gene from which A43 derives was captured 19 million years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref023">23</xref>]. This extraordinary degree of sequence preservation of the Ig domain, which contrasts with the substantial divergence of the rest of the A43 molecule, indicates a strong evolutionary pressure for mantaining its ligand binding specificity and affinity, in order to retain the properties most beneficial for viral survival.</p>
<p>We show that both, recombinant A43-Fc as well as the viral protein shed to the medium of tranfected or infected cells, prevent host CD48:2B4 interactions. Moreover, we present evidences that purified A43 can substantially reduce the interaction of host 2B4-transfected cells and host B lymphocytes that endogenously express CD48. Altogether, and taking into consideration the soluble nature of A43, these findings indicate that the viral protein serves as a decoy molecule, establishing a stable, long-lasting complex with 2B4 that prevents cytotoxic cells from recognizing its counter receptor CD48 on the surface of infected cells. Mammalian decoy receptors are soluble versions of cell surface receptors structurally incapable of signaling. They are able to down-modulate key biological functions by binding with high affinity and specificity to their ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref032">32</xref>]. Viruses, such as poxviruses and herpesviruses, encode in their genomes a number of secreted decoy receptors that target mainly cytokines and chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref035">35</xref>]. The function of A43 described here illustrates that secreted viral decoys can also target additional key molecules involved in the antiviral response.</p>
<p>Importantly, we report that A43 is also capable of binding to human 2B4. This is remarkable since the N-terminal Ig domains of human and host CD48 share only 63% identity. Indeed, we show that the purified A43-Fc fusion protein specifically binds to h2B4-transfected COS-7 cells, as well as to human NK and T cell lines that endogenously express h2B4. In addition, SRP assays revealed that soluble A43 interacts with surface-immobilized h2B4 with high affinity (K<sub>D</sub> 3.6 nM), in a similar way that it is observed for the interaction of the viral protein to host 2B4. However, in this case, when compared with hCD48, A43 was found to bind with a higher affinity (around 6-fold) to h2B4. Moreover, of particular relevance is the difference in the dissociation rates between A43:h2B4 and hCD48:h2B4 interactions, with A43 dissociating from h2B4 much slower than hCD48 (55-times). It should be pointed out, that the affinities reported here for hCD48:h2B4 interactions diverge with preexisting affinity data, which were in the low μM range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref004">4</xref>]. This discrepancy may be due to differences in the experimental conditions and/or in the biosensor platforms used.</p>
<p>Due to the impossibility of obtaining NK cells from the OMCMV host, the owl monkey <italic>A trivirgatus</italic>, the finding that A43 is capable of binding to human NK cells allowed us to assess A43 at the functional level. NK cell cytolytic responses against virally infected cells are determined by the balance of inhibitory and activating signaling pathways, with the 2B4 receptor contributing to this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref037">37</xref>]. Virtually all cytolytic NK cell responses depend on several coordinated steps, requiring a very first stage of contact between the NK cell and the potential target cell, with the implication of integrins, cytoskeletal proteins as well as NK cell receptors, followed by the formation of the immune synapse, sustained signaling, and directed delivery of lytic granules onto the target cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref038">38</xref>]. Engagement of 2B4 by CD48 on the NK cell leads to the initial scanning of target cells and the synapse formation, inducing its recruitment and clustering into lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref026">26</xref>]. Subsequently, the phosphorylation of the ITSMs in the 2B4 cytoplasmic tail induces its association with the adaptor molecule SAP, which enhances NK cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref041">41</xref>]. Here, we explored the function of A43 by employing a number of different assays. We provide evidence that NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against hCD48 expressing target cells is pronouncedly impeded when NK-92, YT cells or primary human NK cells are incubated with soluble purified A43 or supernatants from infected cells. In addition, we show that in the presence of A43, NK cell production of IFN-γ is severely impaired. Our data also indicate that by masking h2B4 in NK cells, the viral protein disrupts the formation of conjugates and the establishment of the mature immunological synapse between effector and target cells. Lastly, we also present data that demonstrate that soluble A43 can interfere with human NK cell-mediated lysis of host B lymphocytes, which endogenously express CD48, or host CD48-expressing HEK cells. Taking into account the IE kinetics of A43, we propose that this viral protein may provide a mechanism for rapid counteraction of innate responses soon after infection, reducing host control of viral replication.</p>
<p>The results obtained here further emphasize the important function of the CD48/2B4 axes in the antiviral response. We must consider that in addition to OMCMV, other CMVs and large DNA viruses encode vCD48s, and therefore have the potential to act as CD48 decoys or to block 2B4 responses in alternative ways. Interestingly, some E3 proteins of human adenoviruses, reported to share a very low homology with SLAM receptors, show a promiscuous binding to several cell-surface molecules, including 2B4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref042">42</xref>]. In addition, viral proteins can have the ability to interfere the CD48:2B4 axis by different mechanisms without interacting with 2B4; for example, by downregulating CD48 at the surface of the infected cell. Indeed, we have reported that MCMV, which encodes the early m154 protein responsible for driving proteolytic degradation of CD48, can lead to defective NK cell responses during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref021">21</xref>]. Consequently, an MCMV mutant lacking m154 results in an attenuated phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic>, which can be substantially restored after NK cell depletion in mice. Moreover, human CMV (HCMV) also uses in part this strategy, reducing CD48 surface levels on human macrophages, although in this case the viral protein causing these effects is not yet known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref043">43</xref>]. However, it must be noted that HCMV does not completely eliminate CD48 from the surface of infected cells, and consistent with this, blockade of 2B4 with a mAb inhibits only partially the human primary NK cell degranulation triggered by the infected macrophages. While HCMV does not encode a recognizable CD48 homolog, we cannot discard that it expresses a soluble protein that, in a similar way to A43, could contribute to block NK cell functions. This might not be surprising, taking into account that CMVs use diverse and redundant strategies to interfere with some of their immune targets. In this context, it seems that viruses have adopted different, and perhaps complimentary, tactics to modulate CD48:2B4 mediated effects.</p>
<p>Given that 2B4 is expressed on other immune cytotoxic cells, such as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, it is more than likely that A43 also has the capacity to interfere with their functions via a similar blocking mechanism to that reported here for NK cells. Thus, expression of A43 could be of particular importance for the viral evasion of both innate and adaptive immune surveillance.</p>
<p>Interestingly, CD48 has also been identified as a soluble form in human serum, and shown to be at increased levels in patients with arthritis, mild asthma, and advanced lymphoid malignancies, potentially acting as an antagonist or decoy receptor capable of blocking CD48:2B4 binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007658.ref046">46</xref>]. Thus, considering the exceptional binding kinetic features of A43 compared to human CD48, one key aspect derived from this work is the potential of using A43 to develop novel therapeutic tools to manipulate aberrant immune responses, such as autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>In summary, our work contributes a novel example of the potency of viral proteins to achieve immune modulation, in this case by counteracting the CD48/2B4 axis through a previously undescribed mechanism involving the direct blockade of 2B4.</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software (v.7.03) and Microsoft Excel (2010). Results are given as means ± standard deviations (SD) or as means ± standard errors of the means (SEM), and statistical significances were determined with the Student’s t-test (two-tailed). P-values less than or equal to 0.05 (*), 0.01 (**) and 0.001 (***) were considered statistically significant.</p>
