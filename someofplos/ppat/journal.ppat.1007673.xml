<abstract>
<p>Many plant bacterial pathogens including <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species, utilize the type III secretion system (T3SS) to deliver effector proteins into plant cells. Genes encoding the T3SS and its effectors are repressed in nutrient-rich media but are rapidly induced after the bacteria enter a plant or are transferred into nutrient-deficient media. To understand how the T3SS genes are regulated, we screened for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>savastanoi</italic> pv. <italic>phaseolicola</italic> (<italic>Psph</italic>) mutants displaying diminished induction of <italic>avrPto-luc</italic>, a reporter for the T3SS genes, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. A mutant carrying transposon insertion into a gene coding for a small functional unknown protein, designated as <italic>rhpC</italic>, was identified that poorly induced <italic>avrPto-luc</italic> in plants and in minimal medium (MM). Interestingly, <italic>rhpC</italic> is located immediately downstream of a putative metalloprotease gene named <italic>rhpP</italic>, and the two genes are organized in an operon <italic>rhpPC</italic>; but <italic>rhpP</italic> and <italic>rhpC</italic> displayed different RNA expression patterns in nutrient-rich King’s B medium (KB) and MM. Deletion of the whole <italic>rhpPC</italic> locus did not significantly affect the <italic>avrPto-luc</italic> induction, implying coordinated actions of <italic>rhpP</italic> and <italic>rhpC</italic> in regulating the T3SS genes. Further analysis showed that RhpC was a cytoplasmic protein that interacted with RhpP and targeted RhpP to the periplasm. In the absence of RhpC, RhpP was localized in the cytoplasm and caused a reduction of HrpL, a key regulator of the T3SS genes, and also reduced the fitness of <italic>Psph</italic>. Expression of RhpP alone in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> inhibited the bacterial growth. The detrimental effect of RhpP on the fitness of <italic>Psph</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> required metalloprotease active sites, and was repressed when RhpC was co-expressed with RhpP. The coordination between <italic>rhpP</italic> and <italic>rhpC</italic> in tuning the T3SS gene expression and cell fitness reveals a novel regulatory mechanism for bacterial pathogenesis. The function of RhpP in the periplasm remains to be studied.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The induction of the type III secretion system (T3SS) is of great importance to the pathogenesis of bacterial pathogens in host plants. <italic>Pseudomonas savastanoi</italic> pv. <italic>phaseolicola</italic> (<italic>Psph</italic>) causes halo blight disease on beans. We discovered that the bicistronic genes in the <italic>rhpPC</italic> locus of <italic>Psph</italic> act coordinately to regulate the T3SS gene expression, bacterial fitness, and pathogenicity. <italic>rhpP</italic> encodes a metalloprotease that can degrade the key T3SS regulator protein HrpL and reduce bacterial fitness. <italic>rhpC</italic> encodes a chaperone that inhibits the RhpP activity and mediates translocation of RhpP to the periplasm. The level of <italic>rhpP</italic> RNA is high in KB but decreases in MM, but the <italic>rhpC</italic> RNA is low in KB but increases in MM. The elevated <italic>rhpC/rhpP</italic> transcript ratio in MM plus the inhibition of RhpC on RhpP activity in cytoplasm provide double insurance that warrants high induction of the T3SS genes in MM and bacterial fitness. The coordination between <italic>rhpP</italic> and <italic>rhpC</italic> reveals a new mechanism regulating bacterial pathogenicity, and may provide an important target for controlling bacterial pathogens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens rely on the T3SS for successful infection of their hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref001">1</xref>]. The T3SS is encoded by a cluster of <italic>hrp/hrc</italic> genes that are essential for the induction of a hypersensitive response (HR) in resistant and nonhost plants and pathogenicity in susceptible plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref002">2</xref>]. The T3SS functions as a conduit to deliver an array of effector proteins into plant cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref003">3</xref>]. The effectors interfere with the host defense systems and contribute to bacterial pathogenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref004">4</xref>]. Some effectors elicit HR and disease resistance in plants containing cognate disease resistance genes, and are therefore named avirulence proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>The expression of <italic>hrp/hrc</italic> genes and the effector genes (together called T3SS genes hereafter) is coordinately regulated by various environmental and host factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref006">6</xref>]. T3SS genes are expressed at a very low level when grown in nutrient-rich medium, but quickly induced to high levels after the bacteria are infiltrated into plants or cultured in nutrient-deficient medium that is believed to resemble the environment of the plant intercellular spaces where the bacteria proliferate during infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s004">S1 Fig</xref>, the T3SS genes in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>syringae</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>savastanoi</italic> are activated by the extracytoplasmic function (ECF)-family alternate σ factor HrpL that recognizes a <italic>hrp</italic> box motif conserved in the promoters of many T3SS genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref011">11</xref>]. In turn, transcription of <italic>hrpL</italic> is controlled by a σ<sup>54</sup>-dependent promoter in an alternate σ factor RpoN-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref012">12</xref>]. Activation of <italic>hrpL</italic> also requires HrpR and HrpS, two homologous enhancer-binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref013">13</xref>]. The <italic>hrpR</italic> and <italic>hrpS</italic> genes are in the same operon proceeded by the <italic>hrpR</italic> promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref014">14</xref>]. HrpR and HrpS form a heterodimer that binds the <italic>hrpL</italic> promoter and induces <italic>hrpL</italic> transcription via interaction with the RpoN RNA polymerase holoenzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>The <italic>hrpRS</italic> operon is moderately expressed in KB and further induced in MM and in the plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref016">16</xref>]. A number of genes, including <italic>hrpA</italic>, <italic>aefR</italic>, and at least two two-component systems, <italic>gacAS</italic> and <italic>rhpRS</italic>, have been reported to regulate the transcription of the <italic>hrpRS</italic> operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref021">21</xref>]. <italic>hrpA</italic> encodes the T3SS pilus structural protein. Mutation of <italic>hrpA</italic> severely reduces the transcription of <italic>hrpRS</italic>, <italic>hrpL</italic> and T3SS genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref017">17</xref>]. AefR is a regulator of quorum sensing and epiphytic traits, and an <italic>aefR</italic> mutation reduces the <italic>hrpR</italic> promoter activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref018">18</xref>]. The GacAS system regulates multiple biological processes in various bacterial species, including motility, virulence, quorum sensing, and production of toxins, antibiotics, exopolysaccharides, and biofilms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref020">20</xref>]. A mutation in the response regulator gene <italic>gacA</italic> severely reduces the expression of <italic>hrpRS</italic> and the downstream cascade genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref020">20</xref>]. Thus far, the mechanisms by which HrpA, AefR, and GacAS regulate the <italic>hrpRS</italic> expression remain unknown. RhpRS was identified as a negative regulator of the T3SS genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref021">21</xref>]. The response regulator RhpR, upon phosphorylation, binds a putative inverted repeat motif in the <italic>hrpR</italic> promoter and represses <italic>hrpRS</italic> transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref022">22</xref>]. Dephosphorylation of RhpR reduces the binding affinity of RhpR to the <italic>hrpR</italic> promoter, and consequently the <italic>hrpRS</italic> promoter is de-repressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref023">23</xref>]. RhpS is a sensor kinase with dual activities. Under T3SS inducing conditions, RhpS presumably acts as a phosphatase that renders RhpR in the dephosphorylation state, which derepresses the <italic>hrpRS</italic> operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Another level of control of T3SS gene expression involves the stability of the HrpR protein, which is regulated by ATP-dependent protease Lon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref025">25</xref>]. In a <italic>lon</italic> mutant, HrpR is stabilized, which elevates the expression of downstream genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>The activity of HrpS is repressed by HrpV, a T3SS negative regulator that physically interacts with the HrpS protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref026">26</xref>]. HrpV-mediated repression can be suppressed by HrpG, a chaperone-like protein that interacts with HrpV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref027">27</xref>]. The interaction of HrpG with HrpV liberates HrpS from the HrpV-repression and consequently up-regulates the T3SS cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref027">27</xref>].</p>

<p><italic>avrPto</italic> is a <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> T3SS effector gene carrying a typical <italic>hrp</italic>-box promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref010">10</xref>]. In a previous study, we fused the <italic>avrPto</italic> promoter with the firefly luciferase gene <italic>luc</italic> in a broad host plasmid and constructed a reporter system for the T3SS gene expression in plants and MM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref028">28</xref>]. To identify bacterial genes regulating the T3SS gene expression in plants, we constructed a transposon insertion mutant library in a <italic>Psph</italic> NPS3121 strain carrying the <italic>avrPto-luc</italic> reporter gene and screened for mutants with diminished <italic>avrPto-luc</italic> induction in <italic>Arabidopsis att1</italic> plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref021">21</xref>]. <italic>att1</italic> was previously isolated by our group, and it supported several-fold higher induction of <italic>avrPto</italic> and <italic>hrpL</italic> promoters than did the wild type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref028">28</xref>]. <italic>att1</italic> plants provide a quick and sensitive reporter system for the assay of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> T3SS gene regulation in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref028">28</xref>]. The <italic>Psph</italic> NPS3121 strain is a non-host bacterium to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Col-0, and it does not multiply in the wild-type (WT) Col-0 and <italic>att1</italic> plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref029">29</xref>]. Using the <italic>avrPto-luc</italic> reporter and <italic>att1</italic> plants, we previously isolated a number of T3SS regulatory genes in the <italic>Psph</italic> NPS3121 strain, including <italic>aefR</italic>, <italic>rhpRS</italic>, <italic>hrpL</italic>, <italic>hrpR</italic>, and <italic>hrpS</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>One <italic>Psph</italic> mutant we identified carried a transposon insertion in PSPPH2198 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref030">30</xref>], which we later called <italic>rhpC</italic> because of its putative role as a molecular chaperone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007673.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The mutant showed reduced induction of <italic>avrPto-luc</italic> not only in the <italic>att1</italic> plant but also in MM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007673.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). A deletion mutant of <italic>rhpC</italic> (<italic>ΔrhpC</italic>) was subsequently constructed, and like the transposon insertion mutant, <italic>ΔrhpC</italic> also showed a reduction of the <italic>avrPto-luc</italic> activities in <italic>att1</italic> and MM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007673.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). When inoculated into the wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Col-0 plants, the <italic>ΔrhpC</italic> mutant also showed lower induction of <italic>avrPto-luc</italic> than did the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007673.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). The bacterial numbers of the wild-type <italic>Psph</italic> and the <italic>ΔrhpC</italic> mutant were similar and did not change clearly after inoculation into the Col-0 and <italic>att1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s005">S2 Fig</xref>). Therefore, the reduced <italic>avrPto-luc</italic> activity in the <italic>ΔrhpC</italic> mutant reflected the poor induction of the reporter gene in the plants. When inoculated into host bean plants, the <italic>ΔrhpC</italic> mutant displayed reduced bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007673.g001">Fig 1F</xref>) and disease symptoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007673.g001">Fig 1G</xref>).

<title>Characteristics of the <italic>rhpPC</italic> locus</title>
<p><italic>rhpC</italic> encodes a protein of 99 amino acid residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref030">30</xref>]. BlastP analysis identified homologous proteins of unknown function in a wide range of bacterial species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s006">S3 Fig</xref>). A cytoplasmic localization of the RhpC protein was predicted by both CELLO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref032">32</xref>] and PredictProtein (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://predictprotein.org/" xlink:type="simple">https://predictprotein.org/</ext-link>). This small protein has an acidic isoelectric point (pI = 4.73) and predominantly <italic>β</italic>-sheet and α-helical secondary structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s007">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>rhpC</italic> is 20 bp downstream of PSPPH2199 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007673.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). PSPPH2199 encodes a protein of 356 amino acid residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref030">30</xref>]. BlastP analysis indicated that PSPPH2199 belongs to the metalloprotease of the M4 family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref033">33</xref>]. We therefore named PSPPH2199 as RhpP.</p>
<p>RhpP homologues exist not only in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s008">S5 Fig</xref>) but also in a wide range of other bacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s009">S6 Fig</xref>). Proteins of this family have three Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding amino acid residues, including two histidine residues in the HEXXH motif and a unique glutamate residue toward the C-terminal from the motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref033">33</xref>]. Protein alignment indicated that these residues (His<sub>176</sub>, His<sub>180</sub> and Glu<sub>200</sub>) were all conserved in RhpP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s010">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s011">S8</xref> Figs). Additional residues at the RhpP active site were 146, 147, 173, 177, 191, 240, 241, and 279 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s010">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s011">S8</xref> Figs). Interestingly, all bacterial strains, except one (<italic>Desulfomonile tiedjei</italic> DSM 6799), that carry the RhpC homologue also carry the RhpP homologue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s008">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s009">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s011">S8</xref> Figs), and the two genes are arranged in the same manner as in the <italic>Psph</italic> strain, suggesting co-evolution of the <italic>rhpPC</italic> locus. However, many bacterial species, including the plant bacterial pathogens <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> and <italic>Pectobacterium</italic>, carry only the RhpP homologue without RhpC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s008">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s009">S6</xref> Figs).</p>

<p>The close proximity of <italic>rhpC</italic> and <italic>rhpP</italic> genes in the bacterial genome led us to test whether the two genes are co-transcribed into a polycistronic RNA.

<title>Deletion of <italic>rhpP</italic> diminished the negative effect of <italic>rhpC</italic> mutation on the T3SS gene induction and bacterial virulence</title>
<p>Polycistronic genes are often functionally related. To test whether <italic>rhpP</italic> and <italic>rhpC</italic> are related in function, deletion mutants of the whole <italic>rhpPC</italic> locus and <italic>rhpP</italic> were created by homologous recombination.

<p>Metalloproteases of the M4 family in bacterial pathogens are largely secreted to the extracellular milieu by their host bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref035">35</xref>]. We therefore examined whether RhpP was also a secreted protein. RhpP was FLAG-tagged at the C-terminus in the broad host vector pHM1 under a constitutive promoter and expressed in the wide-type <italic>Psph</italic> strain. The resulting bacterium was cultured in KB and MM. The bacterial cells and culture media were then separated by centrifugation, the protein in the culturing media was precipitated by TCA, and the presence of RhpP-FLAG was examined using the anti-FLAG antibody. PSPPH_1783, which is homologous to the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> out-secreted protein PlcN/PlcH through the type II secretion pathway, was used as the secretion control in KB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref036">36</xref>]. The T3SS effector AvrPto was used as a secretion control in MM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref037">37</xref>]. Unlike the control proteins that were detected in the culture media, no RhpP-FLAG protein was detected in KB or MM, even when 500 mL of culture medium was used for protein precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007673.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), indicating that RhpP was not secreted to the outside of the bacterial cells at the tested conditions.</p>
<p>Sequence analysis of RhpP did not predict a membrane localization signal. The other possible compartment for RhpP localization would be the cytoplasm or periplasm. We therefore separated the bacterial cells into periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions using osmotic shock. AmiC, a protein that is dispersed throughout the new-born cells and is secreted to the periplasm in divisional cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref038">38</xref>], was used to indicate the protein fractionation in periplasm. The cytoplasmic protein RpoA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref034">34</xref>] was used as control of protein fractionation in cytoplasm. Western blot analysis indicated that the RhpP protein was present in both the cytoplasm and the periplasm in the WT strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007673.g004">Fig 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>As RhpC inhibited the function of RhpP, we asked whether RhpC affects the localization of RhpP. We therefore introduced the <italic>pHM1</italic>::<italic>rhpP-FLAG</italic> plasmid into <italic>ΔrhpP</italic>, <italic>ΔrhpC</italic>, and <italic>ΔrhpPC</italic> mutants and examined the RhpP localization.

<p>We further tested whether RhpP translocation to the periplasm was through the general secretion pathway. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007673.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, mutations of <italic>gspD</italic> and <italic>gspE</italic> genes of the general secretion pathway did not affect the RhpP localization in the <italic>Psph</italic> strain.</p>

<title>RhpC physically interacts with RhpP and stabilizes RhpP in <italic>Psph</italic></title>
<p>The <italic>rhpP-FLAG</italic> gene expressed by the pHM1 plasmid under a constitutive promoter produced stronger protein signal in the WT <italic>Psph</italic> strain than in the <italic>ΔrhpC</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007673.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), suggesting that RhpC stabilized RhpP in the bacterium.

<title>The presence of RhpP alone reduces the accumulation of HrpL but not HrpR and HrpS proteins in <italic>Psph</italic></title>

<p>The reduced level of HrpL protein in the <italic>ΔrhpC</italic> mutant might have resulted from degradation of HrpL by RhpP. To test this possibility, we purified HrpL-FLAG and RhpP-FLAG using anti-FLAG affinity gel. The purified proteins were incubated together in PBS buffer, and the levels of HrpL-FLAG protein were examined after 3 h of incubation. In the presence of PBS buffer only, HrpL-FLAG was stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007673.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). However, the level of HrpL-FLAG was significantly reduced after incubation with RhpP-FLAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007673.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). The reduction of HrpL-FLAG was much suppressed when EDTA, a metalloprotease inhibitor, was added with RhpP-FLAG, or when HrpL-FLAG was incubated with RhpP<sup>H279T</sup>, a RhpP mutant of the protease active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007673.g006">Fig 6D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the search for genes regulating the T3SS genes in <italic>Psph</italic>, we identified the mutant of the <italic>rhpC</italic> gene with diminished T3SS gene induction and reduced pathogenicity in the host plant. <italic>rhpC</italic> is downstream of <italic>rhpP</italic> which encodes a putative metalloprotease. RhpC is a cytoplasmic protein that interacts with RhpP and facilitates the translocation of RhpP to the periplasm. The expression of RhpP alone in <italic>Psph</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> inhibited bacterial growth, and the inhibition was abolished by mutation of the conserved protease activity sites, suggesting that RhpP alone is an active protease in the bacterial cytoplasm. Purified recombinant RhpP protein can degrade HrpL <italic>in vitro</italic>, further showing RhpP as an active protease. The <italic>ΔrhpC</italic> mutant exhibited a reduced level of HrpL protein, the direct regulator of the T3SS genes. The reduction in HrpL was consistent with the reduced T3SS gene induction in the <italic>ΔrhpC</italic> mutant. Interestingly, the <italic>ΔrhpC</italic> mutant did not show a reduction in the HrpS and HrpR protein levels, suggesting that RhpP has substrate specificity. Nonetheless, HrpL is unlikely to be the only substrate for RhpP in the <italic>Psph</italic> cytoplasm, because <italic>hrpL</italic><sup>-</sup> mutant did not show any growth defect in KB and MM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref039">39</xref>]. In addition, RhpP probably degraded the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> proteins as well because expression of the RhpP-MBP recombinant protein in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> caused a severe growth defect, and the detrimental effect in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> required the protease active sites of RhpP. The reduced growth of the <italic>ΔrhpC</italic> mutant in the host plants was likely the result of reduced T3SS gene expression plus the reduced fitness of the bacterial cells.</p>
<p>Protein localization analysis revealed that, in the WT <italic>Psph</italic> strain, an RhpP protein of the same size was present in the cytoplasm and the periplasm but not in the culture medium. This is different from the known RhpP homologues such as thermolysin from <italic>Bacillus thermoproteolyticus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref040">40</xref>], elastase from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref041">41</xref>], Prt1 in <italic>Pectobacterium cratovorum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref042">42</xref>], and many other M4 metalloproteases from other bacteria, which are all secreted proteins to extracellular milieu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref045">45</xref>]. These extracellular proteases are encoded as inactive preproproteases with an N-terminal signal peptide that is followed by a propeptide and a catalytic domain. The signal peptides mediate the translocation of these preproproteases through the Sec pathway to periplasm, where the signal peptides are removed by the periplasmic-localized signal peptidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref043">43</xref>]. Immediately following the signal peptides are propeptides which are also called intramolecular chaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref043">43</xref>]. Propeptides assist in the folding of the catalytic domains into active conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref045">45</xref>]. Upon the completion of protein folding, propeptides are cleaved either by autoprocessing or with the help of other proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref044">44</xref>]. The cleaved propeptide stays in contact with the catalytic domain, which stabilizes the substrate protein, prevents premature activation of the protease, and facilitates translocation of the protease through the outer membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref047">47</xref>]. Alignment of RhpP with the out-secreted M4 metalloproteases showed a conserved C-terminal catalytic domain preceded by an N-terminal peptide of 67 amino acid residues. SignalP analysis did not find a signal peptide for the Sec pathway in the N-terminal sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s014">S11 Fig</xref>). The propeptide sequences presented in the known M4 metalloproteases were not found in RhpP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s010">S7 Fig</xref>). Consistently, mutations of the general secretion pathway genes <italic>gspD</italic> and <italic>gspE</italic> did not block the translocation of RhpP to the periplasm.</p>
<p>Characterization of <italic>rhpC</italic> led us to propose that RhpC is a specific chaperone for RhpP. First, in almost all sequenced bacterial genomes carrying an RhpC homologue, the <italic>rhpC</italic> homologous gene is always coupled by the <italic>rhpP</italic> homologous gene, suggesting co-evolution of the two genes. Second, RhpC is a small cytoplasmic protein (molecular mass = 11 kDa) with a relatively low isoelectric point and a C-terminal helical structure. These characteristics are also shared by many other chaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref049">49</xref>]. In addition, RhpC is required for RhpP protein stability and translocation from the cytoplasm to the periplasm. The presence of RhpC inhibited the RhpP protease activity and the detrimental effect of RhpP on bacterial fitness, suggesting that RhpC is required for the proper function of RhpP. The interaction of RhpC with RhpP in the protein pull-down assay provided further evidence that RhpC is the chaperone of RhpP. Based on these characteristics, RhpC appears to be a functional mimic of prepropeptides of the out-secreted metalloproteases. Although RhpC can inhibit the protease activity of RhpP, mutations of the protease active sites (His<sub>176</sub>, Glu<sub>177</sub>, His<sub>180</sub>, and His<sub>279</sub>) in RhpP did not abolish the interaction with RhpC, suggesting that these active sites are probably not at the RhpC-interacting surface. These RhpP mutant proteins were also translocated to the periplasm in the presence of RhpC. It is possible that the RhpC interaction changes RhpP to an inactive conformation that is compatible with the translocation through the bacterial inner membrane.</p>
<p>Gram-negative bacteria have five classes of protein secretion systems spanning both the inner membrane and the outer membrane that deliver cytoplasmic proteins to the outside of the bacterial cell, including type I secretion system (T1SS), T2SS, T3SS, T4SS, and T6SS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref050">50</xref>]. However, only two classes of protein transporters have been reported that span the inner membrane and deliver proteins to the periplasm, including the Sec apparatus and the Tat system (twin-arginine translocation system) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref051">51</xref>]. The involvement of the Sec pathway in RhpP translocation was ruled out because deletion of <italic>gspE</italic> (<italic>secE</italic>) did not block the RhpP translocation to the periplasm. Proteins targeting to the Tat machinery usually have signal peptides that contain a conserved twin-arginine motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007673.ref051">51</xref>]. TatP analysis predicted a low Tat-targeting signal and a peptide cleavage site between A<sub>49</sub> and R<sub>50</sub> in the N-terminus of RhpP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s015">S12 Fig</xref>). However, the same molecular weight of RhpP detected by Western blot in cytoplasm and periplasm did not support the cleavage of the signal peptide. Because RhpC interacts with RhpP and is required for RhpP translocation, we wondered if RhpC has a signal peptide for the Tat system and carries RhpP to the Tat system in a "piggy-back" manner. However, we did not find the twin-arginine signal peptide in RhpC. Instead, we found significant similarity between RhpC and TatB of the Tat system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s016">S13 Fig</xref>). The functional significance of this sequence similarity is unknown. Whether RhpP passes through the cytoplasmic membrane through the Tat system remains to be investigated.</p>
<p>Real-time PCR analysis indicated that the <italic>rhpPC</italic> locus is subjected to complex regulation in response to nutrient conditions. This locus is transcribed not only into <italic>rhpPC</italic> polycistronic RNA but also into discrete <italic>rhpC</italic> RNA. The <italic>rhpP</italic> (or <italic>rhpPC</italic>) RNA is more abundant in KB than in MM, opposite to <italic>rhpC</italic> that is expressed at a higher level in MM than in KB. The ratio of <italic>rhpC</italic>/<italic>rhpP</italic> transcripts is also much higher in MM than in KB. Given the facts that RhpP in cytoplasm can degrade the HrpL protein and that the RhpP protease activity can be repressed by RhpC, we propose that the reduced <italic>rhpP</italic> transcripts and induced <italic>rhpC</italic> transcripts in MM serve as double protection that restricts the detrimental RhpP activity to a minimal level in the cytoplasm, which in turn secures the high induction of the T3SS genes. It is worthwhile to mention that the negative regulation of RhpP on the T3SS gene induction is obvious only when RhpC is absent, because deletion of the <italic>rhpPC</italic> locus did not significantly change the induction of <italic>avrPto-luc</italic> in the plant and MM. Thus, it is the coordination between <italic>rhpP</italic> and <italic>rhpC</italic> that plays a critical role in regulating the T3SS gene induction. It appears that RhpC, as a chaperone, keeps the function of RhpP under control in the cytoplasm by inhibiting the RhpP protease and facilitating its translocation to the periplasm. RhpP may play an important role in periplasmic protein quality control by degrading the functionally abnormal proteins of bacterium or imported peptides from environment. We conducted a preliminary analysis to compare the proteomes of the wild-type <italic>Psph</italic> and <italic>ΔrhpC</italic> strains, which revealed ~30 periplasmic proteins that were &gt;1.5 fold more abundant in the <italic>ΔrhpC</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007673.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Most of these periplasmic proteins are ABC transporters involved in transportation of various small molecules. Whether any of these differentially expressed proteins are direct substrates of RhpP remains to be studied. Nonetheless, the presence of RhpP protein in the periplasm and cytoplasm in the wild-type <italic>Psph</italic> strain implies that the regulation of T3SS genes is coordinated with the periplasmic activities. RhpC plays a key role in protecting the T3SS regulation pathway and bacterial fitness from the detrimental effect of RhpP by directly inhibiting the RhpP protease activity in bacterial cytoplasm and targeting RhpP to the periplasm. The coordination of the two-component <italic>rhpPC</italic> module represents a novel mechanism underlying the fine regulation of T3SS genes in response to growth conditions.</p>
