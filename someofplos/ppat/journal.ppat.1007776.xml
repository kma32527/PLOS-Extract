<abstract>
<p>VRC01 protects macaques from vaginal SHIV infection after a single high-dose challenge. Infusion of a simianized anti-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> mAb (Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>) just prior to, and during repeated vaginal exposures to SIVmac251 partially protected macaques from vaginal SIV infection and rescued CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. To investigate the impact of combining VRC01 and Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> on SHIV infection, 3 groups of macaques were treated with a suboptimal dosing of VRC01 alone or in combination with Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> or with control antibodies prior to the initiation of weekly vaginal exposures to a high dose (1000 TCID<sub>50</sub>) of SHIV<sub>AD8-EO</sub>. The combination Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>-VRC01 significantly delayed SHIV<sub>AD8-EO</sub> vaginal infection. Following infection, VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>-treated macaques maintained higher CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts and exhibited lower rectal SIV-DNA loads compared to controls. Interestingly, VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>-treated macaques had fewer IL-17-producing cells in the blood and the gut during the acute phase of infection. Moreover, higher T cell responses to the V2-loop of the SHIV<sub>AD8-EO</sub> envelope in the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group inversely correlated with set point viremia. The combination of suboptimal amounts of VRC01 and Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> delayed infection, altered antiviral immune responses and minimized CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell loss. Further exploration of the effect of combining bNAbs with Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> on SIV/HIV infection and antiviral immune responses is warranted and may lead to novel preventive and therapeutic strategies.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) constitute a promising new strategy to prevent and/or treat HIV-1 acquisition. However, it is clear that individual bNAbs cannot be used alone as a single intervention. α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> blockade with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) similar to a drug approved for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has shown promising results against SIV infection in non-human primate studies. In the current study, we report the impact of combining the bNAb VRC01, currently in clinical testing for HIV-1 prevention, with the anti-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> mAb on delaying infection of macaques with a pathogenic simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV). We found that the VRC01/anti-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> combination was able to significantly delay SHIV acquisition when compared with the control group, but not when compared with pretreatment with VRC01 alone. Moreover, after infection, the animals pretreated with the VRC01/anti-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> combination had higher CD4 counts compared to the other treatment groups and lower amounts of virus in the gut compared to the control group. Moreover, important differences were present between the groups in the immune response to the virus in blood and mucosal tissues. More studies are needed to explore the potential synergistic effects of combining bNAbs with the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> blockade for the prevention and therapy of HIV-1 infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Integrin α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> (α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>) is expressed at high levels by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells trafficking to the gut associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref003">3</xref>], a critical site for HIV-1 replication and dissemination after transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref007">7</xref>]. α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub><sup>high</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are highly susceptible to HIV-1 infection and are preferentially depleted during acute HIV-1 and SIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref010">10</xref>]. Higher frequencies of α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub><sup>high</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have been correlated with increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection in humans and SIV infection in macaques and with disease progression in both humans and macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref012">12</xref>]. The higher risk of HIV-1 acquisition due to prevalent HSV-2 infection has also been associated with increased levels of α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref015">15</xref>]. Targeting α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> with a simianized anti-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> monoclonal antibody (Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>; mAb) prior to and during a vaginal repeated low-dose challenge (RLDC) study in rhesus macaques prevented SIV acquisition in half of the animals and delayed disease progression in those animals that did become infected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref016">16</xref>]. Reportedly, simultaneous treatment with Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> and cART led to sustained viral control after cessation of all forms of therapy in at least one model of SIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref017">17</xref>]. The mechanism(s) underlying the anti-HIV-1 activity of the Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> mAb are poorly understood. Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> does not block viral entry into CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and has weak anti-HIV-1 activity <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref019">19</xref>]. We have recently shown that signaling through α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> can promote HIV-1 replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref020">20</xref>] and, in this regard, we previously demonstrated that Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> blocks α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> from adopting an active conformation that is critical for this signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition, we determined that Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> selectively alters trafficking of CCR6<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to mucosal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref022">22</xref>] and impacts the antibody response to SIV infection when given in combination with cART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref017">17</xref>]. Thus, interference with both immune cell trafficking and α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>-driven viral amplification may, at least in part, explain the decrease in gut tissue SIV loads when Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> is administered prior to, and throughout the acute phase of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Passive transfer of a number of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting HIV-1 envelope (Env) has been shown to protect rhesus macaques against a single high-dose inoculation with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref027">27</xref>] and this strategy is currently being evaluated to prevent HIV-1 acquisition in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref028">28</xref>]. In particular, VRC01, a bNAb against the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) on the HIV-1 envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref030">30</xref>], is the first bNAb to be investigated clinically for the prevention of HIV-1 infection in adult men and women (AMP trial; NCT02716675 and NCT02568215). Moreover, VRC01 is being tested for safety in HIV-exposed infants (NCT02256631) as a potential agent to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1. In preclinical studies, VRC01 protected monkeys against single high-dose vaginal and rectal SHIV challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref027">27</xref>] and its protective activity against repeated low-dose rectal challenges decreases after several weekly challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref031">31</xref>]. In this regard, bNAb protection against repeated rectal challenges was shown to be dependent on the potency and half-life of bNAbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref031">31</xref>]. A mutation in the Fc domain of the antibody, which was shown to increase VRC01 half-life in both plasma and tissues, increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref032">32</xref>] and prolonged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref031">31</xref>] its protective activity. Several other strategies to improve the pharmacokinetics and function of bNAbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref028">28</xref>] as well as the use of combinations of bNAbs or bi- and trispecific antibody-based molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref035">35</xref>] are being tested with the ultimate goal of generating new prevention and therapeutic options against HIV-1 infection.</p>
<p>In the present study, we investigated the combination of VRC01 and Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> in a repeated vaginal challenges model using the tier 2 SHIV<sub>AD8-EO</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref036">36</xref>]. This challenge virus was chosen for its multiple properties typical of pathogenic HIV-1 isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref037">37</xref>], allowing us to explore the impact of the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> combination on SHIV<sub>AD8-EO</sub> infection and antiviral immune responses during the acute and early chronic phase of infection. In order to detect an effect of this combination over the sterilizing protective effect of VRC01, we chose a repeated challenges model of infection and treatment with suboptimal amounts of both antibodies. The VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> combination significantly delayed SHIV<sub>AD8-EO</sub> acquisition, protected blood CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and altered antiviral immune responses.</p>

<title>The VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> combination significantly delays SHIV<sub>AD8-EO</sub> vaginal infection</title>
<p>VRC01 has been shown to provide sterilizing protection against high-dose vaginal challenge with SHIV<sub>SF162P3</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref038">38</xref>]. In order to study the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> combination in a setting of suboptimal VRC01 protection we employed an inoculum 100 fold higher and half the dose of VRC01 (10 mg/kg) that resulted in delayed SHIV<sub>AD8-EO</sub> acquisition for a median of 8 weeks in a repeated rectal low-dose challenge model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref031">31</xref>]. A VRC01-alone group was used to monitor baseline VRC01 protection.</p>
<p>A total of 27 animals were infused with VRC01 (10 mg/kg) and Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> (25 mg/kg; n = 9) or with 10 mg/kg of VRC01-alone (n = 9) or with control human and rhesus IgGs (n = 9), 3 days before weekly vaginal challenges with a high-dose inoculum of SHIV<sub>AD8-EO</sub> (1000 TCID<sub>50</sub>) until all animals became infected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> infusions were repeated every 3 weeks for a total of 6 infusions. A Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>-alone group was not included because Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> does not protect from high-dose challenge[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref039">39</xref>] and the levels of VRC01 rapidly decrease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref027">27</xref>]. Thus, the impact of Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> on SHIV-AD8 infection can be inferred from comparison with the VRC01-only and control groups.</p>

<p>The peak concentrations of VRC01 on the day of the first challenge in the VRC01-only group and in the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group were 98.31 ± 25.83 μg/ml and 97.66 ± 55.29 μg/ml (mean±SD), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Of note, for reasons that may be attributed to problems during the infusion, 2 macaques in the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group had peak concentrations of VRC01 at the time of the first challenge about 10 fold lower than the mean and below the protective concentration against SHIV<sub>SF162P3</sub> high-dose challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref038">38</xref>]. (KT57: 19.145 μg/ml and GH63: 3.350 μg/ml; respectively green and orange in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Thus, these 2 animals were excluded from the SHIV acquisition analysis (they acquired infection at the first challenge, as if VRC01 was absent), but not from all other post-infection analysis since VRC01 levels were undetectable in all animals by week 6 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). These 2 animals were not outliers in any post-infection analysis of immunological and virological parameters. Consistent with previous studies, antibodies against VRC01 (ADA) developed around week 3 after infusion in all VRC01-treated animals and levels were similar in both treatment groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007776.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The peak concentration of Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> in the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group at the time of the first challenge was 112 ± 37μg/ml (mean ± SD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g001">Fig 1C</xref>; 1 animal with peak concentrations 10 times higher than the average of the other animals was excluded from the calculation of this mean). None of the animals had plasma Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> concentrations below the expected range and all 9 animals were included in the analysis of the impact of the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> combination on acute and early infection parameters.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, all 9 animals in the control group became viremic after 1 to 5 challenges (median of 2 weekly exposures required for infection). The viral inoculum, as calculated by the infectivity in the control group, was 0.86 AID<sub>50</sub>.</p>
<p>Suboptimal dosing of VRC01 resulted in a non-significant delay in SHIV acquisition (Log-rank p = 0.074). In contrast, in the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> combination treatment, it was possible to detect a significant delay in SHIV acquisition compared to the control group (Log-rank p = 0.016; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). However, the median number of challenges needed to infect in the two treatment groups was similar (n = 4) and the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> combination did not significantly delay acquisition compared to VRC01 alone (Log-rank p = 0.601). Of note, when the cumulative challenges to infect were compared using the Poisson exact test, none of the comparisons was statistically significant (VRC01-alone vs control p = 0.202; VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> vs control p = 0.335; VRC01-alone vs VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> p = 0.804). Moreover, no statistical difference was noted between the groups in the intention-to-treat analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007776.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>FcγRs polymorphisms did not correlate with SHIV acquisition in either of the treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007776.s003">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007776.s004">S4</xref> Figs lists all FcγRs polymorphisms) no effect of FcγRs polymorphisms was noted in any other post-infection analysis. Peak plasma viral load (VL) did not significantly differ either between the treatment groups or when comparing the treatment groups with the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g001">Fig 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007776.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Set-point VL was ~1 Log<sub>10</sub> lower in the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group compared with the other 2 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). However, the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.072 at week 18 p.i.). Confirming previous reports on the effects of Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref040">40</xref>], peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were protected and CD4 counts were significantly higher in the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> when compared with the other 2 groups (treatment adjusted for time; 2-way Anova p = 0.005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). This is at least partially due to Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>-driven lymphocytosis, as we demonstrated in naïve macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref022">22</xref>], and explains the higher baseline CD4 count of the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group.</p>
<p>Although gut SIV DNA loads were slightly higher in both treatment groups compared with controls at week 3–4 p.i. (2–3 weeks after 1<sup>st</sup> virus detection in plasma), by week 20 p.i., VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> treated animals had more than 10-fold lower amounts of cell-associated SIV DNA in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). SIV RNA loads in the GI tract of the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> treated animals were also 100 times lower, on average, than in the control group during the post-acute phase (week 7–8 p.i.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). However, by week 20 p.i. several animals in the control group had undetectable SIV-RNA levels in the GI tract and the difference with the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> lost its significance. Interestingly, no significant differences in SIV loads were found by directly comparing the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> combination group and the VRC01-alone group and the SIV loads in the VRC01-only group often averaged between the other 2 groups. Vaginal SIV DNA and RNA loads did not differ in the acute nor in the early chronic phase of the infection among the treatment groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007776.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Finally, although the SIV-DNA loads at necropsy (around 20 weeks p.i.) were on average slightly lower in the jejunum and iliac lymph nodes of the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group compared with the other 2 groups, the differences were not significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007776.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). No differences were detected in other tissues and lymph nodes at necropsy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007776.s007">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> decreases IL-17-producing cells in acute infection and increases IFN-γ-producing cells in the chronic phase</title>
<p>Mononuclear cells isolated from blood and colorectal biopsies in the acute phase of infection (week 3–4 p.i.) and from ileum, jejunum and colorectal tissue at necropsy (chronic phase) were stimulated with PMA/ionomycin to determine the frequency of IL-17 (acute and chronic phase samples) and IFN-γ, IL-2, TNFα and IL-21-producing cell subsets (chronic phase samples). T lymphocytes and NK cells were analyzed since they express high levels of α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> and thus, they may be directly impacted by Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref022">22</xref>]. Moreover, bNAbs’ activity may be driven, at least in part, by NK-mediated ADCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> treated animals had significantly lower frequencies of IL-17 producing CD4<sup>-</sup> T cells in blood and of IL-17 producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD3<sup>-</sup> NKp44<sup>+</sup> NK cells in the colorectal tissue compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>; gating in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007776.s008">S8 Fig</xref> and baseline frequencies in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007776.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). For these subsets, the difference did not reach significance when compared with the VRC01-only group. However, the frequency of IL-17-producing NKG2A<sup>+</sup> NK cells in blood was significantly lower in the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group compared with the VRC01-only group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007776.s008">S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007776.s009">S9</xref> Figs).

No significant differences in IL-17, IL-2, TNFα and IL-21-producing cells were noted in these tissues in the chronic phase of infection.</p>

<p>Interestingly, when we investigated how the treatments had impacted immune cells in the lymph nodes at necropsy, we found that the VRC01-only group had a lower frequency of CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells (both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>-</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g004">Fig 4</xref>) compared with the control group. Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> in the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> may have interfered with this decrease since the difference was not significant between the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group and the controls. Moreover, we found that the VRC01-treated animals had lower frequencies of CXCR3/CCR6 double positive CD4<sup>-</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compared with both the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> and the control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>).

<title>T cell responses in the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> are primarily directed against the V2-loop of the SHIV<sub>AD8-EO</sub> envelope protein</title>
<p>Blood T cell responses were analyzed against pooled 15-mer overlapping peptides from the consensus B envelope and Gag proteins around week 18 post-infection. Interestingly, T cell responses against the envelope peptides in the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group were virtually undetectable and significantly lower than the T cell responses in the control group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007776.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). T cell responses in the VRC01 group were more similar to the control group, but the difference between the VRC01-only and VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> groups reached statistical significance only for TNFα and IL-22-secreating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007776.s011">S11A Fig</xref>). The responses to Gag peptides were generally lower than those to the envelope peptides at this stage of infection in all groups and differences between groups could not be determined.</p>
<p>We previously reported that the V2 loop of gp120 mediates high affinity binding to α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref043">43</xref>]. Since the sequence of the consensus B envelope differs substantially from the sequence of the SHIV<sub>AD8-EO</sub> envelope in the V1V2 region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007776.s012">S12 Fig</xref>) and a specific response against the V2-loop was found in the Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>-treated animals of the cART-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref017">17</xref>], we synthetized seven 20-mer, 14aa overlapping peptides spanning the V1V2 region that differs between the SHIV<sub>AD8-EO</sub> and the consensus B envelope and used them to probe T cells and antibody responses. Interestingly, the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> macaques had higher frequencies of IFN-γ-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in response to the V1V2 peptide pool than both the VRC01 and control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In contrast, TNFα-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and IFN-γ-producing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were higher in both treatment groups compared with the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). A higher IL-17 response in the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell subset was also noted in the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Finally, a higher frequency of TNF-α-CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was present in the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group compared with the VRC01-only group. In summary, higher T cell responses were detected against the V1V2 loop in the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group particularly compared to control animals. Interestingly, the frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells secreting TNF-α in response to the V1V2 peptides inversely correlated with viral load (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007776.s013">S13 Fig</xref>), suggesting a possible role played by V1V2 responses in controlling viral replication in the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>bNAbs are being tested in the clinic for the prevention and therapy of HIV-1 infection. VRC01 is the first to reach efficacy testing and other bNAbs will soon follow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref045">45</xref>]. However, it is clear that individual bNAbs cannot be used alone as a single intervention. Combinations of more bNAbs or bi- or tri-specific molecules need to be employed to achieve better and more durable protection from HIV-1 acquisition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref046">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref048">48</xref>]. Moreover, recent data suggest that bNAbs treatment may impact immune responses to infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref051">51</xref>]. This feature represents a potential new therapeutic approach toward an HIV-1 cure. Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> has also demonstrated the ability to partially prevent SIV infection in macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref016">16</xref>] and treatment of SIV infected macaques with Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> in combination with cART has shown its potential utility in inducing long-term control of SIV replication without eradicating the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref017">17</xref>]. Nonetheless, much more needs to be understood about the ability of bNAbs and α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>-blockage to impact immune responses against SIV/HIV.</p>
<p>The present study represents the first investigation of the combination of a bNAb and Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>. We aimed to determine how this dual-treatment might alter key features of acute and early-chronic infection, including antiviral immune responses. In order to observe such effects beyond the powerful protective activity of VRC01, we performed the study in a setting of suboptimal amounts of VRC01 against repeated challenges with a relatively high viral inoculum (compared to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref031">31</xref>]) of a pathogenic SHIV. By design, we challenged the animals until all acquired infection with the dual aim in mind of determining the impact on SHIV acquisition and investigate the immunomodulatory effect of the antibodies on acute infection. Unfortunately, the lack of an Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>-alone group precluded a thorough assessment of the effects of Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> on susceptibility and acute infection parameters to compare with previous studies in other macaque models of HIV[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref040">40</xref>]. Moreover, although very low to undetectable concentrations of VRC01 were present during the acute phase of the infection, it is difficult to ascertain the contribution of Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> to the post-infection differences noted between the treatment groups. Finally, the exclusion of 2 macaques due to technical issues with VRC01 infusion from the acquisition analysis, but not from the post-infection analysis is a limitation of the study. It was justified given that all the animals had very low plasma VRC01 levels at the post-infection time points analyzed and none were outliers. Nonetheless, their exclusion from all the analysis may have been more correct.</p>
<p>Overall, more studies are needed to determine if and how Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> may increase the protective activity of suboptimal dosing of bNAbs. The protective effect of the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> combination was not significantly higher than the VRC01-alone group. However, excluding the two animals in the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group that exhibited extremely low levels of plasma VRC01, the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> combination was able to significantly delay infection in our model in contrast to the VRC01 alone treatment group. Since a decrease in CCR6<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in mucosal tissues is one of the major effects of the Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> in naïve macaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref022">22</xref>], the small effect that the Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> had on SHIV<sub>AD8OE</sub> acquisition may be explained, in part, by a decreased availability of this important cell target (CCR6<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) at the mucosal portal of entry. A similar mechanism may have been at play in the protection shown by the Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> against LDC with SIVmac251 in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref016">16</xref>]. The smaller protective effect of the Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> may be due to the substantially higher inoculum used in our study compared to Byrareddy et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref016">16</xref>]. The inoculum we used corresponded to 0.86 AID<sub>50</sub> compared to less than 0.2 AID<sub>50</sub> used in Byrareddy et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref016">16</xref>], and it was ~10 fold higher based on in vitro TCID<sub>50</sub> (determined concurrently in our laboratory on both stocks) and ~300 fold higher based on p27 content. The higher inoculum may have lowered the transmission bottleneck, decreasing the relative importance of target cell availability for infection. Larger studies with a more physiologically relevant, low-dose viral challenge model will be needed to precisely quantify the incremental effect of combining Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> and VRC01 over VRC01 on SHIV acquisition.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we were able to determine that some of the effects of the Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> that were previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref040">40</xref>] are retained by the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> combination in our SHIV model. They include the ability to protect circulating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, a modest effect on the viral set-point and a decrease in the gut viral load. However, we did not find a decrease viral load in any other tissue or lymph nodes as it was described for the Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>-alone in the SIV model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref023">23</xref>]. Protection of the CD4 counts may be due to a small, non-significant effect on chronic plasma viremia with the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007776.g001">Fig 1F</xref>), in addition to the reduced gut viremia and the lymphocytosis effect of the Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, most of the differences that we noted are significant only when the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group is compared with the control group and the data from the VRC01-only group fell in between. This suggests that the presence of minimal quantities of VRC01 at the time of infection may have increased the impact of Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> on virologic and immune parameters, hinting at the possibility of a synergistic effect of the two antibodies. Nonetheless, the lack of Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>-alone group precludes the systematic evaluation of a synergistic activity and this, also, will require further investigation.</p>
<p>Of note, we found that during the acute phase of infection (which coincided with the Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>-treatment) the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group had a lower frequency of IL-17 producing T cells in the gut. This is not surprising since most Th17 are α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub><sup>+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref009">9</xref>] and may be due to the effect of the Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> on CCR6<sup>+</sup> T cells that we noted in absence of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref022">22</xref>]. This early decrease in IL-17 may contribute to lower immune activation during the acute phase of infection, since higher IL-17 during acute infection has been associated with AIDS progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref052">52</xref>]. A reduced inflammatory state in mucosal tissues may help explain the apparent protection of IFN-γ producing cells in the large and small intestine during chronic infection in the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group.</p>
<p>Moreover, reduced trafficking of lymphocytes to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) may lead to a decrease in lymphoid aggregates (as recently described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref053">53</xref>]) reducing overall immune cell priming. This may help explain the overall decrease in SIV-specific T cell responses that was observed in the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group when peptide pools for the entire envelope and Gag proteins were used.</p>
<p>Perhaps because the Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> was administered during the earliest stages of the infection, we did not see an impact on the anti-gp120 antibody responses as was described in the ART-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> combination study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref017">17</xref>]. However, treatment with the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> combination increased T cell responses against the V2 region of the envelope and our data suggest a role for these responses in maintaining virologic control. How and why this happens requires further investigation. We speculate that Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> changes the immunogenicity of the V2-loop region of the envelope, perhaps by interfering with common mechanisms of gp120 processing and MHC-II presentation in antigen presenting cells. This may be due to the high expression of integrin α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> on activated DCs and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref055">55</xref>].</p>
<p>The increase in IFN-γ producing cells in the gut suggests a protective activity of the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> combination on the gut immune system and helps explain the long-term survival of SIV infected animals treated with Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> during acute infection (reported at CROI 2018 by J. Arthos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref056">56</xref>]). Boosting effective mucosal immune responses may also help explain the virologic control seen when the Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> was used in combination with cART as therapeutic approach in Byrareddy et. al, Science 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref017">17</xref>]. This control was not replicated in other similar studies (as reported by Di Mascio and Fauci at AIDS2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref057">57</xref>]). Nonetheless, our study adds to the considerable amount of work that supports the immunomodulatory effect of Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the only VRC01-specific effect we observed appeared in the lymph nodes, where in the VRC01-only treated animals, we detected significantly lower frequencies of CD25<sup>+</sup> and CXCR5<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. In the VRC01-Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> group, this effect was still present, but less pronounced. This further supports the published observations that suggest a direct impact of bNAbs on the antiviral immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref058">58</xref>]. Even so, the amount of time the animals were exposed to meaningful concentrations of VRC01 during infection was very short and the data should be interpreted with caution. Data from breakthrough infections in the AMP study will help shed light on the effects of low levels of VRC01 during acute HIV-1 infection.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a suboptimal dose of VRC01 in combination with the Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> significantly delayed infection and impacted the availability and distribution of immune cell subsets as well as the T cell responses to the virus. VRC01 and Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> impact HIV-1 infection by distinct mechanisms, neither of which is fully understood. This study provides the first insight into the combination of these antibodies and contributes to our understanding their effect on HIV-1 infection. Future studies should address how other bNAbs combinations with Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> could be harnessed in different therapeutic and preventive settings to fight HIV-1 infection.</p>

All of the macaques in the study were previously assigned to the SPF breeding colony for varying lengths of time. Parity was equal among the groups. Animals were monitored twice daily to ensure their welfare. Any abnormalities, including those of appetite, stool, behavior, were recorded and reported to a veterinarian. The animals were fed commercially prepared monkey chow twice daily. Supplemental foods were provided in the form of fruit, vegetables, and foraging treats as part of the TNPRC environmental enrichment program. Water was available at all times through an automatic watering system. The TNPRC environmental enrichment program is reviewed and approved by the IACUC semiannually. Veterinarians at the TNPRC Division of Veterinary Medicine have established procedures to minimize pain and distress through several means. Monkeys were anesthetized with ketamine-HCl (10 mg/kg) or tiletamine/zolazepam (6 mg/kg) prior to all procedures. Preemptive and post procedural analgesia (buprenorphine 0.01 mg/kg) was required for procedures that would likely cause more than momentary pain or distress in humans undergoing the same procedures. The above listed anesthetics and analgesics were used to minimize pain or distress associated with this study in accordance with the recommendations of the Weatherall Report. The animals were euthanized at the end of the study using methods consistent with recommendations of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Panel on euthanasia and per the recommendations of the IACUC. Specifically, the animals were anesthetized with tiletamine/zolazepam (8 mg/kg IM) and given buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg IM) followed by an overdose of pentobarbital sodium. Death was confirmed by auscultation of the heart and pupillary dilation. None of the animals became severely ill or died prior to the experimental endpoint. The TNPRC policy for early euthanasia/humane endpoint was included in the protocol in case those circumstances arose. All studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the TNPRC (OLAW assurance #A4499-01; protocol P0180-3639) and in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. TNPRC is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC#000594).</p>

<title>Macaque treatments</title>
<p>Macaques were divided in three groups of 9 animals each. Animals were administered intravenously 1) 1 injection of 10 mg/kg of VRC01 + 1 injection of 25 mg/kg of Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> mAb; followed by 5 additional injections of 25 mg/kg of Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> mAb every 3 weeks 2) 1 injection of 10 mg/kg of VRC01; 3) 1 injection of 10mg/kg of control Human IgG and 25 mg/kg of control rhesus IgG. Starting 3 days after treatment, macaques were challenged weekly with intravaginal administration of SHIV<sub>AD8-OE</sub> (1,000 TCID<sub>50</sub>/challenge) for 8 weeks. Blood was collected weekly to monitor infection as described below. After two consecutive positive SIV PCRs (3–4 weeks post infection; acute phase) fresh rectal biopsies and blood were used for cell isolation as described below. Subsequently, blood was collected every two weeks throughout the study. Rectal and vaginal samples were also collected at 7–8 weeks post infection (post-acute phase). At necropsy, blood, lymph nodes, gut, brain, vaginal and cervical tissues were harvested and used for cell isolation.</p>

<p>Levels of VRC01 were measured as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref027">27</xref>]. Levels of rhesus Rh-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> antibody in macaque plasma were measured using the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>-expressing human T cell line HuT-78 (NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH: HuT 78 from Dr. Robert Gallo) in a flow cytometry-based assay as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007776.ref022">22</xref>] using the standard curve method. Briefly, HuT 78 cells were first incubated for 2–3 days in complete RPMI 1640 media containing 100 nM retinoic acid to increase the surface expression of α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub>. Cells (150,000/condition) were stained with LIVE/DEAD Aqua dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for live/dead discrimination, incubated for 30min at 4°C with the plasma to be tested (1:10 diluted in PBS) obtained from macaques from the VRC01-α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub> treatment group before (baseline, BL) and up to 6 weeks after treatment. Cells were then washed and incubated for 30 min at 4°C with anti-rhesus IgG1 (NHP Resource Center, antibody 7H11, in house biotinylated with EZ-link NHS-biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions), washed again and resuspended in neutravidin-PE (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 20 min at 4°C.

<p>3–4 weeks post infection, PBMCs were isolated using Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and cells from rectal biopsies were isolated by enzymatic digestion in HBSS containing 2mg/mL Collagenase IV (Worthington Biochemical) and 1mg/ml of Human Serum Albumin (Sigma-Aldrich), shaking at 37°C for 50 minutes. The resulting cell suspension was passed through a 40μm cell strainer and washed with PBS. PBMCs and rectal cells were then stimulated with 60ng/ml PMA, 0.5μg/ml Ionomycin and 5μg/ml Brefeldin A (BFA) for 4 hours at 37°C, stained with LIVE/DEAD Aqua viability dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated with a cocktail of different panels of monoclonal antibodies as listed in the tables in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007776.s015">S15 Fig</xref>.</p>
<p>At the time of necropsy, PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. Enzymatic digestion was used to isolate cells from jejunum, ileum, colorectal, vaginal and cervical tissues as described above. Spleen and LNs (axillary, mesenteric, inguinal, iliac) were cut in small pieces and passed directly through a 40μm cell strainer. Isolated cells were washed, frozen for phenotyping and stimulation experiments at a later time. For PBMC stimulation experiments, up to 3x10<sup>6</sup> cells/sample were thawed, plated on a plate pre-coated with 2.5μg/ml goat anti mouse (GAM) IgGs and cross linked with 10μg/ml anti-CD28 and anti-CD49d antibodies (Sigma Aldrich).

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>To analyze the differences in SHIV acquisition, the survival curves generated with time to first viral detection in plasma from each treatment group were compared to each other directly and each with the curve from the control group using the Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test and with the Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test with p value Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons. The cumulative number of challenges needed to infect in each group was also compared to the cumulative number in each other group by Poisson exact test. In the Log rank, Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon and Poisson exact tests, data from KT57 and GH63 were excluded to allow a fair comparison of infection acquisition between the 2 treatment groups. A survival curve showing intention-to-treat analysis including these 2 animals is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007776.s002">S2 Fig</xref>. Viral loads and CD4 counts were compared by two-way ANOVA for repeated measures. To address whether either treatment had a significantly different effect on infection and immunological parameters than the control group, data was analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test adjusted for multiple comparisons followed by the Dunn’s multiple comparisons post-hoc test. To address whether treatment groups differed from each other a Mann-Whitney unpaired t-test was performed. All analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism software V7.
