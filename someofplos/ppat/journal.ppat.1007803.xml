<abstract>
<p>Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) produced by <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> are known as causative agents of emetic food poisoning. We previously demonstrated that SEA binds with submucosal mast cells and evokes mast cell degranulation in a small emetic house musk shrew model. Notably, primates have been recognized as the standard model for emetic assays and analysis of SE emetic activity. However, the mechanism involved in SEA-induced vomiting in primates has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we established common marmosets as an emetic animal model. Common marmosets were administered classical SEs, including SEA, SEB and SEC, and exhibited multiple vomiting responses. However, a non-emetic staphylococcal superantigen, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, did not induce emesis in these monkeys. These results indicated that the common marmoset is a useful animal model for assessing the emesis-inducing activity of SEs. Furthermore, histological analysis uncovered that SEA bound with submucosal mast cells and induced mast cell degranulation. Additionally, <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacological results showed that SEA-induced histamine release plays a critical role in the vomiting response in common marmosets. The present results suggested that 5-hydroxytryptamine also plays an important role in the transmission of emetic stimulation on the afferent vagus nerve or central nervous system. We conclude that SEA induces histamine release from submucosal mast cells in the gastrointestinal tract and that histamine contributes to the SEA-induced vomiting reflex via the serotonergic nerve and/or other vagus nerve.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) is a bacterial toxin that has been recognized as a leading causative agent of staphylococcal food poisoning since 1930. The primary symptoms of staphylococcal food poisoning are nausea and emesis, which develop up to 1–6 h after ingestion of the causative foods contaminated by the bacteria. In the present study, we established the common marmoset as an emetic animal model and investigated the mechanisms of SEA-induced emesis in the primate model. Common marmosets that received SEA showed multiple emetic responses. We observed that SEA bound with submucosal mast cells in the intestinal tract and induced mast cell degranulation. Furthermore, SEA promoted histamine release from mast cells. We also demonstrated that histamine plays an important role in the SEA-induced emetic response in common marmosets. We conclude that SEA induces histamine release from submucosal mast cells in the intestinal tract and that the stimulation is transmitted from intestine to the brain via nerves, causing emesis. Our study provides a novel insight into functions of submucosal mast cells in the digestive tract.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) produced by <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>) have emetic activity and are causative agents of bacterial food poisoning. The primary symptoms of staphylococcal food poisoning include nausea, abdominal cramping and vomiting, which develop up to 1–6 h after ingestion of the causative foods contaminated with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref001">1</xref>]. In 1930, Dack <italic>et al</italic>. showed that staphylococcal food poisoning is not due to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> cells, but caused by intoxication with SEs in the contaminated foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref002">2</xref>]. These toxins are also superantigens, which have the ability to activate a large amount of T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref003">3</xref>]. These emetic and superantigenic activities make SEs a public health concern. Five major serological types of SEs (SEA to SEE), so-called “classical SEs”, have been characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref003">3</xref>]. Notably, new types of SEs and SE-like toxins (SEG to SElV, SElX and SElY) have also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref010">10</xref>]. Although the mechanism of superantigenic activity and the amino acid residues in the active site of SEs have been clarified, the exact molecular and cellular mechanisms of their emetic activity still remain unclear. We have previously elucidated the mechanism of SEA-induced emesis using a small emetic animal model, house musk shrew (<italic>Suncus murinus</italic>) model. This study has revealed shown that SEA binds with submucosal mast cells and evokes mast cell degranulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref011">11</xref>]. We also have demonstrated that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is a key molecule in SEA-induced emesis in house musk shrews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref012">12</xref>]. Notably, the primates have been recognized as the standard model for detecting the emetic activity of SEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref014">14</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct experiments in a primate model. However, the high cost and limited availability of primates have led to a reduction in the investigation of SE-induced emesis using this model.</p>
<p>The common marmoset is a New World monkey that is small in size (average height of approximately 20 cm). This monkey can give birth twice a year. Hence, the handling and breeding of this animal are easier than those of other primates. Furthermore, its complete genome sequence and the transgenic marmosets have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref015">15</xref>]. This information makes this animal attractive for investigation of SE-induced emesis. In the present study, we established a new emetic animal model using the common marmoset and analyzed the emetic activity of SEA. In addition, we used histological and pharmacological techniques for common marmosets and their gastrointestinal (GI) tracts to clarify the mechanism of emesis induced by SEs.</p>

<title>Establishment of an emetic model using common marmosets</title>
<p>In order to investigate the suitability of common marmosets for the emetic assay, monkeys were administered representative SEs SEA, SEB, SEC and SEI and the emetic response was observed for 5 h (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007803.t001">Table 1</xref>). Five out of 8 common marmosets received 50-μg/kg of SEA and all 11 monkeys that had ingested 250-μg/kg of SEA exhibited vomiting responses from 45 to 202 min after administration. The vomiting responses occurred 4 to 9 times after 50 μg/kg of SEA treatment and 2 to 28 times after 250 μg/kg of SEA treatment. The emesis-inducing activity of SEB was comparable to that of SEA. Furthermore, ingestion of SEC induced emesis in 5 of 8 common marmosets. SEI and a new staphylococcal enterotoxin-like toxin named SEIY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref010">10</xref>] exhibited an emetic response in common marmosets, although the frequency of the emetic response was lower than that of other SEs. By contrast, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), which is a non-emetic staphylococcal superantigen, showed no emetic response. The results indicated that common marmosets respond to the emetic activity of SEs.</p>

<p>SEs are also superantigens and have the ability to activate a large amount of T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref003">3</xref>]. To clarify whether common marmosets respond to the superantigenic activity of SEs, the proliferation of common marmoset PBMCs stimulated with SEs, including SEA, SEB, SEC, SEI, SElY and TSST-1, was measured. The representative results from three experiments are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007803.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Over 1 pg/ml of SEB and SEI was able to induce PBMC proliferation. However, the minimum concentration of SEA and SEC required to induce PBMC proliferation was 100 pg/ml. To achieve substantial lymphocyte proliferation, these SEs required concentrations that were two orders of magnitude higher compared with SEB and SEI. The mitogenic activity of SElY and TSST-1 was low in comparison with that of other SEs. In the cases of SElY and TSST-1, the minimum concentration required to induce PBMC proliferation was 10 and 100 ng/ml, respectively. These results suggested that PBMCs of common marmosets responded to the superantigenic activity of SEs.</p>

<p>We further explored the target cells of SEA in the GI tract of common marmosets. The GI tract was collected and each segment, including the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum and colon, was incubated with 1 μg/ml of SEA for 60 min at room temperature. SEA-treated tissues were then processed for SEA immunostaining using anti-SEA polyclonal antibody.

Spindle-shaped morphology of SEA-positive cells was indicated in the submucosa of the jejunum and ileum. Notably, binding of SEA to enterochromaffin cells was not observed in the luminal epithelium of the GI tract.

<title>SEA binds with submucosal mast cells</title>
<p>Our previous study, which used house musk shrews, demonstrated that the target of SEA is submucosal mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref011">11</xref>]. In the present study, SEA-binding cells in the GI tract of common marmosets morphologically resembled connective tissue-type mast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007803.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Therefore, we investigated whether SEA binds with mast cells in the submucosal jejunum and ileum of common marmosets. Sections of GI tract were incubated with 1 μg/ml of SEA for 60 min at room temperature. The sections of SEA-treated jejunum and ileum were processed for double- immunofluorescence staining using anti-SEA antibody and antibody against FcεRIα, an IgE receptor that is known as a mast cell marker. As expected, SEA and FcεRIα signals were co-localized in the submucosal sections of the ileum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007803.g003">Fig 3</xref>). A similar result was observed in the jejunum sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007803.g003">Fig 3</xref>), suggesting that SEA binds with mast cells. To further confirm whether the detected cells were mast cells, the ileal sections were stained with anti-tryptase monoclonal antibody (mAb), which recognizes tryptase on the mast cells. Double staining with antibodies against SEA and tryptase revealed that almost all of the SEA-binding cells were tryptase-immunopositive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007803.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Additionally, SEA-immunopositive cells in the stomach and colon were also identified as mast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007803.g003">Fig 3</xref>). These results indicated that the target cells of SEA in the GI tract of common marmosets are most likely submucosal mast cells. In addition, SEA-treated ileal sections were stained with anti-5-HT mAb and anti-histamine mAb. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007803.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>, submucosal mast cells exhibited positive histamine signals, but not 5-HT.</p>

<title>SEA induces degranulation in mast cells</title>
<p>Intact and degranulated mast cells are distinguishable by their metachromatic staining, particularly with toluidine blue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref017">17</xref>]. Thus, we further investigated whether the interaction between SEA and mast cells could induce degranulation by using toluidine blue staining. Specimens of the intestinal tract were removed from common marmosets at 2 h after injection with 500 μg of SEA in the intestinal loop. The results of toluidine blue staining showed that metachromatic mast cells, which are virtually identical to mast cells, were present in both the mucosa and submucosa in the GI tract. To estimate the extent of degranulation in the submucosal mast cells quantitatively, we compared the number of metachromatic-staining cells in toluidine blue-stained jejunum sections between SEA and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007803.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

In order to confirm whether the observed SEA-induced histamine release caused by mast cell degranulation, the jejunum sections were incubated with mast cell stabilizer disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) during SEA-stimulation. DSCG suppressed SEA-induced histamine release in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007803.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). However, 5-HT release from the jejunum was not affected by SEA stimulation or the addition of DSCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007803.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>), suggesting that 5-HT release from the jejunum is independent of SEA and mast cells.

To confirm whether the vagus nerves were substantially denervated, the monkeys were administered copper sulfate, a control substance that evokes vomiting via vagus nerves.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The mechanism of SEA-induced vomiting has not been fully elucidated in primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref002">2</xref>]. To investigate this mechanism, we established the common marmoset as an emetic animal model. In the present study, we showed that vomiting was induced in the common marmosets by orogastric intubation of SEs, including classical SEs and recently identified SEs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007803.t001">Table 1</xref>). However, none of common marmosets administered with TSST-1 or PBS exhibited an emetic reaction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007803.t001">Table 1</xref>). Notably, PBMCs of common marmosets were susceptible to the superantigenic activity of SEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007803.g001">Fig 1</xref>). These results are consistent with responses of human and other emetic animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref021">21</xref>]. Although TSST-1 has the highest toxicity to humans among the superantigens, the present study showed that the superantigenic activity of TSST-1 against common marmosets was markedly lower than that against humans. The results suggest the possibility that major histocompatibility complex and/or T cell receptors of common marmosets have low binding affinity to TSST-1. Furthermore, our results indicated that SEI displayed weak emetic activity but was strongly superantigenic. These SEI properties provide information that there is no complete relationship between emetic activity and superantigenic activity. This observation correlates with the data from Harris <italic>et al</italic>. and Schlievert <italic>et al</italic>. which have shown the separation of emesis from superantigenic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref023">23</xref>]. Our previous report indicated that 5 out of 10 cynomolgus monkeys administered 10 μg/kg of SEA, and 6 out of 7 cynomolgus monkeys that had ingested 100 μg/kg of SEA exhibited vomiting responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref021">21</xref>]. We also reported that house musk shrews could be used as a small emetic animal model and that shrews were highly sensitive to SEA in the initial report (32 μg/kg, orogastric administration) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref019">19</xref>]. However, our recent study showed that house musk shrews required a larger amount of SEA (1.4–2.0 mg/kg of body weight) to promote emesis, indicating a decreased susceptibility of shrews to SEA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref024">24</xref>]. Therefore, it was assumed that the marmosets used in the present study showed almost the same sensitivity to SEA as cynomolgus monkeys. As the body weight of common marmosets was markedly low (approximately 0.3 kg), a lower amount of toxins was required compared with cynomolgus monkeys (1.4–2.0 kg). Furthermore, the complete genome sequences and transgenic marmosets have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref026">26</xref>]. Hence, the common marmoset may be a useful animal model for detection and analysis of SEs.</p>
<p>In 2004, the <italic>International Nomenclature Committee for Staphylococcal Superantigens</italic> (INCSS) recommended that only toxins that could induce vomiting after oral administration in primates are termed SEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref014">14</xref>]. Our results indicate that SElY has emetic activity in primates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1007803.t001">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, in the present study it was proposed that SElY should be renamed SEY, according to INCSS recommendations.</p>
<p>Our previous report showed that SEA binds to submucosal mast cells in the GI tract in house musk shrews and can induce submucosal mast cell degranulation, as well as 5-HT release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref011">11</xref>]. To clarify the mechanism of SEA-induced emesis in common marmosets, we used histological and pharmacological techniques in the present study. SEA was indicated to bind with submucosal cells in the GI tract, specifically in the stomach, jejunum, ileum and colon of common marmosets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007803.g002">Fig 2</xref>). We identified and characterized cells as submucosal mast cells according to the positive signals of IgE receptor, tryptase and histamine (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007803.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007803.g004">4</xref>).</p>
<p>As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007803.g005">Fig 5</xref>, SEA induced submucosal mast cell degranulation in the jejunum 2 h after SEA injection. Interestingly, SEA induced histamine release but not 5-HT release in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments, and mast cell stabilizer reduced this histamine release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007803.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Furthermore, mast cell stabilizer and histamine H<sub>1</sub> blockers reduced SEA-induced emesis induced in common marmosets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007803.g007">Fig 7</xref>). In brief, the degranulation of submucosal mast cells was promoted by SEA, and the inhibition of submucosal mast cell degranulation prevented SEA-induced emesis. These results suggested that submucosal mast cell degranulation is important in SEA-induced emetic responses.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that histamine release has a pivotal role in the emetic response in the GI tract (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007803.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007803.g007">7</xref>). Conventionally, 5-HT from enterochromaffin cells in the GI mucosa has been considered to be an important mediator for anticancer drugs, chemical substances and vomiting due to food poisoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref028">28</xref>]. Histamine is a key molecule for transmitting stimuli from the inner ear to the brain during vomiting due to motion sickness and also plays a role in the GI tract with regard to food allergies and histamine fish poisoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref031">31</xref>]. However, it has not been considered to be involved in vomiting associated with bacterial food poisoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref032">32</xref>]. Mast cells in rodents are classified into mucosal mast cells (MMCs) and connective tissue mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref034">34</xref>]. Human mast cells are divided into two major groups: MC<sub>T</sub> (containing tryptase) and MC<sub>TC</sub> (containing tryptase and chymase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref036">36</xref>]. In the human GI tract, MMCs are MC<sub>T</sub>, whereas submucosal mast cells mostly exhibit MC<sub>TC</sub> properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref036">36</xref>]. MMCs have been known to be important cells in allergy development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref037">37</xref>]. However, a few reports demonstrated that submucosal mast cells of the GI tract are involved in diseases, and their function is still unknown in various respects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref034">34</xref>]. The present study indicated that submucosal mast cells were involved in the emetic response and that SEA specifically affects submucosal mast cells in the GI tract. This study provides a novel insight into the functions of submucosal mast cells in the GI tract.</p>
<p>In summary, the results of the present study have shown that the common marmoset is a useful animal for emetic assays and that submucosal mast cells and histamine play critical roles in SEA-induced emesis in common marmosets. Furthermore, 5-HT plays an important role in the transmission of emetic stimulation on the afferent vagus nerve or central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref038">38</xref>]. Taken together, our results suggest that the binding of SEA with mast cells induced histamine release, which acts against the serotonergic nerve and/or other vagus nerve. Furthermore, it was indicated that stimulation could be transmitted to the vomiting center, causing a vomiting reflex. These findings provide a novel function for mast cells and the vomiting pathway, which are considered to be essential in cell biology and neuroscience.</p>

<title>Ethical statement</title>
<p>This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Research Ethics Committee of Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine (permit number M10037), and followed the Guidelines for Animal Experimentation, Hirosaki University. The Hirosaki University guidelines are in accordance with the guidelines for proper conduct of animal experiments determined by Ministry of the Environment <italic>Standard relating to the Care and Keeping and Reducing Pain of Laboratory Animals</italic> (Notice of the Ministry of the Environment No. 88 of 2006) and American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) guidelines for the euthanasia of animals: 2013 edition. Common marmosets (<italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic>) were purchased from CLEA Japan, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Common marmosets were housed at 26–30°C in a room lit for 12 h (from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m). The monkeys had <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to tap water and food pellets (CMS-1M, CLEA Japan, Inc.). One or two monkeys were housed per cage (420x620x670 mm). Daily care was provided by the same staff, and the veterinary staff took care of the monkeys in case of any health problems. Eleven sexually mature monkeys (aged 2–4 years old and weighing 280–360 g) were used in each experiment. To reduce the number of common marmosets used in this study, each monkey was repeatedly administered different types of toxins. The monkeys were then used for experiments with inhibitors. For tissue sample preparation, common marmosets were euthanized by exsanguination under fully anesthetization using a mixture of medetomizine, midazolam and butorphanol and/or inhaled isoflurane.</p>

<title>Preparation of toxins</title>
<p>Cloning and preparation of recombinant SEA, SEB, SEC, SEI, SElY and TSST-1 were performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref021">21</xref>]. Briefly, the toxin genes from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> isolates were amplified by PCR and the PCR products were digested with <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Eco</italic>RI or <italic>Sal</italic>I. The fragment of the genes was then cloned into pGEX6P-1, a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion expression vector. Expression and purification of the GST-fused recombinant proteins and the cleavage and removal of the GST tag from recombinant SE proteins were performed by the methods described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref021">21</xref>].

<title>Assay of emetic activity</title>
<p>The emetic activity of SEs in common marmosets was estimated using Bergdoll’s monkey feeding assay with some modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref013">13</xref>]. At 16 h after food deprivation, common marmosets were anesthetized by an intramuscular injection with a mixture of medetomizine (80 μg/kg; ZENOAQ, Fukushima, Japan) and midazolam (400 μg/kg; SANDOZ, Tokyo, Japan). SEA, SEB, SEC, SEI, SElY or TSST-1 was dissolved in 1.5 ml of sterile PBS and fed to common marmosets at a dose of 50 or 250 μg/kg by orogastric intubation. Alternatively, SEA was dissolved in 150 μl of sterile PBS and administered intravenously at a dose of 250 μg/kg into the femoral vein. Following this, the monkeys were intramuscularly administered atipamezole (320 μg/kg, ZENOAQ) for rapid recovery. The emetic responses were recorded using a video camera for 5 h after oral administration of each toxin. The number of emetic responses, the latency period of the first emetic response and behavioral changes were evaluated. In order to avoid the undesirable influences by repeated administration of the same SE, we did not use the same SE in an individual marmoset with the exception of SEA when the responses to various doses were compared.</p>

<sec id="sec016">
<title>Assays of superantigenic activity</title>
<p>Mitogenic activity of SEs was determined using PBMCs of common marmosets. Blood from 3 healthy monkeys was processed using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare Japan, Tokyo, Japan) density-gradient centrifugation. PBMCs were resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Nichirei Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) and penicillin/streptomycin. The PBMCs were then incubated for 72 h in 96-well round-bottomed tissue culture plates (AGC Techno Glass Co., Shizuoka, Japan) with different concentrations of SEA, SEB, SEC, SEI, SEY or TSST-1 and then assayed for the uptake of [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine (PerkinElmer Japan Co., Ltd., Kanagawa, Japan).

<title>Immunofluorescence analysis</title>
<p>Cryostat sections (10 μm) were processed for immunofluorescence staining with single or double labeling. The sections were washed in PBS and incubated with 2% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) in PBS/0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) for 30 min at room temperature. Afterwards, the sections were rinsed in PBST and incubated with SEA (1.0 μg/ml) for 60 min at room temperature. After washing the sections with PBST, rabbit polyclonal anti-SEA antibody was used to detect SEA in the tissue. This rabbit polyclonal anti-SEA antibody (0.2 μg/ml) was obtained from sera of SEA-immunized rabbits and purified by affinity chromatography using a HiTrap kit (GE Healthcare Japan), as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007803.ref011">11</xref>]. Rat anti-5-HT mAb (1:200; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-histamine antibody (1:200; EMD Millipore), mouse anti-tryptase mAb (1:1000; Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) and mouse anti-FcεRIα mAb (clone CRA1 1:1000; BioAcademia, Osaka, Japan) were also used as primary antibodies. Incubation of the sections with primary antibodies was carried out at 40°C overnight. Then, the sections were rinsed in PBST and incubated with the following secondary antibodies: Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa 568-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG and/or Alexa 568-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:1000; Life Technologies Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for 60 min at room temperature. All of these antibodies were diluted in Can Get Signal Immunostain Solution A (Toyobo Life Science, Osaka, Japan).
