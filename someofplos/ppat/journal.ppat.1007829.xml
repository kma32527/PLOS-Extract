<abstract>
<p>Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) belongs to the family of <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> within the order of <italic>Bunyavirales</italic>. The virus may cause fatal disease both in livestock and humans, and therefore, is of great economical and public health relevance. In analogy to the influenza virus polymerase complex, the bunyavirus L protein is assumed to bind to and cleave off cap structures of cellular mRNAs to prime viral transcription. However, even though the presence of an endonuclease in the N-terminal domain of the L protein has been demonstrated for several bunyaviruses, there is no evidence for a cap-binding site within the L protein. We solved the structure of a C-terminal 117 amino acid-long domain of the RVFV L protein by X-ray crystallography. The overall fold of the domain shows high similarity to influenza virus PB2 cap-binding domain and the putative non-functional cap-binding domain of reptarenaviruses. Upon co-crystallization with m<sup>7</sup>GTP, we detected the cap-analogue bound between two aromatic side chains as it has been described for other cap-binding proteins. We observed weak but specific interaction with m<sup>7</sup>GTP rather than GTP <italic>in vitro</italic> using isothermal titration calorimetry. The importance of m<sup>7</sup>GTP-binding residues for viral transcription was validated using a RVFV minigenome system. In summary, we provide structural and functional evidence for a cap-binding site located within the L protein of a virus from the <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula and leads to abortions in and death of ruminants. The virus can also be transmitted to humans causing febrile illness up to hemorrhagic fever with the possibility of fatal outcome. As there is currently no human vaccine or specific treatment available and because of the high epidemic potential, WHO has listed RVFV on its R&amp;D Blueprint for urgent development of medical countermeasures. In order to amplify, the virus needs to transcribe and replicate the viral genome inside the cell cytoplasm. For transcription, the virus uses a process called cap-snatching, which is essentially depending on two functions presumed to reside within the large viral L protein: the ability to bind cap-structures and the activity of cleaving them off from cellular mRNA. Both functions could serve as specific targets for antiviral drug design. We identified and solved the structure of the cap-binding domain of RVFV and provide the first evidence for the presence of a functional cap-binding site in the L protein of bunyaviruses. Comparison with cap-binding proteins of related viruses revealed similarities and important differences critical for the development of potential broad-spectrum antivirals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) belongs to the family of <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> within the order of <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> with a single stranded RNA genome in negative orientation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/" xlink:type="simple">https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/</ext-link>). RVFV is endemic to sub-Saharan African countries but has also spread to the Arabian Peninsula. The virus infects ruminants and pseudoruminants leading to abortions in pregnant animals and high mortality among young animals. The virus can also be transmitted to humans causing febrile illness with the possibility for severe disease even with fatal outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref002">2</xref>]. Due to the high economical burden of RVFV outbreaks among livestock, the possibility of severe human disease without effective antiviral treatment options and the epidemic potential RVFV is listed on the WHO R&amp;D Blueprint. The WHO urges to focus R&amp;D on this pathogen to develop medical countermeasures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>All viruses from the order of <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> amplify in the cell cytoplasm and the key factor for viral replication is the large L protein (220–450 kDa). The L protein is a multifunctional enzyme catalyzing genome replication as well as viral transcription. Whereas genome replication is initiated <italic>de novo</italic> by a prime-and-realign mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref007">7</xref>], viral transcription is a primer-dependent process. Messenger RNAs of most segmented negative sense RNA viruses, including bunyaviruses, contain additional non-templated host-derived sequences at their 5' ends. Therefore, cap-snatching was proposed to be a common mechanism in these viruses to initiate viral transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref010">10</xref>]. As demonstrated for the influenza virus polymerase complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref011">11</xref>], the bunyavirus L protein is assumed to bind to cap structures of cellular mRNAs, while an endonuclease cleaves the mRNA some nucleotides downstream of the cap creating a short RNA fragment. This capped RNA fragment is subsequently used to prime viral transcription. The length of these sequences differs between the virus families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref015">15</xref>]. This hypothesis is strengthened by the identification and biochemical characterization of an endonuclease in the N-terminus of the L protein for several viruses of the <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref021">21</xref>]. However, there is no convincing evidence for a cap-binding site within the L protein so far. Mutational studies on the Lassa virus and RVFV L proteins using minireplicon systems revealed a specific role of the C-terminus in viral transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref023">23</xref>]. A crystal structure of a C-terminal L protein fragment from a reptarenavirus showed high structural similarity to influenza virus PB2 cap-binding domain but the reptarenavirus domain was lacking the expected cap-binding site arrangement of two aromatic side chains as well as any <italic>in vitro</italic> cap-binding activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref021">21</xref>]. The structure of the La Crosse virus L protein, published in 2015 by Gerlach <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref024">24</xref>], is missing the C-terminal region, allowing only for the conclusion that there is no cap-binding domain present in any other part of the L protein.</p>
<p>We solved the structure of a C-terminal domain of the RVFV L protein and demonstrated specific binding to a cap-structure. We validated the importance of several specific residues implicated in cap-binding for viral transcription using a RVFV minigenome system. Furthermore, we compared the new structure with the structures of influenza virus cap-binding domain as well as reptarenavirus putative cap-binding domain and observed a high degree of similarity between the structures but also striking differences in the binding site composition and binding mode of the cap. In summary, we present evidence for a cap-binding site located within the L protein of a virus from the <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order. This work also provides the basis for the design of specific compounds targeting RVFV cap-binding domain.</p>

<title>Construct design and identification of a small domain in the RVFV L protein C-terminus</title>
<p>A secondary structure based sequence alignment of the C-termini of phlebo- and closely related banyangvirus L proteins was created to identify the region of the L protein, which might contain the potential cap-binding site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007829.s004">S1 Fig</xref>). Guided by the information about the structural composition of cap-binding domains from influenza virus PB2 and the putative cap-binding domain of California Academy of Sciences virus (CASV) L protein, we searched for several β-strands interspersed with one to three α-helices. The region between residues 1677 and 2008 of the RVFV L protein was identified as target region. We designed and cloned six different constructs from this area (putative cap-binding domain CBD 1–6) and tested for soluble expression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Construct details and expression data are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007829.s005">S2 Fig</xref>. Two of the proteins could be solubly expressed (CBD2: residues 1677–1827; and CBD4: residues 1706–1827) but not well purified. Therefore, we designed further constructs (CBD 7–14) based on these soluble candidates and obtained two proteins suitable for crystallization experiments: CBD9 (residues 1719–1827) and CBD13 (residues 1706–1822).</p>

<title>Crystallization and structure determination of a RVFV L protein C-terminal domain</title>
<p>Both CBD9 and CBD13 proteins were crystallized. During the purification process up to 6 mM of m<sup>7</sup>GTP was added, as it significantly reduced precipitation of the protein at low concentrations. Only CBD13 crystals were of good quality. This protein crystallized in space group P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> with two molecules per asymmetric unit and the structure could be refined to a resolution of 1.5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007829.s001">S1 Table</xref>, PDB ID 6QHG). Thus, from now on CBD13 will be referred to as RVFV CBD. Except for the N-terminal residues 1706–1707 in chain B clear electron density was observed for the whole structure. RVFV CBD crystallized as a dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), which is not fully symmetric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), with a buried surface area of ~430 Å<sup>2</sup> between the monomers (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007829.s006">S3 Fig</xref>). The most prominent difference between the monomers is observed between residues 1718 and 1729, which constitute a β-hairpin.

<title>Identification and structural configuration of a cap-binding site in RVFV CBD</title>
<p>During the purification optimization process, it was discovered that concentration of the protein to more than 4.5 mg/ml was only possible after addition of m<sup>7</sup>GTP, a cap-analogue. Thus, m<sup>7</sup>GTP was present in all crystallization setups and additional electron density corresponding to an m<sup>7</sup>GTP ligand was indeed clearly visible in both chains of the RVFV CBD structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007829.s008">S5A Fig</xref>).

<p>The phosphate moiety of the cap structure interacts with R1716 side chain, which is extending from the loop between the first β-strand and the β-hairpin.

For chain A, some residues from neighboring molecules in the crystal also interact with the tri-phosphate of m<sup>7</sup>GTP.

<p>To verify that this binding pocket is specific for a methylated nucleotide, such as a cap-structure, we performed thermal stability assays using influenza virus PB2 cap-binding domain as a control. Addition of m<sup>7</sup>GTP to influenza virus PB2 cap-binding domain stabilized the protein, resulting in a higher melting temperature (ΔTm = 9°C in the presence of 10 mM m<sup>7</sup>GTP). We tested thermal stability of RVFV CBD in the presence of m<sup>7</sup>GTP, GTP, ATP and m<sup>7</sup>GpppG.

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements revealed a K<sub>D</sub> of ~737 μM of RVFV CBD for m<sup>7</sup>GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), which is considerably higher than the K<sub>D</sub> of 1.5 μM reported for m<sup>7</sup>GTP binding to influenza virus PB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref026">26</xref>].

<title>Functional analysis of mutations of the cap-binding site in the context of the full-length L protein</title>
<p>The RVFV minireplicon system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref023">23</xref>] was used to test the effect of mutations in the cap-binding site on the ability of the L protein to transcribe and replicate the viral genome. By using an ambisense minigenome we were able to discriminate between (1) mRNA production, a process depending on the cap-snatching mechanism for priming, and (2) antigenome synthesis, which is independent of a primer. Synthesis of these two RNA species was measured via expression of renilla luciferase ((Ren-Luc) reflecting essentially viral transcription) and quantitative analysis of bands of antigenomic RNA and renilla luciferase mRNA on a northern blot. We know from previous experiments with the Lassa virus replicon system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref028">28</xref>] that modification of L protein residues often affects the RNA polymerase function globally, which manifests as partial or complete defect in synthesis of all viral RNA species, i.e. replicative intermediates (antigenome) and mRNA. However, residues selectively important for viral transcription including cap-binding are expected to show a specific phenotype characterized by (i) reduced Ren-Luc signals indicating reduced mRNA synthesis, (ii) wild-type-like antigenome levels in the northern blot indicating functional RNA polymerase and (iii) a reduced mRNA-to-antigenome ratio as calculated from the quantitative northern blot data indicating a specific defect in transcription vs. replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007829.s003">S3 Table</xref>). We exchanged eight residues of the cap-binding pocket and surrounding areas both for chemically similar and different amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g005">Fig 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007829.s003">S3 Table</xref>). Aromatic residues F1713 and Y1728, relevant for stacking interaction with the m<sup>7</sup>GTP in the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>), could be changed to other aromatic amino acids (F, Y, W) without loss in transcriptional activity, even though they are almost completely conserved among phlebo- and banyangviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Mutation of those aromatic residues to chemically different amino acids resulted either in a complete loss of L protein activity (F1713) or a selective defect in viral transcription (Y1728, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g005">Fig 5</xref>, columns of mutants with selective transcription defect are colored in red). Substitution of R1716 by chemically different amino acids also resulted in a selective transcription defect, which is somehow surprising considering the low degree of conservation among phlebo- and banyangviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g003">Fig 3</xref>). A selective defect in viral transcription was also caused by mutations of residues Q1717 and N1749, although this effect was not observed for all substitutions. Residue M1782 could not be exchanged for other amino acids without a strong negative effect on general L protein function. We also included residue W1778 in our mutational study, because this is the only fairly conserved aromatic residue located in the α-helix, although it is not part of the cap-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). W1778 is obviously of importance for general L protein function as mutations to non-aromatic amino acids resulted in a complete loss of L protein activity, whereas the exchange for a phenylalanine had no effect.</p>

<title>Comparison of the RVFV cap-binding site residues with related proven or putative cap-binding sites</title>
<p>In many cap-binding proteins like eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), cellular cap-binding complex (CBC) or influenza virus PB2, the cap structures are bound between two aromatic side chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref029">29</xref>]. This is also true for RVFV CBD. However, in the PB2 structure the two residues that bind the guanine moiety of the cap are located in the β-hairpin (H357 in β<sub>H2</sub>) and at the end of the long α-helix (F404 in α<sub>1</sub>), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, right panel). Additionally, the ribose interacts with a phenylalanine side chain (F323 in β<sub>1</sub>) extending from the first β-strand of the large β-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, right panel, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007829.s008">S5C Fig</xref>). In RVFV CBD, no aromatic amino acid is present at the end of the long α-helix (α<sub>1</sub>). Instead, the guanine moiety is bound between two aromatic side chains extending from the β-hairpin (Y1728 in β<sub>H2</sub>) and the first β-strand (F1713 in β<sub>1</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, middle panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007829.s008">S5B Fig</xref>), which are also highly conserved among phlebo- and banyangviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The latter residue, F1713, corresponds to F323 of influenza virus PB2, which in PB2 interacts with the ribose. In RVFV CBD methionine 1782 at the end of the long α-helix (α<sub>1</sub>) takes the role of positioning the ribose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007829.s011">S8 Fig</xref>). In case of the CASV C-terminal domain, there is a conserved aromatic residue (Y1872 in α<sub>1</sub>) located at the end of the long α-helix, similar to F404 in influenza virus PB2, but no second residue in a conformation and distance suitable for a stacking interaction with a cap-structure is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, left panel). Among phlebo- and banyangviruses, we found only one aromatic residue near the end of the long α-helix (α<sub>1</sub>), W1818, which is conserved in about 85% of the analyzed sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g003">Fig 3</xref>).

<p>In summary, although the tertiary structure of the (putative) cap-binding domains of influenza virus, CASV, and RVFV is highly conserved, the atomic details of the cap binding sites differ significantly.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cap-snatching was first discovered in influenza virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref030">30</xref>] and is an attractive drug target, because the process is essential for virus amplification and the enzymes involved are virus encoded. This mechanism comprises two targets: the endonuclease and the cap-binding site. However, whereas several structures of bunyavirus endonucleases have been solved and the enzyme has been characterized relatively well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref031">31</xref>], structural data on the cap-binding site of bunyaviruses is rare and functional data is missing. The publication of the structure of a reptarenavirus L protein domain structurally similar to influenza virus PB2, but deficient of cap-binding activity raised the question whether the observed inability of cap-binding truly reflects the situation in mammarenaviruses and possibly all viruses of the <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref021">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we present the structure of a small globular domain located in the C-terminal region of RVFV L protein along with the first evidence for a functional cap-binding site within the bunyavirus L protein. The new structure is similar to influenza virus PB2 cap-binding domain and CASV putative cap-binding domain. The RVFV protein specifically binds to a cap-analogue <italic>in vitro</italic> and upon co-crystallization the cap-analogue could be detected bound between two aromatic side chains, as it is typical for several cellular and viral cap-binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref025">25</xref>]. Still, the residues involved in the interactions with the ligand differ significantly between influenza virus PB2 and RVFV cap-binding domain. These findings pose the following questions: (1) Is a functional cap-binding domain a common feature of all viruses within the B<italic>unyavirales</italic> order? (2) Will it be possible to design broad-spectrum inhibitors targeting the cap-binding domain of segmented negative sense RNA viruses despite the observed differences in the binding mode of m<sup>7</sup>GTP?</p>
<p>The presented data support the hypothesis that bunyavirus L proteins are functionally and structurally equivalent to the concatenation of influenza virus polymerase subunits in the order PA-PB1-PB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref017">17</xref>]. The presence of a β-hairpin in the RVFV structure, similar to PB2 but different from the CASV structure, suggests that the new structure might be more closely related to influenza virus cap-binding domain from an evolutionary perspective, which is contrary to what is described in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref032">32</xref>], although it is worth mentioning that most of the phylogenetic analyses for the L gene are based on the conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region. The evolutionary relation of the cap-binding domains will be difficult to prove, as the observed similarity is not obvious from the sequence level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007829.s009">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007829.s010">S7</xref> Figs).</p>
<p>Our data illustrate the structural flexibility of proteins with the same function, even though they are evolutionarily closely related. This is probably the reason why it is unlikely to reliably predict the cap-binding site in L proteins of different families within the <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order from the sequence level. The C-terminal part of the L protein of <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> is poorly conserved, making sequence alignments challenging. Furthermore, the location of the proven or putative cap-binding domain within the polymerase proteins differs between RVFV, CASV and influenza virus, which makes a correct alignment of these sequences even more difficult. Whereas for CASV the putative cap-binding domain is between 250 and 150 amino acids distance from the C-terminus, for RVFV this domain is between 390 and 270 residues away from the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The evolutionary context of this observation will be interesting to investigate in the future. We created an alignment of the proven and putative cap-binding domains of phlebo- and closely related banyangviruses, as well as arenaviruses and influenza A virus based on the observed structural similarities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007829.s009">S6 Fig</xref>). This alignment has to be interpreted with caution, as it demonstrates the very low degree of sequence conservation in this domain (see identity/ similarity matrix in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007829.s010">S7 Fig</xref>). The lack of a reasonable alignment makes it highly unlikely to model the cap-binding domains of other bunyaviruses based on the known structures. This underlines the need to localize and solve structures of further putative cap-binding domains in order to fully understand the cap-snatching mechanism of bunyaviruses.</p>
<p>For the development of potentially broad-spectrum inhibitors against viruses from the <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order as well as influenza viruses, the structures of the cap-binding cavities are essential. The binding site topology of the RVFV L protein cap-binding domain, however, is different from the PB2 cap-binding site: The corresponding essential aromatic residue from the end of the long α-helix (α<sub>1</sub>) in PB2 (F404) is absent in the RVFV structure. Instead, this function is taken over by an aromatic residue (F1713) located in the first β-strand (β<sub>1</sub>) of the sheet. The equivalent residue in influenza virus PB2 (F323) is responsible for stacking the ribose moiety of the cap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007829.s011">S8 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, the aromatic residue at the end of the long α-helix (α<sub>1</sub>) is present in the CASV domain (Y1872), although no reasonable candidate as a second partner for an aromatic sandwich is apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007829.s011">S8 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We were able to demonstrate binding of the RVFV CBD to m<sup>7</sup>GTP, a cap-analogue. In a thermal stability assay we observed stabilization of RVFV CBD by m<sup>7</sup>GTP. Additionally, we determined the K<sub>D</sub> of the low affinity interaction between m<sup>7</sup>GTP and RVFV CBD, which was considerably high with 737 μM. For influenza A virus PB2, both the shift in melting temperature in presence of m<sup>7</sup>GTP (ΔT<sub>m</sub> &lt;9°C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007829.g004">Fig 4</xref>) and the K<sub>D</sub> for interaction with m<sup>7</sup>GTP, which was shown to be ~1.5 μM <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref026">26</xref>], point to a higher affinity interaction with the m<sup>7</sup>GTP compared to RVFV cap-binding domain. This difference is not surprising, considering the few interactions observed between the RVFV L protein fragment and the ligand in the structure (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007829.s008">S5B and S5C Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007829.s002">S2 Table</xref>) and the fact that we are working with an isolated L protein domain. The affinity of RVFV full-length L protein for capped mRNAs has to be much higher to compete for the ligand with other cap-binding proteins inside the cytoplasm. The K<sub>D</sub> for the interaction of human eIF4E with m<sup>7</sup>GTP is ~0.87 μM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref033">33</xref>]. This suggests that there have to be more residues in RVFV L protein interacting with the cap-structure or the first nucleotides of the capped mRNA apart from the small domain presented here. This is conceivable as for influenza virus PB2 residues of the cap-binding adjacent, so-called mid-link domain have been shown to interact with the capped RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref034">34</xref>]. Alternatively, other mechanisms may support RVFV cap-binding activity. As an example, arenavirus Z protein has been shown to interact with eIF4E and to down-regulate its affinity for cap-structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref035">35</xref>]. Although most bunyaviruses do not contain a Z gene, similar scenarios involving viral proteins are conceivable. Furthermore, bunyavirus non-structural proteins have been shown to regulate host transcription and replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref036">36</xref>]. Additionally, cellular interaction partners of the L protein might play a role in the cap-snatching process as well as the cellular localization of viral transcription processes.</p>
<p>For influenza virus several compounds targeting the two functions involved in cap-snatching, the endonuclease and cap-binding site, have been reported over the past years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref041">41</xref>], two of those having succeeded in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref043">43</xref>]. An inhibitor of influenza endonuclease has been shown to be also effective against the homologous enzyme of La Crosse bunyavirus <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007829.ref044">44</xref>], which demonstrates the possibility to develop broad-spectrum inhibitors against the cap-cleaving endonucleases of influenza viruses and bunyaviruses. However, the observed differences in the topology of the cap-binding sites of influenza virus and RVFV are likely to be a challenge for the design of broad-spectrum inhibitors targeting cap-binding. Further structures of <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> cap-binding domains are essential to evaluate this option. The structural and functional data presented here, provide evidence for the existence of a functional cap-binding domain in bunyavirus L protein essential for viral transcription as well as the foundation for structure based drug development against RVFV cap-snatching mechanism.</p>

<p>We thank Tobias Holm for excellent technical assistance and fruitful discussions. The synchrotron MX data was collected at beamline P13 operated by EMBL Hamburg at the PETRA III storage ring (DESY, Hamburg, Germany). We would like to thank Thomas Schneider, Isabel Bento and Guillaume Pompidor for the assistance in using the beamline. We also thank the team of the EMBL Hamburg Sample Preparation and Crystallization (SPC) facility, in particular Maria Garcia Alai, Angelica Struve and Stefan Niebling, for support of ITC measurements. We thank Colin McVey and Micael Freitas for the 3C-Protease expression plasmid and purification protocol. Moreover, we thank Stephen Cusack and Dominik Vogel for fruitful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript as well as the Dr. Ing. Wilhelm und Maria Kirmser Stiftung for essential equipment.</p>
