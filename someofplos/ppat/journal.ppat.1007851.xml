<abstract>
<p>Enteropathogenic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (EPEC) is an extracellular diarrheagenic human pathogen which infects the apical plasma membrane of the small intestinal enterocytes. EPEC utilizes a type III secretion system to translocate bacterial effector proteins into its epithelial hosts. This activity, which subverts numerous signaling and membrane trafficking pathways in the infected cells, is thought to contribute to pathogen virulence. The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these events are not well understood. We investigated the mode by which EPEC effectors hijack endosomes to modulate endocytosis, recycling and transcytosis in epithelial host cells. To this end, we developed a flow cytometry-based assay and imaging techniques to track endosomal dynamics and membrane cargo trafficking in the infected cells. We show that type-III secreted components prompt the recruitment of clathrin (clathrin and AP2), early (Rab5a and EEA1) and recycling (Rab4a, Rab11a, Rab11b, FIP2, Myo5b) endocytic machineries to peripheral plasma membrane infection sites. Protein cargoes, e.g. transferrin receptors, β1 integrins and aquaporins, which exploit the endocytic pathways mediated by these machineries, were also found to be recruited to these sites. Moreover, the endosomes and cargo recruitment to infection sites correlated with an increase in cargo endocytic turnover (i.e. endocytosis and recycling) and transcytosis to the infected plasma membrane. The hijacking of endosomes and associated endocytic activities depended on the translocated EspF and Map effectors in non-polarized epithelial cells, and mostly on EspF in polarized epithelial cells. These data suggest a model whereby EPEC effectors hijack endosomal recycling mechanisms to mislocalize and concentrate host plasma membrane proteins in endosomes and in the apically infected plasma membrane. We hypothesize that these activities contribute to bacterial colonization and virulence.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EPEC) are pathogenic bacteria that cause infantile diarrhea. Upon ingestion, EPEC reaches the small intestine, where an injection device termed the type III secretion system is utilized to inject a set of effector proteins from the bacteria into the host cell. These proteins manipulate the localization and functions of host proteins, lipids and organelles and contribute to the emergence of the EPEC disease. The molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of the EPEC effector proteins are not completely understood. Here we show that early upon infection, two such effector proteins, EspF and Map, hijack host endosomes at bacterial adherence sites to facilitate endocytosis and recycling of plasma membrane proteins at these sites. The consequence of this event is the enrichment and mislocalization of host plasma membrane proteins at infection sites. One such protein is the transferrin receptor, which is a carrier for transferrin, whose function is to mediate cellular uptake of iron. Iron is a critical nutrient for bacterial growth and survival. We postulate that the unique manipulation of transferrin receptor endocytic membrane trafficking by EPEC plays an important role in its survival on the luminal surface of the intestinal epithelium.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EHEC) are diarrheagenic extracellular pathogens affecting humans worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref001">1</xref>]. EPEC utilizes a molecular syringe termed type III secretion system (T3SS) to deliver a set of effector proteins from the bacterial cytoplasm into the host cell. The coordinated action of these effectors in space and time is critical for remodeling diverse host cell organelles and processes, e.g. the cytoskeleton, signaling pathways and intracellular trafficking, to support successful bacterial colonization and survival in the intestinal mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref004">4</xref>]. A prominent hallmark of EPEC infection is the induction of “attaching and effacing” (AE) lesions of the mucosal tissue, characterized by intimate microbial attachment to the apical plasma membrane of the infected epithelial cells, local elimination of brush border microvilli and the formation of a filamentous actin (F-actin)-rich membrane protrusion (often called pedestal) located immediately beneath the attached bacterium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>EPEC (strain O127:H6 E2348/69) translocates via its T3SS at least 21 ‘effector’ proteins into its host. These effectors are encoded by genes in the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island, and by outside the LEE (non-LEE) genomic sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref008">8</xref>]. The first translocated effector is the intimin receptor (Tir) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref009">9</xref>]. Upon translocation, Tir is incorporated into the host cell plasma membrane and its exposed extracellular domain binds the bacterial outer membrane protein, intimin. Tir-intimin interactions allow intimate attachment of the bacterium to its host plasma membrane and the formation of the F-actin rich pedestal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref003">3</xref>]. Other injected effectors manipulate various processes in the host, including signaling pathways and immune response processes, cytoskeletal remodeling, the subversion of epithelial junctional components and membrane trafficking pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref012">12</xref>]. Notably, however, limited information exists about the capacity of such effectors to manipulate membrane trafficking pathways of their host and, in particular, endosomal trafficking. Exploring the capacity of these effectors to hijack and manipulate endocytic trafficking pathways in a way that benefits the pathogen is important for better understanding the mechanisms by which EPEC colonizes its host.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that regulators of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) are recruited to sites of EPEC infection. These include phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref013">13</xref>], dynamin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref014">14</xref>], the adaptor proteins Eps15 and epsin1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref015">15</xref>], Dab2 and Hip1R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref016">16</xref>], CD2AP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref017">17</xref>] and clathrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref018">18</xref>]. The recruitment of these components has been linked to the process of actin-rich pedestal formation. However, whether these recruitments are directly caused by injected effectors or a result of a broad host response to the bacterial assault is not known. The endocytic Rab5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref019">19</xref>], and the recycling VAMP3,Rab11 and Rab35 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref021">21</xref>] protein markers have also been shown to be subverted by EPEC and EHEC. Nonetheless, neither study addressed the question of whether these endocytic regulators are recruited to infection sites and by what mechanism.</p>
<p>Data linking EPEC type III secreted effectors to endocytic trafficking have shown that the protein effector EspF transiently interacts with pre-existing clathrin-coated pits, and binds neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) as well as the dynamin-associated PX-BAR domain sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref023">23</xref>]. Recently, Tapia et al. have shown that EspF is involved in facilitating basolateral endocytosis and apical redistribution of the Crumbs polarity complex and Na+/K+ ATPase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref019">19</xref>]. However, the mode by which EspF regulates these endocytic activities remains unknown. Here we show that early upon EPEC microcolony attachment to non-polarized host cells, EspF and Map prompt the recruitment of transferrin receptors (TfnR) and Rab11a-positive recycling endosomes to peripheral infection sites. This event may contribute to an increase in TfnR endocytosis and recycling (i.e. endocytic turnover) at these sites. We identified three novel EspF binding proteins, WIPF1, SNX18 and SNX33, which together with N-WASP and SNX9 could contribute to endocytic remodeling of the host. In polarized cells, we show that EspF is sufficient to promote basolateral-to-apical transcytosis of TfnR and increase in apical endocytic turnover. Our results tie for the first time the activity of an EPEC effector protein to endosomal dynamics and breakdown of surface polarity of infected cells. This event could lead to enrichment of the apical infected plasma membrane and endosomes with basolateral membrane proteins that contribute to bacterial colonization and the EPEC disease.</p>

<title>T3SS-dependent recruitment of early and recycling endocytic elements, and Tfn-TfnR, to apical infection sites</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that EPEC and EHEC subvert various elements of the clathrin-coated pits endocytic and recycling machineries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref024">24</xref>]. However, the extent to which T3SS elements are involved in this event has been sparsely studied. We therefore investigated the T3SS dependence of the distribution of clathrin endocytic (CHC, AP2-α, Rab5a and EEA1) and recycling [Rab11a, Rab11b, Rab25, Myosin 5b (Myo5b)] components upon EPEC infection of polarized MDCK cells. Results show that all these markers accumulated at EPEC-<italic>wt</italic>, and not at EPEC-<italic>escV</italic> infection sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). These data suggest the involvement of type III secreted elements in the recruitment of early and recycling endocytic components to bacterial infection sites at the apical plasma membrane.</p>
<p>Transferrin receptors (TfnR) are basolateral recycling membrane proteins that typically do not reach the sub-apical Rab11a/Rab25 endosomal recycling compartment (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref025">25</xref>]) unless they are enforced to undergo transcytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref026">26</xref>]. We analyzed whether the distribution of TfnR and their Tfn cargo is altered in response to EPEC infection of polarized MDCK-PTR9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s002">S2A Fig</xref>), Caco2-BBe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), or MDCK-GFP-TfnR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s003">S3A Fig</xref>) cells. Fluorescently-tagged Tfn was internalized either from the apical, or from the basolateral (basal) plasma membrane of the polarized cells concomitant to apical exposure to EPEC-<italic>wt</italic> or EPEC-<italic>escV</italic>. The ligand distribution along the basal-apical axis of the cells was analyzed in fixed (MDCK-PTR9 and Caco2-BBe), and live (MDCK-GFP-TfnR) cells by confocal microscopy. Tfn internalized from either cell pole was found to be clustered at EPEC-<italic>wt</italic>, but not at EPEC-<italic>escV</italic>, infection sites. Surface immunostained TfnR (s-TfnR) also showed significant clustering at EPEC-<italic>wt</italic>, compared to EPEC-<italic>escV</italic> infected cells. Interestingly, SH3BP4 and ACAP1, which have been shown to promote TfnR endocytosis and recycling by binding to the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref028">28</xref>], were also recruited to infection sites in a T3SS-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s003">S3B Fig</xref>).

<title>Basolaterally internalized Tfn partially co-localized with Rab11a/Myo5b at apical infection sites and undergoes transcytosis</title>
<p>To investigate further the characteristics of apically recruited Tfn/TfnR, we examined the localization of basolaterally internalized Tfn with respect to the Rab11a, a GTPase suggested to be involved in transcytosis. Confocal imaging revealed that the basolaterally internalized Tfn clustered at apical infection sites in a T3SS dependent manner and that the Tfn apical clusters partially co-localized with Rab11a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) and with the full-length (FL) GFP-Myo5b (Myo5b-FL) motor that moves Rab11a-positive vesicles along actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).

<p>In polarized MDCK cells, the Myo5b motor has been suggested to play a role in transcytosis, but not in basolateral recycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref030">30</xref>]. Ectopically expressed Myo5b-FL co-clustered with Rab11a and basolaterally internalized Tfn at apical bacterial infection sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). These data further support the possibility that Tfn internalized from the basolateral pole accessed the Rab11-Myo5b positive apical recycling endosomes. Interestingly, ectopically expressed GFP-Myo5b-tail (Myo5b-tail) appeared as aggregates colocalizing with Rab11a, but not with basolaterally internalized Tfn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g001">Fig 1B</xref>; <bold>red arrows</bold>). Expression of Myo5b-tail inhibited the recruitment of Rab11a and Tfn to the infection sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <bold>yellow arrows</bold>), suggesting that Myo5b is involved in the trafficking of basolaterally internalized TfnR to the apical recycling endosomes at the infection sites. These findings show that Myo5b-tail was able to inhibit Tfn recruitment at the infection site without sequestering it at the Myo5b aggregates. This outcome can be explained in light of previous studies suggesting that Myo5b motors can act on basolateral recycling endosomes by sequestering Rab11-family interacting proteins, e.g. FIP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref031">31</xref>], which are part of the Rab11-FIP2-Myo5b complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g001">Fig 1C</xref> show that basolaterally internalized Tfn was released at a greater extent into the apical medium of EPEC-<italic>wt</italic>, compared to EPEC-<italic>escV</italic> infected cells. TR-Dextran (70 kDa) added to the apical medium showed negligible release to the basolateral medium in the infected cells, suggesting that the epithelial barrier remained intact under the experimental conditions employed. Taken together, these data suggest that type III secreted elements evoke basolateral-to-apical transcytosis of TfnR, a process that can contribute to the increased steady-state apical localization of s-TfnR in EPEC-<italic>wt</italic> infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>EPEC promotes type III secretion-dependent increase in apical endocytic turnover</title>
<p>The observation that early endocytic and recycling machineries are recruited to infection sites has raised the hypothesis that EPEC modulates them to control membrane trafficking at the infected plasma membrane. To address this hypothesis, we examined whether EPEC infected cells display altered Tfn internalization and recycling capacities. To this end, MDCK-PTR9 cells were infected and concomitantly exposed to Tfn administered at either the apical or the basolateral poles of the cells. In the case of apically internalized Tfn, one set of EPEC-<italic>wt</italic> infected cells was treated with the dynamin inhibitor Dynasore. Cells were then washed, lysed and the amount of cell-associated Tfn was analyzed by Western blotting. Data showed an apparent increase in cell-associated Tfn only when the ligand was administered to the apical surface of EPEC-<italic>wt</italic> infected cells. The apical intake of Tfn by the Dynasore treated cells was significantly lower compared to EPEC-<italic>wt</italic> infected cells and uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

<p>To further validate this conclusion, we applied a flow-cytometry-based assay for monitoring Tfn endocytosis and recycling. Polarized MDCK-PTR9 cells were infected with EPEC-<italic>wt</italic>, or EPEC-<italic>escV</italic>, or left uninfected, in the presence of fluorescently-tagged Tfn applied at either the apical, or the basolateral (basal) poles of the cells. Thereafter, adherent cells were detached from their substrate and cell-associated Tfn was determined by flow cytometry. Results showed an apparent increase in cell-associated Tfn only in EPEC-<italic>wt</italic> infected cells that were exposed to apical Tfn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The EPEC-<italic>wt</italic> driven increase in Tfn endocytosis was also observed in polarized MDCK-GFP-TfnR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), and in Caco2-BBe cells, which express endogenously the hTfnR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). The intake of fluorescently labeled Tfn by EPEC-<italic>wt</italic> infected cells was diminished when an excess of unlabeled Tfn was co-administered with Tfn-AF647 to the apical plasma membrane of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In contrast, the addition of unlabeled Tfn to the basolateral compartment had no effect on the EPEC-induced intake of Tfn-AF647 added to the apical plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). These data further argue that Tfn is specifically internalized from the infected apical plasma membrane. Finally, we used flow cytometry to monitor the effects that EPEC infection may have on the release (i.e. apical recycling) of apically internalized Tfn. Results showed enhanced Tfn release in response to EPEC-<italic>wt</italic> infection, compared to EPEC-<italic>escV</italic> and uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Together, these data suggest that type III secreted components stimulate apical endocytosis and recycling of Tfn, i.e. increase the apical endocytic turnover of the ligand.</p>

Collectively, these data suggest that the recruitment effects were specific for cargoes utilizing CME and Rab11 recycling endosomes.

<title>EPEC promotes redistribution of endosomes from perinuclear to peripheral sites</title>
<p>In non-polarized cells, internalized TfnR utilizes either a fast constitutive recycling pathway i.e. shuttling to the cell surface from early recycling endosomes or a slow pathway that involves the transport via perinuclear Rab11-positive recycling endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref034">34</xref>]. The latter is thought to play a key role in directing recycling proteins to specific and specialized cellular locations on the cell surface, such as the leading edges of motile cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref036">36</xref>]. On the basis of these paradigms, we hypothesized that T3SS elements mediate the trafficking of TfnR from the slow perinuclear/pericentriolar recycling endosomal compartment to infection sites confined to the host periphery. To address this hypothesis, endosomes of uninfected, EPEC-<italic>escV</italic>, or EPEC-<italic>wt</italic> infected HeLa cells were loaded with Tfn-AF647 and imaged by confocal microscopy. The area of perinuclear recycling endosomes was determined. As predicted, internalized Tfn accumulated at the perinuclear recycling endosomal compartment of uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <bold>red arrow</bold>). The area occupied by this compartment was not significantly altered in EPEC-<italic>escV</italic> infected cells. In contrast, the area of the perinuclear endosomal compartment was considerably diminished in EPEC-<italic>wt</italic> infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The majority of Tfn positive endosomes apparently redistributed mainly to the periphery of the cells and concentrated at the infection sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g003">Fig 3A</xref>; <bold>yellow and green arrows</bold>). We applied single particle image analysis to explore whether Tfn is enriched in individual peripheral endosomes of the infected cells. As expected, data showed significant enrichment of Tfn in TfnR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) and in EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g003">Fig 3C</xref>)-positive peripheral endosomes in EPEC-<italic>wt</italic>, but not in EPEC-<italic>escV</italic> or uninfected cells. EEA1 acts downstream of Rab4 (fast recycling) and Rab5 (early) endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref039">39</xref>]. Thus, the fact that Tfn was enriched in EEA1-positive endosomes suggests that EPEC type III secreted elements shifted the pathway of Tfn from slow to fast recycling endosomes. The increased abundance of Tfn-positive endosomes at peripheral infection sites in EPEC-<italic>wt</italic> compared to EPEC-<italic>escV</italic> infected cells could also be observed at the ultrastructural level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).</p>

<title>EPEC type III secreted components prompt the shuttling of Rab11a/Tfn endosomes from perinuclear to peripheral infection sites</title>
<p>We asked whether vectorial shuttling of Tfn/Rab11a-positive endosomes takes place from perinuclear to peripheral infection sites.

<p>To further elucidate this notion, we used Dynasore and Dyngo, which inhibit endocytosis but not recycling of clathrin-dependent cargoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref040">40</xref>]. HeLa cells were first treated with Dynasore or Dyngo and then exposed to EPEC and Tfn-AF647. Cells treated with DMSO served as controls. The localization of Tfn, Rab5a, EEA1 (endocytic markers) and Rab11a (recycling marker) in these cells was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Interestingly, while Tfn, Rab5a and EEA1 showed very low levels of clustering at infection sites, Rab11a displayed significantly higher clustering at these sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s009">S9A Fig</xref>).

<title>Myo5b plays a role in EPEC-induced recruitment of endosomes to infection sites</title>
<p>As the movement of TfnR-Rab11 positive recycling endosomes is controlled by Myo5b motors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref032">32</xref>], we asked whether Myo5b is involved in their recruitment at infection sites. To address this question, the following constructs were ectopically expressed in HeLa cells: GFP-Myo5b-FL, the GFP-Myo5b-tail mutant (Myo5b-tail), which harbors the Rab8/Rab11 C-terminal binding motif but lacks the ability to mobilize Rab11-dependent cargo due to deleted N-terminal motor domain, the GFP-Myo5b tail-QLYC mutant, which binds Rab11 but not Rab8a, and the GFP-Myo5b-tail-YEQR mutant, which does not bind Rab11 but binds Rab8a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref041">41</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s018">S3 Table</xref>). Consistent with previous data, over expression of Myo5b-tail and Myo5b-tail-QLYC, but not of Myo5b-FL or Myo5b-tail-YEQR, resulted in the sequestration of Rab11a and Tfn into large intracellular puncta (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s010">S10A Fig</xref>). These data further corroborate the existence of a correlation between the ability of these Myo5b mutants to sequester Rab11a-Tfn endosomes and to reduce s-TfnR levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s010">S10B Fig</xref>). These effects are contributed by the ability of Myo5b-tail mutants to inhibit Tfn recycling, resulting in the retention and accumulation of internalized Tfn within the cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s010">S10C Fig</xref>). Infection of these cells with EPEC-<italic>wt</italic> resulted in significant Tfn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) and Rab11a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) recruitment in Myo5b-FL or Myo5b-tail-YEQR, but not in Myo5b-tail or Myo5b-tail-QLYC expressing cells. Infection with EPEC-<italic>wt</italic> induced Tfn endocytosis in Myo5b-FL or Myo5b-tail-YEQR, but not in Myo5b-tail or Myo5b-tail-QLYC expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). These data suggest that EPEC requires accessible Rab11 and functional Myo5b motors for recruiting TfnR and Rab11a-positive endosomes to peripheral plasma membrane infection sites, and for stimulating Tfn endocytosis.</p>

Additionally, a significant diminishment in perinuclear recycling endosomal area size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s011">S11B Fig</xref>), and an increase in Tfn endocytic turnover (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s011">S11C Fig</xref>) were observed in these cells.

<title>EspF and Map stimulate the recruitment of Tfn/TfnR, Myo5b and Rab11a at infection sites in nonpolarized cells</title>
<p>Next, we aimed at identifying type III secreted effectors that might mediate the clustering of Rab11a and Tfn-positive endosomes at bacterial infection sites. HeLa cells were infected with a series of EPEC strains mutated in their LEE, or non-LEE effector encoding genes, and concomitantly exposed to Tfn-AF647. Cells were then fixed, subjected to F-actin staining and confocal imaging. Results show that, compared to EPEC-<italic>wt</italic> infected cells, infection with EPEC-<italic>espF</italic>, EPEC-<italic>map</italic>, EPEC-<italic>cesT</italic>, or EPEC-<italic>escV</italic> resulted in low levels of Tfn/TfnR clustering at infection sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). F-actin recruitment to EPEC-<italic>espF</italic> and EPEC-<italic>map</italic> infection sites was not significantly altered compared to EPEC-<italic>wt</italic>, suggesting that the reduced Tfn clustering is not contributed by the capacity of EPEC to recruit F-actin. Inefficient Tfn/TfnR clustering in the EPEC-<italic>cesT</italic> infected cells is likely contributed by inefficient Map translocation that is partially mediated by the CesT chaperone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref043">43</xref>].

Neither EPEC-<italic>espF</italic> nor EPEC-<italic>map</italic> had an effect on mRFP-LifeAct recruitment to these sites, suggesting again that the effects obtained in EPEC-<italic>espF</italic> infected cells were not contributed by alterations in F-actin. We then infected polarized MDCK cells co-expressing mRFP-LifeAct and GFP-Rab11a, or mRFP-LifeAct and GFP-TfnR with EPEC-<italic>espF</italic>, or EPEC-<italic>espF</italic>+EspF. The results showed diminished GFP-Rab11a and GFP-TfnR clustering in EPEC-<italic>espF</italic> compared to EPEC-<italic>espF</italic>+EspF infected cells, suggesting that the recruitment of these proteins to apical infection sites is EspF dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, <bold>upper</bold>). The clustering of Tfn internalized from the basolateral pole of the GFP-TfnR expressing cells at apical infection sites also showed EspF dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g009">Fig 9B</xref>, <bold>lower</bold>). Based on previous observations, these data suggest that EspF increases Tfn-endocytic turnover and Tfn basolateral-to-apical transcytosis. Indeed, data obtained by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g009">Fig 9C</xref>) and transcytosis assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g009">Fig 9D</xref>) concur with this notion.</p>

<p><bold>(A) Major host cell proteins co-immunoprecipitated with EspF</bold>. HeLa cells were infected with EPEC-<italic>espF</italic> or <italic>espF</italic>+EspF. The Flag-tagged EspF was immunoprecipitated and co-immunoprecipitated proteins were identified, as described in Methods. 232 proteins were identified in at least two of four replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s021">S6 Table</xref>). Student’s t-test was used to assess which proteins were significantly more abundant in the EspF pull-down compared to the control sample. Six proteins enriched by at least 80-fold with p-value &lt; 0.05 were retrieved. One is EspF itself (not shown), three are sorting nexin proteins (SNX9, SNX18, and SNX33) and two are actin polymerization regulators, WIPF1 (WASP/WASL-interacting protein) and N-WASP (also named WASL). <bold>(B) STRING protein interaction analysis</bold>. To identify potential interactions within the EspF binders, we used the STRING protein interaction database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref085">85</xref>], updated in September 2018, under the highest confidence and experimentally validated interaction setting. Cluster analysis shows that WIPF1, WASL, SNX9 and SNX18 form a highly connected interaction network with experimentally validated interactions (based on the STRING annotation), suggesting that these proteins are pulled-down as one interaction unit. Previous studies have identified only SNX9 and N-WASP/WASL as EspF binding partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref023">23</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results show that EPEC type III secreted components stimulate the recruitment of clathrin-dependent early (Rab5a, EEA1) and recycling (e.g. Rab11a, Rab11b, Rab4a, Rab25, Myo5b, FIP2) endocytic machineries to plasma membrane infection sites of polarized and non-polarized epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s001">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s004">S4A and S4B</xref> Figs). These rearrangements, which occur early upon EPEC microcolony contacting the host (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), coincided with enhanced endocytosis and recycling activities, i.e. increased endocytic turnover, at that host cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s008">S8 Fig</xref>), and with basolateral-to-apical transcytosis of basolaterally recycled cargoes, e.g. TfnR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The consequence of these events is the enrichment of the infected plasma membrane with specific membrane proteins.</p>
<p>The recruitment of endosomes to infection sites is mediated by several mechanisms. From the ‘host cell perspective’, Myo5b motors are required to mobilize Rab11-positive recycling endosomes and their cargoes to host infection sites. In non-polarized cells, this process involves Myo5b-dependent shuttling of Rab11 endosomes and their cargoes from perinuclear slow recycling endosomes to peripheral infection sites (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g004">4</xref>). In polarized cells, the process involves Myo5b-dependent shuttling of basolaterally internalized cargoes to apical infection sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In both cases, the enrichment of peripheral infection sites with recycling endosomes could play an important role in facilitating endocytic turnover near these sites. This hypothesis is supported by previous studies suggesting that the shift in cargo localization from slow perinuclear to fast peripheral recycling endosomes results in an increased endocytic turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref050">50</xref>]. In our studies, depletion of Rab11 in non-polarized cells caused loss of perinuclear endosomes, and increased the abundance of peripheral endosomes and endocytic turnover (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). Infection with EPEC-<italic>wt</italic>, did not affect the endocytic turnover in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g006">Fig 6</xref>), probably because it could not further redistribute the already peripherally redistributed endosomes.</p>
<p>From the ‘pathogen’s perspective', we identified EspF and Map as the protein effectors which mediate endosomal recruitment to infection sites and the increase in endocytic turnover in non-polarized cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g008">8</xref>). Interestingly, EspF, but not Map, has been identified as mediating these activities in polarized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g009">Fig 9</xref>), emphasizing the role of EspF in the process. This conclusion may coincide with recent data suggesting that EspF, but not Map, is involved in the disruption of epithelial cell polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref019">19</xref>]. EspF and Map may perform these activities immediately upon translocation into the host and prior to reaching mitochondria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s013">S13B Fig</xref>). Studies have shown that EspF interacts with high specificity and strong affinity with the eukaryotic SNX9 and N-WASP to mediate endocytic membrane remodeling coupled to Arp2/3 actin nucleation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref023">23</xref>]. Using co-immunoprecipitation followed by proteomics and Western blotting analyses, we confirmed these interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g010">Fig 10A and 10C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s021">S6 Table</xref>). SNX9, SNX18 and SNX33, which represent a subgroup of SNX-BAR (Bin, Amphiphysin, Rvs) sorting nexins are predicted to function as modulators of endocytosis and endosomal sorting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref051">51</xref>]. Studies have shown that SNX18 interacts with the Rab11 family interacting protein (FIP) 5, and that these interactions are required for membrane tubulation and polarized transport of apical proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref052">52</xref>]. We identified SNX18, SNX33 and WIPF1 as novel interactors of EspF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g010">Fig 10A and 10C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s021">S6 Table</xref>). Thus, while the interactions of EspF with SNX9 and with WASP/WIPF1 may be linked to the ability of the effector protein to activate endocytosis (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g008">8G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g009">9C</xref>), the interactions with SNX18 could play a role in Rab11/FIP5 dependent cargo shuttling to the infected apical plasma membrane. Interestingly, EspF seems to interact with SNX18 and SNX33 through the previously identified SNX9 binding motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g010">Fig 10D</xref>). These SNX-EspF interactions may mediate the EspF-dependent increase in endocytic activity.</p>
<p>Our data also indicate that the Map’s GEF and PDZ binding domain play a role in eliciting endocytic turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g008">Fig 8H</xref>). These observations are consistent with previous studies implicating Cdc42 in modulating a functional connection between the actin cytoskeleton and endocytic traffic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref054">54</xref>], and in the induction of endocytic membrane turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref055">55</xref>]. The significance of the PDZ binding motif of Map, which binds EBP50, could be explained by a role attributed to EBP50 in endocytic recycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref056">56</xref>]. Notably, Clements et al have reported that translocated EspG imposed inhibition of endosomal recycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref021">21</xref>] by targeting the TfnR/Rab11/Rab35 positive recycling endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref020">20</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that EspG counterbalances the endocytic and recycling activities elicited by EspF and Map.</p>
<p>The functional significance of these events with respect to the pathogen and host cell physiology could be broad. It would be reasonable to assume that the lumen of the infected gut, particularly following experiencing acute diarrhea, is depleted of nutrients. We suggest that upon landing on the apical cell surface of small intestinal enterocytes, the pathogen generates a local niche that enables nutrient acquisition from the serosal environment. One way of achieving this is by apical missorting of basolateral plasma membrane proteins which carry micronutrients from the blood, such as TfnR bound to iron-loaded Tfn. Indeed, bacterial pathogens have evolved remarkably efficient strategies to hijack iron from their host, a critical micronutrient for their homeostasis and growth, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref057">57</xref>], including from transferrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref059">59</xref>]. Here we show increased EPEC colonization of host cells exposed to iron-loaded Tfn that has been introduced either to the basolateral or the apical poles of polarized MDCK-PTR9 cells. A similar phenomenon was seen when these cells were exposed to free iron. However, such an increase was not observed in parental MDCK cells, which express very low levels of the native canine receptors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s014">S14 Fig</xref>). These data suggest that apically infecting EPEC is capable of hijacking and accessing iron bound Tfn even when the ligand is internalized from the basolateral side of the cells, likely by importing the cargo to the apically infected plasma membrane via transcytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This process seems to be vital for promoting bacterial colonization of the infected cell surface. Another possible way is the weakening of the tight junction barrier functions, which may allow the infiltration of nutrients from the blood to bacteria adhered to apical cell-cell junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref005">5</xref>]. Interestingly, tight junctions disruption has been attributed to several EPEC effectors, including effectors investigated in this study, EspF and Map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref010">10</xref>]. We suggest that through both these activities the pathogen gains a survival advantage over other bacteria (e.g. commensals), resulting in successful colonization and infection of the gut.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that infection with the murine A/E pathogen <italic>C</italic>. <italic>rodentium</italic> resulted in mislocalization of the water channels aquaporin 2 and 3 (AQP2 and AQP3) from the host cell membranes to the cytoplasm. The process, which was partially dependent on EspF and EspG, correlated with a diarrhea-like phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref060">60</xref>]. More recently, transiently expressed eGFP-AQP3 was observed at EPEC infection sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref061">61</xref>]. Studies have shown that similar to the TfnR, AQP2 utilizes the clathrin-dynamin dependent endocytic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref063">63</xref>], as well as the Myo5b and Rab11-FIP2 recycling route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref064">64</xref>]. Moreover, AQP2 has been localized to the apical or basolateral surfaces of polarized epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref065">65</xref>], while AQP3 was localized exclusively to the basolateral surface of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref067">67</xref>]. Here we found that native AQP2 and AQP3 are recruited to EPEC infection sites in a T3SS-dependent manner and that both water transporters colocalized with Myo5b (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007851.s015">S15 Fig</xref>). Thus, it is possible that similarly to TfnR, EPEC utilizes type III secreted effectors to mislocalize aquaporins to Myo5b/Rab11 recycling endosomes, a process that could alter the water homeostasis in the infected cells and thereby lead to the diarrheal effect.</p>
<p>To summarize, our data suggest the following model. In non-polarized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g011">Fig 11A</xref>), translocated EspF and Map promote the biogenesis and nucleation of early and recycling endosomes in proximity to plasma membrane infection sites. Actin has shown to be important for endosomal membrane remodeling, endosomal dynamics and plasma membrane protein (cargo) recycling (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref068">68</xref>]). Thus, EspF and Map may achieve their subversive effect through interactions with actin modulators, e.g. Map-mediated activation of Cdc42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref069">69</xref>] and EspF interactions with N-Wasp and cortactin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref070">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref071">71</xref>]. The end result of these activities is a local increase in endocytic turnover and enrichment of recycling plasma membrane proteins at the infection sites. In polarized epithelial cells, another layer of complexity is added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007851.g011">Fig 11B</xref>). Basolateral recycling plasma membrane cargoes, e.g. TfnR and AQP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref067">67</xref>], are sorted, likely by EspF and yet unidentified other effector proteins, to Rab11/Myo5b-positive apical recycling endosomes hijacked to the apical infection sites. These endosomes then utilize their apical recycling capacity to target these cargoes to the infected apical plasma membrane. The consequence of this event is misrouting of basolateral plasma membrane proteins to apical recycling endosomes and plasma membrane infection sites. Some of these proteins may give a survival advantage to the pathogen, while others may disturb the host physiology. A future challenge would be to explore the molecular mechanisms by which EspF (and other protein effectors) target the polarized endocytic sorting machinery of the host, and to elucidate how this contributes to bacterial colonization and virulence.</p>

<title>Schematic model of EPEC-induced recruitment of TfnR-Rab11-positive endosomes at infection sites of non-polarized (A) and polarized (B) epithelial cells.</title>
<p>In non-polarized cells, EPEC, through its effectors EspF and Map, prompts Myo5b-dependent shuttling of Rab11-positive recycling endosomes to the peripheral infected plasma membrane, where some are clustered at bacterial infection sites. These endosomes exert local endocytic and recycling activities, thereby stimulating the endocytic turnover of plasma membrane proteins at the infected plasma membrane. This activity enriches the plasma membrane infection sites with the missorted endosomes and their cargo proteins. In polarized cells, the Rab11-positive apical recycling endosomes are located beneath the infected (apical) plasma membrane, promoting apical recycling of apical plasma membrane protein. They also utilize their apical recycling capacity to promote transcytosis of basolaterally recycled cargo that has been missorted from the common endosomes to the apical recycling endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007851.ref025">25</xref>]. Upon infection, translocated EspF promotes Myo5b-dependent recruitment of the Rab11-positive apical recycling endosomes to infection sites, where they locally foster endocytosis and recycling (i.e. endocytic turnover). We hypothesize that EspF, and possibly additional protein effectors, interfere with the basolateral recycling sorting machinery. The consequence of this event is missorting of internalized basolateral plasma membrane recycling proteins (e.g. TfnR) from the common endosomes (which mediate basolateral recycling) to the subapical Rab11 recycling endosomes hijacked by EPEC (dashed line arrows). These endosomes then use their apical recycling capacity to translocate the basolateral plasma membrane proteins into apical plasma membrane infection sites, where they undergo continuous endocytosis and apical recycling. This activity enriches the apical plasma membrane infection sites with plasma membrane proteins originally derived from the basolateral surface of the host.</p>

For HeLa cells infected with EPEC-<italic>espF</italic>+EspF or EPEC-<italic>map</italic>+Map, expression of the protein effectors was induced by adding 0.2mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for the last 30 min of the activation step. For polarized MDCK cells infected with these EPEC strains, expression of the protein effectors was induced by introducing 0.2mM IPTG into the medium during the last 60 min of the infection. Deviations from these conditions are indicated in the text. All infections were performed in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 90% humidity).</p>

In this region, the noise signal in individual confocal image Z-slices (0.5μm thick) was filtered by the ‘Mean filter’ tool (radius, 1.0 pixel) and the fluorescence intensity threshold (100–1200 AU for TfnR and 100–1000 AU for EEA1) was set to levels allowing visualization of distinct particles (endosomes). Under these conditions, the smallest (0.2μm<sup>2</sup>) and the largest (2.0 μm<sup>2</sup>) visually distinct particles (i.e. endosomes) were identified and converted to Regions Of Interest (ROI) by the FIJI ‘Particle Analysis’ tool, under restriction for size (0.2–2.0 μm<sup>2</sup>) and for particle circularity (0.5–1.0).
