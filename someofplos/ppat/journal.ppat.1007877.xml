<abstract>
<p>Rapid bone destruction often leads to permanent joint dysfunction in patients with septic arthritis, which is mainly caused by <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>). Staphylococcal cell wall components are known to induce joint inflammation and bone destruction. Here, we show that a single intra-articular injection of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> lipoproteins (Lpps) into mouse knee joints induced chronic destructive macroscopic arthritis through TLR2. Arthritis was characterized by rapid infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes. The arthritogenic effect was mediated mainly by macrophages/monocytes and partially via TNF-α but not by neutrophils. Surprisingly, a <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> mutant lacking Lpp diacylglyceryl transferase (<italic>lgt</italic>) caused more severe joint inflammation, which coincided with higher bacterial loads of the <italic>lgt</italic> mutant in local joints than those of its parental strain. Coinjection of pathogenic <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> LS-1 with staphylococcal Lpps into mouse knee joints caused improved bacterial elimination and diminished bone erosion. The protective effect of the Lpps was mediated by their lipid moiety and was fully dependent on TLR2 and neutrophils. The blocking of CXCR2 on neutrophils resulted in total abrogation of the protective effect of the Lpps. Our data demonstrate that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> Lpps elicit innate immune responses, resulting in a double-edged effect. On the one hand, staphylococcal Lpps boost septic arthritis. On the other hand, Lpps act as adjuvants and activate innate immunity, which could be useful for combating infections with multiple drug-resistant strains.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Rapid bone destruction often leads to permanent joint dysfunction in septic arthritis, which is mainly caused by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. Despite advances in the use of antibiotics, permanent reductions in joint function occur in up to 50% of patients, who may also need joint replacement surgery. Additional challenge is posed by increasing antibiotic resistance of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>, causing significant clinical and economic consequences. Although the outcome is poor, the current treatments for septic arthritis remain unchanged since many decades. It is largely unknown which bacterial factors cause aggressive joint damage. Here, we show that a single intra-articular injection of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> lipoproteins (Lpps) into mouse knee joints induced chronic destructive macroscopic arthritis, and the monocytes/macrophages were the main culprit. However, coinjection of pathogenic <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> with Lpps into mouse knee joints attenuated the disease. The protective effect of Lpps was mediated by their lipid moiety, TLR2 on the host cells, neutrophil chemokine release, and consequent neutrophil recruitment. Our finding might be used as a novel concept in the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite colonizing more than half of the human population at some stage during their life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref001">1</xref>], <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>) is a highly pathogenic microorganism responsible for a broad range of infections in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref002">2</xref>]. Septic arthritis, considered to be one of the most aggressive joint diseases, is most commonly caused by <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref003">3</xref>]. In a mouse model, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> induced severe bone destruction 5 days postinfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref004">4</xref>]. In patients, even after initiating immediate treatment, the joint damage caused by septic arthritis is often irreversible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref005">5</xref>], leading to permanent joint dysfunction in up to half of the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref006">6</xref>]. Furthermore, the emergence of methicillin-resistant <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> (MRSA) has severely reduced the available treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref007">7</xref>]. To limit the immune response and reduce the risk of permanent joint destruction, a combination treatment of antibiotics with immunomodulatory therapy has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref009">9</xref>]. However, there are potential dangers associated with such combination therapies as long as the challenge of antibiotic resistance remains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref011">11</xref>]. Therefore, the identification of the bacterial components responsible for joint inflammation and destruction is key for the development of new therapies. Antibiotic-killed <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> is known to induce destructive arthritis, and the bacterial cell wall components are the culprits in this context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref012">12</xref>]. Among the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> cell wall components, lipoproteins (Lpps) are Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonists and the main immune stimulators, while lipoteichoic acids are much less important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref015">15</xref>]. Lipidation of Lpps is known to be crucial for virulence in murine <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> systemic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref016">16</xref>]. Depending on the degree of acylation in the lipid moiety of the Lpps, different TLR2 receptor combinations are activated: triacylated Lpps are agonists of TLR2/TLR1 heterodimers, while diacylated Lpps are agonists of TLR2/TLR6 heterodimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref018">18</xref>]. Staphylococcal species differ in the length of the fatty acid in the N-acyl group of the lipid moiety, which has drastic effects on innate and adaptive immune stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, we hypothesized that staphylococcal Lpps are the main inducer of synovitis and joint destruction in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>-induced septic arthritis. Indeed, a single intra-articular injection of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> Lpps induced macroscopic, chronic and destructive arthritis, which was mediated by monocytes/macrophages. However, the <italic>Δlgt</italic> strain, an Lpp diacylglyceryl transferase (<italic>lgt</italic>) deletion mutant, caused more severe joint inflammation than its parental strain. This increased severity in joint inflammation was due to the better survival of the <italic>Δlgt</italic> strain, suggesting that a lack of Lpps induces immune evasion. Importantly, coinjection of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> with staphylococcal Lpps in mouse knee joints resulted in radical elimination of bacteria and diminished bone erosion. This protective effect was mediated by the lipid moiety of the Lpps and was fully dependent on TLR2 and the recruitment of neutrophils.</p>

<title>Staphylococcal lipoproteins induce macroscopic, chronic and destructive arthritis</title>
<p>We injected the purified staphylococcal Lpp Lpl1 intra-articularly (i.a.) into mouse knee joints. Lpl1 is a model Lpp derived from the νSaα-specific lipoprotein-like cluster (<italic>lpl</italic>) that exists in highly pathogenic and epidemic <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref020">20</xref>]. One single injection of Lpl1 at a dose of 10 μg/knee caused macroscopic joint inflammation after 24 hours, and the inflammation lasted for at least 21 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). The arthritogenic effect of Lpl1 was dose-dependent—even a 100-fold lower dose (0.1 μg/knee) induced synovitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). Importantly, severe bone erosions were observed on day 7, and all Lpl1-injected joints had erosions on day 10, as verified by microcomputed tomography (μCT) scans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g001">Fig 1E–1G</xref>). Histologically, the highly inflamed synovium, pannus formation, and severe bone destruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g001">Fig 1H</xref>) exhibited characteristics of the typical histopathological picture of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> septic arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref021">21</xref>]. The minimal bone destruction-inducing dose of Lpl1 was much higher (10 μg/knee) than the inflammation-inducing dose (0.1 μg/knee). To further understand whether the lipid- or protein-moiety of Lpl1 was responsible for the arthritogenic effect, Lpp lacking the lipid moiety Lpl1(-sp) was compared to the intact Lpp, Lpl1(+sp). Lpl1(-sp) completely lacked the capacity to induce arthritis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g001">Fig 1I</xref>), suggesting that the lipid moiety of staphylococcal Lpps is fully responsible for their arthritogenic properties. Indeed, <italic>in vitro</italic> splenocyte proliferation was induced by both Lpl1(+sp) and Pam3CSK4 (a synthetic lipopeptide mimicking the N-terminal lipid portion of Lpps) but not by Lpl1(-sp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g001">Fig 1K</xref>). To compare the arthritogenic capacity of Lpps with other <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> components, we injected mice i.a. with the staphylococcal superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) and with the peptidoglycan (PGN) purified from a mutant strain lacking Lpp diacylglyceryl transferase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref015">15</xref>]. Only very mild and transient knee joint swelling was observed on day 1, and the swelling disappeared by day 3 in the knee joints injected with 10 μg of PGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g001">Fig 1J</xref>). Interestingly, heat-treated Lpl1 and Pam3CSK4 preserved their arthritogenic capacity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007877.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), strongly suggesting that the Lpl1 is heat-insensitive.</p>

<title>Neutrophils and monocytes are rapidly recruited to the joints after intra-articular injection of lipoproteins</title>
<p>To understand the cellular mechanism behind Lpp-induced arthritis, we further analyzed the immune cells present in the local synovium using flow cytometry one day after Lpl1 injection. Synovial tissues from Lpl1-injected knee joints of wild-type mice demonstrated higher numbers and frequencies of CD11b+F4/80+ cells (monocytes/macrophages) and CD11b+Gr1+F4/80- cells (neutrophils) than those of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-injected knee joints. Significantly decreased numbers of infiltrating monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils were observed in TLR2-deficient (TLR2<sup>-/-</sup>) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref>). No difference with regard to B- and T-cells was observed. These results suggest that TLR2 is highly important for neutrophil and monocyte recruitment into synovial tissue following Lpl1 injection.</p>

<title>Staphylococcal lipoprotein-induced arthritis is mediated by monocytes/macrophages through TLR2</title>
<p>Next, to elucidate which immune cells were responsible for the onset of arthritis, mice depleted of monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils or T-cells were i.a. injected with 0.33 μg Lpl1, and the severity of the histopathological synovitis was examined on day 3. The depletion of synovial macrophages and infiltrating monocytes by clodronate liposomes significantly reduced the severity of the synovitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), whereas neutrophil depletion by Ly6G antibodies had no effect on synovitis severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). To investigate the role of T-cells, mice were simultaneously depleted of CD4 and CD8 T-cells by intraperitoneal injection of anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies. No notable difference regarding the severity of synovitis was observed between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Additionally, CTLA-Ig treatment (abatacept) that blocks T-cell activation had no effect on synovitis development, suggesting that T-cells were not essential for acute Lpp-induced joint inflammation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g003">Fig 3D</xref> represents a typical picture of the knee joint from mice depleted of monocytes/macrophages showing the absence of leukocyte infiltration.</p>

<p>To examine which cells were responsible for causing bone erosion, a higher dose of Lpl1 (10 μg/knee) was i.a. injected. In line with the data described above, depletion of macrophages significantly attenuated macroscopic inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g003">Fig 3E</xref>) and more strikingly, completely protected the joints from bone damage caused by Lpl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g003">Fig 3F and 3H</xref>). No difference was found regarding bone erosions between the controls and neutrophil-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g003">Fig 3G and 3H</xref>).</p>
<p>TNF-α and IL-1, released by monocytes/macrophages, are known to play a crucial role in septic arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref022">22</xref>]. To study the role of these cytokines in Lpl1-induced synovitis, both anti-TNF treatment (etanercept) and anti-IL1 treatment (anakinra) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref011">11</xref>] were used. Anti-TNF, but not anti-IL1, treatment significantly reduced the synovitis severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g003">Fig 3I</xref>) compared to the severity in the PBS-treated controls, indicating that Lpl1-induced arthritis is partially mediated by TNF-α.</p>
<p>Finally, to study whether joint destruction caused by Lpp, a major ligand for TLR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref024">24</xref>], is mediated through this receptor, TLR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice were i.a. injected with Lpl1. The TLR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice barely developed clinical signs of arthritis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g003">Fig 3J</xref>), and no joint destruction was observed compared to that of the wild-type mice, of which 100% presented joint erosions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g003">Fig 3K</xref>).</p>

<p>To understand the role of Lpps in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> septic arthritis, both heat-killed and live <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> SA113 strains, as well as a deletion mutant of the SA113 strain lacking <italic>lgt</italic>, were inoculated into the mouse knee joints.

<p>To test the above hypothesis, live <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> SA113<italic>Δlgt</italic> mutants mixed with various concentrations of Lpl1(+sp), Lpl1(-sp), or PBS were i.a. injected into mouse knee joints. Strikingly, the bacterial load in the knee joints was dose-dependently reduced when SA113<italic>Δlgt</italic> mutant was simultaneously administered with Lpl1(+sp). For the Lpp dose of 6.5 μg/knee, only 1 out of 5 knee joints was positive for bacterial culture with very low bacterial counts (10<sup>1</sup> colony forming units (CFUs)/knee), whereas in the PBS controls, all knee joints had high CFU counts (10<sup>5</sup> CFU/knee) on day 3 postinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g004">Fig 4F</xref>).

<title>The association between arthritis severity, bacterial load, and release of neutrophil attracting chemokines at the early course of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> septic arthritis</title>
<p>To provide the evidence to support our hypothesis that SA113<italic>Δlgt</italic> mutant arouses immune responses to a lesser extent than its parental strain, we i.a inoculated both bacterial strains into mouse knee joints and compared the knee sizes, CFU counts in joints, and the levels of neutrophil attracting chemokines (KC and MIP-2) on day 1 postinfection. The joints inoculated with SA113 strain were significantly more swollen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) and tended to have lower bacterial counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) compared to SA113<italic>Δlgt</italic> injected knees.

<title>The enhanced bacterial killing effect triggered by lipoproteins is mediated by neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages through TLR2</title>

<p>Next, we studied the importance of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils in the knee joints after Lpl1 injection. The knee joints of monocyte/macrophage-depleted mice injected with a mixture of Lpl1 and SA113<italic>Δlgt</italic> mutant exhibited significantly higher bacterial counts than the knee joints of the non-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). However, macrophage depletion failed to fully abolish the effect of Lpps on bacterial elimination, suggesting that other cell types also contributed to the effect. Importantly, the protective effect of the Lpps completely disappeared in the neutrophil-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), suggesting that Lpl1 elicits neutrophils to kill bacteria. We further studied whether Lpps boost the phagocytic capacities of phagocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>. Mouse peritoneal macrophages stimulated with Lpl1 were incubated with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. The <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> internalization rates in macrophages were analyzed by flow cytometry imaging.

However, no notable differences were observed between the Lpl1-stimulated and non-stimulated groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007877.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, the whole blood killing assay was thereafter performed to verify whether SA113<italic>Δlgt</italic> mutant survived better in whole blood than its parental strain.

<p>As Lpps induced TNF-α release by macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007877.s006">S6 Fig</xref>) and anti-TNF treatment attenuated the severity of Lpp-induced arthritis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007877.g003">Fig 3I</xref>), we posed the question of whether the bacterial eliminating effect of Lpp was TNF-dependent.

<title>Quick release of neutrophil chemoattractants by macrophages is responsible for the lipoprotein-induced protective effect</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate the dual role of staphylococcal Lpp in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>-induced septic arthritis. On the one hand, Lpps induce inflammatory reactions and joint destruction mediated by monocytes/macrophages. On the other hand, Lpps cause the quick release of chemokines and consequent neutrophil recruitment, resulting in efficient bacterial killing. Importantly, both the lipid moiety of Lpps and TLR2 were identified as the molecular structures responsible for this outcome.</p>
<p>Postinfectious complications in septic arthritis, such as joint deformation and deleterious contractures, remain a major medical challenge. Exaggerated immune responses have been proposed as the cause of such complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref012">12</xref>]. There are many bacterial components of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> that possess the capacity to induce joint inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref028">28</xref>]. However, it is still unclear which component is most important in real-life infections. To address this uncertainty, not only the capacity of immune stimulation but also the quantity of components expressed in a single bacterium should be taken into consideration. A single intra-articular injection of Lpp (10 μg/knee) induced chronic macroscopic arthritis lasting for at least 3 weeks as well as severe joint destruction verified by both histopathological and radiological examinations, demonstrating that Lpp is an arthritogenic molecule. Lpps were highly potent since they exerted a strong immunostimulatory effect even at the nanogram level <italic>in vivo</italic>. More importantly, the mice injected with the SA113<italic>Δlgt</italic> mutant strain lacking lipidation displayed less severe joint swelling than the mice injected with the SA113 parental strain at the early time points before the bacterial proliferation of <italic>Δlgt</italic> mutants exceeded that of the parental strains. This finding strongly suggests that Lpps are one of the major arthritogenic bacterial components. However, we have to keep in mind that the <italic>Δlgt</italic> strain that lacks lipidation maintained the capacity to induce joint inflammation, indicating that Lpps are not the only molecule in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> that cause joint inflammation. Although intra-articular injection of PGN (10 μg/knee) induced only transient and milder joint swelling, the importance of PGN in arthritis induction cannot be ruled out since PGN is the most abundant molecule in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic>. The synergistic effect of PGN and lipopeptides in immune activation has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>Our data compellingly demonstrate that both neutrophils and monocytes rapidly migrated into the joints injected with Lpps, and monocytes/macrophages were fully responsible for joint destruction in Lpp-induced arthritis. Focal bone destruction in autoimmune arthritis is due to excessive bone resorption resulting from osteoclast activation that is mediated by local expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANKL) that is higher than that of its decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref030">30</xref>]. Osteoclasts not only exist inside of the bone but also can be derived from mature monocytes and macrophages when a suitable microenvironment is provided by bone marrow-derived stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref031">31</xref>], which might be the case in this study. In fact, monocytes/macrophages were shown to mediate bone erosion in arthritis induced by other <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> components, such as bacterial DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref027">27</xref>] and peptidoglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref028">28</xref>], as well as antibiotic-killed <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref012">12</xref>], suggesting that monocytes/macrophages might be the most important immune cells that determine the progression of septic arthritis. Indeed, mice depleted of monocytes developed less severe septic arthritis and joint lesions despite decreased bacterial clearance and higher mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Macrophages are a major source of many cytokines involved in the immune response. In autoimmune arthritic diseases, proinflammatory cytokines play an important pathogenetic role. In particular, TNF release by macrophages, fibroblasts and T-cells in inflamed synovial tissue leads to joint swelling and subsequent joint destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref033">33</xref>]. Furthermore, a previous study showed that the blockade of TNF, but not IL-1, resulted in a reduction of bone erosions in a murine TNF-driven arthritis model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref034">34</xref>]. Previously, we have shown that antibiotic-killed <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> induces arthritis through the TNF receptor. In the present study, TNF also played an important role in Lpp-induced arthritis since a) Lpps induced TNF release in both macrophages and splenocytes and b) TNF inhibition, but not IL-1 inhibition, significantly reduced synovitis severity.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the live <italic>Δlgt</italic> strain gave rise to significantly more severe joint inflammation, although the heat-killed <italic>Δlgt</italic> strain caused less synovitis. This result is due to the fact that the <italic>Δlgt</italic> strain is more tolerant to host immune-mediated bacterial killing than the parental strain, as the bacterial load of the SA113 parental strain in the knee joints was significantly lower than that of the <italic>Δlgt</italic> strain. This finding is in line with the previous report that revealed that a lack of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> Lpps causes bacterial immune evasion and lethal infections with disseminated abscess formation in mice with systemic <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref035">35</xref>]. The importance of the lipid moiety in bacterial elimination was further confirmed by our experiments when Lpps were coinjected with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> into mouse knee joints. This situation is a perfect example of the dual sides of host responsiveness to bacterial infections—on one hand, the host response protects the host against bacteria, but on the other hand, the response sometimes increases the infection severity when danger signals trigger exaggerated host responses.</p>
<p>How is the bacterial killing effect mediated by Lpps? Lpps themselves had no direct effect on bacterial proliferation. Rather, the enhanced local immune response triggered by Lpps was responsible for the bacterial killing effect. Macrophages, neutrophils and natural killer (NK) cells are the most important immune cell types in innate immunity. NK cells can be activated and exert their biological functions upon stimulation by synthetic lipopeptides with sequences from Lpps of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref036">36</xref>]. Macrophages seem to play a partial role, as the indirect bacterial killing effect was diminished in mice depleted of macrophages/monocytes. This finding suggests that Lpps have the capacity to trigger the activation of macrophages to better control and eliminate bacteria. Macrophages are phagocytes that play an important role in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> septic arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref032">32</xref>]. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> Lpps are the major inducers of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitric oxide (NO) production in mouse macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref025">25</xref>]. The production of nitric oxide is important in controlling bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref037">37</xref>]. However, treatment with an iNOS inhibitor had no effect on the bacterial eradication induced by Lpps, suggesting that NO production is not critical for Lpp-induced bacterial killing. Notably, no complete abrogating effect was observed as a result of macrophage depletion, which indicates the involvement of other immune cells. Neutrophils were the most predominant cell type that infiltrated the local joints upon Lpp stimulation. Additionally, the total abrogation of the bacterial killing effect by Lpps in neutrophil-depleted mice strongly suggests that neutrophils are fully responsible for the protective effect of Lpps. In healthy joints, there are a very limited number of neutrophils. For the neutrophils to reach the joint cavity and exert their biological function, neutrophil chemoattractants are needed. KC and MIP-2 are known major chemokines responsible for recruiting neutrophils, and both bind to CXCR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref038">38</xref>]. Resident tissue macrophages have been shown to be the major source of neutrophil chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref039">39</xref>]. In the current study, macrophages, but not T- or B-cells, quickly released large amounts of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines upon Lpp stimulation, and such chemokine release was fully controlled by lipid moiety-TLR2 signaling. Indeed, a positive feedback loop may exist in Lpp-injected knee joints, as monocytes are recruited to the local joints where they probably respond to Lpp stimulation with chemokine release that leads to an additional influx of monocytes and neutrophils to the local inflammation site. Actually, the bacterial killing effect of phagocytes might also be increased by Lpps, as Lpps can directly activate neutrophils by upregulating CD11b/CD18 and enhancing the production of reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>In recent years, immune therapy targeting negative regulators of immune activation (immune checkpoints) has been an exciting research area in drug development, with promising results achieved in patients with a variety of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref041">41</xref>]. Similarly, in infectious diseases, the activation of the immune system to eliminate invading bacteria has always been an ultimate goal to overcome the challenges caused by the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The development of a vaccine that prevents <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infections is of interest. However, thus far, all attempts to develop active or passive immunization against <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> have failed, which might be due to the lack of a well-defined, single virulence factor in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref042">42</xref>]. Purified Lpp acted in a protective fashion by means of less radiological bone destruction after treatment with a mixture containing a known pathogenic staphylococcal strain, i.e., LS-1. Our results suggest that Lpps/lipid moieties might be used as a potential candidate for immune therapy to combat local <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infections, e.g., septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. In this case, the dose of Lpps should be carefully controlled to keep the local tissue damage and efficient bacterial killing effect in balance. In addition, a similar protective immune response might also be induced by staphylococcal Lpps to eradicate other invading pathogens, such as gram-negative bacteria or even antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</p>
<p>In conclusion, intra-articular injection of staphylococcal Lpps induced chronic joint inflammation and bone erosion. The observed effect was mediated by macrophages via TLR2 signaling and partially involved TNF. Surprisingly, purified <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> Lpps strengthened the immune response, consequently reducing bacterial burden and attenuating bone destruction in septic arthritis. Our findings may pave the way for the development of a novel strategy to address the challenge of antibiotic resistance.</p>

<title>Expression and purification of Lpl1(+sp) and Lpl1(–sp)</title>
<p>The preparation and purification of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> lipoproteins Lpl1(+sp) and Lpl1(-sp) were performed by Dr. Nguyen (Microbial Genetics, University of Tübingen, Germany), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1007877.ref020">20</xref>]. Lpl1(+sp) was isolated from the membrane fraction of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> SA113 (pTX30::<italic>lpl</italic>1-his), whereas Lpl(-sp) was isolated from the cytoplasmic fraction of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> SA113<italic>Δlgt</italic> (pTX30::<italic>lpl</italic>1(-sp)-his). Both of these Lpl1-his proteins were purified via Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. For the enhancement of protein expression, the clones were first cultivated aerobically at 37°C in the absence of xylose (BO-medium) until OD578 nm ≈ 0.5 was reached and were thereafter continuously cultivated for 4 hours in the presence of 0.5% xylose to induce Lpl1 expression. The bacterial cells were harvested and washed twice with Tris buffer (20 mM Tris, 100 mM HCl, pH 8.0). Then, the pellet was resuspended in Tris buffer containing a protease inhibitor tablet (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and lysostaphin (30 μg/ml) and was incubated at 37°C for 2 hours to disrupt the cell wall. After the first ultracentrifugation (235,000 x g for 45 min at 4°C), the supernatant containing the cytoplasmic proteins was collected for the next purification step. For membrane fraction isolation, the pellet was subsequently dissolved overnight at 6°C with Tris buffer containing 2% Triton-X100. After the second ultracentrifugation step, the supernatant containing membrane fragments was collected. The purification step was carried with Ni-NTA Superflow beads (Qiagen, Germany). The Ni-NTA beads capturing Lpl1 proteins were washed four times with the first washing buffer (Tris buffer containing 0.25% Triton X-100 and 20 mM imidazole), followed by washing 2 times with the second washing buffer (Tris buffer containing 0.25% Triton X-100 and 40 mM imidazole). Finally, Lpl1 was eluted with Tris buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. The Lpl1 were concentrated via a centrifugal ultrafilter unit with a molecular mass cut-off of 10 kDa (Sartorius AG, Göttingen, Germany). The concentrated samples of Lpl1 were dialyzed overnight at 6°C with Dulbecco’s PBS (DPBS) buffer (Life Technologies, Darmstadt) by a MWCO 6–8 kDa tube dialyzer (Merck, Darmstadt) and were subsequently lyophilized overnight. A total of 2 μg of lyophilized samples were dissolved in water and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to determine the purity and quantity of purified protein samples.

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> splenocyte and peritoneal macrophage stimulation</title>
<p>Splenocytes from healthy NMRI mice and peritoneal macrophages from C57Bl/6 and TLR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice were prepared under sterile conditions. To prepare the splenocyte culture, mouse spleens were aseptically removed and passed through a nylon mesh.</p>
<p>To collect the peritoneal macrophages, peritoneal lavage was performed using 10 mL of ice cold PBS. Erythrocytes were depleted in both cultures by lysis in 0.83% ammonium chloride, and the remaining cells were washed in PBS. The single-cell suspensions were then adjusted in Iscove’s complete medium (10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5x10<sup>-5</sup> M mercaptoethanol and 50 μg/mL gentamicin) to a density of 1.5x10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL for splenocytes and 5x10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL for macrophages.</p>
<p>For the proliferation assay, the splenocytes were stimulated with purified Lpl1(+sp) or Lpl1(-sp) (20–200 ng/mL), Pam2CSK4 or Pam3CSK4 (40 ng/mL), and TSST-1 (100 ng/mL) or Iscove's medium (negative control). A total of 1 μl of Ci [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine (Amersham, Bucks, UK) was added for incorporation 12 hours before the cells were harvested, and the proliferative response was read with a micro-β counter.
